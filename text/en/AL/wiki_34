<text>Terry Paxton Bradshaw (born September 2, 1948) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Since 1994, he has been a television sports analyst and co-host of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;. Bradshaw is also an actor and recording artist, having participated in several television shows (mainly as himself) and films, most notably co-starring in the movie &quot;Failure to Launch&quot;, and releasing several country music albums. He won four Super Bowl titles in a six-year period (1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989, his first year of eligibility. Bradshaw was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

Bradshaw was known for being a tough competitor and having one of the most powerful arms in NFL history. His physical skills and on-the-field leadership played a major role in the Steelers&#x27; dynasty throughout the 1970s. During his career, he passed for more than 300 yards in a game seven times, but three of those performances came in the postseason (two of which were in Super Bowls). In four career Super Bowl appearances, he passed for 932 yards and nine touchdowns, both Super Bowl records at the time of his retirement. In 19 career postseason games, he completed 261 passes for 3,833 yards.

==Early life==
Bradshaw was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1948. His father, William Marvin &quot;Bill&quot; Bradshaw (1927–2014), a native of Sparta, Tennessee, was a veteran of the United States Navy, a former vice president of manufacturing of the Riley Beaird Company in Shreveport, and a Southern Baptist layman. His mother, Novis (née Gay; 1929–2023), was one of five children of Clifford and Lula Gay of Red River Parish, Louisiana. He has an older brother, Gary, and a younger brother, Craig.

In his early childhood, the family lived in Camanche, Iowa, where he set forth the goal to play professional football. When he was a teenager, Bradshaw returned with his family to Shreveport. There, he attended Woodlawn High School, played under assistant coach A. L. Williams, and led the Knights to the AAA state championship game in 1965, but lost 12–9 to the Sulphur Golden Tornadoes. While at Woodlawn, he set a national record for throwing the javelin at ; his exploits earned him a spot in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; feature &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot;. Bradshaw&#x27;s successor as Woodlawn&#x27;s starting quarterback was another future NFL standout, Joe Ferguson of the Buffalo Bills. Bradshaw&#x27;s Steelers defeated Ferguson&#x27;s Bills in a 1974 divisional playoff game.

==College career==

Bradshaw decided to attend Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, recruited in part by future Hall of Fame coach Jimmy Johnson. He has much affinity for his alma mater, and is a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Initially, he was second on the depth chart at quarterback behind Phil &quot;Roxie&quot; Robertson, who later became famous as the inventor of the Duck Commander duck call and television personality on the A&amp;E program &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;.

When he arrived at Tech in 1966, Bradshaw caused a media frenzy because of his reputation as a football sensation from nearby Shreveport. Robertson was a year ahead of Bradshaw, and was the starter for two seasons in 1966 and 1967, and chose not to play in 1968. As Robertson put it: &quot;I&#x27;m going for the ducks, you [Terry] can go for the bucks.&quot;

In 1969, Bradshaw was considered by most professional scouts to be the most outstanding college football player in the nation. As a junior during the 1968 season, he amassed 2,890 total yards, ranking number one in the NCAA, and led his team to a 9–2 record and a 33–13 win over Akron in the Rice Bowl. In his senior season, he gained 2,314 yards, ranking third in the NCAA, and led his team to an 8–2 record. His decrease in production was mainly because his team played only 10 games that year, and he was taken out of several games in the second half because his team had built up huge leads.

Bradshaw graduated owning virtually all Louisiana Tech passing records at the time. In 1970, Bradshaw received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1984, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Louisiana Tech sports hall of fame. Four years later, he was inducted into the state of Louisiana&#x27;s sports hall of fame.

===College statistics===
==NFL career==

===Pittsburgh Steelers===

In the 1970 NFL draft, Bradshaw was selected as the first overall pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers, who got the first pick in the draft after winning a coin flip tiebreaker with the Chicago Bears since the teams had identical 1–13 records in 1969. Bradshaw was hailed at the time as the consensus number-one pick.

Bradshaw became a starter in his second season after splitting time with Terry Hanratty in his rookie campaign. During his first few seasons, the 6&#x27;3&quot;, 215-pound quarterback was erratic and threw many interceptions (he threw 210 interceptions over the course of his career), and was mocked by the media for his rural roots and perceived lack of intelligence.

Bradshaw took several seasons to adjust to the NFL, but he eventually led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships and four Super Bowl titles. The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense and a powerful running attack led by Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier, but Bradshaw&#x27;s strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In 1972, he threw the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; pass to Franco Harris, among the most famous plays in NFL history, to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs.

Bradshaw temporarily lost the starting job to Joe Gilliam in 1974, but he took over again during the regular season. In the 1974 AFC Championship Game against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Lynn Swann proved to be the winning score in a 24–13 victory. In the Steelers&#x27; 16–6 Super Bowl IX victory over the Minnesota Vikings that followed, Bradshaw completed 9 of 14 passes and his fourth-quarter touchdown pass put the game out of reach and helped take the Steelers to their first Super Bowl victory.

In Super Bowl X following the 1975 season, Bradshaw threw for 209 yards, most of them to Swann, as the Steelers beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21–17. His late-fourth-quarter, 64-yard touchdown pass to Swann, released a split-second before defensive tackle Larry Cole flattened him, was selected by NFL Films as the &quot;Greatest Throw of All Time&quot;.

Neck and wrist injuries in 1976 forced Bradshaw to miss four games. He was sharp in a 40–14 victory over the Baltimore Colts, completing 14 of 18 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns and achieving the highest-possible passer rating of 158.3. As of 2022, it is the only playoff game where the visiting quarterback achieved this effort. With this outstanding game, he was not only instrumental in Pittsburgh&#x27;s blowout win but also potentially—and inadvertently—helped save the lives of scores of people from the impact of a plane crash which took place soon after the game ended as result of the butterfly effect. This is because the Colts were beaten so badly that their fans left much earlier than they would have, with their supporter zone being completely vacated by time of the impact. There were no serious injuries, and the pilot was arrested for violating air safety regulations. Donald Kroner was the 33-year-old pilot charged with reckless flying, littering, and making a bomb threat against former Baltimore Colts linebacker Bill Pellington. Pellington owned a bar and restaurant from which Kroner was once ejected for using foul language. The crash is the subject of the 2022 documentary &quot;Section 1&quot; by Secret Base&#x27;s Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein.

However, the Steelers&#x27; hopes of a three-peat ended when both of their 1,000-yard rushers (Harris and Bleier) were injured in the win over the Colts, and the Steelers subsequently lost to the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship game, 24–7. Jack Lambert asserted that the 1976 Steelers team was the best team that he ever played on, including the four Super Bowl teams of which he was a part.

Bradshaw had his best season in 1978 when he was named the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) by the Associated Press after a season in which he completed 207 of 368 passes for 2,915 yards and a league-leading 28 touchdown passes. He was also named All-Pro and All-AFC that year, despite throwing 20 interceptions.

Before Super Bowl XIII, a Steelers-Cowboys rematch, Cowboys linebacker Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson famously ridiculed Bradshaw by saying, &quot;He couldn&#x27;t spell &#x27;cat&#x27; if you spotted him the &#x27;c&#x27; and the &#x27;a&#x27;.&quot; Bradshaw got his revenge by winning the Super Bowl MVP award, completing 17 of 30 passes for a then-record 318 yards and four touchdowns in a 35–31 win. Bradshaw has in later years made light of the ridicule with quips such as &quot;it&#x27;s football, not rocket science.&quot;

Bradshaw won his second straight Super Bowl MVP award in 1979 in Super Bowl XIV. He passed for 309 yards and two touchdowns in a 31–19 win over the Los Angeles Rams. Early in the fourth quarter, with Pittsburgh down 19–17, Bradshaw again turned to the long pass to help engineer a victory: a 73-yard touchdown to John Stallworth. Bradshaw shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year award that season with fellow Pittsburgh star Willie Stargell, whose Pirates won the 1979 World Series.
After two seasons of missing the playoffs, Bradshaw played through pain—he needed a cortisone shot before every game because of an elbow injury sustained during training camp—in a strike-shortened 1982 NFL season. He still managed to tie for the most touchdown passes in the league with 17. In a 31–28 Wild Card Round loss to the San Diego Chargers, Bradshaw&#x27;s last postseason game, he completed 28 of 39 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.

After undergoing off-season elbow surgery (using the alias &quot;Thomas Brady&quot;, with the actual Brady being six years old at the time), Bradshaw was idle for the first 14 games of the 1983 NFL season. Then on December 10, 1983, against the New York Jets, he felt a pop in his elbow while throwing his final pass, a 10-yard touchdown to Calvin Sweeney in the second quarter of the Steelers&#x27; 34–7 win. Bradshaw later left the game and never played again. The two touchdowns Bradshaw threw in what was the final NFL game played at Shea Stadium (and the last NFL game played in New York City proper to date) allowed him to finish his career with two more touchdowns (212) than interceptions (210).

Bradshaw&#x27;s retirement came as a surprise to some, and in hindsight unplanned on the Steelers&#x27; part. Before Bradshaw&#x27;s elbow problems came about, the team chose to pass on Pitt quarterback Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL draft as an heir successor to Bradshaw due in part to head coach Chuck Noll wanting to rebuild on defense, and according to Bill Hillgrove, the Rooney family not wanting Marino to face a lot of pressure in his hometown and needing to experience life outside of Oakland, where Marino grew up and Pitt is located. The player the Steelers drafted instead (Gabriel Rivera) played only six games before becoming a quadriplegic following a drunk-driving crash, and Marino&#x27;s subsequent success with the Miami Dolphins prompted Art Rooney to remind his sons daily until his death that the team &quot;should&#x27;ve drafted Marino.&quot; The decision also set the franchise back at quarterback; while the team eventually returned to being a Super Bowl contender after their rebuilding period during the mid-1980s, they did not have a consistent quarterback until Ben Roethlisberger arrived in 2004.

Although the Steelers have not officially retired Bradshaw&#x27;s number 12, they have not reissued it since his retirement.

==After football==

Bradshaw was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.

In July 1997, Bradshaw served as the presenter when Mike Webster, his center on the Steelers&#x27; Super Bowl XIII and XIV title teams, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2006, despite the Steelers being one of the teams playing in the game, Bradshaw did not attend a pregame celebration for past Super Bowl MVPs during Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. According to reports, Bradshaw (along with three-time MVP and close friend Joe Montana) requested a US$100,000 guarantee for his appearance in the Super Bowl MVP Parade, and associated appearances. The NFL could not guarantee that they would make that much, so refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; (February 6, 2006), Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (ABC broadcast Super Bowl XL, which is that network&#x27;s last such game to date), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.

In April 2006, Bradshaw donated his four Super Bowl rings, College Football Hall of Fame ring, Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, Hall of Fame bust, four miniature replica Super Bowl trophies, a helmet, and jersey from one of his Super Bowl victories to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech.

On November 5, 2007, during a nationally televised &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game, Bradshaw joined former teammates including Franco Harris and Joe Greene to accept their position on the Steelers&#x27; 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.

===Broadcasting career===

Bradshaw retired from football on July 24, 1984, and quickly signed a television contract with CBS to become an NFL game analyst in 1984, where he and play-by-play announcer Verne Lundquist had the top-rated programs. Prior to his full-time work for them, he served as a guest commentator for CBS Sports&#x27; NFC postseason broadcasts from 1980–82.

Bradshaw was promoted into television studio analyst for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; in 1990 (which he hosted with Greg Gumbel through the 1993 season). In 1994, with the Fox network establishing its sports division with their purchase of NFL TV rights, Bradshaw joined &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, where he normally acts as a comic foil to his co-hosts. On &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, he hosts two semiregular features, &quot;Ten Yards with TB&quot;, where he fires random questions at an NFL professional, and &quot;The Terry Awards&quot;, an annual comedic award show about the NFL season. As a cross-promotional stunt, he also hosted two consecutive &quot;Digi-Bowl&quot; specials in 2001 and 2002 on Fox Kids, providing commentary from the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; studio in-between episodes of &quot;&quot;; the 2002 special was the final one as the Fox Kids block ended the same year. He appeared on the first broadcast of &quot;NASCAR on FOX&quot;, where he took a ride with Dale Earnhardt at Daytona International Speedway the night before Earnhardt was killed in a last-lap crash in the Daytona 500. Bradshaw also waved the green flag at the start of the ill-fated race.

Bradshaw has the reputation of being the &quot;ol&#x27; redneck&quot;, but in co-host and former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson&#x27;s words, the act is a &quot;schtick&quot;. According to Johnson, Bradshaw deflects such criticism by stating that &quot;he&#x27;s so dumb that he has to have somebody else fly his private plane.&quot;

Bradshaw has also garnered the reputation for criticizing players and teams. Following Super Bowl XLVI he was confronted by Ann Mara, wife of the late Wellington Mara, and &quot;heckled&quot; for not picking the Giants to win on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;.

For his work in broadcasting, Bradshaw has won three Sports Emmy Awards as a studio analyst.

===Business career===

During the early part of his career with the Steelers, Bradshaw was a used-car salesman during the off season to supplement his income, as this was still during the days when most NFL players did not make enough money to focus solely on football.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bradshaw sold peanut butter with his name and image on the label. Commercials were run on television in the Shreveport market.

Bradshaw has also written or co-written five books and recorded six albums of country/western and gospel music. His cover of &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; hit the top 20 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; country chart (and number 91 on the Hot 100) in 1976; two other tunes (&quot;The Last Word In Lonesome Is Me&quot; and &quot;Until You&quot;) also made the country charts.

In 2001, Bradshaw entered the world of NASCAR by joining with HighLine Performance Group racing team to form FitzBradshaw Racing. He also is the spokesman for Jani-King international, Inc. Bradshaw ended his ownership in 2006.

Among U.S. consumers, Bradshaw remains one of pro football&#x27;s most popular retired players. As of September 2007, Bradshaw was the top-ranked former pro football player in the Davie-Brown Index, which surveys consumers to determine a celebrity&#x27;s appeal and trust levels.

In early 2020, Bradshaw launched Terry Bradshaw Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, a collaboration with Silver Screen Bottling Company. The bourbon boasts 51.9 percent ABV (103.8 proof) which is Bradshaw&#x27;s passing percentage. The bourbon is produced by Green River Distilling Company in Owensboro, Kentucky.

==Personal life==
Bradshaw has been married four times. He was first married to Melissa Babish (Miss Teenage America, 1969) from 1972 to 1973; ice skater JoJo Starbuck from 1976 to 1983; and family attorney Charla Hopkins from 1983 to 1999, with whom he had two daughters, Erin and Rachel. Erin Bradshaw shows champion Paint and American Quarter Horses and is an honors graduate of the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. Rachel Bradshaw is a graduate of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and appeared in &quot;Nashville&quot; (2007), a reality television series about young musicians trying to make it in Nashville, and is the widow of former Tennessee Titans kicker Rob Bironas. The first three of Bradshaw&#x27;s marriages have all ended in divorce, a subject he jokes about frequently on his NFL pregame show. Bradshaw was married for the fourth time, on July 8, 2014, to Tammy, his girlfriend of 15 years.
After his NFL career ended, Bradshaw disclosed that he had frequently experienced anxiety attacks after games. The problem worsened in the late 1990s after his third divorce, when he said he &quot;could not bounce back&quot; as he had after the previous divorces or after a bad game. In addition to anxiety attacks, his symptoms included weight loss, frequent crying, and sleeplessness. He was diagnosed with clinical depression. Since then, he has taken Paxil regularly. He chose to speak out about his depression to overcome the stigma associated with it and to urge others to seek help.

Bradshaw&#x27;s anxieties about appearing in public, away from the controlled environment of a television studio, led to an unintentional estrangement from the Steelers. When team founder and owner Art Rooney died in 1988, Bradshaw did not attend his funeral. A year later, during his Hall of Fame induction speech, Bradshaw made a point of saluting his late boss and friend, pointing to the sky and saying, &quot;Art Rooney ... boy, I tell you, I loved that man.&quot;

Still, Bradshaw never returned to Three Rivers Stadium for a Steelers game. When the last regular-season game was played there on December 16, 2000, against the Washington Redskins, Bradshaw was with the &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; crew, doing their pregame show aboard the aircraft carrier , while Fox covered the game live. Bradshaw expressed regret that he could not be there, but later said privately that he did not feel he could face the crowds. Not until September 2002, when fellow Hall of Fame teammate and longtime friend Mike Webster died, did Bradshaw finally return to Pittsburgh to attend his friend&#x27;s funeral.

In October 2002, Bradshaw returned to the Steelers sideline for the first time in 20 years for a Monday night game between the Steelers and the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, when the Steelers played the 1,000th game in franchise history, Fox covered the game at Heinz Field, and Bradshaw returned to cover the game. In addition to appearing to take his position on the Steelers All-Time Team in 2007 as part of the team&#x27;s 75th-anniversary festivities, he also was on the sideline alongside a number of his teammates such as Mean Joe Greene and Franco Harris for the game against the Baltimore Ravens on November 5. Despite those appearances, Bradshaw&#x27;s appearances at Steelers functions have remained relatively rare compared to his Hall of Fame teammates from his playing days.
Politically, Bradshaw is a long-time supporter of the Republican Party. In 2012, he went on record on &quot;Fox News&quot; as supporting the candidacy of Newt Gingrich for the Republican presidential nomination. In the same interview, he also labeled linebacker Terrell Suggs &quot;an idiot&quot; for making comments critical of Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow&#x27;s public remarks about his Christian faith, saying Suggs &quot;better be careful; if I were him I&#x27;d be on my hands and knees tonight asking for forgiveness because that&#x27;s totally unacceptable.&quot;

Bradshaw has made statements critical of former President of the United States Donald Trump. During a 2017 episode of &quot;FOX NFL Sunday&quot;, Bradshaw, while not condoning NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, stated, &quot;if our country stands for anything, folks, it&#x27;s freedom. People died for that freedom. I&#x27;m not sure if our President understands those rights. That every American has the right to speak out also to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love our [this] great country of ours. Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL.&quot; After the Super Bowl LII Champion Philadelphia Eagles White House visit was cancelled due to Trump&#x27;s anti-anthem protest sentiment, Bradshaw voiced his support for the Philadelphia Eagles, stating that &quot;Trump just needs to go somewhere and enjoy the money he&#x27;s got.&quot; In 2019, Bradshaw appeared on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; and commented on Donald Trump&#x27;s planned attendance of a regular-season game between the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, stating that he respects Donald Trump &quot;having the guts to go in there.&quot;

===Health===
In September 2022, after viewers expressed concern during his appearance on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, Bradshaw revealed he had been treated for bladder cancer and neck cancer between 2021 and 2022.

===Relationship with Chuck Noll===
While Bradshaw never had any problems with the Rooney family, he had a complicated relationship with Steelers head coach Chuck Noll. Noll and Bradshaw had an uneasy relationship during his playing days, with Bradshaw stating that he felt that Noll was too hard on him and never liked him, though the two made peace (at least publicly) before Noll&#x27;s death in 2014.

In an interview with NFL Films in 2016 for an episode of &quot;A Football Life&quot; about Noll, Bradshaw felt that they had too much of a culture clash with their personalities. Bradshaw also stated that Noll belittled him constantly and wanted positive reinforcement instead of &quot;being grabbed at&quot;. In the same episode, however, former Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon characterized the animosity as &quot;a one-way street,&quot; with former teammate Jack Ham adding that Noll &quot;insulated&quot; Bradshaw from certain issues while taking a &quot;rest of us be damned&quot; approach with the other players.

In an archival interview, Noll described his relationship with Bradshaw as &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;business-like&quot; and that his personality needed to conform with the team, adding, &quot;it worked, even if Bradshaw didn&#x27;t like it.&quot; Nonetheless, Bradshaw chose not to attend Noll&#x27;s funeral despite being in Pittsburgh at the time.

==Television and film career==

Bradshaw has appeared in numerous television commercials. The most recent was the series of live ads for Tide detergent along with his Fox Sports co-host Curt Menefee, where Bradshaw shows up with a shirt stain on what appeared to be live TV from the Fox broadcast booth at Super Bowl LI and then washes it with Tide at the house of Jeffrey Tambor. The teasers leading up to the Super Bowl showed Tambor initially taking his shirts to Rob Gronkowski&#x27;s dry cleaners, only to see the sleeves get ripped out. Near the end of the Super Bowl, Menefee spills coffee on his shirt, but Tambor, who is watching on TV, refuses to help out.

Bradshaw has had cameo appearances in many shows as himself, including &quot;Brotherly Love&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, and &quot;The League&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; with Howie Long as the trashy coach of a women&#x27;s ice hockey team. He hosted a short-lived television series in 1997 called &quot;Home Team with Terry Bradshaw&quot;.

In addition to his television work, Bradshaw has appeared in several movies, including a part in the 1978 film &quot;Hooper&quot;, which starred Burt Reynolds, Jan-Michael Vincent, and Sally Field, and made an appearance in the 1981 film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;. In 1980, he had a cameo in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, which starred Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, and Sally Field. He made a guest appearance in &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; in 1994, playing Colonel Forrest March, a rogue U.S. Army officer who gave orders to his squad (played by NFL players Ken Norton Jr., Carl Banks, and Jim Harbaugh) in a huddle using football diagrams.

Bradshaw appeared on Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; as a motivational speaker for people needing to change their lives. Bill Engvall&#x27;s character is affected by Bradshaw&#x27;s rantings about witchcraft and voodoo in his pregame warm-ups.

On October 11, 2001, Bradshaw received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the first NFL player to do so.

In 2006, Bradshaw returned to the silver screen in the motion picture &quot;Failure to Launch&quot;. He and Kathy Bates played the parents of Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s character. In one notable scene, he appeared nude, which his own daughters (who were teenagers at the time) did not even know about until they saw the movie&#x27;s premiere with their grandmother and were half-heartedly warned by Bradshaw just moments before the scene.

He is also a devout Christian and wrote the book &quot;Terry Bradshaw: Man of Steel&quot; with broadcaster Dave Diles. Since 2010, Bradshaw has been hosting television shows produced by United States Media Television.

In 2017, Bradshaw appeared as himself in the comedy film &quot;Father Figures&quot;.

In 2016 and 2018, Bradshaw had a leading role in the NBC reality-travel series &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot;, where he travels around the world with William Shatner, Henry Winkler, George Foreman, and Jeff Dye. In 2017, he had a supporting role as a fictionalized version of himself in the comedy film &quot;Father Figures&quot;.

On January 16, 2019, Bradshaw competed in season one of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Deer&quot;.

On January 2, 2020, he was on the season-eight premiere of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.

On September 17, 2020, Bradshaw and his family premiered their new E! reality show &quot;The Bradshaw Bunch&quot;.

<doc id="60090" wikidata="Q181282" url="?curid=60090" title="Enzo Ferrari">
<text>Enzo Anselmo Giuseppe Maria Ferrari (; ; 18 February 1898 – 14 August 1988) was an Italian motor racing driver and entrepreneur, the founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team, and subsequently of the Ferrari automobile marque. Under his leadership, Scuderia Ferrari won nine drivers&#x27; world championships and eight constructors&#x27; world championships in Formula 1 during his lifetime. 

He was widely known as il Commendatore or il Drake, a nickname given by British opponents in reference to the English privateer Francis Drake, due to Ferrari&#x27;s demonstrated ability and determination in achieving significant sports results with his small company. In his final years, he was often referred to as l&#x27;Ingegnere (&quot;the Engineer&quot;), il Grande Vecchio (&quot;the Grand Old Man&quot;), il Cavaliere (&quot;the Knight&quot;), il Mago (&quot;the Wizard&quot;), and il Patriarca (&quot;the Patriarch&quot;).

==Early life==
Enzo Ferrari was born on February 18, 1898 in Modena, Italy, while his birth certificate states 20 February. His parents were Alfredo Ferrari and Adalgisa Bisbini; he had an older brother Alfredo Junior (Dino). The family lived in via Paolo Ferrari n°85, next to the mechanical workshop founded by Alfredo, who worked for the nearby railways. This site is now the Enzo Ferrari Museum.
Alfredo Senior was the son of a grocer from Carpi, and began a workshop fabricating metal parts at the family home. 

Enzo grew up with little formal education. Unlike his brother, he preferred working in his father&#x27;s workshop and participated in the construction of the canopy at the Giulianova station in 1914. He had ambitions of becoming an operetta tenor, sports journalist, or racing driver. When he was 10 he witnessed Felice Nazzaro&#x27;s win at the 1908 Circuito di Bologna, an event which inspired him to become a racing driver. During World War I, he served in the 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment of the Italian Army. His father Alfredo, and his older brother, Alfredo Jr., died in 1916 as a result of a widespread Italian flu outbreak. Ferrari became seriously sick himself during the 1918 flu pandemic and was consequently discharged from the Italian service.

==Racing career==


After the collapse of his family&#x27;s carpentry business, Ferrari searched for a job in the car industry. He unsuccessfully volunteered his services to Fiat in Turin, eventually settling for a job as test-driver for CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali), a car manufacturer in Milan which rebuilt used truck bodies into small passenger cars. He was later promoted to race car driver and made his competitive debut in the 1919 Parma-Poggio di Berceto hillclimb race, where he finished fourth in the three-litre category at the wheel of a 2.3-litre 4-cylinder C.M.N. 15/20. On 23 November of the same year, he took part in the Targa Florio but had to retire after his car&#x27;s fuel tank developed a leak. Due to the large number of retirements, he finished 9th. 

In 1920, Ferrari joined the racing department of Alfa Romeo as a driver. Ferrari won his first Grand Prix in 1923 in Ravenna on the Savio Circuit. 1924 was his best season, with three wins, including Ravenna, Polesine and the Coppa Acerbo in Pescara. Deeply shocked by the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923 and Antonio Ascari in 1925, Ferrari, by his admission, continued to race half-heartedly. At the same time, he developed a taste for the organisational aspects of Grand Prix racing. Following the birth of his son Alfredo (Dino) in 1932, Ferrari decided to retire and form a team of superstar drivers, including Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari. This team was called Scuderia Ferrari (founded by Enzo in 1929) and acted as a racing division for Alfa Romeo. The team was very successful, thanks to excellent cars like the Alfa Romeo P3 and to the talented drivers, like Nuvolari. Ferrari retired from competitive driving having participated in 41 Grands Prix with a record of 11 wins.

During this period, the prancing horse emblem appeared on his team&#x27;s cars. The emblem had been created and sported by Italian fighter plane pilot Francesco Baracca. During World War I, Baracca&#x27;s mother gave her son a necklace with the prancing horse on it before takeoff. Baracca was shot down and killed by an Austrian aeroplane in 1918. In memory of his death, Ferrari used the prancing horse to create the emblem that would become the world-famous Ferrari shield. Initially displayed on Ferrari&#x27;s Alfa Romeo racing car, the shield was first seen on a factory Ferrari in 1947.

==Building Ferrari==
Alfa Romeo agreed to partner with Ferrari&#x27;s racing team until 1933, when financial constraints forced them to withdraw their support – a decision subsequently retracted thanks to the intervention of Pirelli. Despite the quality of the Scuderia drivers, the team struggled to compete with Auto Union and Mercedes. Although the German manufacturers dominated the era, Ferrari&#x27;s team achieved a notable victory in 1935 when Tazio Nuvolari beat Rudolf Caracciola and Bernd Rosemeyer on their home turf at the German Grand Prix.

In 1937 Scuderia Ferrari was dissolved and Ferrari returned to Alfa&#x27;s racing team, named &quot;Alfa Corse&quot;. Alfa Romeo decided to regain full control of its racing division, retaining Ferrari as Sporting Director. After a disagreement with Alfa&#x27;s managing director Ugo Gobbato, Ferrari left in 1939 and founded Auto-Avio Costruzioni, a company supplying parts to other racing teams. Although a contract clause restricted him from racing or designing cars for four years, Ferrari managed to manufacture two cars for the 1940 Mille Miglia, which were driven by Alberto Ascari and Lotario Rangoni. With the outbreak of World War II, Ferrari&#x27;s factory was forced to undertake war production for Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government. Following Allied bombing of the factory, Ferrari relocated from Modena to Maranello. At the end of the war, Ferrari decided to start making cars bearing his name, and founded Ferrari S.p.A. in 1947.
Enzo decided to battle the dominating Alfa Romeos and race with his own team. The team&#x27;s open-wheel debut took place in Turin in 1948 and the first win came later in the year in Lago di Garda. The first major victory came at the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans, with a Ferrari 166 MM driven by Luigi Chinetti and (Baron Selsdon of Scotland) Peter Mitchell-Thomson. In 1950 Ferrari enrolled in the newly born Drivers World Championship and is the only team to remain continuously present since its introduction. Ferrari won his first world championship Grand Prix with José Froilán González at Silverstone in 1951. Apocryphally, Enzo cried like a baby when his team finally defeated the mighty Alfetta 159. The first championship came in 1952, with Alberto Ascari, a task that was repeated one year later. In 1953 Ferrari made his only attempt at the Indianapolis 500, but the car driven by Ascari crashed on lap 41 of the race. 

In order to finance his racing endeavors in Formula One as well as in other events such as the Mille Miglia and Le Mans, the company started selling sports cars.

Ferrari&#x27;s decision to continue racing in the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; brought the company new victories and greatly increased public recognition. However, increasing speeds, poor roads, and nonexistent crowd protection eventually spelled disaster for both the race and Ferrari. During the 1957 Mille Miglia, near the town of Guidizzolo, a 4.0-litre Ferrari 335 S driven by Alfonso de Portago was traveling at when it blew a tyre and crashed into the roadside crowd, killing de Portago, his co-driver and nine spectators, five of whom were children. In response, Enzo Ferrari and Englebert, the tyre manufacturer, were charged with manslaughter in a lengthy criminal prosecution that was finally dismissed in 1961.

Deeply unsatisfied with the way motorsports were covered in the Italian press, in 1961 Ferrari supported Bologna-based publisher Luciano Conti&#x27;s decision to start a new publication, &quot;Autosprint&quot;. Ferrari himself regularly contributed to the magazine for a few years.

Many of Ferrari&#x27;s greatest victories came at Le Mans (nine victories, including six in a row in 1960–1965) and in Formula One during the 1950s and 1960s, with the successes of Juan Manuel Fangio (1956), Mike Hawthorn (1958), and Phil Hill (1961).

==The Great Walkout==
Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s strong personality and controversial management style became notorious in 1962. Following a rather weak title defence of Phil Hill&#x27;s 1961 world title, sales manager Girolamo Gardini, together with manager Romolo Tavoni, chief engineer Carlo Chiti, sports car development chief Giotto Bizzarrini and other key figures in the company left Ferrari to found the rival car manufacturer and racing team Automobili Turismo e Sport (ATS). Based in Bologna, and financially supported by Count Giovanni Volpi, ATS managed to lure away Phil Hill and Giancarlo Baghetti from Ferrari, who responded by promoting junior engineers like Mauro Forghieri, Sergio Scaglietti and Giampaolo Dallara, and hiring Ludovico Scarfiotti, Lorenzo Bandini, Willy Mairesse and John Surtees to drive his Formula One cars.

The &quot;great walkout&quot; came at an especially difficult time for Ferrari. At the urging of Chiti, the company was developing a new 250-based model. Even if the car would be finished, it was unclear if it could be raced successfully. Ferrari&#x27;s shakeup proved to be successful. The mid-engined Dino racers laid the foundation for Forghieri&#x27;s dominant 250-powered 250 P. John Surtees won the world title in 1964 following a tense battle with Jim Clark and Graham Hill. The Dino road cars sold well, and other models like the 275 and Daytona were on the way. Conversely, ATS, following a troubled Formula One 1963 campaign, with both cars retiring four times in five races, folded at the end of the year.

In 1998, Tavoni declared in an interview that he and the remainder of Ferrari&#x27;s senior figures did not leave on their initiative, but were ousted following a disagreement with Ferrari over the role of his wife in the company. He said: &quot;Our mistake was to go to a lawyer and write him a letter, instead of openly discussing the issue with him. We knew that his wife wasn&#x27;t well. We should have been able to deal with it in a different way. When he called the meeting to fire us, he had already nominated our successors.&quot;

==Merging with Fiat==

By the end of the 1960s, increasing financial difficulties and the problem of racing in many categories and having to meet new safety and clean air emissions requirement for road car production and development, caused Ferrari to start looking for a business partner. In 1969 Ferrari sold 50% of his company to Fiat S.p.A., with the caveat that he would remain 100% in control of the racing activities and that Fiat would pay a sizable subsidy until his death for use of his Maranello and Modena production plants. Ferrari had previously offered Ford the opportunity to buy the firm in 1963 for US$18 million ($ in dollars ) but, late in negotiations, Ferrari withdrew once he realized that Ford would not agree to grant him independent control of the company racing department. Ferrari became a joint-stock company, and Fiat took a small share in 1965. In 1969, Fiat increased their holding to 50% of the company. In 1988 Fiat&#x27;s holding rose to 90%.

Following the agreement with Fiat, Ferrari stepped down as managing director of the road car division in 1971. In 1974, Ferrari appointed Luca Cordero di Montezemolo as Sporting Director/Formula One Team manager. Montezemolo eventually assumed the presidency of Ferrari in 1992, a post he held until September 2014. Clay Regazzoni was runner-up in 1974, while Niki Lauda won the championship in 1975 and 1977. In 1977, Ferrari was criticized in the press for replacing World Champion Lauda with newcomer Gilles Villeneuve. Ferrari claimed that Villeneuve&#x27;s aggressive driving style reminded him of Tazio Nuvolari. These feelings were reinforced after the 1979 French Grand Prix when Villeneuve finished second after an intense battle with René Arnoux. According to technical director Mauro Forghieri, &quot;When we returned to Maranello, Ferrari was ecstatic. I have never seen him so happy for a second place.&quot;

==The Modena Autodrome==
In the early 1970s, Ferrari, aided by fellow Modena constructors Maserati and Automobili Stanguellini, demanded that the Modena Town Council and Automobile Club d&#x27;Italia upgrade the Modena Autodrome, the reasoning being that the race track was obsolete and inadequate to test modern racing cars. The proposal was initially discussed with interest, but eventually stalled due to lack of political will. Ferrari then proceeded to buy the land adjacent to his factory and build the Fiorano Circuit, a 3 km track still in use to test Ferrari racing and road cars.

==Final years==
After Jody Scheckter won the title in 1979, the team experienced a disastrous 1980 campaign. In 1981 Ferrari attempted to revive his team&#x27;s fortunes by switching to turbo engines. In 1982, the second turbo-powered Ferrari, the 126C2, showed great promise. However, driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed in an accident during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix in Zolder, in May. In August, at Hockenheim, teammate Didier Pironi had his career cut short in a violent end over end flip on the misty back straight after hitting the Renault F1 driven by Alain Prost. Pironi was leading the driver&#x27;s championship at the time; he would lose the lead and the championship by five points as he sat out the remaining five races. The Scuderia went on to win the Constructors Championship at the end of the season and in 1983, with driver René Arnoux in contention for the championship until the very last race. Michele Alboreto finished second in 1985, but the team would not see championship glory again before Ferrari&#x27;s death in 1988. The final race win Ferrari saw before his death was when Gerhard Berger and Alboreto scored a 1–2 finish at the final round of the 1987 season in Australia.

==Auto racing and management controversies==
Ferrari&#x27;s management style was autocratic and he was known to pit drivers against each other in the hope of improving their performance. Some critics believe that Ferrari deliberately increased psychological pressure on his drivers, encouraging intra-team rivalries and fostering an atmosphere of intense competition for the position of number one driver. &quot;He thought that psychological pressure would produce better results for the drivers&quot;, said Ferrari team driver Tony Brooks. &quot;He would expect a driver to go beyond reasonable limits... You can drive to the maximum of your ability, but once you start psyching yourself up to do things that you don&#x27;t feel are within your ability it gets stupid. There was enough danger at that time without going over the limit.&quot; According to Mario Andretti, &quot;[Ferrari] just demanded results. But he was a guy that also understood when the cars had shortcomings. He was one that could always appreciate the effort that a driver made, when you were just busting your butt, flat out, flinging the car, and all that. He knew and saw that. He was all-in. Had no other interest in life outside of motor racing and all of the intricacies of it. Somewhat misunderstood in many ways because he was so demanding, so tough on everyone, but at the end of the day he was correct. Always correct. And that’s why you had the respect that you had for him.&quot;
Between 1955 and 1971 eight Ferrari drivers were killed driving Ferrari racing cars: Alberto Ascari, Eugenio Castellotti, Alfonso de Portago, Luigi Musso, Peter Collins, Wolfgang von Trips, Lorenzo Bandini and Ignazio Giunti. Although such a high death toll was not unusual in motor racing in those days, the Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; described Ferrari as being like the god Saturn, who consumed his own sons. In Ferrari&#x27;s defence, contemporary F1 race car driver Stirling Moss commented: &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a single occasion where a (Ferrari) driver&#x27;s life was taken because of mechanical failure.&quot;

In public Ferrari was careful to acknowledge the drivers who risked their life for his team, insisting that praise should be shared equally between car and driver for any race won. However, his longtime friend and company accountant, Carlo Benzi, related that privately Ferrari would say that &quot;the car was the reason for any success&quot;.

Following the deaths of Giuseppe Campari in 1933 and Alberto Ascari in 1955, both of whom he had a strong personal relationship with, he chose not to get too close to his drivers, out of fear of emotionally hurting himself. Later in life, he relented his position and grew very close to Clay Regazzoni and especially Gilles Villeneuve.

==Personal life==
Enzo Ferrari lived a reserved life and rarely granted interviews. He seldom left Modena and Maranello and never went to any Grands Prix outside of Italy after the 1950s. He was usually seen at the Grands Prix at Monza, near Milan, and Imola, not far from the Ferrari factory, where the circuit was named after the late Dino. His last known trip abroad was in 1982, when he went to Paris to broker a compromise between the warring FISA and FOCA parties. He never flew in an aeroplane and never set foot in a lift.

Ferrari met his future wife, Laura Dominica Garello () in Turin. They lived together for two years, and married on 28 April 1923. According to Brock Yates&#x27; 1991 book &quot;Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine&quot;, Ferrari married to keep up appearances for the sake of his career, as divorce was frowned upon in the predominantly Catholic Italy, and sought sexual conquests not so much for pleasure but for the gratification of his ego. According to Yates, Ferrari once remarked to racing manager Romolo Tavoni that &quot;a man should always have two wives&quot;, and at one point in 1961, when he was dating three women simultaneously, he wrote, &quot;I am convinced that when a man tells a woman he loves her, he only means that he desires her and that the only perfect love in this world is that of a father for his son&quot;, a comment that came several years after the death of his first son.
Ferrari and Laura&#x27;s one son, Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot;, who was born in 1932 and groomed as Enzo&#x27;s successor, suffered from ill-health and died from muscular dystrophy in 1956. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Ferrari and Laura&#x27;s love for their son is what kept them together. Although Dino never raced, his father provided him with a fleet of cars that he raced for pleasure. He also designed engine parts while bedridden. Ferrari and Laura remained married until her death in 1978. John Nikas, writer and expert on the history of cars who founded the British Sports Car Hall of Fame, said of Ferrari, &quot;His real loves in life were racing and Dino.&quot;

Enzo had a second son, Piero, with his mistress Lina Lardi in 1945. As divorce was illegal in Italy until 1970, Piero could only be recognized as Enzo&#x27;s son after Laura&#x27;s death in 1978. Piero Lardi&#x27;s existence was kept a secret known only to a few of his father&#x27;s confidantes. According to Yates, &quot;There is no question that at some point in the late 1950s, Laura Ferrari discovered her husband&#x27;s second life&quot;, and openly derided him as a &quot;bastard&quot; when she saw him in a factory. After Laura&#x27;s death, Ferrari adopted Piero, who took the name Piero Lardi Ferrari. As of 2023, he is vice chairman of the company, and owns a 10% share of it. Piero told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Michael Mann&#x27;s 2023 biographical film &quot;Ferrari&quot; was accurate, in particular in its depiction of his father&#x27;s drive, saying, &quot;My father was a person who was always looking ahead, moving forward, never going back.&quot;

Ferrari was made a Cavaliere del Lavoro in 1952, to add to his honours of Cavaliere and Commendatore in the 1920s. He also received several honorary degrees, including the Hammarskjöld Prize in 1962, the Columbus Prize in 1965, and the De Gasperi Award in 1987. He was posthumously inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1994) and the Automotive Hall of Fame (2000).

==Death==
Ferrari died on 14 August 1988 in Maranello at the age of 90, of leukemia. Because he was a private person, and because he feared popular protests due to the fact that Ferrari&#x27;s team had been beaten by McLaren in every race of the 1988 season so far, Enzo expressed the wish for his death to be reported in the media only on 16 August, the day after his burial (witnessed only by his family) on 15 August. He witnessed the launch of the Ferrari F40 shortly before his death, which was dedicated as a symbol of his achievements. In 2002 Ferrari began production of the Ferrari Enzo, named after its founder.

The Italian Grand Prix was held just weeks after Ferrari&#x27;s death, and the result was a 1–2 finish for Ferrari, with the Austrian Gerhard Berger leading home Italian and Milan native Michele Alboreto; it was the only race that McLaren did not win that season. Since Ferrari&#x27;s death, the Scuderia Ferrari team has remained successful. The team won the Constructors&#x27; Championship every year from to , and in both and . Michael Schumacher won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Scuderia Ferrari every year from to , and Kimi Räikkönen won the title with the team in .

<text>Promiscuity is the practice of engaging in sexual activity frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners. The term can carry a moral judgment. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand, and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity.

What sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures, as does the prevalence of promiscuity. Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statutes. Feminists have traditionally argued a significant double standard exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity. Historically, stereotypes of the promiscuous woman have tended to be pejorative, such as &quot;the slut&quot; or &quot;the harlot&quot;, while male stereotypes have been more varied, some expressing approval, such as &quot;the stud&quot; or &quot;the player&quot;, while others imply societal deviance, such as &quot;the womanizer&quot; or &quot;the philanderer&quot;. A scientific study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are both prone to derogatory judgment. 

Promiscuity is common in many animal species. Some species have promiscuous mating systems, ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable pair bonds, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. In biology, incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called extra-pair copulations.

==Motivations==
Accurately assessing people&#x27;s sexual behavior is difficult, since strong social and personal motivations occur, depending on social sanctions and taboos, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity.

American experiments in 1978 and 1982 found the great majority of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness, women responded with shock and disgust.

The number of sexual partners people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. We see a higher number of people who are more comfortable with their sexuality in the modern world. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above. About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted infections consistently demonstrate a small percentage of the studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random with sexual partners from throughout a population or within their social groups.

A 2006 systematic review analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as number of sexual partners, and sexual-health status. Much more predictive of sexual-health status are socioeconomic factors like poverty and mobility. Other studies have suggested that people with multiple casual sex partners are more likely to be diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections.

Severe and impulsive promiscuity, along with a compulsive urge to engage in illicit sex with attached individuals is a common symptom of borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder but most promiscuous individuals do not have these disorders.

==Cross-cultural studies==
In 2008, a U.S. university study of international promiscuity found that Finns have had the largest number of sex partners in the industrialized world, and British people have the largest number among big western industrial nations. The study measured one-night stands, attitudes to casual sex, and number of sexual partners. A 2014 nationwide survey in the United Kingdom named Liverpool the country&#x27;s most promiscuous city.

Britain&#x27;s position on the international index &quot;may be linked to increasing social acceptance of promiscuity among women as well as men&quot;. Britain&#x27;s ranking was &quot;ascribed to factors such as the decline of religious scruples about extramarital sex, the growth of equal pay and equal rights for women, and a highly sexualized popular culture&quot;. 

The top-10-ranking OECD nations with a population over 10 million on the study&#x27;s promiscuity index, in descending order, were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Czechia, Australia, the United States, France, Turkey, Mexico, and Canada.
A 2017 survey by Superdrug found that the United Kingdom was the country with the most sex partners with an average of 7, while Austria had around 6.5. The 2012 Trojan Sex Life Survey found that African American men reported an average of 38 sex partners in their lifetime. A study funded by condom-maker Durex, conducted in 2006 and published in 2009, measured promiscuity by a total number of sexual partners. The survey found Austrian men had the highest number of sex partners globally, with 29.3 sexual partners on average. New Zealand women had the highest number of sex partners for females in the world with an average of 20.4 sexual partners. In all of the countries surveyed, except New Zealand, men reported more sexual partners than women.

One review found the people from developed Western countries had more sex partners than people from developing countries in general, while the rate of STIs was higher in developing countries.

According to the 2005 Global Sex Survey by Durex, people have had on average nine sexual partners, the most in Turkey (14.5) and Australia (13.3), and the fewest in India (3) and China (3.1).

In many cases, the population of each country that participates is approximately 1000 people and can equate to less than 0.0003% of the population, e.g. the 2017 survey of 42 nations surveyed only 33,000 people. In India, data was collected from less than 0.000001% of the total population at that time. According to the 2012 General Social Survey in the United States by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, Protestants on average had more sex partners than Catholics. Similarly, a 2019 study by the Institute for Family Studies in the US found that of never married young people, Protestants have more sexual partners than Catholics.

==Male promiscuity==
=== Straight men (heterosexuals) ===
A 1994 study in the United States, which looked at the number of sexual partners in a lifetime, found 20% of heterosexual men had one partner, 55% had two to 20 partners, and 25% had more than 20 sexual partners. More recent studies have reported similar numbers.

In the United Kingdom, a nationally representative study in 2013 found that 33.9% of heterosexual men had 10 or more lifetime sexual partners. Among men between 45 and 54 years old, 43.1% reported 10 or more sexual partners.

A 2003 representative study in Australia found that heterosexual men had a median of 8 female sexual partners in their lifetime. For lifetime sexual partners: 5.8% had 0 partners, 10.3% had 1 partner, 6.1% had 2 partners, 33% had between 3 and 9 partners, 38.3% had between 10 and 49 partners and 6.6% had more than 50 female sexual partners.

A 2014 representative study in Australia found that heterosexual men had a median of 7.8 female sexual partners in their lifetime. For lifetime sexual partners: 3.7% had 0 partners, 12.6% had 1 partner, 6.8% had 2 partners, 32.3% had between 3 and 9 partners, 36.9% had between 10 and 49 partners and 7.8% had more than 50 female sexual partners.

Research by J. Michael Bailey found that heterosexual men had the same level of interest in casual sex as gay men. However he found straight men were limited in their ability to acquire high numbers of female partners. According to Bailey, &quot;These facts suggest that women are responsible for the pace of sex. Gay and straight men both want casual sex, but only straight men have the brake of women’s sexually cautious nature to slow them.&quot; 

===Gay men (homosexuals)===

A 1989 study found having over 100 partners to be present though rare among homosexual males. An extensive 1994 study found that difference in the mean number of sexual partners between gay and straight men &quot;did not appear very large&quot;.

A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found &quot;the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women.&quot;

The 2013 British NATSAL study found that gay men typically had 19 sexual partners in a lifetime (median). In the previous year, 51.8% reported having either 0 or 1 sexual partner. A further 21.3% reported having between 2 and 4 sexual partners, 7.3% reported having between 5 and 9, and 19.6% reported having 10 or more sexual partners.

A 2014 study in Australia found gay men had a median of 22 sexual partners in a lifetime (&quot;sexual partner&quot; was defined as kissing, touching or intercourse). 50.1% of gay men reported having either 0 or 1 partner in the previous year, while 25.6% reported 10 or more partners in the previous year.

Research on gay sexual behavior may overrepresent promiscuous respondents. This is because gay men are a small portion of the male population, and thus many researchers have relied on convenience surveys to research behavior of gay men. Examples of this type of sampling includes surveying men on dating apps such as Grindr, or finding volunteers at gay bars, clubs and saunas. Convenience surveys often exclude gay men who are in a relationship, and gay men who do not use dating apps or attend gay venues. For example, the British and European convenience surveys included approximately five times as many gay men who reported &quot;5 or more sexual partners&quot; than the nationally representative NATSAL study did. Probability sample surveys are more useful in this regard, because they seek to accurately reflect the characteristics of the gay male population. Examples include the NATSAL in the United Kingdom and the General Social Survey in the United States.

According to John Corvino, opponents of gay rights often use convenience sample statistics to support their belief that gay men are promiscuous, but that larger representative samples show that the difference is not so large, and that extreme promiscuity occurs in a minority of gay men. Psychologist J. Michael Bailey has stated that social conservatives use promiscuity among gay men as evidence of a &quot;decadent&quot; nature of gay men, but says &quot;I think they&#x27;re wrong. Promiscuous gay men are expressing an essentially masculine trait. They are doing what most heterosexual men would do if they could. They are in this way just like heterosexual men, except that they don&#x27;t have women to constrain them.&quot;

Regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), some researchers have said that the number of sexual partners had by gay men cannot fully explain rates of HIV infection in this population. Most gay men report having similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners as straight men on an annual basis. Unprotected receptive anal sex, which holds a much higher risk of HIV transmission, appears to be the major factor.

==Female promiscuity==

In 1994, a study in the United States found almost all married heterosexual women reported having sexual contact only with their husbands, and unmarried women almost always reported having no more than one sexual partner in the past three months. Lesbians who had long-term partners reported having fewer outside partners than heterosexual women. More recent research, however, contradicts the assertion that heterosexual women are largely monogamous. A 2002 study estimated that 45% to 55% of married heterosexual women engage in sexual relationships outside of their marriage, while the estimate for heterosexual men engaging in the same conduct was 50–60% in the same study.

One possible explanation for hyper sexuality is child sexual abuse (CSA) trauma. Many studies have examined the correlation between CSA and risky sexual behavior. Rodriguez-Srednicki and Ofelia examined the correlation of CSA experienced by women and their self-destructive behavior as adults using a questionnaire. The diversity and ages of the women varied. Slightly fewer than half the women reported CSA while the remainder reported no childhood trauma. The results of the study determined that self-destructive behaviors, including hypersexuality, correlates with CSA in women. CSA can create sexual schemas that result in risky sexual behavior. This can play out in their sexual interactions as girls get older. The sexual behaviors of women that experienced CSA differed from those of women without exposure to CSA. Studies show CSA survivors tend to have more sexual partners and engage in higher risk sexual behaviors. 

Since at least 1450, the word &#x27;slut&#x27; has been used, often pejoratively, to describe a sexually promiscuous woman. In and before the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, terms like &quot;strumpet&quot; and &quot;whore&quot; were used to describe women deemed promiscuous, as seen, for example, in John Webster&#x27;s 1612 play &quot;The White Devil&quot;.

Thornhill and Gangestad found that women are much more likely to sexually fantasize about and be attracted to extra-pair men during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than the luteal phase, whereas attraction to the primary partner does not change depending on the menstrual cycle. A 2004 study by Pillsworth, Hasselton and Buss contradicted this, finding greater in-pair sexual attraction during this phase and no increase in attraction to extra-pair men.

In Norwegian students, Kennair et al. (2023) found no signs of a sexual double standard in short-term or long-term mating contexts, nor in choosing a friend, except that women&#x27;s self-stimulation was more acceptable than men&#x27;s.

==Evolution==
Evolutionary psychologists propose that a conditional human tendency for promiscuity is inherited from hunter-gatherer ancestors. Promiscuity increases the likelihood of having children, thus &quot;evolutionary&quot; fitness. According to them, female promiscuity is advantageous in that it allows females to choose fathers for their children who have better genes than their mates, to ensure better care for their offspring, have more children, and as a form of fertility insurance. Male promiscuity was likely advantageous because it allowed males to father more children.

==Primitive promiscuity==
Primitive promiscuity or original promiscuity was the 19th-century hypothesis that humans originally lived in a state of promiscuity or &quot;&quot; before the advent of society as we understand it. Hetaerism is a theoretical early state of human society, as postulated by 19th-century anthropologists, which was characterized by the absence of the institution of marriage in any form and in which women were the common property of their tribe and in which children never knew who their fathers were.

The reconstruction of the original state of primitive society or humanity was based on the idea of progress, according to which all cultures have degrees of improvement and becoming more complicated. It seemed logical to assume that never before the types of families developed did they simply exist, and in primitive society, sexual relations were without any boundaries and taboos. This view is represented, inter alia, by anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan in &quot;Ancient Society&quot; and Friedrich Engels&#x27; work &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;.

In the first half of the 20th century, this notion was rejected by a number of authors, e.g. Edvard Westermarck, a Finnish philosopher, social anthropologist and sociologist with in-depth knowledge of the history of marriage, who provided strong evidence that, at least in the first stages of cultural development, monogamy has been a perfectly normal and natural form of man-woman coexistence.

Modern cultural anthropology has not confirmed the existence of a complete promiscuity in any known society or culture. The evidence of history is reduced to some texts of Herodotus, Strabo, and Solinus, which have been hard to interpret.

==Religious, social, and cultural views==

Christianity, Judaism, and Islam condemn promiscuity and instead advocate lifelong monogamous marriage (although Islam allows polygamy for men). The perspectives on promiscuity vary significantly depending on the region. Every country has different values and morals pertaining to sexual life.

Promiscuity has been practiced in hippie communities and other alternative subcultures since the 1960s cultural revolution.

Sex and Culture is a book by J. D. Unwin concerning the correlation between a society&#x27;s level of &#x27;cultural achievement&#x27; and its level of sexual restraint. Published in 1934, the book concluded with the theory that as societies develop, they become more sexually liberal, accelerating the social entropy of the society, and thereby diminishing its &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;expansive&quot; energy.

==Other animals==
Some researchers have suggested that the practice of referring to animals as promiscuous in reference to their mating system is often inaccurate and potentially biased. More precise terms such as polyandry, polygyny, and polygynandry are increasingly preferred.

Many animal species, such as spotted hyenas, pigs, bonobos and chimpanzees, are promiscuous as a rule, and do not form pair bonds. Although social monogamy occurs in about 90% of avian species and about 3% of mammalian species, an estimated 90% of socially monogamous species exhibit individual promiscuity in the form of copulation outside the pair bond.

In the animal world, some species, including birds such as swans and fish such as &quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot;, once believed monogamous, are now known to engage in extra-pair copulations. One example of extra-pair fertilization (EPF) in birds is the black-throated blue warblers. Though it is a socially monogamous species, both males and females engage in EPF.

The Darwin-Bateman paradigm, which states that males are typically eager to copulate while females are more choosy about whom to mate with, has been confirmed by a meta-analysis. There is, however, continued debate about the utility and pitfalls of the Bateman perspective.

<doc id="60097" wikidata="Q922339" url="?curid=60097" title="Topological ring">
<text>In mathematics, a topological ring is a ring formula_1 that is also a topological space such that both the addition and the multiplication are continuous as maps:
formula_2
where formula_3 carries the product topology. That means formula_1 is an additive topological group and a multiplicative topological semigroup.

Topological rings are fundamentally related to topological fields and arise naturally while studying them, since for example completion of a topological field may be a topological ring which is not a field.

==General comments==

The group of units formula_5 of a topological ring formula_1 is a topological group when endowed with the topology coming from the embedding of formula_5 into the product formula_3 as formula_9 However, if the unit group is endowed with the subspace topology as a subspace of formula_10 it may not be a topological group, because inversion on formula_5 need not be continuous with respect to the subspace topology. An example of this situation is the adele ring of a global field; its unit group, called the idele group, is not a topological group in the subspace topology. If inversion on formula_5 is continuous in the subspace topology of formula_1 then these two topologies on formula_5 are the same.

If one does not require a ring to have a unit, then one has to add the requirement of continuity of the additive inverse, or equivalently, to define the topological ring as a ring that is a topological group (for formula_15) in which multiplication is continuous, too.

==Examples==

Topological rings occur in mathematical analysis, for example as rings of continuous real-valued functions on some topological space (where the topology is given by pointwise convergence), or as rings of continuous linear operators on some normed vector space; all Banach algebras are topological rings. The rational, real, complex and formula_16-adic numbers are also topological rings (even topological fields, see below) with their standard topologies. In the plane, split-complex numbers and dual numbers form alternative topological rings. See hypercomplex numbers for other low-dimensional examples.

In commutative algebra, the following construction is common: given an ideal formula_17 in a commutative ring formula_10 the -adic topology on formula_1 is defined as follows: a subset formula_20 of formula_1 is open if and only if for every formula_22 there exists a natural number formula_23 such that formula_24 This turns formula_1 into a topological ring. The formula_17-adic topology is Hausdorff if and only if the intersection of all powers of formula_17 is the zero ideal formula_28 

The formula_16-adic topology on the integers is an example of an formula_17-adic topology (with formula_31).

==Completion==
Every topological ring is a topological group (with respect to addition) and hence a uniform space in a natural manner. One can thus ask whether a given topological ring formula_1 is complete. If it is not, then it can be &quot;completed&quot;: one can find an essentially unique complete topological ring formula_33 that contains formula_1 as a dense subring such that the given topology on formula_1 equals the subspace topology arising from formula_36
If the starting ring formula_1 is metric, the ring formula_33 can be constructed as a set of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in formula_10 this equivalence relation makes the ring formula_33 Hausdorff and using constant sequences (which are Cauchy) one realizes a (uniformly) continuous morphism (CM in the sequel) formula_41 such that, for all CM formula_42 where formula_43 is Hausdorff and complete, there exists a unique CM formula_44 such that 
formula_45 If formula_1 is not metric (as, for instance, the ring of all real-variable rational valued functions, that is, all functions formula_47 endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence) the standard construction uses minimal Cauchy filters and satisfies the same universal property as above (see Bourbaki, General Topology, III.6.5).

The rings of formal power series and the formula_16-adic integers are most naturally defined as completions of certain topological rings carrying formula_17-adic topologies.

==Topological fields==

Some of the most important examples are topological fields. A topological field is a topological ring that is also a field, and such that inversion of non zero elements is a continuous function. The most common examples are the complex numbers and all its subfields, and the valued fields, which include the formula_16-adic fields.

<doc id="60098" wikidata="Q52418" url="?curid=60098" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">
<text>The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Empire of Japan on the United States Pacific Fleet at its naval base at Pearl Harbor on Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. At the time, the U.S. was a neutral country in World War II. The air raid on Pearl Harbor, which was launched from aircraft carriers, resulted in the U.S. entering the war on the side of the Allies on the day following the attack. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was preceded by months of negotiations between the U.S. and Japan over the future of the Pacific. Japanese demands included that the U.S. end its sanctions against Japan, cease aiding China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, and allow Japan to access the resources of the Dutch East Indies. Japan sent out its naval attack group on November 26, 1941, just prior to receiving the Hull note, which stated the U.S. desire that Japan withdraw from China and French Indochina. Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, planned the attack as a pre-emptive strike on the Pacific Fleet, based at Pearl Harbor since 1940, in order to prevent it from interfering with Japan&#x27;s planned actions in Southeast Asia. Yamamoto hoped that the strike would enable Japan to make quick territorial gains and negotiate a peace. In addition to Pearl Harbor, over seven hours Japan launched coordinated attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island; and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

The attack force, commanded by Chūichi Nagumo, began its attacks at 7:48a.m. Hawaiian time (6:18p.m. GMT) on December 7, 1941. The base was attacked by 353 fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers in two waves launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight U.S. battleships present, all were damaged and four were sunk. All but were later raised, and six were returned to service during the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and a minelayer. More than 180 U.S. aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded, while the Japanese lost a total of 29 aircraft, five midget submarines, and 130 men. The three U.S. carriers stationed at Pearl Harbor escaped damage because they were at sea at the time, and important base installations, including its oil storage and naval repair facilities, were not attacked.

Japan declared war on the U.S. and the British Empire later that day (December 8 in Tokyo), but the declarations were not delivered until the next day. On December 8, both the United Kingdom and U.S. declared war on Japan. On December 11, though they had no formal obligation to do so under the Tripartite Pact with Japan, Germany and Italy each declared war on the United States, which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. While there were historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, the lack of a formal warning and perception that the attack had been unprovoked led U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt to famously label December 7, 1941, &quot;a date which will live in infamy&quot;. The attack was the deadliest event ever in Hawaii, and the deadliest foreign attack on the U.S. until the September 11 attacks of 2001.

==Background==
===Diplomacy===

War between the Empire of Japan and the United States was seen as a possibility since the 1920s. Japan had been wary of American territorial and military expansion in the Pacific and Asia since the late 1890s, followed by the annexation of islands, such as Hawaii and the Philippines, which they felt were close to or within their sphere of influence.

At the same time, Japanese strategic thinkers believed that Japan needed economic self-sufficiency in order to wage modern war. The experiences of World War I had taught the Japanese that modern wars would be protracted, require total mobilization and create vulnerabilities for trade embargoes and encirclement. As a consequence, Japan needed access to strategically important resources (e.g. iron, oil) that could not be extracted at sufficient levels in the home islands.

Although Japan had begun to take a hostile stance against the United States after the rejection of the Racial Equality Proposal, the relationship between the two countries was cordial enough that they remained trading partners. Tensions did not seriously grow until Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Over the next decade, Japan expanded into China, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and endeavored to secure enough independent resources to attain victory on the mainland. The &quot;Southern Operation&quot; was designed to assist these efforts. Nevertheless, Japan would still rely heavily on U.S. oil imports, including to Japanese forces in Japan-occupied Manchuria. In a memorandum dated October 24, 1934, Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs Stanley K. Hornbeck discussed his meeting with Teagle to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and how Standard Oil New Jersey head Walter C. Teagle was also uncooperative with U.S. recommendations and also given special treatment by the Japanese government, who made him and Standard Oil New Jersey less subjected to Japan&#x27;s national business regulation policies than they did other companies. Hornbeck noted in the memorandum that as a result of Teagle&#x27;s business dealings with Japan, &quot;petroleum products now imported into Japan is of American origin.&quot;

Starting in December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS &quot;Panay&quot;, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre swung Western public opinion sharply against Japan. The United States unsuccessfully proposed a joint action with the United Kingdom to blockade Japan. In 1938, following an appeal by President Roosevelt, American companies stopped providing Japan with implements of war.

In 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, attempting to stymie the flow of supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which the latter perceived as an unfriendly act. The United States did not stop oil exports, however, partly because of the prevailing sentiment in Washington that given Japanese dependence on American oil, such an action was likely to be considered an extreme provocation.

In mid-1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii. He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines, taking both actions in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was mistakenly certain any attack on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore, would bring the United States into the war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to prevent American naval interference. An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The American War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with an elite force of 40,000 men; this option was never implemented due to opposition from Douglas MacArthur, who felt he would need a force ten times that size. By 1941, American planners expected to have to abandon the Philippines at the outbreak of war. Late that year, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, was given orders to that effect.

The United States finally ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following the seizure of French Indochina after the Fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption. Because of this decision, Japan proceeded with plans to take the oil-rich Dutch East Indies. On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that America was prepared to take opposing steps if &quot;neighboring countries&quot; were attacked.

Japan and the United States engaged in negotiations during 1941, attempting to improve relations. In the course of these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina after making peace with the Nationalist government. It also proposed to adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact and to refrain from trade discrimination, provided all other nations reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe then offered to meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on reaching an agreement before any meeting. The American ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoe government and peace in the Pacific. However, his recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoe government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military rejected a withdrawal of all troops from China.

Japan&#x27;s final proposal, delivered on November 20, offered to withdraw from southern Indochina and to refrain from attacks in Southeast Asia, so long as the United States, United Kingdom, and Netherlands supplied of aviation fuel, lifted their sanctions against Japan, and ceased aid to China. The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan), the Hull note, required Japan to completely evacuate China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. On November 26 in Japan, the day before the note&#x27;s delivery, the Japanese task force left port for Pearl Harbor.

The Japanese intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with their planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the course of seven hours, there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the American-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. From the Japanese point of view, it was seen as a preemptive strike &quot;before the oil gauge ran empty.&quot;

===Military planning===

Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the &quot;Southern Resource Area&quot;, the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally, began early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan&#x27;s Combined Fleet. He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command. Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Commander Minoru Genda and Yamamoto&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima. The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.

Over the next several months, pilots were trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence was collected. Despite these preparations, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter. At first, he hesitated to engage in war but eventually authorized the Pearl Harbor strike despite dissent from certain advisors. Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the Hull note would &quot;destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea&quot;. Before the attack, he became more involved in military matters, even joining the Conference of Military Councillors, which was considered unusual for him. Additionally, he actively sought more information about the war plans. According to an aide, he openly displayed happiness upon hearing about the success of the surprise attacks. 

By late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the United States and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion. While American Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines to be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south. They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.

===Objectives===
The Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and enabling Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. The leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) ascribed to Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine, especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory. Third, to deliver a blow to America&#x27;s ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of navies at the time. Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale to such an extent that the American government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests and seek a peace compromise.

Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor had two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them, and most of the crews would survive the attack since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantage was the absence of all three of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers (, , and ). Despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.

Japanese confidence in their ability to win a short war meant that other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms and submarine base, were left unscathed, since by their thinking the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.

==Approach and attack==
On November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the Striking Force) of six aircraft carriers, , , , , and departed Hittokapu Bay on Etorofu (now Iterup) Island in the Kuril Islands, &quot;en route&quot; to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.

The first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target. The first wave carried most of the weapons designed to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water. The aircrews were ordered to select the highest-value targets (battleships and aircraft carriers) or, if these were not present, any other high-value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First-wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters&#x27; fuel got low, they were to refuel aboard the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to assume CAP duties where needed, especially over American airfields.

Before the attack commenced, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched reconnaissance floatplanes from heavy cruisers and , to scout Oahu and Lahaina Roads, Maui, respectively, with orders to report on American fleet composition and location. Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the Americans, and were not necessary. Fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor were already known from the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa. A report of the absence of the American fleet at Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the &quot;Tone&quot;″s floatplane and the fleet submarine . Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the Kidō Butai) and Niihau, to detect any counterattack.

===Submarines===
Fleet submarines , , , , and each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu. The five I-boats left Kure Naval District on November 25, 1941. On December 6, they came to within of the mouth of Pearl Harbor and launched their midget subs at about 01:00 local time on December 7. At 03:42 Hawaiian time, the minesweeper spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer . The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor. However, &quot;Ward&quot; sank another midget submarine at 06:37 in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater. A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer with her other one before being sunk by &quot;Monaghan&quot; at 08:43.

A third midget submarine, &quot;Ha-19&quot;, grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8. Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui, becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war. A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes. It was found outside the harbor in 1960. Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming to have damaged one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor.

In 1992, 2000, and 2001 Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory&#x27;s submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus American equipment had been dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer at 08:21. There is dispute over this official chain of events though. The &quot;torpedo&quot; that &quot;St. Louis&quot; saw was also reportedly a porpoising minesweeping float being towed by the destroyer . Some historians and naval architects theorise that a photo taken by a Japanese naval aviator of Battleship Row during the attack on Pearl Harbor that was declassified in the 1990s and publicized in the 2000s to the public, shows the fifth midget submarine firing a torpedo at &quot;West Virginia&quot; and another at &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. These torpedoes were twice the size of the aerial torpedoes so it was possible that both torpedoes heavily contributed to the sinkings of both ships and especially helped to capsize &quot;Oklahoma&quot; as &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was the only battleship that day to suffer catastrophic damage to her belt armor at the waterline from a torpedo. Admiral Chester Nimitz, in a report to Congress, confirmed that one midget submarine&#x27;s torpedo (possibly from the other midget submarine that fired torpedoes but failed to hit a target) which was fired but did not explode was recovered in Pearl Harbor and was much larger than the aerial torpedoes.
 Others dispute this theory.

===Japanese declaration of war===
The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto&#x27;s intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end. However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the &quot;14-Part Message&quot;) in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it at 1:00p.m. Washington time, as ordered, and consequently the message was not presented until more than one hour after the attack had but American code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before it was scheduled to be delivered. The final part of the message is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior American government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated and that war might break out at any moment, it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan&#x27;s newspapers in the evening edition of December 8 (late December 7 in the United States), but not delivered to the American government until the day after the attack.

For decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan&#x27;s intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, &quot;[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.&quot; Of this, Iguchi said, &quot;The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations... and they clearly prevailed.&quot;

In any event, even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14-Part Message before the beginning of the attack, it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war. The final two paragraphs of the message read:

United States naval intelligence officers were alarmed by the unusual timing for delivering the 1:00p.m. on a Sunday, which was 7:30a.m. in and attempted to alert Pearl Harbor. But due to communication problems the warning was not delivered before the attack.

===First wave composition===
The first attack wave of 183 airplanes, led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, was launched north of Oahu. Six airplanes failed to launch due to technical difficulties. The first wave included three groups of airplanes:

*1st Group (targets: battleships and aircraft carriers)
**49 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; bombers armed with 800kg (1760lb) armor-piercing bombs, organized in four sections (one failed to launch)
**40 B5N bombers armed with Type 91 torpedoes, also in four sections
*2nd Group – (targets: Ford Island and Wheeler Field)
**51 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers armed with general-purpose bombs (3 failed to launch)
*3rd Group – (targets: aircraft at Ford Island, Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, Barber&#x27;s Point, Kaneohe)
**43 Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot; fighters for air control and strafing (2 failed to launch)

As the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by United States Army SCR-270 radar positioned at Opana Point near the island&#x27;s northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational. The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target to Private Joseph P. McDonald, a private stationed at Fort Shafter&#x27;s Intercept Center near Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers, and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size. Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).

As the first wave approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several American aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the Japanese air assault began at 7:48a.m. Hawaiian time (3:18a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;), with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353 Japanese planes reached Oahu in two waves. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked American air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main United States Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces&#x27; Bellows Field, near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P-36 Hawks, P-40 Warhawks and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier .

In the first-wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800kg (1760lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud. Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships, while four hit other ships. Men aboard the ships awoke to the sounds of alarms, bombs exploding, and gunfire, prompting them to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations. (The famous message, &quot;Air raid Pearl Harbor. This is not drill.&quot;, was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two, the first senior Hawaiian command to respond.) American servicemen were caught unprepared by the attack. Ammunition lockers were locked, aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage, guns unmanned (none of the Navy&#x27;s 5&quot;/38s, only a quarter of its machine guns, and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action). Despite this low alert status, many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack. Ensign Joseph Taussig Jr., aboard , commanded the ship&#x27;s antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded but remained at his post. Lieutenant Commander F. J. Thomas commanded &quot;Nevada&quot; in the captain&#x27;s absence and got her underway until the ship was grounded at 9:10a.m. One of the destroyers, , got underway with only four officers aboard, all ensigns, none with more than a year&#x27;s sea duty; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard. Captain Mervyn Bennion, commanding , led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit , moored alongside.

===Second wave composition===
The second planned wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki. Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties. This wave and its targets also comprised three groups of planes:
*1st Group – 54 B5Ns armed with and general-purpose bombs
**27 B5Ns – aircraft and hangars on Kaneohe, Ford Island, and Barbers Point
**27 B5Ns – hangars and aircraft on Hickam Field
*2nd Group (targets: aircraft carriers and cruisers)
**78 D3As armed with general-purpose bombs, in four sections (3 aborted)
*3rd Group – (targets: aircraft at Ford Island, Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, Barber&#x27;s Point, Kaneohe)
**35 A6Ms for defense and strafing (1 aborted)
The second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kāneohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.

===American casualties and damage===
Ninety minutes after it began, the attack was over. 2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded; 218 soldiers and airmen (who were part of the Army prior to the independent United States Air Force in 1947) were killed and 364 wounded; 109 Marines were killed and 69 wounded; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded. In total, 2,403 Americans were killed, and 1,178 were wounded. Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships. All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were legally non-combatants, given that there was no state of war when the attack occurred.

Of the American fatalities, nearly half were due to the explosion of &#x27;s forward magazine after she was hit by a modified shell. Author Craig Nelson wrote that the vast majority of the U.S. sailors killed at Pearl Harbor were junior enlisted personnel. &quot;The officers of the Navy all lived in houses and the junior people were the ones on the boats, so pretty much all of the people who died in the direct line of the attack were very junior people&quot;, Nelson said. &quot;So everyone is about 17 or 18 whose story is told there.&quot;

Among the notable civilian casualties were nine Honolulu Fire Department firefighters who responded to Hickam Field during the bombing in Honolulu, becoming the only fire department members on American soil to be attacked by a foreign power in history. Fireman Harry Tuck Lee Pang of Engine6 was killed near the hangars by machine-gun fire from a Japanese plane. Captains Thomas Macy and John Carreira of Engine4 and Engine1, respectively, died while battling flames inside the hangar after a Japanese bomb crashed through the roof. An additional six firefighters were wounded by Japanese shrapnel. The wounded later received Purple Hearts (originally reserved for service members wounded by enemy action while partaking in armed conflicts) for their peacetime actions that day on June 13, 1944; the three firefighters killed did not receive theirs until December 7, 1984, on the 43rd anniversary of the attack. This made the nine men the only non-military firefighters to receive such an award in American history.

Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, &quot;Nevada&quot; attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid risking blocking the harbor entrance if she sank there. was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from &quot;Arizona&quot; and was drifted down toward her and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship was holed twice by torpedoes. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. was hit by two of the converted 16&quot; shells, but neither caused serious damage.

Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer . Two destroyers in dry dock, and , were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. &quot;Cassin&quot; slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against &quot;Downes&quot;. The light cruiser was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser was damaged but remained in service. The repair vessel , moored alongside &quot;Arizona&quot;, was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender &quot;Curtiss&quot; was also damaged. The destroyer was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.

Of the 402 American aircraft in Hawaii, 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged, 155 of them on the ground. Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base. Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack, and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack: 1st Lieutenant Lewis M. Sanders and 2nd Lieutenants Philip M. Rasmussen, Kenneth M. Taylor, George S. Welch, Harry W. Brown, and Gordon H. Sterling Jr. Of 33 Consolidated PBY Catalinas in Hawaii, 30 were destroyed, while three on patrol at the time of the attack returned undamaged. Friendly fire brought down some American planes on top of that, including four from an inbound flight from .

At the time of the attack, nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor. Of these, three were shot down.

===Japanese losses===
Fifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack, and one, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. Of Japan&#x27;s 414 available planes, 350 took part in the raid. Twenty-nine were lost, nine in the first wave (three fighters, one dive bomber, and five torpedo bombers) and twenty in the second (six fighters and fourteen dive bombers), with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground.

===Possible third wave===
According to some accounts, several Japanese junior officers, including Fuchida and Genda, urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to sink more of the Pearl Harbor&#x27;s remaining warships, and damage the base&#x27;s maintenance shops, drydock facilities and oil tank yards. Most notably, Fuchida gave a firsthand account of this meeting several times after the war. However, some historians have cast doubt on this and many other of Fuchida&#x27;s later claims, which sometimes conflict with documented historic records. Genda, who opined during the planning for the attack that without an invasion three strikes were necessary to fully disable the Pacific Fleet, denied requesting an additional attack. Regardless, it is undisputed that the captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike soon after the second returned, but Nagumo decided to withdraw for several reasons:
*American anti-aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike, and two-thirds of Japan&#x27;s losses were incurred during the second wave.
*Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike, he would be risking three-quarters of the Combined Fleet&#x27;s strength to wipe out the remaining targets (which included the facilities) while suffering higher aircraft losses.
*The location of the American carriers remained unknown. In addition, the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land-based bombers. Nagumo was uncertain whether the United States had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers.
*A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time, and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night. At the time, only the Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques, so this was a substantial risk. The first two waves had launched the entirety of the Combined Fleet&#x27;s air strength. A third wave would have required landing both the first and second wave before launching the first wave again. Compare Nagumo&#x27;s situation in the Battle of Midway, where an attack returning from Midway kept Nagumo from launching an immediate strike on American carriers.
*The task force&#x27;s fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer, since he was at the very limit of logistical support. To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel, perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home.
*He believed the second strike had essentially accomplished the mission&#x27;s main objective (neutralizing the United States Pacific Fleet) and did not wish to risk further losses. Moreover, it was IJN practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy.

Although a hypothetical third strike would have likely focused on the base&#x27;s remaining warships, military historians have suggested any potential damage to the shore facilities would have hampered the Pacific Fleet far more seriously. If they had been wiped out, &quot;serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year&quot;; according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, &quot;it would have prolonged the war another two years&quot;.

At a conference aboard his flagship the following morning, Yamamoto supported Nagumo&#x27;s withdrawal without launching a third wave. In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and the oil tank farm meant the United States could respond relatively quickly in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo&#x27;s decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.

==Ships lost or damaged==
Twenty-one American ships were damaged or lost in the attack, of which all but three were repaired and returned to service.

==Salvage==
After a systematic search for survivors, Captain Homer N. Wallin was ordered to lead a formal salvage operation.

Around Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge Company and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Melvin Storer and other Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.

Intensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water. &quot;Arizona&quot; and the target ship &quot;Utah&quot; were too heavily damaged for salvage and remain where they were sunk, with &quot;Arizona&quot; becoming a war memorial. &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, while successfully raised, was never repaired and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. The &quot;Nevada&quot; proved particularly difficult to raise and repair; two men involved in the operation died after inhaling poisonous gases that had accumulated in the ship&#x27;s interior. When feasible, armament and equipment were removed from vessels too damaged to repair and put to use to improve the anti-aircraft defense of the harbor or installed aboard other craft.

==News coverage==
=== Coverage in the United States ===

The initial announcement of the attack on Pearl Harbor was made by the White House Press Secretary, Stephen Early, at 2:22p.m. Eastern time (8:52a.m. Hawaiian time): &quot;The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor from the air and all naval and military activities on the island of Oahu, principal American base in the Hawaiian islands.&quot; As information developed, Early made a number of additional announcements to approximately 150 White House reporters over the course of the afternoon.

Initial reports of the attack moved on news wires at approximately 2:25p.m. Eastern time. The first radio coverage (which, at the time, represented the earliest opportunity for ordinary people to learn of the attack) was on the CBS radio network&#x27;s scheduled news program, &quot;World News Today&quot;, at 2:30p.m. Eastern time. John Charles Daly read the initial report, then switched to London, where Robert Trout ad-libbed on the possible London reaction. The first report on NBC cut into a play, a dramatization of &quot;The Inspector-General&quot;, at 2:33p.m. Eastern time and lasted only 21 seconds. Unlike the later practice with major news stories, there were only brief interruptions of scheduled commercial programming. 

The attacks were covered on television but the extent of it was limited; as commercial television had started just 6 months earlier, &quot;a few thousand TV sets existed&quot; in the United States, with most being in the Greater New York City area, and only a handful of stations existed which were all in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. WNBT from New York was the only TV station that was regularly airing that day in the country, with the comedy movie &quot;Millionaire Playboy&quot;, which was scheduled for 3:30-4:30 PM, being interrupted with the news of the attack. The other station known to cover the attacks was WCBW, also out of New York, where a special report on the attack was broadcast that evening. There are no recordings of either station&#x27;s coverage, either visual or audio.

A contemporaneous newspaper report compared the attack to the Battle of Port Arthur in which the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Imperial Russian Navy, triggering the Russo-Japanese War, 37 years prior. Modern writers have continued to note parallels between the attacks, albeit more dispassionately.

=== Coverage in Japan ===
News of the attack was first broadcast at 11:30 AM (Japanese Standard Time), however it had already been announced &quot;shortly after&quot; 7 AM (Japanese Standard Time) that Japan had &quot;entered into a situation of war with the United States and Britain in the Western Pacific before dawn&quot;. There was no further elaboration or explanation, and the attacks were already finished by that time. The attack on Pearl Harbor was eventually covered in the Japanese press, but press in wartime Japan was heavily censored. One Japanese newspaper, The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; did report on the attack the day it occurred, and from that point onward their editorials began to back governmental decisions regardless of what they were. The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; also reported the declaration of war on the United States after the attacks, framing it as an Imperial Order, with most Japanese people taking it that way. In contrast, coverage in the &quot;New York Times&quot; focused on &quot;the danger to democracy and to the nation&quot; brought on by the Japanese attack. NHK broadcast twelve special news reports along with its six regularly scheduled ones that day. NHK covered the news of Pearl Harbor and other attacks positively throughout the rest of the month.

=== Coverage elsewhere ===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s BBC broadcast news of the attack and that Manila was also under attack.

==Aftermath==
The day after the attack, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his famous Day of Infamy speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it. Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day.

The United Kingdom had already been at war with Germany since September 1939 and with Italy since June 1940, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had promised to declare war &quot;within the hour&quot; of a Japanese attack on the United States. Upon learning of the Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Churchill promptly determined there was no need to either wait or further consult the US government and immediately summoned the Japanese Ambassador. As a result, the United Kingdom declared war on Japan nine hours before the United States did.

The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot; were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing Churchill later to recollect &quot;In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters, Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked.&quot;

Throughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.

One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau incident) was that Japanese-American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese-American leaders were rounded up and taken to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii. Eventually, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, nearly all who lived on the West Coast, were forced into interior camps, but in Hawaii, where the 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned.

The attack also had international consequences. The Canadian province of British Columbia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese-Canadian descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the government of Canada. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act, allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as prohibiting them from returning to the province. On March 4, regulations under the act were adopted to evacuate Japanese Canadians. As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps, and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies on sugar beet farms.

In the wake of the attack, fifteen Medals of Honor, fifty-one Navy Crosses, fifty-three Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor. Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.

===Niihau Incident===
Japanese planners of the Pearl Harbor attack had determined that some means were required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were damaged too badly to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only thirty minutes by air from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.

During the second wave, a Zero fighter flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of &quot;Hiryu&quot; was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point. The aircraft was further damaged on his crash landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the Native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot&#x27;s pistol, maps, codes and other documents. The island&#x27;s residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed, and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.

The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi&#x27;s assistance was a source of concern for many and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.

===Strategic implications===
Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara summed up the Japanese result by saying, &quot;We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.&quot;

While the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the United States Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon &quot;charging&quot; across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange). The United States instead adopted &quot;Plan Dog&quot; in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the United States concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.

Fortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the Navy was left with no choice but to rely on carriers and submarines. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw in Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a &quot;decisive battle&quot; that never happened.

The Japanese confidence in their ability to win a quick victory meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor&#x27;s navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base and old headquarters building. All of these targets were omitted from Genda&#x27;s list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war effort in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support of the Navy, such as the Doolittle Raid and the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s heavy ships and brought Japan&#x27;s economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the importation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, the amount of raw materials brought in was cut in half, &quot;to a disastrous ten million tons&quot;, while oil &quot;was almost completely stopped&quot;. Lastly, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force&#x27;s success.

===Retrospective debate on American intelligence===
Ever since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics. As early as 1924, Chief of United States Air Service Mason Patrick showed concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent General Billy Mitchell on a survey of the Pacific and the East. Patrick called Mitchell&#x27;s subsequent report, which identified vulnerabilities in Hawaii, a &quot;theoretical treatise on employment of airpower in the Pacific, which, in all probability undoubtedly will be of extreme value some 10 or 15 years hence&quot;.

At least two naval war games, one in 1932 and another in 1936, proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor. The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings have contributed to conspiracy theories. Several writers, including decorated World WarII veteran and journalist Robert Stinnett, author of &quot;Day of Deceit&quot;, and former United States Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, author of &quot;The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor: The Washington Background of the Pearl Harbor Attack&quot;, have argued that various parties high in the American and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the United States into the war via the so-called &quot;back door&quot;. However, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.

The theory that the Americans were warned in advance, however, is supported by statements made by Dick Ellis, a British-Australian intelligence officer for MI6 who helped William J. Donovan set up the Office of Strategic Services. Ellis was deputy to William Stephenson at British Security Co-ordination. In Jesse Fink&#x27;s 2023 biography of Ellis, &quot;The Eagle in the Mirror&quot;, Ellis is quoted as saying: &quot;[Stephenson] was convinced from the information that was reaching him that this attack was imminent, and through Jimmy Roosevelt, President Roosevelt&#x27;s son, he passed this information to the President. Now whether the President at that time had other information which corroborated this... it&#x27;s impossible to say.&quot;

<text>Not invented here (NIH) is the tendency to avoid using or buying products, research, standards, or knowledge from external origins. It is usually adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures. Research illustrates a strong bias against ideas from the outside.

The reasons for not wanting to use the work of others are varied, but can include a desire to support a local economy instead of paying royalties to a foreign license-holder, fear of patent infringement, lack of understanding of the foreign work, an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others, jealousy, belief perseverance, or forming part of a wider . As a social phenomenon, this tendency can manifest itself as an unwillingness to adopt an idea or product because it originates from another culture, a form of tribalism and/or an inadequate effort in choosing the right approach for the business.

The term is typically used in a pejorative sense. The opposite predisposition is sometimes called &quot;proudly found elsewhere&quot; (PFE) or &quot;invented elsewhere&quot;.

== Scientific study ==
A 1982 study by Ralph Katz and Thomas J. Allen provides empirical evidence for the &quot;not invented here&quot; syndrome, showing that the performance of R&amp;D project groups declines after about five years, which they attribute to the groups becoming increasingly insular and communicating less with key information sources outside the group.

<doc id="60107" wikidata="Q3714476" url="?curid=60107" title="Dot matrix">
<text>A dot matrix is a 2-dimensional patterned array, used to represent characters, symbols and images. Most types of modern technology use dot matrices for display of information, including mobile phones, televisions, and printers. The system is also used in textiles with sewing, knitting and weaving.

An alternate form of information display using lines and curves is known as a vector display, was used with early computing devices such as air traffic control radar displays and pen-based plotters but is no longer used. Electronic vector displays were typically monochrome only, and either leave the interiors of closed vector shapes unfilled, or perform slow, time-consuming and often non-uniform shape-filling, as on pen-based plotters.

In printers, the dots are usually the darkened areas of the paper. In displays, the dots may light up, as in an LED, CRT, or plasma display, or darken, as in an LCD.

== Use in computers ==
Although the output of modern computers is generally all in the form of dot matrices (technically speaking), computers may internally store data as either a dot matrix or as a vector pattern of lines and curves. Vector data encoding requires less memory and less data storage, in situations where the shapes may need to be resized, as with font typefaces. For maximum image quality using only dot matrix fonts, it would be necessary to store a separate dot matrix pattern for the many different potential point sizes that might be used. Instead, a single group of vector shapes is used to render all the specific dot matrix patterns needed for the current display or printing task.

===All points addressable===
All points addressable (APA), or pixel addressable, in the context of a dot matrix on a computer monitor or any display device consisting of a pixel array, refers to an arrangement whereby bits or cells can be individually manipulated, as opposed to rewriting the whole array, or regions such as characters, every time a change is needed.

Generally, text modes are not all-points-addressable, whereas graphics modes are. With the advent of more powerful computer graphics hardware, the use and importance of text-only display modes has declined, and with graphics modes it is generally taken for granted that they are all-points-addressable.

== Use in printers ==
The process of doing dot matrix printing can involve dot matrix printers, both for impact and non-impact printers.

Almost all modern computer printers (both impact and non-impact) create their output as matrices of dots, and they may use 
* laser printing 
* inkjet printing
* dot matrix printers

Except for impact dot matrix printers, it is not customary to call the others by that term.

Printers that are not but what &quot;The New York Times&quot; calls a &quot;dot-matrix impact printer&quot; are not called dot matrix printers. Impact printers survive where multi-part forms are needed, as the pins can impress dots through multiple layers of paper to make a carbonless copy, for security purposes.

As an impact printer, the term mainly refers to low-resolution impact printers, with a column of 8, 9 or 24 &quot;pins&quot; hitting an ink-impregnated fabric ribbon, like a typewriter ribbon, onto the paper. It was originally contrasted with both daisy wheel printers and line printers that used fixed-shape embossed metal or plastic stamps to mark paper.

All types of electronic printers typically generate image data as a two-step process. First the information to be printed is converted into a dot matrix using a raster image processor, and the output is a dot matrix referred to as a raster image, which is a complete full-page rendering of the information to be printed. Raster image processing may occur in either the printer itself using a page description language such as Adobe Postscript, or may be performed by printer driver software installed on the user&#x27;s computer.

Early 1980s impact printers used a simple form of internal raster image processing, using low-resolution built-in bitmap fonts to render raw character data sent from the computer, and only capable of storing enough dot matrix data for one printed line at a time. External raster image processing was possible such as to print a graphical image, but was commonly extremely slow and data was sent one line at a time to the impact printer.

Depending on the printer technology the dot size or grid shape may not be uniform. Some printers are capable of producing smaller dots and will intermesh the small dots within the corners larger ones for antialiasing. Some printers have a fixed resolution across the printhead but with much smaller micro-stepping for the mechanical paper feed, resulting in non-uniform dot-overlapping printing resolutions like 600×1200 dpi.

A dot matrix is useful for marking materials other than paper. In manufacturing industry, many product marking applications use dot matrix inkjet or impact methods. This can also be used to print 2D matrix codes, e.g. Datamatrix.

==LED matrix==
An LED matrix or LED display is a large, low-resolution form of dot-matrix display, useful both for industrial and commercial information displays as well as for hobbyist human–machine interfaces. It consists of a 2-D diode matrix with their cathodes joined in rows and their anodes joined in columns (or vice versa). By controlling the flow of electricity through each row and column pair it is possible to control each LED individually. By multiplexing, scanning across rows, quickly flashing the LEDs on and off, it is possible to create characters or pictures to display information to the user.
By varying the pulse rate per LED, the display can approximate levels of brightness. Multi-colored LEDs or RGB-colored LEDs permit use as a full-color image display. The refresh rate is typically fast enough to prevent the human eye from detecting the flicker.

The primary difference between a common LED matrix and an OLED display is the large, low resolution dots. The OLED monitor functionally works the same, except there are many times more dots, and they are all much smaller, allowing for greater detail in the displayed patterns.

<doc id="60108" wikidata="Q14524612" url="?curid=60108" title="Rasterisation">
<text>In computer graphics, rasterisation (British English) or rasterization (American English) is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image (a series of pixels, dots or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes). The rasterized image may then be displayed on a computer display, video display or printer, or stored in a bitmap file format. Rasterization may refer to the technique of drawing 3D models, or to the conversion of 2D rendering primitives, such as polygons and line segments, into a rasterized format.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;rasterisation&quot; comes .

== 2D images ==

=== Line primitives ===

Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm is an example of an algorithm used to rasterize lines.

=== Circle primitives ===
Algorithms such as Midpoint circle algorithm are used to render circle onto a pixelated canvas.

==3D images==
Rasterization is one of the typical techniques of rendering 3D models. Compared with other rendering techniques such as ray tracing, rasterization is extremely fast and therefore used in most realtime 3D engines. However, rasterization is simply the process of computing the mapping from scene geometry to pixels and does not prescribe a particular way to compute the color of those pixels. The specific color of each pixel is assigned by a pixel shader (which in modern GPUs is completely programmable). Shading may take into account physical effects such as light position, their approximations or purely artistic intent.

The process of rasterizing 3D models onto a 2D plane for display on a computer screen (&quot;screen space&quot;) is often carried out by fixed function (non-programmable) hardware within the graphics pipeline. This is because there is no motivation for modifying the techniques for rasterization used at render time and a special-purpose system allows for high efficiency.

=== Triangle rasterization ===

Polygons are a common representation of digital 3D models. Before rasterization, individual polygons are typically broken down into triangles; therefore, a typical problem to solve in 3D rasterization is rasterization of a triangle. Properties that are usually required from triangle rasterization algorithms are that rasterizing two adjacent triangles (i.e. those that share an edge)

# leaves no holes (non-rasterized pixels) between the triangles, so that the rasterized area is completely filled (just as the surface of adjacent triangles). And
# no pixel is rasterized more than once, i.e. the rasterized triangles don&#x27;t overlap. This is to guarantee that the result doesn&#x27;t depend on the order in which the triangles are rasterized. Overdrawing pixels can also mean wasting computing power on pixels that would be overwritten.

This leads to establishing rasterization rules to guarantee the above conditions. One set of such rules is called a top-left rule, which states that a pixel is rasterized if and only if

# its center lies completely inside the triangle. Or
# its center lies exactly on the triangle edge (or multiple edges in case of corners) that is (or, in case of corners, all are) either &quot;top&quot; or &quot;left&quot; edge.

A &quot;top&quot; edge is an edge that is exactly horizontal and lies above other edges, and a &quot;left&quot; edge is a non-horizontal edge that is on the left side of the triangle.

This rule is implemented e.g. by Direct3D and many OpenGL implementations (even though the specification doesn&#x27;t define it and only requires a consistent rule).

== Quality ==

The quality of rasterization can be improved by antialiasing, which creates &quot;smooth&quot; edges. Sub-pixel precision is a method which takes into account positions on a finer scale than the pixel grid and can produce different results even if the endpoints of a primitive fall into same pixel coordinates, producing smoother movement animations. Simple or older hardware, such as PlayStation 1, lacked sub-pixel precision in 3D rasterization.

<text>HP-GL, short for Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language and often written as HPGL, is a printer control language created by Hewlett-Packard (HP). HP-GL was the primary printer control language used by HP plotters. It was introduced with the plotter HP-9872 in 1977 and became a standard for almost all plotters. Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s printers also usually support HP-GL/2 in addition to PCL.

== Design ==
The language is formed from a series of two letter codes (mnemonics), followed by optional parameters. For instance an arc can be drawn on a page by sending the string:

codice_1

This means &quot;Arc Absolute&quot;, and the parameters place the center of the arc at absolute coordinates 100,100 on the page, with a starting angle of 50 degrees measured counter-clockwise. A fourth optional parameter (not used here) specifies how far the arc continues, and defaults to 5 degrees.

When first introduced, HP-GL contained the following commands:

Formats:
* [i]: integer formats between -32767 and 32768. No decimal point.
* [d]: decimal format between +/- 127.9999. Optional decimal point.
* [c]: ASCII character

== Examples ==
Typical HP-GL files start with a few setup commands, followed by a long string of graphics commands. The file was in ASCII (text file) format, for instance:

The coordinate system was based on the smallest units one of the HP plotters could support, and was set to 25 μm (i.e. 40 units per millimeter, 1016 per inch).
The coordinate space was positive or negative floating point numbers, specifically ±230.

== HP-GL/2 ==
The original HP-GL language did not support definition of line width, as this parameter was determined by the pens loaded into the plotter. With the advent of the first inkjet plotters, line width for the &quot;pens&quot; specified within the HP-GL files had to be set at the printer so it would know what line width to print for each pen, a cumbersome and error-prone process. With Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language/2 aka HP-GL/2, definition of line width was introduced into the language and allowed for elimination of this step. Also, among other improvements a binary file format was defined that allowed for smaller files and shorter file transfer times, and the minimal resolution was reduced.

== AGL ==
HP-GL is related to AGL (A Graphics Language), an extension of the BASIC programming language. AGL was implemented on Hewlett-Packard minicomputers to simplify controlling a plotter. AGL commands describe the desired graphics plotting function, which the computer relays as several HP-GL instructions to the plotter.

<doc id="60112" wikidata="Q173034" url="?curid=60112" title="Battle of Midway">
<text>The Battle of Midway was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4–7 June 1942, six months after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea. The Japanese Combined Fleet under the command of Isoroku Yamamoto suffered a decisive defeat by the U.S. Pacific Fleet near Midway Atoll, about northwest of Oahu. Yamamoto had intended to capture Midway and lure out and destroy the Pacific Fleet, especially the U.S. aircraft carriers which had escaped damage at Pearl Harbor.

Before the battle, Japan desired to extend its Pacific defense perimeter, especially after the Doolittle air raid of Tokyo in April 1942, and to clear the seas for attacks on Midway, Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii. A related Japanese attack on the Aleutian Islands began one day earlier, on 3 June. The Japanese strike force at Midway, known as the &quot;Kidō Butai,&quot; was commanded by Chuichi Nagumo. Yamamoto&#x27;s plan for the operation, which depended on precise timing and coordination, was undermined by its wide dispersal of forces, which left the rest of the fleet unable to support the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; effectively.

On 4 June, the Japanese began bombing Midway and prepared to wait for the Pacific Fleet to arrive from Pearl Harbor to defend the island. Unknown to Yamamoto, U.S. code breakers had determined the date and location of his planned attack, enabling the Americans to prepare their own ambush; Chester Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet, had sent a large force under Frank Jack Fletcher to the Midway area before the Japanese had arrived. Land-based planes from Midway and carrier-based planes from the U.S. fleet surprised and attacked Nagumo&#x27;s force. All four Japanese fleet carriers—, , , and —present at the battle were sunk, as was the heavy cruiser . Japan also lost 3,000 men, including many well-trained and difficult-to-replace pilots. The U.S. lost the carrier and the destroyer , while the carriers and (under the command of Raymond Spruance during the battle) survived the fighting without damage.

The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal campaign, is widely considered a turning point in the Pacific War. After Midway and the attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan&#x27;s ability to replace its losses in materiel and trained men became rapidly insufficient, while the U.S.&#x27;s massive industrial and training capabilities increased over time. Historian John Keegan called the battle &quot;the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare&quot;, while historian Craig Symonds called it &quot;one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history, ranking alongside Salamis, Trafalgar, and Tsushima Strait, as both tactically decisive and strategically influential.&quot;

==Background==
After expanding the war in the Pacific to include western colonies, the Japanese Empire quickly attained its initial strategic goals of British Hong Kong, the Philippines, British Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies, the latter of whose oil resources were particularly important to Japan. Because of this, preliminary planning for the second phase of operations commenced as early as January 1942.

Because of strategic disagreements between the Imperial Army (IJA) and Imperial Navy (IJN), and infighting between the Navy&#x27;s Imperial General Headquarters and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s Combined Fleet, a follow-up strategy was not formed until April 1942. Yamamoto finally won the bureaucratic struggle with a thinly veiled threat to resign, after which his plan was adopted. Yamamoto&#x27;s primary strategic goal was the elimination of America&#x27;s carrier forces, which he regarded as the principal threat to the overall Pacific campaign. This concern was acutely heightened by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, in which 16 United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities. The raid, while militarily insignificant, was a shock to the Japanese and highlighted a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home islands as well as the vulnerability of Japanese territory to American bombers.

This, and other successful hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed that they were still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on Naval Station Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based airpower on the Hawaiian Islands since the 7 December 1941 attack, he judged that it was too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.

Instead, Yamamoto selected Midway, a tiny atoll at the extreme northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain, approximately from Oahu. Midway was outside the effective range of almost all the American aircraft stationed on the main Hawaiian Islands. It was not especially important in the larger scheme of Japan&#x27;s intentions, but the Japanese felt the Americans would consider Midway a vital outpost of Pearl Harbor and would be compelled to defend it vigorously. The U.S. did consider Midway vital: after the battle, the establishment of a U.S. submarine base on Naval Air Facility Midway Island allowed submarines operating from Pearl Harbor to refuel and re-provision, extending their radius of operations by . In addition to serving as a seaplane base, Midway&#x27;s airstrips were a forward staging point for bomber attacks on Wake Island.

===Yamamoto&#x27;s plan===
Typical of Japanese naval planning during World War II, Yamamoto&#x27;s battle plan for taking Midway (named Operation MI) was exceedingly complex. It required the careful coordination of multiple battle groups over hundreds of miles of open sea. His design was also predicated on optimistic intelligence suggesting that and USS &quot;Hornet&quot;, forming Task Force 16, were the only carriers available to the Pacific Fleet. During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, had been sunk and suffered so much damage that the Japanese believed she too had been lost. However, following hasty repairs at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sortied and ultimately played a critical role in the discovery and eventual destruction of the Japanese fleet carriers at Midway. Finally, much of Yamamoto&#x27;s planning, coinciding with the general feeling among the Japanese leadership at the time, was based on a gross misjudgment of American morale which was believed to be debilitated from the string of Japanese victories in the preceding months.

Yamamoto felt deception would be required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation. To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his battleships) would be concealed from the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto&#x27;s supporting battleships and cruisers trailed Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s carrier force by several hundred miles. They were intended to come up and destroy whatever elements of the American fleet might come to Midway&#x27;s defense once Nagumo&#x27;s carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun battle. This tactic was doctrine in most major navies of the time.

What Yamamoto did not know was that the U.S. had broken parts of the main Japanese naval code (dubbed JN-25 by the Americans), divulging many details of his plan. His emphasis on dispersal also meant none of his formations were in a position to support the others. For instance, although Nagumo&#x27;s carriers were expected to carry out strikes against Midway and bear the brunt of American counterattacks, the only warships in his fleet larger than the screening force of twelve destroyers were two fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser. By contrast, Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, four heavy cruisers, and two light cruisers, none of which saw action at Midway.

The light carriers of the trailing forces and Yamamoto&#x27;s three battleships were unable to keep pace with the carriers of the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; (機動部隊, &quot;Mobile Strike Force&quot;) and so could not sail in company with them. The &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; would sail into range at best speed so as to increase the chance of surprise and would not have ships spread out across the ocean guiding the USN toward it. If the other parts of the invasion force needed more defense, the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; would make best speed to defend them. Hence the slower ships could not be with the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot;. The distance between Yamamoto and Kondo&#x27;s forces and Nagumo&#x27;s carriers had grave implications during the battle. The invaluable reconnaissance capability of the scout planes carried by the cruisers and carriers, and the additional anti-aircraft capability of the cruisers and the other two battleships of the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class in the trailing forces, were unavailable to help Nagumo.

===Aleutian invasion===

To obtain support from the IJA for the Midway operation, the IJN agreed to support their invasion of the United States through the Aleutian Islands of Attu and Kiska, part of the Alaska Territory. The IJA occupied these islands to place the Japanese home islands out of range of U.S. land-based bombers in Alaska. Most Americans feared that the occupied islands would be used as bases for Japanese bombers to attack strategic targets and population centers along the U.S. West Coast.

The Japanese operations in the Aleutians (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, according to the original Japanese battle plan, AL was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo&#x27;s task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.

==Prelude==
===American reinforcements===
To do battle with the IJN, expected to muster four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available flight deck. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s two-carrier (&quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;) task force at hand, though Halsey was stricken with shingles and had to be replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Halsey&#x27;s escort commander. Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher&#x27;s task force, including the carrier &quot;Yorktown&quot;, from the South West Pacific Area.

Despite estimates that &quot;Yorktown&quot;, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require several months of repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough for two or three weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s partially depleted air group was rebuilt using whatever planes and pilots could be found. Scouting Five (VS-5) was replaced with Bombing Three (VB-3) from . Torpedo Five (VT-5) was replaced by Torpedo Three (VT-3). Fighting Three (VF-3) was reconstituted to replace VF-42 with sixteen pilots from VF-42 and eleven pilots from VF-3, with Lieutenant Commander John Thach in command. Some of the aircrew were inexperienced, which may have contributed to an accident in which Thach&#x27;s executive officer Lieutenant Commander Donald Lovelace was killed. Despite efforts to get &quot;Saratoga&quot; (which had been undergoing repairs on the American West Coast) ready, the need to resupply and assemble sufficient escorts meant she was unable to reach Midway until after the battle.

On Midway, the U.S. Navy had by 4 June stationed four squadrons of PBYs—31 aircraft in total—for long-range reconnaissance duties, and six brand-new Grumman TBF Avengers from &quot;Hornet&quot;″s VT-8. The Marine Corps stationed 19 Douglas SBD Dauntless, seven F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A Buffalos. The USAAF contributed a squadron of 17 B-17 Flying Fortresses and four Martin B-26 Marauders equipped with torpedoes: in total 122 aircraft. Although the F2As and SB2Us were already obsolete, they were the only aircraft available to the Marine Corps at the time.

===Japanese shortcomings===
During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, the Japanese light carrier had been sunk, while the fleet carrier had been severely damaged and was in drydock for months of repair. Although the fleet carrier escaped the battle undamaged, she had lost almost half her air group and was in port at the Kure Naval District in Hiroshima, awaiting replacement planes and pilots. That there were none immediately available can be attributed to the growing inability of the IJN to properly train pilots faster than they were killed in action. In desperation, instructors from the Yokosuka Air Corps were relieved of their duties to plug the gap.

Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully believe that by combining the surviving aircraft and pilots from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; likely could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They note, however, that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their air groups must train as a single unit. (In contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers allowing for more flexibility.) The Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get &quot;Zuikaku&quot; ready for the forthcoming battle.

Thus, Carrier Division 5, consisting of the two most advanced aircraft carriers of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, was not available which meant that Vice-Admiral Nagumo had only two-thirds of the fleet carriers at his disposal: and forming Carrier Division 1 and and making up Carrier Division 2. This was partly due to fatigue; Japanese carriers had been constantly on operations since 7 December 1941 including raids on Darwin and Colombo. Nonetheless, the First Carrier Strike Force sailed with 248 available aircraft on the four carriers (60 on &quot;Akagi&quot;, 74 on &quot;Kaga&quot; (B5N2 squadron oversized), 57 on &quot;Hiryū&quot; and 57 on &quot;Sōryū&quot;).

The main Japanese carrier-borne strike aircraft were the Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bomber and the Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot;, which was used either as a torpedo bomber or as a level bomber. The main carrier fighter was the fast and highly maneuverable Mitsubishi A6M Zero. For a variety of reasons, production of the &quot;Val&quot; had been drastically reduced, while that of the &quot;Kate&quot; had been stopped completely and, as a consequence, there were none available to replace losses. In addition, many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operational since late November 1941 and, although they were well-maintained, many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant all carriers of the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; had fewer aircraft than their normal complement, with few spare aircraft or parts in the carriers&#x27; hangars.

In addition, Nagumo&#x27;s carrier force suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in Mark Peattie&#x27;s words, a &#x27;: it could throw a punch but couldn&#x27;t take one.&quot; Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration change deficiencies which limited their effectiveness. The IJN&#x27;s fleet combat air patrol (CAP) had too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of radar. Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control. The carriers&#x27; escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range, not as close anti-aircraft escorts, as they lacked training, doctrine, and sufficient anti-aircraft guns.

Japanese strategic scouting arrangements prior to the battle were also in disarray. A picket line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto&#x27;s haste), which let the American carriers reach their assembly point northeast of Midway (known as &quot;Point Luck&quot;) without being detected. A second attempt at reconnaissance, using four-engine H8K &quot;Emily&quot; flying boats to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle and detect whether the American carriers were present, part of Operation K, was thwarted when Japanese submarines assigned to refuel the search aircraft discovered that the intended refueling point—a hitherto deserted bay off French Frigate Shoals—was occupied by American warships because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March. Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers immediately before the battle.

Japanese radio intercepts did notice an increase in American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto&#x27;s hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans were not changed; Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo and did not communicate with him by radio, so as not to reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons that remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.

===U.S. code-breaking===
Nimitz had one critical advantage: U.S. cryptanalysts had partially broken the Japanese Navy&#x27;s JN-25b code. Since early 1942, the U.S. had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective &quot;AF.&quot; It was initially not known where &quot;AF&quot; was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea communications cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway&#x27;s water purification system had broken down. Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that &quot;AF was short on water.&quot; No Japanese radio operators who intercepted the message seemed concerned that the Americans were broadcasting uncoded that a major naval installation close to the Japanese was having a water shortage, which Japanese intelligence might have suspected as deception. HYPO was also able to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June, and to provide Nimitz with a complete IJN order of battle.

Japan had a new codebook, but its introduction had been delayed, enabling HYPO to read messages for several crucial days; the new code, which took several days to be cracked, came into use on 24 May, but the important breaks had already been made. As a result, the Americans entered the battle with a good picture of where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, so widely separated that they were essentially unable to support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, thus reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto&#x27;s four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained largely unaware of their opponent&#x27;s true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.

==Battle==

===Initial air attacks===
At about 09:00 on 3 June, Ensign Jack Reid, piloting a PBY from U.S. Navy patrol squadron VP-44, spotted the Japanese Occupation Force to the west-southwest of Midway. He mistakenly reported this group as the Main Force. Nine B-17s took off from Midway at 12:30 for the first air attack. Three hours later, they found Tanaka&#x27;s transport group to the west.

Harassed by heavy anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs. Although their crews reported hitting four ships, none were actually hit and no significant damage was inflicted. Early the following morning, the Japanese oil tanker &quot;Akebono Maru&quot; sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking PBY struck her around 01:00. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the battle.

At 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his initial attack on Midway, consisting of 36 D3As and 36 B5Ns, escorted by 36 Zero fighters. At the same time, he launched his seven search aircraft (2 B5Ns from &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Kaga;&quot; 4 Aichi E13A &quot;Jakes&quot; from the heavy cruiser &quot;&quot; and &quot;Chikuma;&quot; and 1 short-range Nakajima E8N &quot;Dave&quot; from the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot;; an eighth aircraft from launched 30 minutes late). Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force. As Nagumo&#x27;s bombers and fighters were taking off, 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to run their search patterns. At 05:34, a PBY reported sighting two Japanese carriers; another spotted the inbound airstrike 10 minutes later.

Midway&#x27;s radar picked up the Japanese at a distance of several miles, and interceptors were scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carriers, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway. At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighters led by Major Floyd B. Parks, which included six F4Fs and twenty F2As, intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they destroyed four B5Ns and one Zero. Within the first few minutes, two F4Fs and thirteen F2As were destroyed, while most of the surviving U.S. planes were damaged, with only two remaining airworthy. American anti-aircraft fire was intense and accurate, destroying three Japanese aircraft and damaging many more.

Of the 108 Japanese aircraft that participated in this attack, 11 were destroyed (including 3 that ditched), 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. 140 more were available to the Japanese, but never launched, and were destroyed when their carriers sunk. The initial Japanese attack did not succeed in neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese, and most of Midway&#x27;s land-based defenses remained intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway&#x27;s defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.

Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier force. These included six Grumman Avengers, detached to Midway from &quot;Hornet&quot;″s VT-8 (Midway was the combat debut of both VT-8 and the Avenger); Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of 11 SB2U-3s and 16 SBDs, plus four USAAF B-26s of the 18th Reconnaissance and 69th Bomb Squadrons armed with torpedoes, and 15 B-17s of the 31st, 72nd, and 431st Bomb Squadrons. The Japanese repelled these attacks, losing only three Zero fighters while destroying five Avengers, two SB2Us, eight SBDs, and two B-26s. Among the dead was Major Lofton R. Henderson of VMSB-241, killed while leading his inexperienced SBD squadron into action. The main airfield at Guadalcanal was named after him in August 1942.

One B-26, piloted by Lieutenant James Muri, after dropping his torpedo and searching for an escape route, flew directly down the length of &quot;Akagi&quot; while being fired upon by fighters and anti-aircraft fire, which had to hold their fire to avoid hitting their own flagship; the B-26 strafed &quot;Akagi&quot;, killing two men. Another B-26, piloted by Lieutenant Herbert Mayes, did not pull out of its run after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and instead flew directly at &quot;Akagi&quot;″s bridge. Either attempting a suicide ramming or out of control, the plane narrowly missed striking the bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his staff, crashing into the ocean. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo&#x27;s determination to launch another attack on Midway in direct violation of Yamamoto&#x27;s order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.

While the air strikes from Midway were happening, American submarine , commanded by Lieutenant Commander William Brockman, approached the Japanese fleet, attracting attention from the escorts. Around 08:20, she made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on a battleship and then dived to evade escorts. At 09:10, she launched a torpedo at a cruiser and again dived to evade escorts, with destroyer &quot;Arashi&quot; spending considerable time chasing &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

===Nagumo&#x27;s dilemma===
In accordance with Yamamoto&#x27;s orders for Operation MI, Nagumo had kept half of his aircraft in reserve, comprising two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The dive bombers were as yet unarmed (this was doctrinal: dive bombers were to be armed on the flight deck). The torpedo bombers were armed with torpedoes should any American warships be located.

At 07:15, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with contact-fused general-purpose bombs for use against land targets. This was a result of the attacks from Midway, as well as the morning flight leader&#x27;s recommendation of a second strike. Re-arming had been underway for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed scout plane from &quot;Tone&quot; signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to specify its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.

Nagumo quickly reversed his order to re-arm the bombers and demanded that the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 20–40 minutes elapsed before &quot;Tone&quot;″s scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.

Nagumo was now in a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (&quot;Hiryū&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;), recommended that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 16 D3A1 dive bombers on &quot;Sōryū&quot; and 18 on &quot;Hiryū&quot;, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo&#x27;s opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or it would have to ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position (&quot;spot&quot;) their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.

The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of &quot;Sōryū&quot;, fighters being spotted to augment the combat air patrol. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserves to battle without proper anti-ship armament, and likely without fighter escort; he had just witnessed how easily the unescorted American bombers had been shot down.

Japanese naval doctrine preferred the launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo&#x27;s reaction was doctrinaire. The arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave weight to the need to attack the island again. Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, and &quot;then&quot; launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.

Had Nagumo instead launched the available aircraft around 07:45 and risked the ditching of Tomonaga&#x27;s aircraft, they would have formed a powerful and well-balanced force with the potential to sink two American carriers. Furthermore, fueled and armed aircraft inside the ships presented a significant additional hazard for damage to the carriers in an event of attack, and keeping them on the decks was much more dangerous than getting them airborne. Whatever the case, at that point there was no way to stop the American strike against him, since Fletcher&#x27;s carriers had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; having completed launching by 07:55, but &quot;Yorktown&quot; not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, he could not have prevented the launch of the American attack.

===Attacks on the Japanese fleet===
The Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Fletcher, in overall command aboard &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and benefiting from PBY sighting reports from the early morning, ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical, while initially holding &quot;Yorktown&quot; in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found.

Spruance judged that, though the range was extreme, a strike could succeed and gave the order to launch the attack. He left Halsey&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Captain Miles Browning, to work out the details and oversee the launch. The carriers had to launch into the wind, so the light southeasterly breeze would require them to steam away from the Japanese at high speed. Browning, therefore, suggested a launch time of 07:00, giving the carriers an hour to close on the Japanese at . This would place them at about from the Japanese fleet, assuming it did not change course. The first plane took off from Spruance&#x27;s carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; a few minutes after 07:00. Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights, followed suit at 08:00 from &quot;Yorktown&quot;.

Fletcher, along with &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired the first-hand experience needed in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy force in the Coral Sea, but there was no time to pass these lessons on to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, commanded by Captain George Murray, and &quot;Hornet&quot;, commanded by Captain Marc Mitscher, which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately rather than waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing the Japanese carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.

While the Japanese were able to launch 108 aircraft in just seven minutes, it took &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; over an hour to launch 117. Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the Japanese as soon as possible was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.

American carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target, despite the positions they had been given. The strike from &quot;Hornet&quot;, led by Commander Stanhope C. Ring, followed an incorrect heading of 265 degrees rather than the 240 degrees indicated by the contact report. As a result, Air Group Eight&#x27;s dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers: the 10 F4Fs from &quot;Hornet&quot; ran out of fuel and had to ditch. Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from &quot;Hornet&quot;), led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, broke formation from Ring and followed the correct heading.
Waldron&#x27;s squadron sighted the Japanese carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed at 09:40 by VF-6 from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, whose Wildcat fighter escorts lost contact, ran low on fuel, and had to turn back. Without fighter escort, all 15 TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down without being able to inflict any damage. Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. He launched his torpedo on &quot;Sōryū&quot; before he was shot down, but &quot;Sōryū&quot; evaded it. VT-6, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey lost 9 of its 14 Devastators (one ditched later), and 10 of 12 Devastators from &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s VT-3 (who attacked at 10:10) were shot down with no hits to show for their effort, thanks in part to the abysmal performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes. Midway was the last time the TBD Devastator was used in combat.

The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Zeros, made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes—close enough to be able to strafe the Japanese ships and force their carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. The performance of American torpedoes early in the war was extremely poor, as shot after shot missed by running directly under the target (deeper than intended), prematurely exploded, or failed to explode at all. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results.

Despite their failure to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks achieved three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese CAP meant they were out of position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, led by Lieutenant Commander Lance Edward Massey at 10:00 quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline and the employment of a greater number of Zeros for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.

By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, three squadrons of SBDs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; were approaching from the southwest and northeast. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; squadron (VB-3) had flown just behind VT-3 but elected to attack from a different course. The two squadrons from &quot;Enterprise&quot; (VB-6 and VS-6) were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the Japanese ships. Air Group Commander C. Wade McClusky, Jr. decided to continue the search and by good fortune spotted the wake of the Japanese destroyer , steaming at full speed to rejoin Nagumo&#x27;s carriers after having unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine , which had unsuccessfully attacked the battleship . Some bombers were lost from fuel exhaustion before the attack commenced.

McClusky&#x27;s decision to continue the search and his judgment, in the opinion of Admiral Chester Nimitz, &quot;decided the fate of our carrier task force and our forces at Midway ...&quot; All three American dive-bomber squadrons (VB-6, VS-6, and VB-3) arrived almost simultaneously at the perfect time, locations and altitudes to attack. Most of the Japanese CAP was directing its attention to the torpedo planes of VT-3 and was out of position; meanwhile, armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, fuel hoses snaked across the decks as refueling operations were hastily being completed, and the repeated change of ordnance meant that bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars, rather than stowed safely in the magazines, making the Japanese carriers extraordinarily vulnerable.

====Destruction of &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;====
Beginning at 10:22, the two squadrons of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s air group split up with the intention of sending one squadron each to attack &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;. A miscommunication caused both of the squadrons to dive at &quot;Kaga&quot;. Recognizing the error, Lieutenant Richard Halsey Best and his two wingmen were able to pull out of their dives and, after judging that &quot;Kaga&quot; was doomed, headed north to attack &quot;Akagi&quot;. Coming under an onslaught of bombs from almost two full squadrons, &quot;Kaga&quot; sustained three to five direct hits, which caused heavy damage and started multiple fires. One of the bombs landed on or right in front of the bridge, killing Captain Jisaku Okada and most of the ship&#x27;s senior officers. Lieutenant Clarence E. Dickinson, part of McClusky&#x27;s group, recalled:

Several minutes later, Best and his two wingmen dived on &quot;Akagi&quot;. Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese aviator who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor, was on &quot;Akagi&quot; when it was hit, and described the attack:

Although &quot;Akagi&quot; sustained only one direct hit (almost certainly dropped by Lieutenant Best), it proved to be a fatal blow: the bomb struck the edge of the mid-ship deck elevator and penetrated to the upper hangar deck, where it exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft in the vicinity. Nagumo&#x27;s chief of staff, Ryūnosuke Kusaka, recorded &quot;a terrific fire ... bodies all over the place ... Planes stood tail up, belching livid flames and jet-black smoke, making it impossible to bring the fires under control.&quot; Another bomb exploded underwater very close astern; the resulting geyser bent the flight deck upward &quot;in grotesque configurations&quot; and caused crucial rudder damage.

Simultaneously, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s VB-3, commanded by Lieutenant Max Leslie, went for &quot;Sōryū&quot;, scoring at least three hits and causing extensive damage. Gasoline ignited, creating an inferno, while stacked bombs and ammunition detonated. VT-3 targeted &quot;Hiryū&quot;, which was hemmed in by &quot;Sōryū&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot;, and &quot;Akagi&quot;, but achieved no hits.

Within six minutes, &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were ablaze from stem to stern. &quot;Akagi&quot;, having been struck by only one bomb, took longer to burn, but the resulting fires quickly expanded and proved impossible to extinguish; she too was eventually consumed by flames and had to be abandoned. Although Nagumo was reluctant to leave &quot;Akagi&quot;, Kusaka was able to persuade him. At 10:46, Nagumo transferred his flag to the light cruiser . All three carriers remained temporarily afloat, as none had suffered damage below the waterline, other than the rudder damage to &quot;Akagi&quot; caused by the near miss close astern. Despite initial hopes that &quot;Akagi&quot; could be saved or at least towed back to Japan, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and scuttled. While &quot;Kaga&quot; was burning, &quot;Nautilus&quot; showed up again and launched three torpedoes at her, scoring one dud hit. The &quot;Kaga&quot; was later sunk by the Japanese destroyer &quot;Hagikaze&quot;.

===Japanese counterattacks===

&quot;Hiryū&quot;, the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s first attack wave, consisting of 18 D3As and 6 Zeros, followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the first carrier they encountered, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, hitting her with three bombs, which blew a hole in the deck, snuffed out all but one of her boilers, and destroyed one anti-aircraft mount. The damage forced Fletcher to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser . Damage control parties were able to temporarily patch the flight deck and restore power to several boilers within an hour, giving her a speed of and enabling her to resume air operations. &quot;Yorktown&quot; hoisted a flag signal to indicate a speed of 5 knots. Captain Buckmaster had his signalmen hoist a new 10-by-15-foot American flag from the foremast. Thirteen D3As and three Zeros were lost in this attack (two Zeros turned back early after they were damaged attacking some of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s SBDs returning from their attack on the Japanese carriers).

Approximately one hour later, &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s second attack wave, consisting of ten B5Ns and six escorting Zeros, arrived over &quot;Yorktown&quot;; the repair efforts had been so effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that &quot;Yorktown&quot; must be a different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling &quot;Yorktown&quot; with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five B5Ns and two Zeros were shot down in this attack.

News of the two strikes, with the mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly improved Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard &quot;Hiryū&quot;. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese believed that they could scrape together enough aircraft for one more strike against what they believed to be the only remaining American carrier.

===American counterattack===
Late in the afternoon, a &quot;Yorktown&quot; scout aircraft located &quot;Hiryū&quot;, prompting &quot;Enterprise&quot; to launch a final strike of 24 dive bombers (six SBDs from VS-6, four SBDs from VB-6, and 14 SBDs from &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s VB-3). Despite &quot;Hiryū&quot; being defended by more than a dozen Zero fighters, the attack by &quot;Enterprise&quot; and orphaned &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft launched from &quot;Enterprise&quot; was successful: four bombs (possibly five) hit &quot;Hiryū&quot;, leaving her ablaze and unable to operate aircraft. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s strike, launched late because of a communications error, concentrated on the remaining escort ships but failed to score any hits. A bomb from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bomber piloted by Dusty Kleiss struck &quot;Hiryū&quot; on the bow, essentially crippling her.

After futile attempts at controlling the blaze, most of the crew on &quot;Hiryū&quot; were evacuated, and the remainder of the fleet continued sailing northeast in an attempt to intercept the American carriers. Despite a scuttling attempt by a Japanese destroyer that hit her with a torpedo and then departed quickly, &quot;Hiryū&quot; stayed afloat for several more hours. She was discovered early the next morning by an aircraft from the escort carrier , prompting hopes she could be saved or towed back to Japan. Soon after being spotted, &quot;Hiryū&quot; sank. Yamaguchi, along with ship&#x27;s captain, , chose to go down with the ship, costing Japan perhaps its best carrier officer. One young sailor reportedly tried to stay with the officers but was denied.

As darkness fell, both sides made tentative plans for continuing the action. Fletcher, obliged to abandon the derelict &quot;Yorktown&quot; and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the U.S. had won a great victory, but he was unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.

Finally, fearing a possible night encounter with Japanese surface forces and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade (based in part on a misleading contact report from the submarine ) Spruance changed course and withdrew to the east, turning back west towards the Japanese at midnight. For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the engagement and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, he detached a cruiser raiding force to bombard the island. The Japanese surface forces failed to make contact with the Americans because Spruance had briefly withdrawn eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a general withdrawal to the west. It was fortunate for the U.S. that Spruance did not pursue: had he come in contact with Yamamoto&#x27;s heavy ships, including , in the dark, considering the Japanese Navy&#x27;s superiority in night-attack tactics at the time, there is a very high probability his cruisers would have been overwhelmed and his carriers sunk.

Spruance failed to reestablish contact with Yamamoto&#x27;s forces on 5 June, despite extensive searches. Towards the end of the day, he launched a search-and-destroy mission to seek out any remnants of Nagumo&#x27;s carrier force. This late afternoon strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto&#x27;s main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall, prompting Spruance to order &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; to turn on their lights to aid the landings.

At 02:15 on 5 June Commander John Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Tambor&quot;, lying west of Midway, made the second of the submarine force&#x27;s two major contributions to the battle&#x27;s outcome, although its impact was heavily blunted by Murphy. Sighting several ships, neither Murphy nor his executive officer, Edward Spruance (son of Admiral Spruance), could identify them. Uncertain of whether they were friendly and unwilling to approach any closer to verify their heading or type, Murphy decided to send a vague report of &quot;four large ships&quot; to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. This report was passed on by English to Nimitz, who then sent it to Spruance. Spruance, a former submarine commander, was &quot;understandably furious&quot; at the vagueness of Murphy&#x27;s report, as it provided him with little more than suspicion and no concrete information on which to make his preparations. Unaware of the exact location of Yamamoto&#x27;s &quot;Main Body&quot; (a persistent problem since the time PBYs had first sighted the Japanese), Spruance was forced to assume the &quot;four large ships&quot; reported by &quot;Tambor&quot; represented the main invasion force and so he moved to block it, while staying northeast of Midway.

In reality, the ships sighted by &quot;Tambor&quot; were the detachment of four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bombard Midway. At 02:55 these ships received Yamamoto&#x27;s order to retire and changed course to comply. At about the same time as this change of course, &quot;Tambor&quot; was sighted and during maneuvers designed to avoid a submarine attack, the heavy cruisers and collided, inflicting serious damage on &quot;Mogami&quot;″s bow. The less severely damaged &quot;Mikuma&quot; slowed to to keep pace. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous and he dived to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful, and around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound s before diving again and playing no further role in the battle. Limping along on a straight course at 12 knots—roughly one-third their top speed—&quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot; had been almost perfect targets for a submarine attack. As soon as &quot;Tambor&quot; returned to port, Spruance had Murphy relieved of duty and reassigned to a shore station, citing his confusing contact report, poor torpedo shooting during his attack run, and general lack of aggression, especially as compared to &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the oldest of the 12 boats at Midway and the only one which had successfully placed a torpedo on target (albeit a dud).
Over the next two days, several strikes were launched against the stragglers, first from Midway, then from Spruance&#x27;s carriers. &quot;Mikuma&quot; was eventually sunk by Dauntlesses, while &quot;Mogami&quot; survived further severe damage to return home for repairs. The destroyers and were also bombed and strafed during the last of these attacks. Captain Richard E. Fleming, a U.S. Marine Corps aviator, was killed while executing a glide bomb run on &quot;Mikuma&quot; and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Meanwhile, salvage efforts on &quot;Yorktown&quot; were encouraging, and she was taken in tow by fleet tug . In the late afternoon of 6 June the , which had managed to slip through the cordon of destroyers (possibly because of the large amount of debris in the water), fired a salvo of torpedoes, two of which struck &quot;Yorktown&quot;. There were few casualties aboard since most of the crew had already been evacuated, but a third torpedo from this salvo struck the destroyer , which had been providing auxiliary power to &quot;Yorktown&quot;. &quot;Hammann&quot; broke in two and sank with the loss of 80 lives, mostly because her own depth charges exploded. With further salvage efforts deemed hopeless, the remaining repair crews were evacuated from &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Throughout the night of 6 June and into the morning of 7 June, &quot;Yorktown&quot; remained afloat, but by 05:30 on 7 June, her list rapidly increased to port. Shortly afterward, the ship turned onto her port side. At 07:01, &quot;Yorktown&quot; capsized and sank.

===Japanese and U.S. casualties===
SBD pilot Norman &quot;Dusty&quot; Kleiss, who scored three hits on Japanese ships during the Battle of Midway (aircraft carriers &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Hiryū&quot; and heavy cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot;), wrote: &quot;From the experience in the Marshalls, at Wake and at Marcus, I thought our fleet learned its lessons. We could not send TBDs into action unless they had adequate smoke protection and torpedoes that exploded more than 10 percent of the time.&quot;

By the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. Casualties aboard the four carriers were: &quot;Akagi&quot;: 267; &quot;Kaga&quot;: 811; &quot;Hiryū&quot;: 392 (including Yamaguchi who chose to go down with his ship); &quot;Soryū&quot;: 711 (including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board); a total of 2,181. The heavy cruisers &quot;Mikuma&quot; (sunk; 700 casualties) and &quot;Mogami&quot; (badly damaged; 92) accounted for another 792 deaths.

In addition, the destroyers &quot;Arashio&quot; (bombed; 35) and &quot;Asashio&quot; (strafed by aircraft; 21) were both damaged during the air attacks which sank &quot;Mikuma&quot; and caused further damage to &quot;Mogami&quot;. Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers &quot;Chikuma&quot; (3) and &quot;Tone&quot; (2). Dead aboard the destroyers &quot;Tanikaze&quot; (11), &quot;Arashi&quot; (1), &quot;Kazagumo&quot; (1) and the fleet oiler &quot;Akebono Maru&quot; (10) made up the remaining 23 casualties.

At the end of the battle, the U.S. lost the carrier &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Hammann&quot;. 307 Americans had been killed, including Major General Clarence L. Tinker, Commander, 7th Air Force, who personally led a bomber strike from Hawaii against the retreating Japanese forces on 7 June. He was killed when his aircraft crashed near Midway Island.

==Aftermath==
After winning a clear victory, and as pursuit became too hazardous near Wake Island, American forces retired. Spruance again withdrew to the east to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot;, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to &quot;Saratoga&quot; on the afternoon of 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and the next, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area, and the American carriers returned to Pearl Harbor.

Historian Samuel E. Morison noted in 1949 that Spruance was criticized for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, he would have been unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto&#x27;s powerful surface units, including &quot;Yamato&quot;. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch them during the daytime. Also, Spruance&#x27;s destroyers were critically low on fuel.

On 10 June the Imperial Japanese Navy conveyed to the military liaison conference an incomplete picture of the results of the battle. Nagumo&#x27;s detailed battle report was submitted to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest echelons in the Japanese Navy and government and was guarded closely throughout the war. In it, one of the more striking revelations is the comment on Mobile Force Commander Nagumo&#x27;s estimates: &quot;The enemy is not aware of our plans (we were not discovered until early in the morning of the 5th at the earliest).&quot; In reality, the whole operation had been compromised from the beginning by American code-breaking efforts.

The Japanese public and much of the military command structure were kept in the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command staff were accurately informed of the carrier and personnel losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.

On the return of the Japanese fleet to Hashirajima on 14 June the wounded were immediately transferred to naval hospitals; most were classified as &quot;secret patients&quot;, placed in isolation wards and quarantined from other patients and their own families to keep this major defeat secret. The remaining officers and men were quickly dispersed to other units of the fleet and, without being allowed to see family or friends, were shipped to units in the South Pacific, where the majority died in battle. None of the flag officers or staff of the Combined Fleet were penalized, and Nagumo was later placed in command of the rebuilt carrier force. A possible reason Nagumo was not relieved of command was that he reported two American carriers had been sunk; not one actually sunk.

As a result of the defeat, new procedures were adopted whereby more Japanese aircraft were refueled and re-armed on the flight deck rather than in the hangars, and the practice of draining all unused fuel lines was adopted. The new carriers being built were redesigned to incorporate only two flight deck elevators and new firefighting equipment. More carrier crew members were trained in damage-control and firefighting techniques, although the losses of the &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, &#x27;, and especially &#x27; later in the war suggest that there were still problems in this area.

Japanese replacement pilots were pushed through an abbreviated training regimen to meet the short-term needs of the fleet, leading to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.

===American prisoners===
Three U.S. aviators were captured during the battle: Ensign Wesley Osmus, a pilot from &quot;Yorktown&quot;; Ensign Frank O&#x27;Flaherty, a pilot from &quot;Enterprise&quot;; and Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate Bruno Peter Gaido, O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s radioman-gunner. Osmus was held on &quot;Arashi&quot;; O&#x27;Flaherty and Gaido on the cruiser &quot;Nagara&quot; (or destroyer &quot;Makigumo&quot;, sources vary); O&#x27;Flaherty and Gaido were interrogated and then tied to water-filled kerosene cans and thrown overboard to drown. Osmus was slated for the same fate; however, he resisted and was murdered on the &quot;Arashi&quot; with a fire axe, and his body was thrown overboard. The report filed by Nagumo tersely states that Osmus, &quot;died on 6 June and was buried at sea&quot;; O&#x27;Flaherty and Gaido&#x27;s fates were not mentioned. The execution of Osmus in this manner was apparently ordered by &quot;Arashi&quot;″s captain, Watanabe Yasumasa. Yasumasa died when the destroyer sank in December 1943; had he survived the war he would have likely been tried as a war criminal.

===Japanese prisoners===

Two enlisted men from &quot;Mikuma&quot; were rescued from a life raft on 9 June by and taken to Pearl Harbor. After receiving medical care, at least one of these sailors cooperated during interrogation and provided intelligence. Another 35 crewmen from &quot;Hiryū&quot; were taken from a lifeboat by on 19 June after being spotted by an American search plane. They were taken to Midway and then transferred to Pearl Harbor on .

==Impact==
The Battle of Midway has often been called &quot;the turning point of the Pacific&quot;. It was the Allies&#x27; first major naval victory against the Japanese. Had Japan won the battle as thoroughly as the U.S. did, it might have been able to capture Midway Island. &quot;Saratoga&quot; would have been the only American carrier in the Pacific, as no new ones were completed before the end of 1942. While the U.S. would probably not have sought peace with Japan as Yamamoto hoped, his country might have revived Operation FS to invade and occupy Fiji and Samoa; attacked Australia, Alaska, and Ceylon; or even attempted to occupy Hawaii.

Although the Japanese continued to try to secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, paving the way for the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal campaign is regarded by some as a turning point in the Pacific War.

Some authors have stated that heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully have stated that the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrews at the start of the Pacific War. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers&#x27; highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.

After the battle, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike force still afloat. Of Japan&#x27;s other carriers, &quot;Taihō&quot;, which was not commissioned until early 1944, would be the only fleet carrier worth teaming with &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;; and were light carriers, while and , although technically classified as fleet carriers, were second-rate ships of comparatively limited effectiveness. In the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers. By 1942 the U.S. was already three years into a shipbuilding program mandated by the 1938 Second Vinson Act.

Both the U.S. and Japan accelerated the training of aircrew, but the U.S. had a more effective pilot rotation system, which meant that more veterans survived and went on to training or command billets, where they were able to pass on lessons they had learned in combat to trainees, instead of remaining in combat, where errors were more likely to be fatal. By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Japanese had nearly rebuilt their carrier forces in terms of numbers, but their planes, many of which were obsolete, were largely flown by inexperienced and poorly trained pilots.

Midway showed the worth of pre-war naval cryptanalysis and intelligence-gathering. These efforts continued and were expanded throughout the war in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. Successes were numerous and significant. For instance, cryptanalysis made possible the shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto&#x27;s airplane in 1943.

The Battle of Midway also caused the plan of Japan and Nazi Germany to meet up in the Indian subcontinent to be abandoned.

The Battle of Midway redefined the central importance of air superiority for the remainder of the war when the Japanese suddenly lost their four main aircraft carriers and were forced to return home. Without any form of air superiority, the Japanese never again launched a major offensive in the Pacific.

==Discovery of sunken vessels==
Because of the extreme depth of the ocean in the area of the battle (more than ), researching the battlefield has presented extraordinary difficulties. On 19 May 1998, Robert Ballard and a team of scientists and Midway veterans from both sides located and photographed &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which was located deep. The ship was remarkably intact for a vessel that had sunk in 1942; much of the original equipment and even the original paint scheme were still visible. Ballard&#x27;s subsequent search for the Japanese carriers was unsuccessful.

In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques in conjunction with the ship&#x27;s log of the submarine USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the expedition located a large piece of wreckage, subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of &quot;Kaga&quot;.

The crew of the research vessel RV &quot;Petrel&quot;, in conjunction with the U.S. Navy, announced on 18 October 2019 that it had found the Japanese carrier &quot;Kaga&quot; at . The crew confirmed the discovery of another Japanese carrier, the &quot;Akagi&quot;, on 21 October 2019. The &quot;Akagi&quot; was found in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in nearly of water.

==Remembrances==

Chicago Municipal Airport, important to the war effort in World War II, was renamed Chicago Midway International Airport (or simply Midway Airport) in 1949 in honor of the battle. Henderson Field in Guadalcanal was named in honor of U.S. Marine Corps Major Lofton Henderson, the first Marine aviator to perish during the battle.

Escort carrier USS &quot;Midway&quot; (CVE-63) was commissioned on 17 August 1943. She was renamed &quot;St. Lo&quot; on 10 October 1944 to clear the name &quot;Midway&quot; for a large fleet aircraft carrier, , which was commissioned on 10 September 1945, eight days after the Japanese surrender, and is now docked in San Diego, California, as the USS &quot;Midway&quot; Museum.

On 13 September 2000 Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt designated the lands and waters of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge as the Battle of Midway National Memorial. Tinker Air Force Base outside Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is named in honor of Major General Clarence L. Tinker, Commander 7th Air Force, who personally led a bomber strike from Hawaii against the retreating Japanese forces on 7 June.

John Ford directed the 18-minute 1942 Movietone News documentary (released by the War Activities Committee) &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot;, which received the 1942 Academy Award for Best Documentary; and the eight-minute documentary &quot;Torpedo Squadron 8&quot;, which describes the heroism of Torpedo Squadron 8 of the . Ford, who was a Navy Reserve commander at the time, was present at Midway Atoll&#x27;s power plant on Sand Island during the Japanese attack and filmed it. He was wounded by enemy fire in his arm during the filming.

<text>In computer science, an escape sequence is a combination of characters that has a meaning other than the literal characters contained therein; it is marked by one or more preceding (and possibly terminating) characters.

==Examples==
* In C and many derivative programming languages, a string escape sequence is a series of two or more characters, starting with a backslash codice_1.
** Note that in C a backslash immediately followed by a newline does not constitute an escape sequence, but splices physical source lines into logical ones in the second translation phase, whereas string escape sequences are converted in the fifth translation phase.
** To represent the backslash character itself, codice_2 can be used, whereby the first backslash indicates an escape and the second specifies that a backslash is being escaped.
** A character may be escaped in multiple different ways. Assuming ASCII encoding, the escape sequences codice_3 (hexadecimal), codice_2, and codice_5 (octal) all encode the same character: the backslash codice_1.
* For devices that respond to ANSI escape sequences, the combination of three or more characters beginning with the ASCII &quot;escape&quot; character (decimal character code 27) followed by the left-bracket character codice_7 (decimal character code 91) defines an escape sequence.

==Control sequences==
When directed, this series of characters is used to change the state of computers and their attached peripheral devices, rather than to be displayed or printed as regular data bytes would be, these are also known as control sequences, reflecting their use in device control, beginning with the Control Sequence Initiator - originally the &quot;escape character&quot; ASCII code - character 27 (decimal) - often written &quot;Esc&quot; on keycaps.

With the introduction of ANSI terminals most escape sequences began with the &quot;two&quot; characters &quot;ESC&quot; then &quot;[&quot; or a specially-allocated CSI character with a code 155 (decimal).

Not all control sequences used an escape character; for example:
* modem control sequences used by AT/Hayes-compatible modems

* Data General terminal control sequences, but they often were still called escape sequences, and the very common use of &quot;escaping&quot; special characters in programming languages and command-line parameters today often use the &quot;backslash&quot; character to begin the sequence.

Escape sequences in communications are commonly used when a computer and a peripheral have only a single channel through which to send information back and forth (so escape sequences are an example of in-band signaling). They were common when most dumb terminals used ASCII with 7 data bits for communication, and sometimes would be used to switch to a different character set for &quot;foreign&quot; or graphics characters that would otherwise been restricted by the 128 codes available in 7 data bits. Even relatively &quot;dumb&quot; terminals responded to some escape sequences, including the original mechanical Teletype printers (on which &quot;glass Teletypes&quot; or VDUs were based) responded to characters 27 and 31 to alternate between letters and figures modes.

==Keyboard==
An escape character is usually assigned to the Esc key on a computer keyboard, and can be sent in other ways than as part of an escape sequence. For example, the Esc key may be used as an input character in editors such as vi, or for backing up one level in a menu in some applications. The Hewlett Packard HP 2640 terminals had a key for a &quot;display functions&quot; mode which would display graphics for all control characters, including Esc, to aid in debugging applications.

If the Esc key and other keys that send escape sequences are both supposed to be meaningful to an application, an ambiguity arises if a character terminal is in use. When the application receives the ASCII escape character, it is not clear whether that character is the result of the user pressing the Esc key or whether it is the initial character of an escape sequence (e.g., resulting from an arrow key press). The traditional method of resolving the ambiguity is to observe whether or not another character quickly follows the escape character. If not, it is assumed not to be part of an escape sequence. This heuristic can fail under some circumstances, especially without fast modern communication speeds.

Escape sequences date back at least to the 1874 Baudot code.

==Modem control==
The Hayes command set, for instance, defines a single escape sequence, &quot;+++&quot;. (In order to interpret &quot;+++&quot;, which may be a part of data, as the escape sequence, the sender stops communication for one second before and after the &quot;+++&quot;.) When the modem encounters this in a stream of data, it switches from its normal mode of operation, which simply sends any characters to the phone, to a command mode in which the following data is assumed to be a part of the command language. You can switch back to the &quot;online mode&quot; by sending the O command.

The Hayes command set is modal, switching from command mode to online mode. This is not appropriate in the case where the commands and data will switch back and forth rapidly. An example of a non-modal escape sequence control language is the VT100, which used a series of commands prefixed by a Control Sequence Introducer.

==Comparison with control characters==

A control character is a character that, in isolation, has some control function, such as carriage return (CR). Escape sequences, by contrast, consist of one or more escape characters which change the interpretation of subsequent characters.

==ASCII video data terminals==
The VT52 terminal used simple digraph commands like escape-A: in isolation, &quot;A&quot; simply meant the letter &quot;A&quot;, but as part of the escape sequence &quot;escape-A&quot;, it had a different meaning. The VT52 also supported parameters: it was not a straightforward control language encoded as substitution.

The later VT100 terminal implemented the more sophisticated ANSI escape sequences standard (now ECMA-48) for functions such as controlling cursor movement, character set, and display enhancements. The Hewlett Packard HP 2640 series had perhaps the most elaborate escape sequences for block and character modes, programming keys and their soft labels, graphics vectors, and even saving data to tape or disk files.

===Use in DOS and Windows===
A utility, ANSI.SYS, can be used to enable the interpreting of the ANSI (ECMA-48) terminal escape sequences under DOS (by using codice_8 in the PROMPT command) or in command windows in 16-bit Windows. The rise of GUI applications, which directly write to display cards, has greatly reduced the usage of escape sequences on Microsoft platforms, but they can still be used to create interactive random-access character-based screen interfaces with the character-based library routines such as printf without resorting to a GUI program.

===Use in Linux and Unix displays===
The default text terminal, and text windows (such as using xterm) respond to ANSI escape sequences.

==Quoting escape==
===Overview===
When an escape character is needed within the quoted/escaped string, there are two strategies used within programming and scripting languages:
* doubled delimiter (e.g. codice_9)
* secondary escape sequence

An example of the latter is in the use of the caret (codice_10). E.g. this outputs &quot;You can do so via Cut&amp;Paste&quot; in CMD. (otherwise, the ampersand has a restricted use)

 echo You can do so via Cut^&amp;Paste

===In detail===
A common use of escape sequences is in fact to remove control characters found in a binary data stream so that they will not cause their control function by mistake. In this case, the control character is replaced by a defined &quot;escape character&quot; (which need not be the US-ASCII escape character) and one or more other characters; after exiting the context where the control character would have caused an action, the sequence is recognized and replaced by the removed character. To transmit the &quot;escape character&quot; itself, two copies are sent.

In many programming languages and command line interfaces escape sequences are used in character literals and string literals, to express characters which are not printable or clash with the syntax of characters or strings. For example, control characters themselves might not be allowed to be placed in the program coded by the editor program, or may have undesirable side-effects if typed into a command. The end-of-quote character is also a problem for programmers that can be solved by escaping it. In most contexts the escape character is the backslash (&quot;\&quot;).

===Samples===
For example, the single quotation mark character might be expressed as codice_11 since writing codice_12 is not acceptable.

Many modern programming languages specify the doublequote character (codice_13) as a delimiter for a string literal. The backslash escape character typically provides ways to include doublequotes inside a string literal, such as by modifying the meaning of the doublequote character embedded in the string (codice_14), or by modifying the meaning of a sequence of characters including the hexadecimal value of a doublequote character (codice_15). Both sequences encode a literal doublequote (codice_13).

In Perl or Python 2

print &quot;Nancy said &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the crowd.&quot;;

produces a syntax error, whereas:

print &quot;Nancy said \&quot;Hello World!\&quot; to the crowd.&quot;; ### example of \&quot;

produces the intended output.
Another alternative:

print &quot;Nancy said \x22Hello World!\x22 to the crowd.&quot;; ### example of \x22

uses &quot;\x&quot; to indicate the following two characters are hexadecimal digits, &quot;22&quot; being the ASCII value for a doublequote in hexadecimal.

C, C++, Java, and Ruby all allow exactly the same two backslash escape styles. The PostScript language and Microsoft Rich Text Format also use backslash escapes. The quoted-printable encoding uses the equals sign as an escape character.

URL and URI use percent-encoding to quote characters with a special meaning, as for non-ASCII characters.

Another similar (and partially overlapping) syntactic trick is stropping.

Some programming languages also provide other ways to represent special characters in literals, without requiring an escape character (see e.g. delimiter collision).

<doc id="60115" wikidata="Q190568" url="?curid=60115" title="Eadweard Muybridge">
<text>Eadweard Muybridge (; 9 April 1830 – 8 May 1904, born Edward James Muggeridge) was an English photographer known for his pioneering work in photographic studies of motion, and early work in motion-picture projection. 

He adopted the first name &quot;Eadweard&quot; as the original Anglo-Saxon form of &quot;Edward&quot;, and the surname &quot;Muybridge&quot;, believing it to be similarly archaic. A noted photographer in the 19th century American West, he photographed Yosemite, San Francisco, the newly acquired Alaskan Territory, subjects involved in the Modoc War, and lighthouses on the West Coast. He also made his early &quot;moving&quot; picture studies in California.

Born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, England, at the age of 20 he emigrated to the United States as a bookseller, first to New York City, then to San Francisco. In 1860, he planned a return trip to Europe, but suffered serious head injuries en route in a stagecoach crash in Texas. He spent the next few years recuperating in Kingston upon Thames, where he took up professional photography, learned the wet-plate collodion process, and secured at least two British patents for his inventions. He returned to San Francisco in 1867, a man with a markedly changed personality. In 1868, he exhibited large photographs of Yosemite Valley, and began selling popular stereographs of his work.

Muybridge is known for his pioneering chronophotography of animal locomotion between 1878 and 1886, which used multiple cameras to capture the different positions in a stride; and for his zoopraxiscope, a device for projecting painted motion pictures from glass discs that predated the flexible perforated film strip used in cinematography. From 1883 to 1886, he entered a very productive period at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, producing over 100,000 images of animals and humans in motion, occasionally capturing what the human eye could not distinguish as separate moments in time.

In his later years, Muybridge gave many public lectures and demonstrations of his photography and early motion picture sequences, travelling frequently in England and Europe to publicise his work in cities such as London and Paris. He also edited and published compilations of his work (some of which are still in print today), which greatly influenced visual artists and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography. He retired to his native England permanently in 1894. In 1904, the year of his death, the Kingston Museum opened in his hometown, and continues to house a substantial collection of his works in a dedicated gallery.

== Names ==
Edward James Muggeridge was born and raised in England. Muggeridge changed his name several times, starting with &quot;Muggridge&quot;. From 1855 to 1865, he mainly used the surname &quot;Muygridge&quot;.

From 1865 onward, he used the surname &quot;Muybridge&quot;.

In addition, he used the pseudonym &quot;Helios&quot; (Titan of the sun) for his early photography. He also used this as the name of his studio and gave it to his only son, as a middle name: Florado Helios Muybridge, born in 1874.

While travelling in 1875 on a photography expedition in the Spanish-speaking nations of Central America, the photographer advertised his works under the name &quot;Eduardo Santiago Muybridge&quot; in Guatemala.

After an 1882 trip to England, he changed the spelling of his first name to &quot;Eadweard&quot;, the Old English form of his name. The spelling was probably derived from the spelling of King Edward&#x27;s Christian name as shown on the plinth of the Kingston coronation stone, which had been re-erected in 1850 in Muybridge&#x27;s hometown, 100 yards from his childhood family home. He used &quot;Eadweard Muybridge&quot; for the rest of his career.

Others frequently misspelled his surname as &quot;Maybridge&quot;, &quot;Moybridge&quot;, or &quot;Mybridge&quot;. His gravestone carries his name as &quot;Eadweard Maybridge&quot;.

==1830–1850: early life and family==

Edward James Muggeridge was born in Kingston upon Thames, in the county of Surrey in England (now Greater London), on 9 April 1830 to John and Susanna Muggeridge; he had three brothers. His father was a grain and coal merchant, with business spaces on the ground floor of their house adjacent to the River Thames at No. 30 High Street. The family lived in the rooms above. After his father died in 1843, his mother carried on the business.

His younger cousins Norman Selfe (1839–1911) and Maybanke Anderson (née Selfe; 1845–1927), also spent part of their childhood in Kingston upon Thames. They moved to Australia and Norman, following a family tradition. Selfe became a renowned engineer, while Maybanke made fame as a suffragette.

His paternal great-grandparents were Robert Muggeridge and Hannah Charman, who owned a farm. Their oldest son John Muggeridge (1756–1819) was Edward&#x27;s grandfather; he was a stationer who taught Edward the business. Several uncles and cousins, including Henry Muggeridge (Sheriff of London), were corn merchants in the City of London. All were born in Banstead, Surrey. Edward&#x27;s younger brother George, born in 1833, lived with their uncle Samuel in 1851, after the death of their father in 1843.

==1850–1860: bookselling in America==
At the age of 20, Muybridge decided to seek his fortune. He turned down an offer of money from his grandmother, saying &quot;No, thank you Grandma, I&#x27;m going to make a name for myself. If I fail, you will never hear of me again.&quot; Muybridge immigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City in 1850. Here, he was possibly a partner in the book business enterprise Muygridge &amp; Bartlett together with a medical student, which existed for about a year. He spent his first years importing and selling books from the UK, and became familiar with early photography through his acquaintance with New York daguerreotypist Silas T. Selleck.

Muybridge arrived in New Orleans in January 1855, and was registered there as a book agent by April.

Muybridge probably arrived in California around the autumn of 1855, when it had not yet been a state for more than five years. He visited the new state capital, Sacramento, as an agent selling illustrated Shakespeare books in April 1856, and soon after settled at 113 Montgomery Street in San Francisco. From this address he sold books and art (mostly prints), in a city that was still the booming &quot;capital of the Gold Rush&quot; in the &quot;Wild West&quot;. There were already 40 bookstores and a dozen photography studios in town, and he even shared his address with a photo gallery, right next to another bookstore. He partnered with W.H. Oakes as an engraver and publisher of lithograph prints, and still functioned as a book agent for the London Printing and Publishing Company.

In April 1858, Muybridge moved his store to 163 Clay Street, where his friend Silas Selleck now had a photo gallery. Muygridge was a member of the Mechanic&#x27;s Institute of the City of San Francisco. In 1859, he was elected as one of the directors for the San Francisco Mercantile Library Association.

Muybridge sold original landscape photography by Carleton Watkins, as well as photographic copies of paintings. It remains uncertain whether or not Muygridge personally made such copies, or familiarized himself with photographic techniques in any fashion before 1860, although Muybridge claimed in 1881 that he &quot;came to California in 1855, and most of the time since and all of the time since 1860 (...) had been diligently, and at the same time studiously, been engaged in photography&quot;.

Edward&#x27;s brother George Muybridge came to San Francisco in 1858 but died of tuberculosis soon after. Their youngest brother Thomas S. Muygridge arrived in 1859, and it soon became clear that Edward planned to stop operating his bookstore business. On 15 May 1860, Edward published a special announcement in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; newspaper: &quot;I have this day sold to my brother, Thomas S. Muygridge, my entire stock of Books, Engravings, etc. (...) I shall on 5th June leave for New York, London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, and Vienna, etc.&quot;. Although he altered his plans, he eventually took a cross-country stagecoach on 2 July to catch a ship in New York.

==1860–1866: serious accident, recuperation, early patents, and short career as venture capitalist==
In July 1860, Muybridge suffered a head injury in a violent runaway stagecoach crash at the Texas border, which killed the driver and one passenger, and badly injured all other passengers. Muybridge was ejected from the vehicle and hit his head on a rock or another hard object. He woke up in a hospital bed at Fort Smith, Arkansas, with no recollection of the nine days after he had taken supper at a wayside cabin away, not long before the accident. He suffered from a bad headache, double vision, deafness, loss of taste and smell, and confusion. It was later claimed that his hair turned from black to grey in three days. The problems persisted fully for three months and to a lesser extent for a year.

Arthur P. Shimamura, an experimental psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, has speculated that Muybridge suffered substantial injuries to the orbitofrontal cortex that probably also extended into the anterior temporal lobes, which may have led to some of the emotional, eccentric behaviour reported by friends in later years, as well as freeing his creativity from conventional social inhibitions. Today, there is still little effective treatment for this kind of injury.

Muybridge was treated at Fort Smith for three weeks before he went to a doctor in New York City. He fled the noise of the city and stayed in the countryside. He then went back to New York for six weeks and sued the stage company, which earned him a $2,500 compensation. Eventually, he felt well enough to travel to England, where he received medical care from Sir William Gull (who was also personal physician to Queen Victoria), and was prescribed abstinence of meat, alcohol, and coffee for over a year. Gull also recommended rest and outdoor activities, and considering a change in profession.

Muybridge stayed with his mother in Kennington and later with his aunt while in England. Muybridge later stated that he had become a photographer at the suggestion of Gull. However, while outdoors photography might have helped in getting some fresh air, dragging around heavy equipment and working with chemicals in a dark room did not comply with the prescriptions for rest that Gull preferred to offer.

On 28 September 1860, &quot;E. Muggeridge, of New York&quot; applied for British patent no. 2352 for &quot;An improved method of, and apparatus for, plate printing&quot; via London solicitor August Frederick Sheppard.

On 1 August 1861, Muygridge received British patent no. 1914 for &quot;Improvements in machinery or apparatus for washing clothes and other textile articles&quot;. On 28 October the French version of this patent was registered. He wrote a letter to his uncle Henry, who had immigrated to Sydney (Australia), with details of the patents and he also mentioned having to visit Europe for business for several months. Muygridge&#x27;s inventions (or rather: improved machinery) were demonstrated at the 1862 International Exhibition.

Muybridge&#x27;s activities and whereabouts between 1862 and 1865 are not very well documented. He turned up in Paris in 1862 and again in 1864. In 1865 he was one of the directors for the Austin Consolidated Silver Mines Company (limited) and for The Ottoman Company (limited)/The Bank of Turkey (limited), under his new name &quot;Muybridge&quot;. Both enterprises were very short-lived due to the Panic of 1866, and Muybridge chaired the meetings in which the companies were dissolved during the spring of 1866.

Muybridge may have taken up photography sometime between 1861 and 1866. He possibly learned the wet-plate collodion process in England, and was possibly influenced by some of well-known English photographers of those years, such as Julia Margaret Cameron, Lewis Carroll, and Roger Fenton. However, it remains unclear how much he had already learned before the accident and how much he may have learned after his return to the United States.

==1867–1873: Helios, photographer of the American West ==

Muybridge returned to San Francisco on 13 February 1867 a changed man. Friends and associates later stated that he had changed from a smart and pleasant businessman into an eccentric artist. He was much more careless about his appearance, was easily agitated, could suddenly take objection to people and soon after act like nothing had happened, and he would regularly misstate previously-arranged business deals. His care about whether he judged something to be beautiful had become much stronger than his care for money; he easily refused payment if a customer seemed to be slightly critical of his work. Photographer Silas Selleck, who had known Muybridge from New York since circa 1852 and had been a close friend since 1855, claimed that he could hardly recognize Muybridge after his return.

Muybridge converted a lightweight two-wheel, one-horse carriage into a portable darkroom to carry out his work, and with a logo on the back dubbed it &quot;Helios&#x27; Flying Studio&quot;. He had acquired highly proficient technical skills and an artist&#x27;s eye, and became very successful in photography, focusing principally on landscape and architectural subjects. An 1868 advertisement stated a wide scope of subjects: &quot;Helios is prepared to accept commissions to photograph Private Residences, Ranches, Mills, Views, Animals, Ships, etc., anywhere in the city, or any portion of the Pacific Coast. Architects&#x27;, Surveyors&#x27; and Engineers&#x27; Drawings copied mathamatically (sic) correct. Photographic copies of Paintings and Works of Art.&quot;

Muybridge constantly tinkered with his cameras and chemicals, trying to improve the sales appeal of his pictures. In 1869, he patented a &quot;sky shade&quot; to reduce the tendency of intense blue outdoors skies to bleach out the images of the blue-sensitive photographic emulsions of the time. An article published in 2017 and an expanded book document that Muybridge heavily edited and modified his photos, inserting clouds or the moon, even adding volcanos to his pictures for artistic effects.

===San Francisco views===

Helios produced over 400 different stereograph cards, initially sold through Seleck&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Gallery at 415 Montgomery Street, and later through other distributors, such as Bradley &amp; Rulofson. Many of these cards showed views of San Francisco and its surroundings. Stereo cards were extremely popular at the time and thus could be sold in large quantities for a very low price, to tourists as a souvenir, or to proud citizens and collectors.

Early in his new career, Muybridge was hired by Robert B. Woodward (1824–1879) to take extensive photos of his Woodward&#x27;s Gardens, a combination amusement park, zoo, museum, and aquarium that had opened in San Francisco in 1866.

Muybridge took pictures of ruins after the 21 October 1868 Hayward earthquake.

During the construction of the San Francisco Mint in 1870–1872, Muybridge made a series of images of the building&#x27;s progress, documenting changes over time in a fashion similar to time-lapse photography. These images may have attracted the attention of Leland Stanford, who would later hire Muybridge to develop an unprecedented series of photos spaced in time.

===Yosemite===

From June to November 1867, Muybridge visited Yosemite Valley. He took enormous safety risks to make his photographs, using a heavy view camera and stacks of glass plate negatives. A stereograph he published in 1872 shows him sitting casually on a projecting rock over the Yosemite Valley, with of empty space below him. He returned with numerous stereoscopic views and larger plates. He selected 20 pictures to be retouched and manipulated for a subscription series that he announced in February 1868. Twenty original photographs (possibly the same) were used to illustrate John S. Hittel&#x27;s guide book &quot;Yosemite: Its Wonders and Its Beauties&quot; (1868).

Some of the pictures were taken of the same scenes shot by his contemporary Carleton Watkins. Muybridge&#x27;s photographs showed the grandeur and expansiveness of the West; if human figures were portrayed, they were dwarfed by their surroundings, as in Chinese landscape paintings. In comparing the styles of the two photographers, Watkins has been called &quot;a classicist, making serene, stately pictures of a still, eternal world of beauty&quot;, while Muybridge was &quot;a romantic who sought out the uncanny, the unsettling, the uncertain&quot;. In the 21st century there have been claims that many landscape photos attributed to Muybridge were actually made by or under the close guidance of Watkins, but these claims are disputed. Regardless, Muybridge started to develop his own leading-edge innovations in photography, especially in the capturing of ever-faster motion.

===Government commissions===
====Alaska====
In 1868, Muybridge was commissioned by the US government to travel to the newly acquired US territory of Alaska to photograph the Tlingit Native Americans, occasional Russian inhabitants, and dramatic landscapes.

====Lighthouses of the West Coast====
In 1871, the United States Lighthouse Board hired Muybridge to photograph lighthouses of the American West Coast. From March to July, he travelled aboard the Lighthouse Tender &quot;Shubrick&quot; to document these structures.

====Modoc War====
In 1873, Muybridge was commissioned by the US Army to photograph the &quot;Modoc War&quot; dispute with the Native American tribe in northern California and Oregon. A number of these photographs were carefully staged and posed for maximum effect, despite the long exposures required by the slow photographic emulsions of the time.


== 1872–1879: Stanford and horse gaits ==

In 1872, the former governor of California, Leland Stanford, a businessman and race-horse owner, hired Muybridge for a portfolio depicting his mansion and other possessions, including his racehorse Occident.

Stanford also wanted a proper picture of the horse at full speed, and was frustrated that the existing depictions and descriptions seemed incorrect. The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground. There are stories that Stanford had made a $25,000 bet on his theories about horse locomotion, but no evidence has been found of such a wager. However, it has been estimated that Stanford spent a total of $50,000 over the next several years to fund his investigations.

In 1873, Muybridge managed to use a single camera to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of the racehorse Occident running, at Union Park racetrack in Sacramento. Because of the insensitivity of the photographic emulsions used, early pictures were little more than blurry silhouettes. They both agreed that the image lacked quality, but Stanford was excited to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of this earliest image has yet resurfaced.

Muybridge promised to study better solutions, but his work on higher-speed photography would take several years to develop, and was also delayed by events in his personal life. With the aid of engineers and technicians from the Central Pacific Railroad (Stanford was one of the founding directors), Muybridge experimented with ever-faster mechanical shutters, and began developing state-of-the-art electrically-triggered mechanisms. He also experimented with more sensitive photographic emulsions to work with the shorter exposure times.

In July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still-fuzzy picture, he had it recreated by a retouch artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in instantaneous photography was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed that the heavily-manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but as he and Stanford were planning a new project that would convince everyone, they saw no need to prove that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.

In June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs, now with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford&#x27;s Palo Alto Stock Farm (now the campus of Stanford University). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a cart or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electromagnetic circuit. For a session on 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turf men were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most sceptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide.

&quot;The Daily Alta California&quot; reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern projected slides of the photographs at the San Francisco Art Association on 8 July 1878. Newspapers were not yet able to reproduce detailed photographs, so the images were widely printed as woodcut engravings. &quot;Scientific American&quot; was among the publications at the time that carried reports and engravings of Muybridge&#x27;s groundbreaking images. Six different series were soon published as cabinet cards, entitled &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot;.

Many people were amazed at the previously unseen positions of the horse&#x27;s legs in action, particularly the fact that a running horse had all four hooves in the air at regular intervals. This did not take place when the horse&#x27;s legs were extended to the front and back, as imagined by illustrators of the time, but when its legs were collected beneath its body as it switched from &quot;pulling&quot; with the front legs to &quot;pushing&quot; with the back legs.

In 1879, Muybridge continued with additional studies using 24 cameras, and published a very limited edition portfolio of the results.

Muybridge had images from his motion studies hand-copied in the form of silhouettes or line drawings onto a disc, to be viewed in the machine he had invented, which he called a &quot;zoopraxiscope&quot;. Later, his more-detailed images were hand-coloured and marketed commercially. A device he developed was later regarded as an early movie projector, and the process was an intermediate stage toward motion pictures or cinematography.

== 1878: San Francisco panorama ==
In 1878, Muybridge made a notable 13-part 360° photographic panorama of San Francisco. He presented a copy to the wife of Leland Stanford. Today, it can be viewed on the Internet as a seamlessly-spliced panorama, or as a QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) panorama.

That same year, he applied for a patent on a camera sequence shutter to photograph moving objects, with a mechanical trigger. Later that year, he applied for a further patent, this time using an electrical trigger. He also filed for British and French patents.

== 1871–1881: personal life, marriage, killing, acquittal, paternity, and divorce ==

On 20 May 1871, 41-year-old Muybridge married 21-year-old divorcee Flora Shallcross Stone (née Downs). The differences in their tastes and temperaments were understood to have been due to their age difference. Muybridge did not care for many of the amusements that she sought, so she went to the theatre and other attractions without him, and he seemed to be fine with that. Muybridge was more of the type that would stay up all night to read classics. Muybridge was also used to leaving home by himself for days, weeks or even months, visiting faraway places for personal projects or assignments. This did not change after his marriage.

On 14 April 1874 Flora gave birth to a son, Florado Helios Muybridge.

At some stage, Flora became romantically involved with one of their friends, Harry Larkyns. Muybridge intervened several times and believed the affair was over when he sent Flora to stay with a relative and Larkyns found a job at a mine near Calistoga, California. In mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora&#x27;s maternity nurse revealed many details and she had in her possession some love letters that the couple had still been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with &quot;Harry&quot; written on the back in Flora&#x27;s handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be fathered by Larkyns.

On 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, &quot;I have a message for you from my wife&quot;, and shot him point-blank. Larkyns died that night, and Muybridge was arrested without protest and put in the Napa jail.

A &quot;Sacramento Daily Union&quot; reporter visited Muybridge in jail for an hour and related how he was coping with the situation. Muybridge was in moderately good spirits and very hopeful. He felt he was treated very kindly by the officers and was a little proud of the influence he had on other inmates, which had earned him everyone&#x27;s respect. He had protested the abuse of a &quot;Chinaman&quot; from a tough inmate, by claiming &quot;No man of any country whose misfortunes shall bring him here shall be abused in my presence&quot; and had strongly but politely voiced threats against the offender. He had addressed an outburst of profanity in a similar fashion.

Flora filed for divorce on 17 December 1874 on the grounds of extreme cruelty, but this first petition was dismissed. It was reported that she fully sympathized with the prosecution of her husband.

Muybridge was tried for murder in February 1875. His attorney, W. W. Pendegast (a friend of Stanford), pleaded insanity in his behalf due to a severe head injury suffered in the 1860 stagecoach accident. At least four long-time acquaintances testified under oath that the accident had dramatically changed Muybridge&#x27;s personality, from genial and pleasant to unstable and erratic. During the trial, Muybridge undercut his own insanity case by indicating that his actions were deliberate and premeditated, but he also showed impassive indifference and uncontrolled explosions of emotion. In the end he was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide, with the jury explanation that if their verdict was not in accordance with the law, it was in accordance with the law of human nature. In other words: they believed they could not punish a person for doing something that they themselves would do in similar circumstances.

The episode interrupted his photography studies, but not his relationship with Stanford, who had arranged for his criminal defence. By 1877, Muybridge had resumed his photographic work for Stanford.

Shortly after his acquittal in February 1875, Muybridge left the United States on a previously planned 9-month photography trip to Central America, now acting as a &quot;working exile&quot;. His photographs from this period are less known, because relatively few copies were produced. It is believed that during this period, he further developed his ability to take pictures more rapidly, due to the requirement that these processes be performed aboard a constantly-rolling ship.

Flora&#x27;s second petition for divorce received a favourable ruling, and an order for alimony was entered in April 1875. Flora died suddenly in July 1875 while Muybridge was in Central America. She had placed their son, Florado Helios Muybridge (later nicknamed &quot;Floddie&quot; by friends), with a French couple. In 1876, Muybridge had the boy moved from a Catholic orphanage to a Protestant one and paid for his care. Otherwise he had little to do with him.

Photographs of Florado Muybridge as an adult show him to have strongly resembled Muybridge. Put to work on a ranch as a boy, he worked all his life as a ranch hand and gardener. In 1944, Florado was hit by a car in Sacramento and killed.

Today, the court case and transcripts are important to historians and forensic neurologists, because of the sworn testimony from multiple witnesses regarding Muybridge&#x27;s state of mind and past behaviour.

In 1982, American composer Philip Glass would create an opera, &quot;The Photographer&quot;, with a libretto based in part on court transcripts from the case.

== 1882–1893: motion studies in Philadelphia==
Muybridge often travelled to American cities as well as back to England and Europe to publicise his work. The opening of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 and the development of steamships made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the Royal Institution in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the Royal Family, notably the future King Edward VII. He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope. He also lectured at the Royal Academy of Arts and the Royal Society.

Muybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion. Stanford had asked his friend and horseman Dr JBD Stillman to write a book analysing &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot;, which was published in 1882. Stillman used Muybridge&#x27;s photos as the basis for his 100 illustrations, and the photographer&#x27;s research for the analysis, but he gave Muybridge no prominent credit. The historian Phillip Prodger later suggested that Stanford considered Muybridge as just one of his employees, and not deserving of special recognition. Stanford was quite proud of his role in creating the book, and commissioned a portrait of himself by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, in which a copy of the volume was visible under his arm.

However, as a result of Muybridge not being credited in the book, the Royal Society of Arts withdrew an offer to fund his stop-motion studies in photography, and refused to publish a paper he had submitted, accusing him of plagiarism. Muybridge filed a lawsuit against Stanford to gain credit, but it was delayed two years and then dismissed out of court. Stillman&#x27;s book did not sell as expected. Muybridge, looking elsewhere for funding, was more successful. The Royal Society of Arts eventually invited Muybridge back to show his work.

In 1883, Muybridge gave a lecture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), arranged by artist Thomas Eakins and University of Pennsylvania trustee Fairman Rogers. At that time, Eakins was a faculty member at PAFA, and had recently been appointed its director. A group of Philadelphians, including Penn Provost William Pepper and the publisher J.B. Lippincott recruited him to work at Penn under their sponsorship. Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in a dedicated studio at the northeast corner of 36th and Pine streets in Philadelphia. He was now able to afford multiple larger high-quality lenses, giving him the ability to make simultaneous pictures from multiple viewpoints, with a clarity and tonal range not achieved earlier.

In 1884, Eakins briefly worked alongside Muybridge, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of multiple exposures superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.

The vast majority of Muybridge&#x27;s work at this time was done at a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the still-bulky cameras and relatively slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Most of the photographs were taken during the summers, and winters were spent developing and organizing the images. He used banks of 12 custom-made cameras to photograph professors, athletes, students, disabled patients from the Blockley Almshouse (located next to Penn at the time), and local residents, all in motion. He photographed at least 9 sequences showing the movements of neurological patients. He also borrowed animals from the Philadelphia Zoo, to study their movements in detail.

The human models, usually either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military manoeuvres, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as baseball, cricket, boxing, wrestling, discus throwing, and a ballet dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner&#x27;s pick. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.

In 1887, the photos were published as a massive collotype portfolio in 11 volumes, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled &quot;Animal Locomotion: an Electro-photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements&quot;. Muybridge&#x27;s work contributed substantially to developments in the science of biomechanics and the mechanics of athletics. Some of his books are still published today, and are used as references by artists, animators, and students of animal and human movement.

In 1888, the University of Pennsylvania donated an album of Muybridge&#x27;s photographs, which featured students and Philadelphia Zoo animals, to the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Abdul Hamid II, who had a keen interest in photography. This gift may have helped to secure permissions for the excavations that scholars from the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology later pursued in the Ottoman region of Mesopotamia (now Iraq), notably at the site of Nippur. The Ottoman sultan reciprocated, five years later, by sending as a gift to the United States a collection of photograph albums featuring Ottoman scenes: the Library of Congress now preserves these albums as the Abdul Hamid II Collection.

Recent scholarship has noted that in his later work, Muybridge was influenced by, and in turn, influenced the French photographer Étienne-Jules Marey. In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey&#x27;s studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area. Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called &quot;Marey wheel&quot; camera.

While Marey&#x27;s scientific achievements in the realms of cardiology and aerodynamics (as well as pioneering work in photography and chronophotography) are indisputable, Muybridge&#x27;s efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).

Today, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern special effects photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed &quot;bullet time&quot; photography.

After his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the &quot;Science of Animal Locomotion&quot; in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the &quot;Midway Plaisance&quot; arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his moving pictures to a paying public. The Hall was the first commercial movie theatre. He also sold a series of souvenir phenakistoscope discs to demonstrate simple animations, using painted colour images derived from his photographs.

== 1894–1904: retirement and death ==

Muybridge returned to his native England in 1894 and continued to lecture extensively throughout Great Britain. He returned to the US once more, in 1896–1897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania. He retained control of his negatives, which he used to publish two popular books of his work, &quot;Animals in Motion&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Human Figure in Motion&quot; (1901), both of which remain in print over a century later.

Muybridge died on 8 May 1904 in Kingston upon Thames of prostate cancer at the home of his cousin Catherine Smith. It is claimed that at that time, he was excavating a scale model of the American Great Lakes in the back garden. His body was cremated and his ashes interred in a grave at Woking in Surrey. On the gravestone his name is misspelled as &quot;Eadweard Maybridge&quot;.

In 2004, a British Film Institute commemorative plaque was installed on the outside wall of the former Smith house, at Park View, 2 Liverpool Road. Many of his papers and collected artefacts were donated to Kingston Library, and are currently under the ownership of Kingston Museum in his place of birth.

== Influence on others ==

According to an exhibition at Tate Britain, &quot;His influence has forever changed our understanding and interpretation of the world, and can be found in many diverse fields, from Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s painting &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; and countless works by Francis Bacon, to the blockbuster film &quot;The Matrix&quot; and Philip Glass&#x27;s opera &quot;The Photographer&quot;&quot;.

In 2010, the American painter Philip Pearlstein published an article in &quot;ARTnews&quot; suggesting the strong influences Muybridge&#x27;s work and public lectures had on 20th-century artists, including Degas, Rodin, Seurat, Duchamp, and Eakins, either directly or through the contemporaneous work of his fellow photographic pioneer, Marey. He concluded: &quot;I believe that both Muybridge and Eakins—as a photographer—should be recognized as among the most influential artists on the ideas of 20th-century art, along with Cézanne, whose lessons in fractured vision provided the technical basis for putting those ideas together&quot;.

* Étienne-Jules Marey – in 1882 recorded the first series of live-action photos with a single camera by a method of chronophotography; influenced and was influenced by Muybridge&#x27;s work.
* Thomas Eakins – American artist and teacher who worked directly with Muybridge in 1884, and then continued his own independent motion studies, incorporating the findings into his artwork.
* William Dickson – credited as inventor of the motion picture camera in 1890.
* Thomas Edison – developed and owned patents for motion picture cameras in 1891.

* Harold Eugene Edgerton – , pioneered stroboscopic and high speed photography and film, producing an Oscar-winning short movie and many striking photographic sequences.
* Francis Bacon – painted multiple overlapping images inspired by Muybridge photographs (1909–1992).
* Peer Bode – created &quot;Video Locomotion (man performing forward hand leap)&quot; (1978), which adapts Muybridge&#x27;s motion studies to electronic video at the Experimental Television Center.
* Sol LeWitt – a modern American artist inspired by Muybridge&#x27;s serial investigations, LeWitt explicitly paid homage to the photographer in &quot;Muybridge I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; (1964).
* Diller Scofidio + Renfro – &quot;EJM 1:Man Walking at Ordinary Speed&quot; and &quot;EJM2:Interia&quot; (1998), a two-part multimedia dance work with Charleroi/Danses and the Ballet Opera of Lyon, was inspired by motion photography experiments of two photographer-scientists: Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey.
* John Gaeta – used the principles of Muybridge photography to create the bullet time slow-motion technique of the 1999 movie &quot;The Matrix&quot;.
* Steven Pippin – so-called Young British Artist who in 1999 converted a row of laundromat washing machines into sequential cameras in the style of Muybridge.
* Wayne McGregor – in 2011 UK choreographer collaborated with composer Mark-Anthony Turnage and artist Mark Wallinger on a piece entitled &quot;Undance&quot;, inspired by Muybridge&#x27;s &quot;action verbs&quot;.

== Exhibitions and collections ==
Muybridge bequeathed a selection of his equipment to Kingston Museum in Greater London. This includes his original biunial slide lantern, a zoopraxiscope projector, over 2,000 glass magic lantern slides and 67 zoopraxiscope discs. The University of Pennsylvania Archives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hold a large collection of Muybridge&#x27;s photographs, equipment, and correspondence. Among these artefacts are 740 of the 781 original glass plate negatives used for publication of his masterwork edition.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art also holds a large collection of Muybridge material, including hundreds of collotype prints, gelatin internegatives, glass plate positives, phenakistoscope cards, and camera equipment, totalling just under 800 objects. The Stanford University Libraries and the Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University also maintain a large collection of Muybridge&#x27;s photographs, glass plate negatives, and some equipment including a functioning zoopraxiscope.

In 1991, the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, hosted a major exhibition of Muybridge&#x27;s work, plus the works of many other artists who had been influenced by him. The show later travelled to other venues and a book-length exhibition catalogue was also published. The Addison Gallery has significant holdings of Muybridge&#x27;s photographic work.

In 1993, the Canadian Centre for Architecture presented the exhibition &quot;Eadweard Muybridge and the Photographic Panorama of San Francisco, 1850–1880&quot;.

In 2000–2001, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History presented the exhibition &quot;Freeze Frame: Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s Photography of Motion&quot;, plus an online virtual exhibit.

From 10 April to 18 July 2010, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, mounted a major retrospective of Muybridge&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change&quot;. The exhibit received favourable reviews from major publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The exhibition travelled in autumn 2010 to Tate Britain, Millbank, London, and also appeared at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA).

An exhibition of important items bequeathed by Muybridge to his birthplace of Kingston upon Thames, entitled &quot;Muybridge Revolutions&quot;, opened at the Kingston Museum on 18 September 2010 (exactly a century since the first Muybridge exhibition at the Museum) and ran until 12 February 2011. The full collection is held by the Museum and Archives.

== Legacy and representation in other media ==

Muybridge&#x27;s influence extended to many artists and beyond, including efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth, entrepreneur Walt Disney, Nobel-Prize chemist Ahmed Zewail, and the International Society of Biomechanics.

* The main campus site of Kingston University has a building named after Muybridge.

<doc id="60116" wikidata="Q189147" url="?curid=60116" title="George Eastman">
<text>George Eastman (July 12, 1854March 14, 1932) was an American entrepreneur who founded the Eastman Kodak Company and helped to bring the photographic use of roll film into the mainstream. After a decade of experiments in photography, he patented and sold a roll film camera, making amateur photography accessible to the general public for the first time. Working as the treasurer and later president of Kodak, he oversaw the expansion of the company and the film industry.

Eastman was a major philanthropist, establishing the Eastman School of Music, Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, and schools of dentistry and medicine at the University of Rochester and Eastman Dental Hospital at University College London, and making large contributions to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), the construction of several buildings at the second campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on the Charles River, and Tuskegee University and Hampton University, two historically black universities in the South. With interests in improving health, he provided funds for clinics in London and other European cities to serve low-income residents.

In his final two years, Eastman was in intense pain caused by a disorder affecting his spine. On March 14, 1932, he shot himself in the heart, leaving a note which read, &quot;To my friends: my work is done. Why wait?&quot;

Eastman is regarded as one of the most influential and well-known residents of Rochester, New York. He has been commemorated on several college campuses and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the George Eastman Museum has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

==Early life==

Eastman was born in Waterville, New York, as the youngest child of George Washington Eastman and Maria Eastman (née Kilbourn), at the farm which his parents had bought in 1849. He had two older sisters, Ellen Maria and Katie. He was largely self-educated, although he attended a private school in Rochester after the age of eight.

In the early 1840s his father had started a business school, the Eastman Commercial College in Rochester, New York. The city became one of the first &quot;boomtowns&quot; in the United States, based on its rapid industrialization. As his father&#x27;s health started deteriorating, the family gave up the farm and moved to Rochester in 1860. His father died of a brain disorder on April 27, 1862. To survive and afford George&#x27;s schooling, his mother took in boarders.

The second daughter, Katie, had contracted polio when young and died in late 1870 when George was 15 years old. The young George left school early and started working to help support the family. As Eastman began to have success with his photography business, he vowed to repay his mother for the hardships she had endured in raising him.

==Career==
=== Founding of Kodak ===

While working as a bank clerk in the 1870s, Eastman became interested in photography. After receiving lessons from George Monroe and George Selden, he developed a machine for coating dry plates in 1879. In 1881, he founded the Eastman Dry Plate Company with Henry Strong to sell plates, with Strong as company president and Eastman as treasurer, where he handled most executive functions. Around the same time, he began experiments to create a flexible film roll that could replace plates altogether. In 1885, he received a patent for a film roll, and then focused on creating a camera to use the rolls. In 1888, he patented and released the Kodak camera (&quot;Kodak&quot; being a word Eastman created). It was sold loaded with enough roll film for 100 exposures. When all the exposures had been made, the photographer mailed the camera back to the Eastman company in Rochester, along with $10. The company would process the film, make a print of each exposure, load another roll of film into the camera, and send the camera and the prints to the photographer.

The separation of photo-taking from the difficult process of film development was novel and made photography more accessible to amateurs than ever before, and the camera was immediately popular with the public. By August 1888, Eastman was struggling to meet orders, and he and his employees soon had several other cameras in development. The rapidly-growing Eastman Dry Plate Company was reorganized as the Eastman Company In 1889, and then incorporated as Eastman Kodak in 1892.

=== Growth of film industry===

Eastman recognized that most of his revenue would come from the sale of additional film rolls, rather than camera sales, and focused on film production. By providing quality and affordable film to every camera manufacturer, Kodak managed to turn competitors into &quot;de facto&quot; business partners. In 1889 he patented the processes for the first nitrocellulose film along with chemist Henry Reichenbach. A number of patent infringement lawsuits would preoccupy Eastman and his lawyers in subsequent years, including one from Reichenbach after he was fired in 1892. The largest lawsuit would come from rival film producer Ansco. Inventor Hannibal Goodwin had filed a patent for nitrocellulose film in 1887, prior to Eastman and Reichenbach&#x27;s, but it was not granted until 1898. Ansco purchased the patent in 1900 and sued Kodak for infringement. Kodak ultimately lost the suit, which lasted over a decade and cost the company $5 Million.

Eastman paid close attention to Kodak&#x27;s advertisements. He coined the slogan, “You press the button, we do the rest”, which became ubiquitous in the general public.

As Kodak pursued a monopoly on film through patents and acquisitions, the company experienced rapid growth. By 1896, Kodak was the leading supplier of film stock internationally, and by 1915, the company was the largest employer in Rochester, with over 8,000 employees and annual earnings of $15.7 Million. In 1934, shortly after Eastman&#x27;s death, Kodak employed 23,000. One of the largest markets for film became the emerging motion picture industry. When Thomas Edison and other film producers formed the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908, Eastman negotiated for Kodak to be sole supplier of film to the industry. His monopolistic actions attracted the attention of the federal government, which began an anti-trust investigation into Kodak in 1911 for exclusive contracts, acquisitions of competitors, and price-fixing. This resulted in a lawsuit against Kodak in 1913 and a final judgement in 1921, ordering Kodak to stop fixing prices and sell many of its interests.

Kodak&#x27;s growth was sustained during the 20th century by new innovations in film and cameras, including the Brownie camera, which was marketed to children. Eastman took interest in color photography in 1904, and funded experiments in color film production for the next decade. The resulting product, created by John Capstaff, was a two-color process named Kodachrome. Later, in 1935, Kodak would release the more famous second Kodachrome, the first marketed integral tripack film. During World War I, Eastman established a photographic school in Rochester to train pilots for aerial reconnaissance.

In an era of growing trade union activities, Eastman sought to counter the union movement by anticipating worker demands. To this end, he implemented a number of worker benefit programs, including a welfare fund to provide workmen&#x27;s compensation in 1910 and a profit-sharing program for all employees in 1912.

==Personal life==
Eastman never married. He was close to his mother and to his sister Ellen Maria and her family. He had a long platonic relationship with Josephine Dickman, a trained singer and the wife of business associate George Dickman. He became especially close to Dickman after the death of his mother, Maria Eastman, in 1907. He was also an avid traveler, enjoyed music and social gatherings, and had a passion for playing the piano.

The loss of his mother, Maria, was particularly crushing to George. Almost pathologically concerned with decorum, he found himself, for the first time, unable to control his emotions in the presence of his friends. &quot;When my mother died I cried all day&quot;, he said later. &quot;I could not have stopped to save my life.&quot; Due to his mother&#x27;s reluctance to accept his gifts, Eastman could never do enough for his mother during her lifetime. He continued to honor her after her death. On September 4, 1922, he opened the Eastman Theatre in Rochester, which included a chamber-music hall, Kilbourn Theater, dedicated to his mother&#x27;s memory. At the Eastman House he maintained a rose bush, using a cutting from her childhood home.

==Later years==

Eastman was a presidential elector in 1900 and 1916. In 1915, Eastman founded the Bureau of Municipal Research in Rochester to gather information and make government policy recommendations. The agency was later renamed the Center for Governmental Research and continues to carry out that mission. In 1924, Eastman and the Bureau supported a referendum to change Rochester&#x27;s government to a city manager system, which passed.

In 1920, Eastman established the Eastman Savings and Loan to provide financial services to Kodak employees. The institution was later rechartered as ESL Federal Credit Union.

In the 1920s, Eastman was involved in calendar reform and supported the 13-month per year International Fixed Calendar developed by Moses B. Cotsworth. On January 17, 1925, Eastman invited Cotsworth to his home; he had been introduced to Cotsworth&#x27;s calendar by a mutual friend and was interested in the system. He secretly funded Cotsworth for a year and then openly supported him and the 13-month plan. Eastman took a major role in planning and financing the campaign for a new global calendar, and also headed the National Committee on Calendar Simplification, in the United States, which was created at the behest of the League of Nations. Eastman supported Cotsworth&#x27;s campaign until his death. 

Eastman wrote several articles to promote the 13-month system, including &quot;Problems of Calendar Improvement&quot; in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Calendar Reform to the Business World&quot; in &quot;Nation&#x27;s Business&quot;. By 1928, the Kodak Company implemented the calendar in its business bookkeeping, and continued to use it until 1989. He was chairman of the National Committee on Calendar Simplification. Although a conference was held at the League of Nations in 1931, with his death and the looming tensions of World War II, this calendar was dropped from consideration.

In 1925 Eastman gave up his daily management of Kodak and officially retired as president. He remained associated with the company in a business executive capacity, as the chairman of the board, until his death.

=== Philanthropy ===
During his lifetime, Eastman donated $100 million to various organizations, becoming one of the major philanthropists in the United States during his lifetime. His largest donations went to the University of Rochester and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build their programs and facilities. Preferring to remain anonymous, he made donations under the alias &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;. In 1918, he endowed the establishment of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, and in 1921 a school of medicine and dentistry there. In 1922, he founded the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, hiring its first music director Albert Coates. Figured for its value in 1932, the year of Eastman&#x27;s death, $100 million is equivalent to more than $2 billion in 2022.

In 1915, Eastman provided funds for the establishment of the Eastman Dental Dispensary in Rochester. He donated £200,000 in 1926 to fund a dental clinic in London after being approached by the chairman of the Royal Free Hospital, George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell. Donations of £50,000 each had been made by Lord Riddell and the Royal Free honorary treasurer. On November 20, 1931, the UCL Eastman Dental Institute opened in a ceremony attended by Neville Chamberlain, then Minister of Health, and the American Ambassador to the UK. The clinic was incorporated into the Royal Free Hospital and was committed to providing dental care for disadvantaged children from central London. It is now a part of University College London. In 1929 he founded the George Eastman Visiting Professorship at Oxford, to be held each year by a different American scholar of the highest distinction. Eastman also funded Eastmaninstitutet, a dental care clinic for children opened in 1937 in Stockholm, Sweden.

=== Views on race ===
Marion Gleason, a close confidante of Eastman, later described his views on African Americans as &quot;typical of his time – paternalistic, but strictly against social fraternization.&quot; Although he made generous donations to the Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute, becoming their largest donor in his era, he also upheld and reinforced the de facto segregation which existed in Rochester. Kodak hired virtually no black employees during Eastman&#x27;s lifetime, and a 1939 commission of the New York State Legislature on living conditions of African Americans found that Kodak had only a single black employee. The Eastman Dental Dispensary also rejected black applicants, and the Eastman Theater restricted black patrons to its balcony. Eastman rejected several requests to meet with NAACP representatives, including a direct appeal from president Walter White in 1929.

From 1925 until his death, Eastman donated $10,000 per year to the American Eugenics Society (increasing the donation to $15,000 in 1932), a popular cause among many of the upper class when there were concerns about immigration and &quot;race mixing&quot;.

==Infirmity and suicide==

In his final two years, Eastman was in intense pain due to a disorder affecting his spine. He had trouble standing, and his walk became a slow shuffle. Today, it might be diagnosed as a form of degenerative disease such as disc herniations from trauma or age causing either painful nerve root compressions, or perhaps a type of lumbar spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal caused by calcification in the vertebrae. Since his mother suffered during the final two years of her life in a wheelchair, she also may have had a spine condition but that is uncertain. Only her uterine cancer and successful surgery are documented in her health history.

As a result of his pain, Eastman suffered from depression. On March 14, 1932, Eastman died by suicide with a single gunshot through the heart. His suicide note read, &quot;To my friends, my work is done – Why wait? GE.&quot;

Raymond Granger, an insurance salesman in Rochester, was visiting to collect insurance payments from several members of the staff. He arrived at the scene to find the workforce shocked and upset. At least one chronicler said that Eastman&#x27;s fear of senility or other debilitating diseases of old age was a contributing factor to his action.

Eastman&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Rochester; his coffin was carried out to Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Marche Romaine&quot;. It was buried in the grounds of the company he founded, at what is now known as Eastman Business Park.

The Security Trust Company of Rochester was the executor of Eastman&#x27;s estate. His entire estate was bequeathed to the University of Rochester.

==Legacy==

Eastman disdained public notoriety and sought to tightly control his image. He was reluctant to share information in interviews, and on multiple occasions both Eastman and Kodak blocked biographers from full access to his records. A definitive biography was finally published in 1996.

Eastman is the only person represented by two stars in the Film category in the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one on the north side of the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard and the other one on the west side of the 1700 block of Vine Street. Both recognize the same achievement, that he developed bromide paper, which became a standard of the film industry.

The Eastman Quadrangle of the River Campus of the University of Rochester is named for Eastman. The Rochester Institute of Technology has a building dedicated to him, in recognition of his support and substantial donations. MIT installed a plaque of Eastman on one of the buildings he funded. (Students rub the nose of Eastman&#x27;s image on the plaque for good luck.)

Eastman had built a mansion at 900 East Avenue in Rochester. Here he entertained friends to dinner and held private music concerts. The University of Rochester used the mansion for various purposes for decades after his death. In 1949, it re-opened after having been adapted for use as the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark, and is now known as the George Eastman Museum.

Eastman&#x27;s boyhood home was saved from destruction. It was restored to its state during his childhood and is displayed at the Genesee Country Village and Museum.

*In 1966, the George Eastman House was designated a National Historic Landmark.
*The auditorium at the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering at Mississippi State University is named for Eastman, in recognition of his inspiration to Swalm.
*In 1968, Eastman was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.
==Representation in other media==
*PBS American Experience produced an episode entitled &quot;The Wizard of Photography: The story of George Eastman and how he transformed photography&quot;. It first aired May 22, 2000.

<doc id="60117" wikidata="Q832409" url="?curid=60117" title="Juno Beach">
<text>Juno and or Juno Beach was one of five beaches of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 during the Second World War. The beach spanned from Courseulles, a village just east of the British beach Gold, to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, and just west of the British beach Sword. Taking Juno was the responsibility of the First Canadian Army, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Canadian Navy and the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Free French, Norwegian, and other Allied navies. The objectives of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on D-Day were to cut the Caen-Bayeux road, seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen, and form a link between the two British beaches on either flank.

The beach was defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division, with elements of the 21st Panzer Division held in reserve near Caen.

The invasion plan called for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division to land on two beach sectors—Mike and Nan—focusing on Courseulles, Bernières and Saint-Aubin. It was hoped that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up the beach defences and destroy coastal strong points. Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and specialized armoured vehicles of the 79th Armoured Division of the United Kingdom. Once the landing zones were secured, the plan called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland, the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold. The 3rd Canadian Division&#x27;s D-Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen–Bayeux railway line by nightfall.

The landings encountered heavy resistance from the German 716th Division; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped, and rough weather forced the first wave to be delayed until 07:35. Several assault companies—notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada—took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the first wave. Strength of numbers, coordinated fire support from artillery, and armoured squadrons cleared most of the coastal defences within two hours of landing. The reserves of the 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08:30 (along with the Royal Marines), while the 9th Brigade began its deployment at 11:40.

The subsequent push inland towards Carpiquet and the Caen–Bayeux railway line achieved mixed results. The sheer numbers of men and vehicles on the beaches created lengthy delays between the landing of the 9th Brigade and the beginning of substantive attacks to the south. The 7th Brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with the British 50th Division at Creully. The 8th Brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of the 716th at Tailleville, while the 9th Brigade deployed towards Carpiquet early in the evening. Resistance in Saint-Aubin prevented the Royal Marines from establishing contact with the British 3rd Division on Sword. By the time all operations on the Anglo-Canadian front were ordered to halt at 21:00, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada had reached its D-Day objective and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on D-Day.

==Background==
===Invasion of Normandy===

In 1942, the Western Allies agreed to open a second front (the Western Front) in Western Europe to take pressure off the beleaguered Red Army in the Soviet Union. While Britain and the United States did not yet possess the resources to mount a full invasion, invasion plans that came to be known as Operation Sledgehammer were drawn up, in case the German position in Western Europe weakened or the USSR&#x27;s situation became dire. In August 1942 Anglo-Canadian forces attempted an abortive landing—Operation Jubilee—at the French port of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. Following the Anglo-American victory against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa in May 1943, British, American and Canadian troops invaded Sicily in July 1943, followed by Italy in September. By December the Allies&#x27; progress had slowed facing tenacious German resistance and the difficult geography of the Italian Peninsula.

After gaining valuable experience in amphibious assaults and inland fighting, Allied planners returned to the plans to invade Northern France, now postponed to 1944. Under the direction of General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force) and Frederick Morgan, plans for the invasion of France coalesced as Operation Overlord. With an initial target date of 1 May 1944, the infantry attack was conceived as a joint assault by five divisions transported by landing craft, constituting the largest amphibious operation in military history. The attack was later scheduled for Monday, 6 June 1944, and Normandy was selected for the landing sites, with a zone of operations extending from the Cotentin Peninsula to Caen. There were originally seventeen sectors along the Normandy coastline with codenames taken from one of the spelling alphabets of the time, from Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the east flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red and White. Operation Overlord called for the British Second Army to assault between the River Orne and Port en Bessin, capture Caen, and form a front line from Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé to the south-east of Caen, to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it captured Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the city of Falaise, which could then be used as a pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan, the Touques River and then towards the River Seine.

After delays due to both logistical difficulties and poor weather, the D-Day of Overlord, the largest amphibious operation ever, was postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen within the first day, and liberate Paris within 90 days.

===Juno===
Operation Neptune, the landing phase of Overlord, called for a five-division front spread across of coastline; three airborne divisions (two American, one British, which also included a Canadian battalion) would also land in the pre-dawn hours of D-Day. Eisenhower and General Bernard Montgomery hoped to have eight infantry divisions and fourteen tank regiments in the Normandy beachhead by nightfall on D-Day. The landing zone was divided into five landing areas, with the Americans attacking Utah (the westernmost) and Omaha, and the British attacking Gold and Sword. Juno, a stretch of shoreline between La Rivière to the west and Saint-Aubin to the east, was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (3rd CID), commanded by Major-General Rod Keller. Juno included the villages of Courseulles and Bernières.

The name &quot;Juno&quot; arose because Winston Churchill considered that the original code name – Jelly – sounded inappropriate. The code names for the beaches to be taken by British and Commonwealth forces were named after types of fish: Goldfish, Swordfish and Jellyfish, abbreviated to Gold, Sword and Jelly. Churchill &quot;disapproved of the name Jelly for a beach on which so many men might die&quot;. He insisted on a change to the more dignified name Juno.

==Planning and preparation==
===German defences===

While the German army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in Russia, North Africa and Italy, it remained a powerful fighting force. Despite this, most of the German divisions along the French coast in late 1943 were composed of either new recruits or veteran units resting and rebuilding from the Eastern Front; altogether some 856,000 soldiers were stationed in France, predominantly on the coast. An additional 60,000 (voluntary helpers), USSR and Polish members of the German army, served on the French coast. Under the command of Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, the defences of the Atlantic Wall – a line of coastal gun emplacements, machine-gun nests, minefields and beach obstacles along the French coast – were increased; in the first six months of 1944, the Germans laid of steel and of concrete. Rommel also surrounded the coast with four million anti-tank and anti-personnel mines and 500,000 beach obstacles.

On Juno, the defences of the Atlantic Wall were greater than at many other landing sectors. The Germans assumed that the Allies would land during high tide, to minimize the distance during which they would be exposed on the beaches and created &quot;a &#x27;devil&#x27;s garden&#x27; of beach obstacles ... deployed in rows between above the low-tide mark&quot;. Strongpoints of machine-gun positions, antitank and anti-personnel artillery and bunkers were located every , manned by several platoons with mortars. Minefields were deployed surrounding these strongpoints, and additional defences were present in the Courseulles harbour.

The Calvados beaches of Normandy were defended by the 716th Static and 352nd Infantry divisions, with the Canadian landing zone defended by elements of the 716th. It was formed mostly from soldiers under 18 or over 35, comprising 7,771 combat troops in six battalions (as opposed to 9 or 12 battalions of Allied divisions). While the 352nd was considered a first-rate division, the 716th was &quot;accounted a better-than-average static division&quot;. These divisions generally had very few vehicles or tanks and had to rely on infantry and field regiments. On Juno the 736th Grenadier Regiment deployed four infantry companies, 7 &quot;Kompanie&quot; held what was to become &quot;Mike Sector&quot;, the 6th was stationed in Courseulles, the 5th was at Bernières and the 9th held Nan sector and Saint-Aubin. A second line of four infantry companies and one panzer company was stationed inland. The 21st Panzer Division was deployed south-east of Caen and two battalions of Polish and Russian conscripts were stationed on the flanks of Juno adjacent to Sword and Gold.

===Canadian preparations===
Canadian training for D-Day had begun as early as July 1943, when Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton the military representative of the Canadian government informed Harry Crerar, commander of I Canadian Corps, that the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division might play a role in the invasion of France. Initial training was demanding, and complicated by the lack of any landing craft to practice with, either LCAs or LCTs. Field exercises in Scotland commenced in August and September 1943, and succeeded in establishing unique techniques and equipment for use by armoured and artillery regiments in storming the beach; the most significant were the amphibious &quot;Duplex Drive&quot; tanks (DD tanks). Mechanisms were also developed to allow artillery to bombard the beach while still aboard their landing craft. Through the winter of 1944, units jointly developed more advanced assault tactics among the Juno regiments.

The landings would be supported by the largest invasion fleet in history – 7,016 vessels in total. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 121 vessels to the armada, including destroyers, frigates, corvettes, landing ships, minesweepers and torpedo boats. Four Canadian Tribal-class destroyers were in the Royal Navy&#x27;s 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which joined other RN units in keeping the English Channel near Normandy clear of German naval units. Naval Force J had begun intense training for the invasion with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division in February 1944, with a full-scale simulation of the invasion carried out on 4 May in Exercise Fabius. On D-Day itself, Force J, commanded from , was to bombard German defensive positions along the landing zone with everything from heavy-calibre cruiser guns to self-propelled artillery attached to landing craft. According to Canadian Army Historian C. P. Stacey, a light bombardment of the landing zone would commence &quot;30 minutes before H Hour and continue for 15 minutes; heavy bombing would then begin on the flanks of the divisional attack, lasting until H Hour&quot;. Additional cover would be provided by Royal and Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons both before and on D-Day. A successful surprise invasion required total air superiority over the English Channel and Normandy. In the months preceding D-Day, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force attacked airfields, coastal garrisons, radar, railway lines and transport routes in order to soften the beach defences, as well as prevent the German Luftwaffe from mounting a serious challenge to air superiority over Normandy. By dawn, on 6 June, the RAF tactical air forces had 2,434 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft with approximately 700 light and medium bombers to support them.

The operational plan for Juno was divided into two main sectors: Mike (west) and Nan (east). Mike Sector would be attacked by the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade, with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, The Canadian Scottish Regiment and the 1st Hussars in support. The 7th Brigade was to take Courseulles and drive inland. Nan Sector would be assaulted by the Regina Rifle Regiment of 7th Brigade, as well as the North Shore Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade, while tanks of the Fort Garry Horse provided armoured support; a squadron of specialized Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) from the British 79th Armoured Division would land on each beach sector as well. The 8th Brigade was to capture Bernières and the western edge of Saint-Aubin, then push south into Normandy. The operational plan also called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers to be deployed to Juno as reinforcements within 4 to 6 hours of the initial assault. By nightfall of D-Day, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was slated to have captured the high ground west of Caen, the Bayeux–Caen railway line, and the seaside towns of Courseulles, Bernières, Saint-Aubin and Bény-sur-Mer.

==D-Day landings==
===Early bombardment===
Air attacks on Normandy&#x27;s coastal defences began in earnest on 5 June at 23:30, with RAF Bomber Command units targeting the primary coastal defences. The attack continued until 05:15, with of bombs dropped by 1,136 sorties; this marked the largest attack by Bomber Command in terms of tonnage up to that point in the war. Initial attacks on the Atlantic Wall proved ineffective, with poor weather and visibility making it difficult to accurately hit the bunkers and turrets. The bombing left the defences on Omaha, Gold and Juno virtually intact, yet did not damage Allied landing craft in the Channel (as many planners had feared it would). The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) sent 230 bombers to bomb targets on Juno during this raid, yet damage was limited.

As the Americans began their own bombing runs against Omaha and Utah to the west, the Anglo-Canadian naval forces began their counter-battery fire, seeking to knock out German shore batteries and bunkers. The British had attached the cruisers and to Force J to serve as heavy support. &quot;Belfast&quot; commenced bombardment of the Atlantic Wall at 05:30 and &quot;Diadem&quot; at 05:52 on 6 June. The naval gunfire proved more effective than the aerial bombardment; the battery at Longues was the only one to return fire, and was quickly destroyed by the light cruiser . Indeed, most of the gun batteries at Juno were incomplete on D-Day, and did not possess sufficient protection or communication measures to accurately return fire on Force J. The Bény-sur-Mer battery was neutralized by &quot;Diadem&quot; shortly after she opened fire.

At 06:10, the 11 destroyers of Force J moved shoreward to begin bombardment, hoping to damage light gun emplacements and prevent the German 716th from mobilizing and moving across the beach. They were supplemented by additional raids by medium bombers and fighter-bombers of the RAF and USAAF, which dropped an additional 2,796 tons of ordnance on the five landing zones. While the medium bombers proved inaccurate, the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers proved more effective at attacking coastal defences. As the bombing runs continued to hit Juno, the destroyers and landing craft moved towards the beach and began close-range saturation bombardment. In addition to the destroyers of Force J—two Canadian, eight British, one French—bombardment was also provided by converted LCTs fitted with guns. Smaller, light-gunned landing craft were able to get closer to the beach and use their 6-pounder guns against German defensive positions. Additional firepower was provided by eight landing craft fitted with over 1,000 high-explosive rockets and 24 LCTs, each carrying four M7 Priest self-propelled guns. These field regiments, while still seaborne, were to fire heavy concentrations of high explosive and smoke shells against the four main &quot;resistance nests&quot; in &quot;Mike&quot; and &quot;Nan&quot; sectors, beginning half an hour before H Hour. Forward observation and fire control officers in the leading assault waves were to make the necessary adjustments to this neutralizing fire during the assault.

The bombardment was scheduled to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.

===Landing: 7th Brigade (Mike, Nan Green)===
Though the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade was scheduled to land on Mike Sector at 07:35, rough seas and poor craft co-ordination pushed this time back by ten minutes. Two assault companies of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, one assault company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment, and one squadron of the 1st Hussars were to land on &quot;Mike Red&quot; and also on &quot;Mike Green&quot;, while the Regina Rifle Regiment, supported by a second squadron of the 1st Hussars, landed on &quot;Nan Green&quot; sector. The first Winnipegs touched down at 07:49, with the remaining assault companies deploying within seven minutes. The LCAs carrying &quot;B&quot; Company craft were engaged while about 700 yards from shore. Disembarkation had to be done under direct fire and, in consequence, heavy casualties were sustained by this company while landing. The strongpoint in this area consisted of three casemates and twelve machine-gun emplacements. This left the infantry the grim prospect of clearing it by direct assault. &quot;B&quot; company was unable to advance further without armoured support. The Hussars&#x27; &quot;A&quot; Squadron launched from the beach, but would not be fully deployed until a full six minutes after the Winnipegs were ashore. To their west, &quot;D&quot; Company faced less defensive fire, as it was clear of the strongpoint. The company easily cleared the beach, and went through the barbed wire with light casualties. &quot;A&quot; platoon of the 6th Field Company Royal Canadian Engineers was redirected to clear the minefields facing &quot;D&quot; Company, given that the flail tanks had yet to land. On the far right, &quot;C&quot; Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment landed with little opposition, and discovered that their objective—a 75 mm gun emplacement—had been destroyed by naval gunfire.

To the east of Mike Sector, the Regina Rifles came ashore on &quot;Nan Green&quot; with the objective of subduing German forces in Courseulles. &quot;A&quot; Company reported touchdown at 08:09, and met heavy resistance almost immediately; &quot;B&quot; Company reported touchdown at 08:15. The Hussars&#x27; tanks first reported deploying twenty minutes before the infantry, with &quot;B&quot; Squadron HQ reporting their landing at 07:58. They faced the task of destroying a heavy gun emplacement equipped with 88 mm and 75 mm guns and thick concrete walls. The bombardment had failed to destroy the emplacement and heavy machine guns inflicted many casualties on the company; one LCA reported six men killed within seconds of lowering the ramps. A platoon was able to breach the barbed wire lining the beach and take cover in Courseulles and then eliminate the machine-guns engaging &quot;A&quot; Company of the Regina Rifles. The DD tanks arrived in the Regina Rifles sector with greater numbers and punctuality than in the Winnipegs&#x27; sector. The 75 mm gun emplacement in the Courseulles strongpoint was destroyed by fire from &quot;B&quot; Squadron of the 1st Hussars; the 88 mm was similarly silenced. To their east, &quot;B&quot; Company encountered limited resistance, pushed into Courseulles and soon &quot;had cleared a succession of the assigned blocks in the village&quot;.

With the initial assault companies ashore and fighting for their objectives, the reserve companies and battalion (Canadian Scottish Regiment) began their deployment on Juno. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; Companies of the Winnipeg Rifles landed at 08:05 and began to push towards the villages of Banville and Sainte-Croix-sur-Mer. &quot;A&quot; Company encountered heavy machine-gun fire and had to request support from the 1st Hussars to clear the position. On Nan Green, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; Companies of the Regina Rifles prepared to storm Courseulles. &quot;C&quot; Company touched down at 08:35 and moved into the village without difficulty. &quot;D&quot; Company was further delayed, after several LCAs struck antitank mines attached to beach obstacles; only 49 &quot;D&quot; Company soldiers reached the beach. The Canadian Scottish Regiment arrived on the beach at 08:30, with the leading companies coming under heavy mortar fire; it took the regiment a full hour to get off the beaches and push further inland.

===Landing: 8th Brigade (Nan White, Red)===
Originally scheduled to land at 07:45 to the east of the 7th, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade&#x27;s two assault battalions were postponed by 10 minutes as a result of heavy seas. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada (QOR) landed at 08:12 at Nan White and faced the most tenacious defences of any unit in Nan Sector: an 88 mm gun emplacement with multiple machine-gun nests outside of Bernières. The first LCA to touch down saw 10 of its first 11 soldiers either killed or wounded. &quot;B&quot; Company came ashore directly in front of the main resistance nests, 200 yards east of their intended landing zone, subjecting them to heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. The QOR had been scheduled to advance with DD fire support, but the heavy seas meant that &quot;instead of swimming in, they [DD tanks] left their craft close inshore and landed behind the infantry assault companies&quot;. Several soldiers from &quot;B&quot; Company succeeded in outflanking the main pillbox and killing its gunners with grenades and small arms. One LCA&#x27;s rudder from &quot;B&quot; Company had jammed and that platoon landed far to the left of the rest of &quot;B&quot; Company, enabling them to outflank and destroy the gun emplacements. With the defences silenced, the QOR was able to advance into Bernières, having suffered 65 casualties on the beaches. To their west, &quot;A&quot; Company encountered less resistance but was limited by poorly coordinated run-ins by the LCAs to the beach. &quot;A&quot; Company was able to quickly reach the seawall and breach the barbed wire but encountered much mortar and sniper fire in Bernières. This was the only sector of Juno where armoured support proved ineffective, as &quot;B&quot; Squadron of the Fort Garry Horse was too far out from the beach to provide heavy support.

The first units of the North Shore Regiment&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; companies touched down on Nan Red at 08:10 in chest-deep water. They were tasked with securing Saint-Aubin and clearing defences in the village. &quot;B&quot; Company landed to find that the Saint-Aubin strong point &quot;appeared not to have been touched&quot; by preliminary naval bombardment. The two assault companies faced a sprint across open beach in the face of fire from Saint-Aubin. &quot;A&quot; Company suffered the most casualties, incurring many fatalities from beach mines. &quot;B&quot; Company faced stronger opposition at the strong point, yet managed to breach the seawall and barbed wire. The 50 mm antitank gun was still firing and the thick concrete casemates protected it from infantry fire. By 08:10, Sherman tanks of the Fort Garry Horse and AVRE of the 80th Assault Squadron, Royal Engineers, had landed at Nan Red and begun to assist &quot;B&quot; Company in clearing the gun emplacement. The 50 mm gun knocked out four of the squadron&#x27;s tanks, while the North Shore&#x27;s machine-gun platoon was flanking the position. The right section of the strong point was eliminated by anti-tank guns and engineers, while the central anti-tank gun was silenced by Petard demolition bombs fired from the AVRE. When the North Shore captured the strong point, approximately half the defenders were killed; 48 German soldiers surrendered.

The 8th Brigade reserve battalion, Le Régiment de la Chaudière, began deploying to the beaches at 08:30 along with the reserve companies of the North Shore and QOR. More than half of the LCAs were crippled by mines buried along the beach; QOR &quot;C&quot; Company was forced to touch down further offshore when their LCAs were damaged by mines. &quot;C&quot; Company linked up with &quot;B&quot; Squadron of the Fort Garry Horse, and moved to assist the pinned-down and exhausted &quot;A&quot; Company. The North Shore C and D Companies landed outside of Saint-Aubin, with &quot;C&quot; Company taking over for &quot;A&quot; Company in the advance further into Saint-Aubin, while &quot;D&quot; Company occupied the village. All but one of the LCAs carrying Chaudière &quot;A&quot; Company foundered before they could touch down on the beach, and they lost most of their equipment while swimming to shore. The Chaudières quickly formed up outside Bernières and Saint-Aubin, linking up with both the QOR and the North Shores. The reserve also included the No. 48 (Royal Marine) Commando, which was scheduled to land 45 minutes after the first arrivals. The Commandos were to pass Saint-Aubin&#x27;s eastern edge and occupy Langrune-sur-Mer on the eastern end of Juno. The strong point facing them had not been cleared and 120 of the 400-man unit became casualties within seconds of landing.

===Deploying reinforcements===
With Juno largely secured, Keller prepared to deploy the reserves of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and tanks of the Sherbrooke Fusiliers. The reports coming in from the battalions already on Juno were mixed; Canadian military historian Terry Copp says that the North Shore was &quot;proceeding according to plan&quot;, while the Chaudières were &quot;making progress slowly&quot;. The two self-propelled artillery regiments—the 14th Field and 19th Army Field Regiments, Royal Canadian Artillery—had deployed at 09:25 and 09:10, and had several dozen guns in action before 11:00. Opposition and continued problems with mine obstacles on Nan Red meant that the entire 9th Brigade would have to land in Bernières and Nan White sector. When the 9th Brigade&#x27;s LCIs touched down at 11:40, the congestion on the beach in Nan White was so heavy that most infantry companies could not disembark from their landing craft. The 9th Brigade&#x27;s reserves consisted of the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa, the North Nova Scotia Highlanders, the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders, and the Highland Light Infantry of Canada. The Glengarry Highlanders reported coming under mortar fire from German positions further inland, as &quot;with little room to manoeuvre on dry land, the entire 9th Brigade became easy targets for German artillery&quot;. The 9th Brigade quickly made it across the beach, and joined the Chaudières, Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles and Fort Garry Horse in Bernières to await further advance inland.

Having subdued German defences on the beach, the next task of the landed forces was to clear Juno of obstacles, debris and undetonated mines then establish the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division&#x27;s headquarters in Bernières. Movement Control Units came ashore just before noon, with military policemen beginning to marshal vehicles through to Bernières and Courseulles. Sappers of 619 Independent Field Company also moved in to begin clearing the minefields surrounding the beach, so as to free up the advance south towards Carpiquet. Keller himself established divisional headquarters in Bernières shortly after noon.

==Advance inland==
===Initial attacks===
At 14:35, Keller met with the commanders of the 8th and 9th Infantry Brigades, as well as the newly reconstituted 2nd Armoured Brigade (Fort Garry Horse, Sherbrooke Fusiliers, 1st Hussars). With the first line of objectives (codenamed Yew) secured on the beachhead, Keller ordered the 7th and 8th Brigades to advance with armoured support towards the second line of objectives (Elm), whereupon 9th Brigade would then leapfrog over the 7th and 8th to reach the third objective line (Oak). Facing them were the remains of three battalions of the 736th Grenadier Regiment, and three battalions of the 726th Regiment. &quot;B&quot; Company of the Winnipegs was still facing heavy resistance from snipers and machine guns in Courseulles, while the eastern companies of the North Shore Regiment were fighting for Saint-Aubin. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; Companies of the Royal Winnipegs moved off the beach, cut through the walls of barbed wire behind the German bunkers, pushed through Vaux and Graye-sur-Mer, and began to advance towards St. Croix and Banville. &quot;C&quot; Company advanced on Banville—the headquarters of II Battalion of the 726th—but was stopped by three machine-gun emplacements just short of the town. Winnipeg &quot;A&quot; Company joined &quot;C&quot; Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment and a troop of &quot;C&quot; Squadron of the 1st Hussars and advanced on St. Croix, unaware of a large German counter-attack massing in St. Croix under the command of 8 Battalion, 726 Regiment. &quot;C&quot; Company of the Canadian Scottish Regiment had deployed to their west, and was able to spot the units of the 8th Battalion, and halt the counter-attack before it fully materialized. &quot;D&quot; Company of the Winnipegs joined the advance on Banville with covering fire from the Cameron Highlanders and the 12th and 13th Field Artillery Regiments; Banville was declared captured at 13:10, although small pockets of resistance would survive until nightfall and then retreat. &quot;D&quot; Company of the Canadian Scottish moved to capture two bridges on the Seulles River further inland from the Winnipeg companies. &quot;B&quot; Company joined them, and pushed through the gap between St. Croix and Banville, joining &quot;C&quot; Company as it did so. &quot;C&quot; Squadron of the 1st Hussars provided armoured support. To their east, the Regina Rifles advanced south towards Reviers, engaging troops of the 7th Battalion of the 736th Grenadier Regiment. They reported reaching the town by 12:15 with two companies, and began consolidating their position in preparation for further advance.

In Nan Sector, the 8th Brigade advance started slower than that of the 7th Brigade, because the Chaudières had lost most of their equipment on the advance over the beaches. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles&#x27; &quot;C&quot; Company was pinned down at the edge of Bernières by sniper-fire, and could not cross the open fields behind the town; their armoured support was also stopped by heavy antitank fire coming from Beny-sur-Mer. The Chaudières &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Companies were caught in the crossfire; &quot;B&quot; Company lost almost an entire platoon when a German 88 mm scored a hit on a Priest self-propelled gun. Chaudière and QOR progress was slow; all told, it took nearly two hours for artillery and heavy guns to clear the defences at Beny-sur-Mer, allowing the QOR to advance towards the town. Beny-sur-Mer was reported cleared at 14:00, at which point the Chaudières began to mass in the town for a further advance south towards Carpiquet. The QOR broke off to the left to engage heavy artillery batteries to the west of Beny, and &quot;B&quot; Company was assisted by the guns of HMCS &quot;Algonquin&quot;, which destroyed a bunker of 105 mm guns. To their east, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; Company of the North Shores advanced towards Tailleville—the headquarters of II Battalion of the 736th Grenadiers. Mortar fire north of the headquarters was both concentrated and accurate, slowing the advance of &quot;C&quot; Company. They were supported in their drive south by tanks of the Fort Garry Horse, which caught close to 100 German defenders in open fields. The North Shores and their armour support entered Tailleville at 14:00, at which point the six tanks of &quot;C&quot; Squadron moved through the village, destroying German gun emplacements. The defenders of the II Battalion had created a complex underground bunker system in the village, which enabled them to continuously outflank Canadian infantry; it took another seven hours to clear Tailleville of defenders, which ensured that the North Shores would be unable to capture German radar sites to the south on D-Day.

&quot;B&quot; Company of the North Shore Regiment and No. 48 Commando of the Royal Marines were engaged in a protracted fight to secure Saint-Aubin and Lagrune-sur-Mer. &quot;B&quot; Company had generally neutralized the strongpoint WN27 within two hours of landing, which allowed Troops A and B of the Royal Marines to push east. These units had the important objective of bridging the gap between the landing zones at Juno and Sword, which would allow for a continuous Anglo-Canadian front by the end of the first day. The Royal Marines began to advance on Lagrune and strong-point WN26, while to their east No. 41 Commando Royal Marines advanced from Sword. The strongpoint was defended by &quot;a reinforced platoon from the 736th Grenadiers&quot; and was a group of fortified houses and 50 mm anti-tank guns. B Troop&#x27;s first attempt to capture it failed and the assault was renewed with support from Centaur tanks only to again falter in the face of heavy resistance. No. 48 Commando was forced to call the assault off at nightfall, as reports of massing for counter-attacks by the 21st Panzer Division against the divide between Sword and Juno arrived. The strong points at Lagrune and Luc-sur-Mer were captured on 8 June.

===Drive to Elm===
The division&#x27;s advance south of Tailleville had halted, preventing an attack on German radar stations. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles and &quot;C&quot; Company of the Chaudières opted to continue their advance towards Anguerny and Columby-sur-Thaon and Objective Line &quot;Elm&quot;. The beachhead was now filled to capacity with troops, to the point that &quot;B&quot; Company of the Chaudières could not be deployed alongside &quot;C&quot; Company without severely hindering the advance of the QOR to their east. &quot;C&quot; Company&#x27;s advance on Basly was even further hindered by the proximity of the combat; the fighting occurred at such close range that the 14th Field Artillery would not provide fire support for fear of friendly-fire casualties. When &quot;C&quot; Company reached Basly, the North Nova Scotia Highlanders formed up outside Beny-sur-Mer, with the intention of overtaking the Chaudières and making for Carpiquet and the Caen–Bayeux highway. At 16:45, the North Novas assembled in Beny, and were the target of concentrated German mortar fire as the Sherbrooke Fusiliers de-waterproofed their tanks. Three companies of the North Novas and a squadron of the Sherbrookes advanced on the mortar positions, with many casualties among the infantry but clearing the positions. The QOR entered Anguerny—on the Elm Objective Line—at 17:30, and sent &quot;D&quot; Company to probe German defences on the hills overlooking the village. The Chaudières reported that Basly was cleared of defenders at 18:15, allowing the 9th Brigade to advance towards Carpiquet Airfield. By 19:00, the North Nova Scotia Highlanders were advancing towards Carpiquet, encountering their first resistance an hour later. With reports of the 21st Panzer Division attacking the flanks of the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword, Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey—commander of the British Second Army—ordered forces on Sword, Juno and Gold to establish defensive positions at their intermediate objectives.

On the western edge of the Canadian sector, the advance of the 7th Brigade had stalled in the face of stiffening resistance in St. Croix and Banville, delaying the right flank of the assault. The German defenders gave ground slowly and did not begin withdrawing from the towns until the Bren Gun platoons began to arrive at 14:00. Once St. Croix and Banville were cleared, the Canadian Scots pushed south to Colombiers, reinforced the platoons that had captured the bridge across the Seulles earlier in the day, and moved towards the Creully–Caen road. The Canadian Scots reported reaching the road at 16:30, and continued to push south past Objective Line Elm. To their west the Royal Winnipegs stopped at Elm Line, and began to erect defensive positions with Bren Gun carriers and artillery. The Regina Rifles had been slow to advance from Courseulles on account of the heavy casualties taken securing the village; the 1st Hussars&#x27; &quot;B&quot; Squadron was in a similar position, with only half its fighting strength having made it off the beach. By 18:00 the Reginas were advancing, while the Hussars scouted ahead of the infantry companies. As the Reginas linked up with the Canadian Scots, the order to hold positions and dig in arrived from Keller&#x27;s headquarters; the two battalions halted at 21:00.

Three tanks of the 1st Hussars&#x27; &quot;C&quot; Squadron (No. 2 Troop) had continued to advance southwards, pushing through side-roads towards Carpiquet Airfield. Aside from a German staff-car and a machine-gun nest, the three Sherman tanks encountered virtually no resistance, advancing all the way to the Caen–Bayeux railway line and becoming the only unit on the whole of D-Day to reach its final objective. Though the commander of the unit—Lieutenant William F. McCormick—attempted to contact his superiors to bring up reinforcements to attack Carpiquet Airfield, the three tanks eventually withdrew back to the Canadian lines.

===Positions at nightfall===
At the end of D-Day, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was situated firmly on Objective Line Elm, short of their final D-Day objectives. In the west, the 7th Brigade was anchored in Creully and Fresne-Camilly. The 9th Brigade was positioned a mere from Caen, the farthest inland of any Allied units on D-Day. On the eastern edge of the Canadian sector the 8th Brigade had taken up positions in Anguerny and Columby, having begun in the late afternoon to dig in. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in advancing farther than any other divisional element in the Allied Expeditionary Force, but due to heavy fighting in Lagrune and Saint-Aubin had failed to link up with the British 3rd Division from Sword. The German 716th Infantry Division was scattered and heavily depleted: division commander Lieutenant General Wilhelm Richter recorded that less than one full battalion could be mustered for further defence. The German 21st Panzer Division had driven a wedge between the British and Canadian 3rd Divisions, yet had been unable to dislodge either from the beaches. To the south, Hitler had released the elite Panzer Lehr Division and the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth), both of which prepared to head north with the I SS Panzer Corps.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
While the Normandy landings in all five sectors managed to establish footholds in Normandy, many D-Day objectives were not met. The 82nd and 101st US Airborne divisions had suffered many casualties—their landings were scattered all over the dropzones—but had captured Sainte-Mère-Église to the west of Utah. On the Cotentin Peninsula, the American 4th Infantry Division had suffered lighter casualties in securing Utah, and had established a strong bridgehead by the end of D-Day. Omaha had met with less success, as intact defences and high-calibre troops of the 352nd Infantry Division caused more casualties than at any of the other beaches; at one point the attack was going so badly that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley considered withdrawing V Corps from the beaches. A second wave of attacks breached the coastal defences, but could only push inland by nightfall. To the west of Juno, the British 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division encountered only light resistance, and succeeded in advancing inland and creating a continuous front with Juno (though not with Omaha) with only 413 casualties. To their east, the British 3rd Infantry Division established a foothold on Sword. Counter-attacks by the 21st Panzer Division in the afternoon prevented the 3rd Infantry Division from capturing Caen and from making contact with the 3rd Canadian Infantry division on Juno. The counter-attack failed to drive the British into the sea.

In spite of the many casualties inflicted on the 352nd and 716th Infantry divisions, the 7th Army quickly established plans for counter-attacks. Early orders to move towards the invasion beaches were confused, as the divisions necessary for counter-attacks fell under a different jurisdiction than those defending the coast. The panzer divisions, such as the Panzer Lehr, 12th SS Panzer and 2nd SS Panzer, could not be mobilized for the coast without authorization by Hitler. The order to mobilize Panzer Lehr and the 12th SS was finally given in the mid-afternoon of 6 June. When the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers began to advance on 7 June, they were met by dug in troops of the 716th Infantry and 21st Panzer divisions. At 17:00, the advancing force was counter-attacked by the 12th SS, under the command of Kurt Meyer. The 9th Brigade was forced to withdraw to its D-Day positions, having suffered more casualties than any unit on Juno the previous day. The 7th Brigade reached its final D-Day objectives along Line Oak, while the 8th Brigade attempted to destroy German radar stations to their east, which took until 11 June.

The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division made contact with the British from Sword on 7 June, before forming a continuous front with the American sector by 13 June. The subsequent advance on Caen and Cherbourg was slow, as a greater number of German Panzer units were concentrated near Caen and Carentan. The Canadians captured Carpiquet Airfield during Operation Windsor on 5 July, while Anglo-Canadian forces captured Caen as part of Operation Charnwood (8–9 July) and Operation Atlantic (18–20 July).

===Preliminary bombardment===
Military historians have generally drawn the conclusion that the preliminary aerial and naval bombardment of Juno was not as effective as had been hoped, yet differ in their opinions as to how ineffective. The aerial bombardment of Juno&#x27;s defences the night before is considered to have been very ineffective, primarily because of the inclement weather. John Keegan notes that &quot;the prevailing low, thick cloud frustrated its [Bomber Command&#x27;s] efforts&quot;. Colonel Stacey—the official historian of the Canadian Army in the Second World War—considers the effects of the bombing runs to have been &quot;spotty&quot;, noting that while several coastal batteries were not hit, those that were (such as the battery at Houlgate) were hit accurately. Chester Wilmot offers a different view, suggesting that &quot;[the coastal guns] had been accurately bombed, but had survived because they were heavily protected by the concrete casemates Rommel had insisted upon&quot;. Historians&#x27; assessment of the naval bombardment is even more mixed; while they generally agree that it failed to fully neutralize German defences on Juno, they are in disagreement as to why. Stacey suggests that while the &quot;beach-drenching fire&quot; was concentrated and substantial, it was both inaccurate and of insufficient firepower to destroy the coastal bunkers. He further suggests that the effect of the drenching fire was moral rather than material, in that it forced defenders to keep below-ground and sapped their morale. Terry Copp echoes this analysis, noting that &quot;reasonable accuracy could not be obtained from the pitching decks of LCTs [by mounted artillery on the ships]&quot;; the 13th Field Regiment&#x27;s drenching fire fell on average past their targets. British historian Max Hastings notes that because of the delay in landing times by ten minutes, a substantial gap existed between the cessation of bombardment and the actual landing of the first waves of infantry, meaning that platoons of the 716th had ample time to return to their positions. The bombardment of strongpoints in the towns along the coast was inconsistent; the North Shore Regiment reported that the strongpoint near Saint-Aubin &quot;appeared not to have been touched&quot; by bombardment, while the strongpoints facing the Canadian Scottish Regiment had been eliminated by naval bombardment before their landing.

===Overall===
Despite the failure to capture any of the final D-Day objectives, the assault on Juno is considered by some—alongside Utah—the most strategically successful of the D-Day landings. Historians suggest a variety of reasons for this success. Mark Zuehlke notes that &quot;the Canadians ended the day ahead of either the US or British divisions despite the facts that they landed last (a delay of half an hour due to bad weather) and that only the Americans at Omaha faced more difficulty winning a toehold on the sand&quot;. Chester Wilmot claims that the Canadian success in clearing the landing zones is attributable to the presence of amphibious DD tanks on the beaches; The DD Tanks arrival on the British beaches had been seriously disrupted by bad weather and choppy seas, and the absence of DD tanks altogether was largely responsible for the heavier casualties on Omaha, the only beach with heavier resistance than Juno. Canadian historian Terry Copp attributes the steady advance of the 7th Brigade in the afternoon to &quot;less serious opposition&quot; than the North Shore Regiment encountered in Tailleville.

Despite the verdict of a successful D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than the reasons for their success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan van der Vat notes that &quot;the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles&quot;. Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that &quot;on the whole it was not so much the opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective&quot;. Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that &quot;British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied&quot;. Copp disagrees with Stacey&#x27;s assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that &quot;the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in at the first sign of a counterattack&quot;. He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that &quot;if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [on 7 June]&quot;.

Stacey offers a second line of analysis on the Canadians&#x27; failure to advance to Line Oak, suggesting that difficulties encountered by the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword caused Dempsey to halt the advance of the entire British Second Army. The British encountered heavy counterattacks by the 21st Panzer Division, which prevented the British 9th Brigade from establishing contact with the Canadians at Juno. Copp wrote that, &quot;Before this withdrawal [of the 21st Panzer Division] became evident, Dempsey had concluded that more armoured counter-attacks could be expected. So he ordered the three assault divisions to dig in at their second line of objectives. This decision was relayed to subordinate commanders somewhere after 19:00&quot;, just as the 9th Canadian Brigade was preparing to advance south towards Carpiquet. Wilmot wrote that the British 3rd Infantry Division brigade commanders were overly cautious in advancing towards Caen and this slowed the Anglo-Canadian advance, especially given the reports of counter-attacks Dempsey received from Sword.

===Casualties===
Predictions of the casualties on Juno had been about 2,000 men, including 600 drowned. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division suffered 340 men killed, 574 wounded and 47 taken prisoner. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles suffered 143 casualties, the most of any battalion, the Royal Winnipegs 128, the North Shore 125 and the Regina Rifles 108. Of the landing craft used on the run-in to Juno, 90 of 306 were lost or damaged. Due to the lack of records for D-Day, casualties for the German 716th Infantry Division are unknown. Of the four German battalions numbering 7,771 men before the invasion, Richter reported that the equivalent of only one battalion—at 80 per cent strength—remained. At least one of the two conscript battalions of the 716th was reported to have fled. Richter also reported that 80 per cent of the divisional artillery had been destroyed or captured on D-Day, while only two gun batteries were intact west of the River Orne. By 9 June, the division had been reduced to a battlegroup of 292 officers and men.

==Commemoration==

The landing is commemorated today by the museum and memorial at the Juno Beach Centre in Courseulles-sur-Mer as well as exhibits at the Canadian War Museum and other Canadian military museums. One of the Sherman tanks that landed at Juno, the M4A3 Sherman &quot;Bomb&quot;, fought all the way into Germany and is today preserved at Sherbrooke, Quebec. In Bernières-sur-Mer, the owners of a house facing the beach hold memorial services yearly. The house is now named &quot;Canada House&quot;.

The last surviving member of the 48 Royal Marine Commandos who landed at Juno Beach is Dennis George Donovan.

<doc id="60120" wikidata="Q464257" url="?curid=60120" title="Omaha Beach">
<text>Omaha Beach was one of five beach landing sectors of the amphibious assault component of Operation Overlord during the Second World War.

On June 6, 1944, the Allies invaded German-occupied France with the Normandy landings. &quot;Omaha&quot; refers to an section of the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, from east of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to west of Vierville-sur-Mer on the right bank of the Douve river estuary. Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at Gold with the American landing to the west at Utah, thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Baie de Seine (Bay of the Seine river). Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport, and a naval bombardment force provided predominantly by the United States Navy and Coast Guard, with contributions from the British, Canadian and Free French navies.

The primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead deep, between Port-en-Bessin and the Vire river, linking with the British landings at Gold to the east, and reaching the area of Isigny to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah. The untested American 29th Infantry Division, along with nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc, assaulted the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half.

Opposing the landings was the German 352nd Infantry Division. Of its 12,020 men, 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a front. The German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line, and the defenses were mainly deployed in strongpoints along the coast.

The Allied plan called for initial assault waves of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces to reduce the coastal defenses, allowing larger ships to land in follow-up waves. But very little went as planned. Difficulties in navigation caused most of the landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted substantial casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under intense fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most well-defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.

== Terrain and defenses ==
The coastline of Normandy was divided into sixteen sectors, which were assigned code names using a spelling-alphabet - from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of Sword. The area of beach that would become Omaha was originally designated &quot;X-Ray&quot;, from the phonetic alphabet of the day; the name was changed on 3 March 1944. The names of both Omaha and Utah were probably suggested by Omar Bradley, as two privates fitting out his London headquarters were from Omaha, Nebraska (Gayle Eyler) and Provo, Utah; they were not named after the corps commanders, who were from Virginia (Gerow) and Louisiana (Collins). Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were divided into beaches identified by the colors Red, White and Green, corresponding to the colored lights used on naval craft to designate the port (left), amidships, and starboard (right) sides.

Omaha was bounded at either end by large rocky cliffs. The crescent-shaped beach presented a gently sloping tidal area averaging between low and high-water marks. Above the tide line was a bank of shingle high and up to wide in places. At the western end, the shingle bank rested against a stone (further east becoming wood) sea wall which ranged from in height. For the remaining two thirds of the beach after the seawall ended, the shingle lay against a low sand embankment. Behind the sand embankment and sea wall was a level shelf of sand, narrow at either end and extending up to inland in the center, and behind that rose steep escarpments or bluffs high, which dominated the whole beach and were cut into by small wooded valleys or draws at five points along the beach, codenamed west to east D-1, D-3, E-1, E-3 and F-1.

The German defensive preparations and the lack of any defense in depth indicated that their plan was to stop the invasion at the beaches. Four lines of obstacles were constructed in the intertidal zone. The first, a non-contiguous line with a small gap in the middle of Dog White and a larger gap across the whole of Easy Red, was out from the highwater line and consisted of 200 Belgian Gates with mines lashed to the uprights. behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into the sand pointing seaward, every third one capped with an anti-tank mine. Another shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards the shore, also with mines attached and designed to force flat-bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate the mine. The final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs from the shoreline. The area between the shingle bank and the bluffs was both wired and mined, and mines were also scattered on the bluff slopes.

Coastal troop deployments, comprising five companies of infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called &quot;Widerstandsnester&quot; (&quot;resistance nests&quot;), numbered WN-60 in the east to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. Obsolete VK 30.01 (H) tank turrets (from a panzer development program) armed with 75mm L/24 guns were re-used in permanent fortified bunkers. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could be brought to bear anywhere along the beach.

Allied intelligence had identified the coastal defenders as a reinforced battalion (800–1000 men) of the 716th Infantry Division. This was a static defensive division estimated to consist up to 50% of non-German troops, mostly Russians and Ukrainians, and German &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;. The recently activated but capable 352nd Infantry Division was believed to be inland at Saint-Lô and was regarded as the most likely force to be committed to a counter-attack. As part of Rommel&#x27;s strategy to concentrate defenses at the water&#x27;s edge, the 352nd had been ordered forward in March, taking over responsibility for the defense of the portion of the Normandy coast in which Omaha was located. As part of this reorganization, the 352nd also took under its command two battalions of the 726th Grenadier Regiment (part of the 716th Static Infantry Division) as well as the 439th Ost-Battalion, which had been attached to the 726th. Omaha fell mostly within &#x27;Coast Defense Sector 2&#x27;, which stretched westward from Colleville and allocated to the 916th Grenadier Regiment, with the third battalion 726th Grenadier Regiment attached. Two companies of the 726th manned strongpoints in the Vierville area while two companies of the 916th occupied the St. Laurent area strongpoints in the center of Omaha. These positions were supported by the artillery of the first and fourth battalions of the 352nd Artillery Regiment (twelve 105 mm and four 150 mm howitzers respectively). The two remaining companies of the 916th formed a reserve at Formigny, inland. East of Colleville, &#x27;Coast Defense Sector 3&#x27; was the responsibility of the remainder of the 726th Grenadier Regiment. Two companies were deployed at the coast, one in the most easterly series of strongpoints, with artillery support provided by the third battalion of the 352nd Artillery Regiment. The area reserve, comprising the two battalions of the 915th Grenadier Regiment and known as &#x27;Kampfgruppe Meyer&#x27;, was located south-east of Bayeux outside the immediate Omaha area.

The failure to identify the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the Allies. Post-action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance, a few days previously, as part of an anti-invasion exercise. The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D-Day as reported by the 16th Infantry S-3 D-Day Action Report. In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.

When General Omar Bradley expressed concern about Omaha Beach in January, a Royal Engineers team of Captain Logan Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Bruce Ogden-Smith showed him a sample of sand from the beach. They had swum ashore in Normandy from midget submarines over thirty times, to obtain sand samples to see whether the beaches would support tanks. Scott-Bowden said to him &quot;Sir, I hope you don&#x27;t mind me saying it, but this beach is a very formidable proposition indeed and there are bound to be tremendous casualties.&quot; Bradley put his hand on Scott-Bowden&#x27;s shoulder and replied, &quot;I know, my boy. I know.&quot;

== Plan ==
Omaha was divided into ten sectors, codenamed (from west to east): Charlie, Dog Green, Dog White, Dog Red, Easy Green, Easy White, Easy Red, Fox Green, Fox White, and Fox Red. The initial assault was to be made by two Regimental Combat Teams (RCT), supported by two tank battalions, with two battalions of Rangers also attached. The infantry regiments were organized into three battalions each of around 1,000 men. Each battalion was organized as three rifle companies each of up to 240 men, and a support company of up to 190 men. Infantry companies A through D belonged to the 1st battalion of a regiment, E through H to the 2nd, I through M to the 3rd; the letter ‘J’ was not used. (Individual companies will be referred to in this article by company and regiment, e.g. Company A of the 116th RCT will be &#x27;A/116&#x27;). In addition, each battalion had a headquarters company of up to 180 men. The tank battalions consisted of three companies, A through C, each of 16 tanks, while the Ranger battalions were organized into six companies, A through F, of around 65 men per company. V Corps&#x27; 56th Signal Battalion was responsible for communications on Omaha with the fleet offshore, especially routing requests for naval gunfire support to the destroyers and USS &quot;Arkansas&quot;.

The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in the western four beaches, to be followed 30 minutes later by the third battalion. Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion; two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly onto the beach from assault craft. To the left of the 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after, on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha. Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion, again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally. Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at Pointe du Hoc, to the west of Omaha. Meanwhile, C Company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at Pointe de la Percée. The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at Pointe du Hoc if that action proved to be successful, otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to Pointe du Hoc overland.

The landings were scheduled to start at 06:30, &quot;H-Hour&quot;, on a flooding tide, preceded by a 40-minute naval and 30-minute aerial bombardment of the beach defenses, with the DD tanks arriving five minutes before H-Hour. The infantry were organized into specially equipped assault sections, 32 men strong, one section to a landing craft, with each section assigned specific objectives in reducing the beach defenses. Immediately behind the first landings the Special Engineer Task Force was to land with the mission of clearing and marking lanes through the beach obstacles. This would allow the larger ships of the follow-up landings to get through safely at high tide. The landing of artillery support was scheduled to start at H+90 minutes while the main buildup of vehicles was to start at H+180 minutes. At H+195 minutes two further Regimental Combat Teams, the 115th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division and the 18th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division were to land, with the 26th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division to be landed on the orders of the V Corps commander.

The objective was for the beach defenses to be cleared by H+2 hours, whereupon the assault sections were to reorganize, continuing the battle in battalion formations. The draws were to be opened to allow traffic to exit the beach by H+3 hours. By the end of the day, the forces at Omaha were to have established a bridgehead deep, linked up with the British 50th Division landed at Gold to the east, and be in position to move on Isigny the next day, linking up with the American VII Corps at Utah to the west.

===Naval component===

Task Force O, commanded by Rear Admiral John L. Hall Jr., was the naval component responsible for transporting the troops across the channel and landing them on the beaches. The task force comprised four assault groups, a support group, a bombarding force, a minesweeper group, eight patrol craft, and three anti-submarine trawlers, numbering in total 1,028 vessels.

Assault groups O1 to O3, tasked with landing the main body of the assault, were organized along similar lines, with each comprising three infantry transports and varying numbers of tank landing ships (LST), Landing Craft Control (LCC), Landing Craft Infantry (LCI(L)), Landing Craft Tank (LCT), and Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM). Assault Group O4, tasked with landing the Rangers and the Special Engineer Task Force at Pointe du Hoc and Dog Green, comprised only six smaller infantry transports.

The infantry transports of assault groups O1 and O2 comprised two US Navy Attack Transport (APA or AP) ships and a Royal Navy Landing Ship, Infantry (Large) (LSI(L)). All three infantry transports of Assault Group O3 were US Navy AP ships. Each US transport typically carried 1,400 troops and 26 Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP, popularly known as &quot;Higgins Boats&quot;), while the British LSI(L) carried 900 to 1,400 troops and 18 Landing Craft Assault (LCA). The infantry transports of Assault Group O4 – all Royal Navy ships – comprised three LSI(S) and three LSI(H), all converted fast North Sea ferries. Each of them carried 200 to 250 troops and eight LCA.

The Support Group operated a mixture of gun, rocket, flak, tank, and smoke landing craft, totaling 67 vessels. The Minesweeper Group comprised four flotillas, the 4th comprising nine Royal Navy minesweepers; the 31st comprising nine minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy; the 104th comprising ten Royal Navy inshore minesweepers; and the 167th comprising ten Royal Navy coastal minesweepers. Bombarding Force C comprised two battleships, three cruisers (two Free French and one Royal Navy), and 13 destroyers (three of which were provided by the Royal Navy).

== Pre-landing bombardment ==
While reviewing Allied troops in England training for D-Day, General Omar Bradley promised that the Germans on the beach would be blasted with naval gunfire before the landing. &quot;You men should consider yourself lucky. You are going to have ringside seats for the greatest show on earth,&quot; he said, referring to the naval bombardment. However, Rear Admiral John L. Hall strongly disapproved of what he considered to be the small amount of air and naval bombardment used, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a crime to send men on the biggest amphibious attack in history with such inadequate naval gunfire support.&quot;

Just after 05:00 the Germans at Port-en-Bessin reported ships off the coast, and at 05:30 opened artillery fire on the destroyer . The destroyer was joined in returning fire by the Free French , and later by the battleship USS &quot;Arkansas&quot;. At 05:50 the planned naval bombardment began. Pointe-du-Hoc was targeted by the battleship , and the destroyers and , the latter having first destroyed the radar station at Pointe et Raz de la Percée.

The focus of the main naval bombardment was then switched to the beach defenses, and at 06:00, 36 M7 Priest howitzers and 34 tanks that were approaching the beach on LCTs began to supplement the naval guns. They were joined by fire from ten landing craft-mounted 4.7-inch guns and the rockets of nine Landing Craft Tank (Rocket), the latter planned to hit as the assault craft were just from the beach.

At 06:00, 448 Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the United States Army Air Forces, having already completed one bombing mission over Omaha late the previous day, returned. However, with the skies overcast and under orders to avoid bombing the troops which were by then approaching the beach, the bombers overshot their targets and only three bombs fell near the beach area.

Shortly after the bombardment began, the German 916th Grenadiers reported their positions to be under particularly intense fire, with the position at WN-60 very badly hit. Although the Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc were greatly assisted in their assault of the cliffs by the &quot;Satterlee&quot; and &quot;Talybont&quot;, elsewhere the air and naval bombardment was not so effective, and the German beach defenses and supporting artillery remained largely intact.

Later analysis of naval support during the pre-landing phase concluded that the navy had provided inadequate bombardment, given the size and extent of the planned assault. Kenneth P. Lord, a U.S. Army planner for the D-Day invasion, says that, upon hearing the naval gunfire support plan for Omaha, which limited support to one battleship, two cruisers and six destroyers, he and other planners were very upset, especially in light of the tremendous naval gunfire support given to landings in the Pacific.

Historian Adrian R. Lewis postulates that American casualties would have been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had been implemented, although the First Infantry Division Chief of Staff said that the Division would not have been able to move off the beach without effective naval gunfire.

== Initial assault ==


Despite these preparations, very little went according to plan. Ten landing craft were swamped by the rough seas before they reached the beach, and several others stayed afloat only because their passengers bailed water out with their helmets. Seasickness was prevalent among the troops waiting offshore. On the 16th RCT front, the landing boats passed struggling men in life preservers and on rafts, survivors of the DD tanks which had sunk in the rough sea. Navigation of the landing vehicles was made difficult by the smoke and mist obscuring the landmarks they were to use in guiding themselves in, while a strong current pushed them continually eastward.

As the boats approached to within a few hundred yards of the shore, they came under increasingly intense fire from automatic weapons and artillery. The force only then discovered the ineffectiveness of the pre-landing bombardment. The bombers, facing overcast conditions, had been ordered to implement a pre-arranged plan to compensate for decreased accuracy. The center of targeting was displaced inland to assure the safety of the landing allied troops. As a result, there was little or no damage to the beach defenses.

=== Tank landings ===
Because sea conditions were so rough, the decision was made for the 116th LCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion all the way to the beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were swamped while wading to shore. Coming in opposite the well-defended Vierville draw, Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its DD tanks. The other two companies landed to the left of B/743 without initial loss. On the 16th RCT front, the two DD tanks from the 741st Tank Battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto the beach because of their LCT&#x27;s damaged ramp. The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks (although three of these were quickly knocked out).

=== Infantry landings ===
Of the nine companies landing in the first wave, only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up scattered across the two beaches of the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900 m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half.

As infantry disembarked from the landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars out. To reach the beach they had to wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that made it to the shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost as they made their way westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.

Casualties were most severe among the troops landing at either end of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water&#x27;s edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.

L/16 eventually landed, 30 minutes late, to the left of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the of beach. The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs. They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.

=== Engineer landings ===
Like the infantry, the engineers had been pushed off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them. Working under intense fire, the engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40 percent.

== Second assault wave ==
With the initial targets unaccomplished, the second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements, support weapons and headquarters elements at 07:00 to face nearly the same difficulties as had the first. The second wave was larger, and so the defenders&#x27; fire was less concentrated. The survivors of the first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire, and in places the fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of the first wave. Failure to clear paths through the beach obstacles also added to the difficulties of the second wave. In addition, the incoming tide was beginning to hide the remaining obstacles, causing high attrition among the landing craft before they had reached the shore. As in the initial landings, difficult navigation caused disruptive mislandings, scattering the infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units.

On the 116th RCT front, the remainder of the 1st Battalion, B/116, C/116 and D/116, were due to land in support of A/116 at Dog Green. Three boats, including their headquarters and beach-master groups, landed too far west, under the cliffs. Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown, but the one-third to one-half that made it to shore spent the rest of the day pinned down by snipers. Not all sections of the badly scattered B/116 landed there, but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of A/116 fighting for survival at the water&#x27;s edge. Two companies of 2nd Rangers, coming in later on the edge of Dog Green, did manage to reach the seawall, but at the cost of half their strength.

To the left of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a different story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, with a handful of tanks from the first wave in sight. With the smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger battalion commander, Col. Max Schneider, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger&#x27;s landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brig. Gen. Norman &quot;Dutch&quot; Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.

Further east, the strongpoint defenses were effective. On the Dog Red/Easy Green boundary, the defenses around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on the remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green/Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT&#x27;s support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.

On the 16th RCT front, at the eastern end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support battalion to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16&#x27;s 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.

On the easternmost beach, Fox Green, elements of five different companies had become entangled, and the situation was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, three of the four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.

=== American situation ===
Along with the infantry landing in the second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.

Many half-tracks, jeeps and trucks foundered in deep water; those that made it ashore soon became jammed up on the narrowing beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.

The survivors at the shingle, many facing combat for the first time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses to the fate of neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.

=== German situation ===
By 07:35, the third battalion of the 726th Grenadier Regiment, defending Draw F-1 on Fox Green beach, was reporting that 100–200 American troops had penetrated the front, with troops inside the wire at WN-62 and WN-61 attacking the Germans from the rear. From the German vantage point at Pointe de la Percée, overlooking the whole beach from the western end, it seemed that the assault had been stopped at the beach. An officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles, and counted ten tanks burning. Thus, as late as 13:35, the 352nd division was reporting that the assault had been hurled back into the sea. Heinrich Severloh, a machine-gunner of the 352nd at WN62 was given the soubriquet &quot;The Beast of Omaha&quot;: he claimed to have fired that day 400 rounds from two rifles and a staggering 13,500 rounds from his MG 42; an ammunition weight of over 560 kg. An NCO ferried ammunition from a nearby underground bunker. Low on ammunition, he even fired phosphorescent tracer rounds, which revealed his position.

Casualties among the defenders were mounting. While the 916th Regiment, defending the center of the 352nd zone, was reporting that the landings had been frustrated, it was also requesting reinforcements. The request could not be met, because the situation elsewhere in Normandy was becoming more urgent for the defenders. The reserve force of the German 352nd Division, the 915th Regiment, which had earlier been deployed against the US airborne landings to the west of Omaha, was diverted to the Gold Beach zone east of Omaha, where German defenses were crumbling.

== Breakthrough ==
The key geographical features that had influenced the landings also influenced the next phase of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.

The other key aspect of the next few hours was leadership. The original plan was in tatters, with so many units mis-landed, disorganized and scattered. Most commanders had fallen or were absent, and there were few ways to communicate, other than shouted commands. In places, small groups of men, sometimes scratched together from different companies, in some cases from different divisions, were &quot;...inspired, encouraged or bullied...&quot; out of the relative safety of the shingle, starting the dangerous task of reducing the defenses atop the bluffs.

=== Assaulting the bluffs ===
Survivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the first wave landed on Dog Green around 06:45; by 07:30, they had scaled the cliffs near Dog Green and the Vierville draw. They were joined later by a mis-landed section from B/116, and this group spent the better part of the day tying up and eventually taking WN-73, which defended draw D-1 at Vierville.

At 07:50, Cota led the charge off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party established themselves at the top of the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00, more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.

The 3rd battalion 116th RCT forced its way across the flats and up the bluff between WN-66 (which defended the D-3 draw at Les Moulins), and WN-65 (defending the E-1 draw). They advanced in small groups, supported by the heavy weapons of M/116, who were held at the base of the bluff. Progress was slowed by mines on the slopes of the bluff, but elements of all three rifle companies, as well as a stray section of G/116, had gained the top by 09:00, causing the defenders at WN-62 to mistakenly report that both WN-65 and WN-66 had been taken.

Between 07:30 and 08:30 elements of G/16, E/16, and E/116 came together and climbed the bluffs at Easy Red, between WN-64 (defending the E-1 draw) and WN-62 (the E-3 draw). At 09:05, German observers reported that WN-61 was lost, and that one machine gun was still firing from WN-62. 150 men, mostly from G/16, having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire, continued south to attack the WN-63 command post on the edge of Colleville. Meanwhile, E/16, led by Second Lieutenant John M. Spalding and Captain Robert L. Sheppard V, turned westward along the top of the bluffs, engaging in a two-hour battle for WN-64. His small group of just four men had effectively neutralized this point by mid-morning, taking 21 prisoners—just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops. On the beach below, the 16th RCT commander, Colonel George Taylor had landed at 08:15. With the words &quot;Two kinds of people are staying on this beach, the dead and those who are going to die – now let&#x27;s get the hell out of here!&quot; he organized groups of men regardless of their unit, putting them under the command of the nearest non-commissioned officer and sending them through the area opened up by G/16. By 09:30, the regimental command post was set up just below the bluff crest, and the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 16th RCT were being sent inland as they reached the crest.

On Fox Green, at the eastern end of Omaha, four sections of L/16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of I/16, K/16 and E/116 up the slopes. With supporting fire from the heavy weapons of M/16, tanks and destroyers, this force eliminated WN-60, which defended the draw at F-1; by 09:00, the 3rd battalion 16th RCT was moving inland.

=== Naval support ===
The only artillery support for the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy. Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches. The destroyers were able to get in closer, and from 08:00 began engaging their own targets. At 09:50, two minutes after the destroyed a 75 mm gun position in WN-74, the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible. Some approached within several times, scraping bottom and risking running aground. An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red, watching the &quot;Frankford&quot; steaming in towards shore, thought she had been badly hit and was being beached. Instead, she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards, guns blazing at targets of opportunity. Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the &quot;Frankford&quot; saw an immobilized tank at the water&#x27;s edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own. In this manner, the tank acted as the ship&#x27;s fire control party for several minutes.

=== German defenses inland ===
While the coastal defenses had not turned back the invasion at the beach, they had broken up and weakened the assault formations struggling through them. The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives. As an example of the effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One platoon attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position to the left of the first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.

== Beachhead ==
Despite penetrations inland, the key beach objectives had not been achieved. The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach had not been opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance. The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red.

Where vehicles were landing, they found a narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire. Around 08:30, commanders suspended all such landings. This caused a jam of landing craft out to sea. The DUKWs had a particularly hard time of it in the rough conditions. Thirteen DUKWs carried the 111th Field Artillery Battalion of the 116th RCT; five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT, four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area while waiting to land, and one capsized as they turned for the beach. Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea. This one gun eventually landed in the afternoon.

The official record of Omaha reports that &quot;...the tanks were leading a hard life...&quot;. According to the commander of the 2nd battalion 116th RCT the tanks &quot;...saved the day. They shot the hell out of the Germans, and got the hell shot out of them.&quot; As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced, often by tanks. Scattered along the length of the beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st Tank Battalion lost three out of their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.

Reinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion, beginning with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion offshore. Casualties were light, though. Despite the existence of a narrow channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss of 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending the entrance to the E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.

By early afternoon, the strong-point guarding the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough force on the ground to mop up the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.

The advance of the 18th RCT cleared away the last remnants of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up the western side of this draw, it became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.

The F-1 draw, initially considered too steep for use, was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road. In the absence of any real progress opening the D-3 and E-3 draws, landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route, and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20:00.

Approaches to the exits were also cleared, with minefields lifted and holes blown in the embankment to permit the passage of vehicles. As the tide receded, engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles, and by the end of the evening, 13 gaps were opened and marked.

== German reactions ==
Observing the build-up of shipping off the beach, and in an attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at Omaha, a battalion was detached from the 915th Regiment being deployed against the British to the east. Along with an anti-tank company, this force was attached to the 916th Regiment and committed to a counterattack in the Colleville area in the early afternoon. It was stopped by &quot;firm American resistance&quot; and reported heavy losses. 

The strategic situation in Normandy precluded the reinforcement of the weakened 352nd Division. The main threat was felt by the Germans to be the British beachheads to the east of Omaha, and these received the most attention from the German mobile reserves in the immediate area of Normandy. Preparations were made to bring up units stationed for the defense of Brittany, southwest of Normandy, but these would not arrive quickly and would be subject to losses inflicted in transit by overwhelming Allied air superiority. The last reserve of the 352nd Division, an engineer battalion, was attached to the 916th Regiment in the evening. It was deployed to defend against the expected attempt to break out of the Colleville-St. Laurent beachhead established on the 16th RCT front. 

At midnight General Dietrich Kraiss, commander of the 352nd Division, reported the total loss of men and equipment in the coastal positions. He advised that he had sufficient forces to contain the Americans on D+1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter. He was told that there were no more reserves available.

== RAF at Omaha Beach ==
In order to provide frontline infantry the best possible aerial protection, both on the beaches and as they moved forward to secure the beachhead, it was necessary that the Allied Air Forces provided radar detection and guidance to be in place on the evening of the D-Day invasion.

As a result, a small force of about 160 Royal Air Force technical personnel, together with their attached supporting signals and other units, were scheduled to land on Omaha beach in Normandy at high tide on D-Day (about 11:00hrs), immediately after the first waves of American assault troops had secured the beach and their engineers had made it safe.

As the United States did not have their own radar available by D-Day, it was agreed that a British Mobile Ground Controlled Interception Radar Units, (GCI 15082), would be lent to the US. The British mobile radars, being able to detect the range, bearing and height of potential enemy aircraft, were ideally suited for this role, provided they could be located on favorable sites and were available for immediate use on the night of the landings. GCI 15082 was formed as a Ground Controlled Interception unit in August 1943 at Renscombe Down, near Swanage in Dorset. It was equipped with what was then the latest in radar, including height-finding apparatus, and it was used primarily for the control of night fighters in forward fighting areas. The unit was mobile, with heavy equipment mounted on Crossley trucks and smaller apparatus on Bedfords. Operational status, following arrival at a designated site, was expected to be reached in two hours.

In order to provide this air cover, three Base Defence Wings (re-designated as &quot;Sectors&quot; – BDS - in May 1944) were begun to be formed from 1 January 1944 with the appointment of Group Captain Moseby as the Commanding Officer of No. 21 BDS at RAF Church Fenton, North Riding of Yorkshire. At a later date, the second and third Wings, Nos 24 and 25, were formed, the former with effect from 1 February 1944 at RAF Acklington, Northumberland, and the latter with effect from 1 March 1944 at RAF Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire.

The plan had been for 21 BDS to land at Easy Red Beach at around 11.30 am when the tide would be in and to drive ashore. However, at the appointed hour for 21 BDS to land, the beach had not been taken, so they were ordered to circle offshore until the situation improved. Slowly, US Forces began to penetrate the bluffs and by early afternoon, at several points along the beach, advances were being made. By mid-afternoon, the first draw had been taken (E-1), quickly followed by E-3. There was now a chance to land 21 BDS, and so at 5.00pm, 6 hours behind schedule, they were ordered in. However, while they should have landed at the E-1 draw, they were actually put ashore closer to the D-3 draw, which was still being viciously fought over. The tide was also low, and so the vehicles were dropped far out on the flat, sandy beach into low water. There were deep, hidden channels. The whole contents of one LCT drove off the ship and straight into a deep channel, never to be seen again.

Other vehicles became stuck in deep sand and mud and became drowned out by the advancing tide. Those that made it to the edge of the shingle found themselves trapped with no exit off the beach. They became sitting targets for the German mortar and artillery shells that picked them off, one after another.

The US forces that were on the beach with them were traumatized and immobile. Many men were dead or injured. 21 BDS’ position was grave, and they too were suffering casualties. The only solution was to get off the beach and get into the shelter of a ravine.

Several of the British officers managed to organize themselves and some of the Americans to utilize an abandoned bulldozer to break through the shingle and effect their escape. Their plan was successful, and the remaining, unscathed vehicles were driven a few hundred yards to the comparative safety of the destroyed hamlet of Les Moulins. Out of the original 27 vehicles, only 8 survived, and 21 BDS had lost 11 dead and 39 seriously injured out of their starting complement of about 150. Six men were awarded either the Military Cross or Military Medal from 21 BDS.

Along with many detachments of the US 5th Army, they had suffered shocking losses, and had endured a frightening ordeal. Despite losing most of their equipment, they were able to re-group on 7 June and salvage some vehicles from the beach, though still under sniper fire. By the 8th June, they had established a temporary working base at the airstrip close to St. Laurent and claimed their first “kill” on the 9th June.

One tragic error that the RAF committed was to send these men into conflict in their RAF blue battle dress, treated with “anti gas” material - once this uniform got wet, it became more grey than blue and became far too similar to the German grey uniform. It was reported that, on many occasions, the ill-fated 21 BDS were being shot at from both sides.

Replacement vehicles and men were sent over after a week or so, and the rest of 21 BDS were operational by 1 July. 21 BDS went on to become the joint most successful GCI unit on the Western Front, with over 46 enemy aircraft downed in the first three months of the invasion alone.

==End of day==
Following the penetrations inland, confused hard-fought individual actions pushed the foothold out deep in the Colleville area to the east, less than that west of St. Laurent, and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area. Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line, and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire. At 21:00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry, but losses in equipment were high, including 26 artillery pieces, over 50 tanks, about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels.

Only 100 of the 2,400 tons of supplies scheduled to be landed on D-Day were landed. An accurate figure for casualties incurred by V Corps at Omaha on 6 June is not known; sources vary between 5,000 and over 6,000 killed, wounded, and missing, with the heaviest losses incurred by the infantry, tanks and engineers in the first landings. Only five tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were ready for action the next day. The German 352nd division suffered 1,200 killed, wounded and missing; about 20% of its strength. Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. First Army, at one stage considered evacuating Omaha, while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold.

== Aftermath ==
The foothold gained on D-Day at Omaha, itself two isolated pockets, was the most tenuous across all the D-Day beaches. With the original objective yet to be achieved, the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads. During the course of June 7, while still under sporadic shellfire, the beach was prepared as a supply area. Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and, while still less than planned, 1,429 tons of stores were landed that day.

With the beach assault phase completed the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions and over the course of the next two days achieved the original D-Day objectives. On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN-63 and Colleville, both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port-en-Bessin. The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. 

The most intense opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. 

The 26th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin. By the morning of June 9, the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps, thus linking Omaha with Gold.

On the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment cleared the last defenders from the bluffs while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast. This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost-Battalion to withdraw from the Grandcamp area which lay further to the west. Early on June 7 WN-69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south-west, reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D-Day phase line the following day. The third regiment of 29th Division; the 175th, started landing on June 7. By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the 101st Airborne Division, thus linking Omaha with Utah.

In the meantime, the original defender at Omaha, the 352nd Division, was being steadily reduced. By the morning of June 9 the division was reported as having been &quot;...reduced to &#x27;small groups&#x27;...&quot; while the 726th Grenadier Regiment had &quot;...practically disappeared.&quot; By June 11 the effectiveness of the 352nd was regarded as &quot;very slight&quot;, and by June 14 the German corps command was reporting the 352nd as completely used up and needing to be removed from the line.

Once the beachhead had been secured, Omaha became the location of one of the two Mulberry harbors, prefabricated artificial harbors towed in pieces across the English Channel and assembled just off shore. Construction of &#x27;Mulberry A&#x27; at Omaha began the day after D-Day with the scuttling of ships to form a breakwater. By D+10 the harbor became operational when the first pier was completed; &quot;LST 342&quot; docking and unloading 78 vehicles in 38 minutes. Three days later the worst storm to hit Normandy in 40 years began to blow, raging for three days and not abating until the night of June 22. The harbor was so badly damaged that the decision was taken not to repair it; supplies being subsequently landed directly on the beach until fixed port facilities were captured. In the few days that the harbor was operational, 11,000 troops, 2,000 vehicles and 9,000 tons of equipment and supplies were brought ashore. Over the 100 days following D-Day more than 1,000,000 tons of supplies, 100,000 vehicles and 600,000 men were landed, and 93,000 casualties were evacuated, via Omaha.

Today at Omaha jagged remains of the harbor can be seen at low tide. The shingle bank is no longer there, cleared by engineers in the days following D-Day to facilitate the landing of supplies. The beachfront is more built-up and the beach road extended, villages have grown and merged, but the geography of the beach remains as it was and the remains of the coastal defenses can still be visited. At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery. In 1988, particles of shrapnel, as well as glass and iron beads resulting from munitions explosions were found in the sand of the beach, and the study of them estimated that those particles would remain in the sand of the beach for one to two centuries.

<text>Operation Fortitude was a military deception operation by the Allied nations as part of Operation Bodyguard, an overall deception strategy during the buildup to the 1944 Normandy landings. Fortitude was divided into two subplans, North and South, and had the aim of misleading the German High Command as to the location of the invasion.

Fortitude had evolved from plans submitted by Noel Wild, the head of Ops (B), and John Bevan, from the London Controlling Section in late 1943. Early revisions in January 1944 suggested a fictional buildup of troops in southern England with the hope of drawing German attention to the Calais region. Colonel David Strangeways, head of Montgomery&#x27;s R Force deception staff, was unimpressed with the approach. He was widely critical of the original plan and eventually rewrote the Fortitude deception with a focus on creating a more realistic threat.

Both Fortitude plans involved the creation of phantom field armies (based in Edinburgh and southern England), which threatened Norway (Fortitude North) and Pas de Calais (Fortitude South). The operation was intended to divert Axis attention away from Normandy and, after the invasion on 6 June 1944, to delay reinforcement by convincing the Germans that the landings had been purely a diversionary attack.

==Background==
Fortitude was one of the major elements of Operation Bodyguard, the overall Allied deception stratagem for the Normandy landings. Bodyguard&#x27;s main objectives were to ensure that the Germans would not increase troop presence in Normandy and to do so by promoting the appearance that the Allies would attack in other locations. It consisted of a wide range of deceptions ranging across the European front, with Operation Fortitude representing the main effort to misdirect the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (German High Command) to believe in specific mainland invasion objectives.

The problem facing the Allies was that France was the most logical choice for an invasion into mainland Europe. Therefore, the Allied high command had only a small geographical area across which to mislead the German defences. Montgomery, commanding the Allied landing forces, knew that the crucial aspect of any invasion was the ability to enlarge a beachhead into a full front. He also had only 37 divisions at his command, compared to around 60 German formations. That meant that any deception would have to convince the German high command that the Allies were not committing their full forces into Normandy, but holding many of those formations in reserve. After the landings, there would then need to be some way to delay the movement of German reserves to the Normandy beachhead to prevent a potentially disastrous counterattack.

Operation Fortitude focused on creating invasion threats from the United Kingdom into various parts of Western Europe. The plan was eventually split into two parts, North and South. Fortitude South focused on creating confusion about the Allied Channel crossing, and Fortitude North, staged out of Scotland, introduced a threat to occupied Norway. Planning for Bodyguard overall came under the auspices of the London Controlling Section (LCS), a secret body that was set up to manage Allied deception strategy during the war. However, the execution of individual plans fell to the various theatre commanders. In the case of Fortitude, it was Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), under General Dwight D. Eisenhower and specifically 21st Army Group, the invasion force, under the command of General Bernard Montgomery. A special section, Ops (B), was established at SHAEF to handle Fortitude, and Montgomery formed R Force under his command to handle the tactical elements of deception.

===Deception techniques===
The idea of creating fake formations as a method of deception had been pioneered in Cairo by Dudley Clarke&#x27;s &#x27;A&#x27; Force earlier in the war. Fortitude made heavy use of Clarke&#x27;s techniques for inflating the size of an army and used a number of methodologies which had come to be referred to as &quot;special means.&quot; They included combinations of physical deception, fake wireless (radio) activity, leaks through diplomatic channels or double agents and the usage of notable officers in fake formations.

One of the main deception channels for the Allies was the use of double agents. B1A, the Counter-Intelligence Division of MI5, had done a good job in intercepting numerous German agents in Britain. Many of them were recruited as double agents under the Double Cross System. For Fortitude, the intelligence agencies made particular use of three agents:

* Juan Pujol García (Garbo), a Spanish citizen who volunteered to set himself up as a double agent. Garbo was a key agent for the Fortitude deception. His fictional network of 27 agents across Britain was an excellent way to create the impression of additional formations. He was so trusted he was awarded the Iron Cross (for his efforts on D-Day, he was awarded an MBE).
* Roman Czerniawski (Brutus), a Polish officer who ran an intelligence network for the Allies in occupied France. Captured by the Germans, he was offered a chance to work for them as a spy. On his arrival in Britain, he turned himself in to British intelligence.
* Dušan Popov (Tricycle), a Yugoslav lawyer, whose flamboyant lifestyle covered his intelligence activities.

==Planning==
Detailed planning ostensibly sat with Noel Wild and his Ops (B) staff. In practice, it was a collaboration between Wild and the heads of the London Controlling Section and B1a. Work began in December 1943 under the codename Mespot. Wild&#x27;s first version of the Fortitude plan was socialised in early January 1943 with SHAEF, political leaders and the staff officers of the 21st Army Group. That iteration aimed to take advantage of the likelihood that the Germans would notice invasion preparations in southern England. Wild wanted to create the impression that an invasion was aimed at the Pas-de-Calais slightly later in the year (July, instead of June). Once the real invasion had landed, six fictional divisions would then keep the threat to Calais alive.

Colonel David Strangeways, head of Montgomery&#x27;s R Force, raised concerns about the entire plan. Strangeways argued that the plan aimed to cover the Allies&#x27; real intentions, instead of creating a realistic threat to Calais to which Axis forces would be forced respond in defence. He was concerned the Germans might well be aware of the Allied readiness in southern England and so they would be alert to the risk of an invasion in early June. However, that would realise this gave them several weeks to defeat any bridgehead and return to defend Calais. On 25 January, Montgomery&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Francis de Guingand, sent a letter to the deception planners that asked them to focus on Pas-de-Calais as the main assault and was almost certainly sent at the behest of Strangeways.

With those criticisms in hand, Wild produced his final draft for Fortitude. In the revised plan, which was issued on 30 January and approved by the Allied chiefs on 18 February, fifty divisions would be positioned in Southern England to attack Pas de Calais. After the real invasion had landed, the story would change to suggest to the Germans that several assault divisions remained in England that were ready to conduct a cross-Channel attack once the Normandy beachhead had drawn German defences away from Calais. The plan still retained some of its initial form, most notably since the first part of the story still aimed to suggest an invasion date of mid-July. At that point, Winston Churchill judged &#x27;Mespot&#x27; to be an unsuitable name and so &#x27;Fortitude&#x27; was adopted from an alternative list on 18 February.

===Strangeways rewrite===
Strangeways was still unimpressed with the Fortitude outline, and, according to Ops (B)&#x27;s Christopher Harmer, in mid-February, he set out to ride &quot;roughshod over the established deception organization&quot;. Harmer writes that Strangeways displayed the same arrogance as his commanding officer. Montgomery was famously opinionated and held a low opinion of the London establishment of the &quot;old boys&#x27;&quot; of Ops (B) and the LCS. More importantly, however, he had worked under Dudley Clarke in Cairo during the beginning of the war and had extensive experience of deception operations.

In North Africa, he had learned Clarke&#x27;s maxim that deception relied on getting the enemy to do something, not just to think something, and so his criticism focused on that. He pointed out that convincing the Germans of so many fictional divisions would be difficult, and even more so would be convincing them of Montgomery&#x27;s ability to manage two entire invasions at the same time. Wild&#x27;s plan outlined ten divisions for the Calais assault, six of them being fictional and the remainder being the real American V Corps and British I Corps. However, the corps would be part of the actual Normandy invasion and so it would be difficult to imply Calais as the main assault after D-Day. Strangeways&#x27;s final concerns related to the effort required for physical deception, as the plan called for large numbers of troop movements and dummy craft.

Strangeways&#x27;s objections were strong, and having responsibility for the plan&#x27;s implementation, he refused to undertake most of the physical deception. A power struggle ensued throughout February and early March between Ops (B) and Strangeways as to who had authority to implement each part of the deception plan. Montgomery put his full support behind his head of deception and so Strangeways prevailed. Finally, in a 23 February meeting between R Force and Ops (B), Strangeways tore up a copy of the plan, declared it useless, and announced that he would rewrite it from scratch. The established deceivers were dubious about Strangeways&#x27;s announcement and assumed that he would resubmit the existing plan with some modifications. However, he duly submitted a rewritten operation that was met, in Harmer&#x27;s words, with &quot;astonishment&quot;.

===Quicksilver===
Strangeways&#x27;s revised Fortitude plan and an operational implementation, dubbed Quicksilver, invented an entire new field army but crucially without significant fictional forces. The skeleton of the new force already existed in the form of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG), commanded by Omar Bradley. It had been formed for administrative purposes but never used, but the Germans had discovered its existence through radio intercepts. Strangeways proposed activating the unit, with a series of fictional and real formations. The order of battle for the army would be intended to represent the bulk of Allied forces in England and therefore the main Allied threat. To add credence to the importance of FUSAG, Bradley was replaced by Lieutenant General George Patton, whom the Germans held in high regard and who was known to be a competitor to Montgomery.

The Fortitude South story would be that FUSAG was being prepared to invade Pas-de-Calais some weeks after an initial diversionary invasion. That would allow Operation Neptune&#x27;s landings to be passed off as a distraction from the later main invasion. Pas-de-Calais offered a number of advantages over the real invasion site, such as by being the shortest crossing of the English Channel and the quickest route into Germany. As a result, Erwin Rommel had taken steps to fortify that area of coastline heavily. Strangeways felt that would help the deception seem realistic in the minds of German high command.

A deception of such a size required significant organisation and input from many organisations, including MI5, MI6, SHAEF via Ops B, and the armed services. Information from the various deception agencies was organised by and channelled through the London Controlling Section. To help keep the approach well-organised, Strangeways divided the implementation stages into six subplans, codenamed Quicksilver.


The FUSAG deception was not implemented primarily with dummy tanks, aeroplanes, or other vehicles. At that stage of the war, the Germans were unable to fly reconnaissance planes over England and so Strangeways felt that such effort would have been wasted. However, temporary buildings were constructed and dummy landing craft were stationed at likely embarkation point in the East and the South-East of England. As the FUSAG commander, Patton paid many of them a visit, along with a photographer, to ensure that their location was noted. The landing craft, built from wood and canvas and nicknamed Bigbob&#x27;s, suffered from being too light. Wind and rain flipped many of them over or ran them to ground during the operation.

Instead of extensive physical measures, most of Strangeway&#x27;s plan relied on radio signals and leaks through double agents. Managing that information flow had to be done with caution since leaking supposed top-secret invasion plans would have been very obvious. Instead, the deceivers used tactics developed by Clarke in Cairo. Agents were allowed to report minutiae such as insignia on soldiers&#x27; uniforms and unit markings on vehicles to allow the Germans to build up a picture. The observations in the south-central areas largely gave accurate information about the real invasion forces since Clarke had stressed that using as much real information as possible led to better outcomes. Reports from the South-West of England indicated few troop sightings, but in reality, many units were housed there in preparation for D-Day. Reports from the South-East depicted largely-notional Quicksilver forces. That approach aimed to convince German intelligence services of an order of battle for the Allied forces that placed the centre of gravity of the invasion force opposite Pas-de-Calais.

==Fortitude North==
Fortitude North was designed to mislead the Germans into expecting an invasion of Norway. By threatening any weakened Norwegian defence, the Allies hoped to prevent or to delay reinforcement of France after the Normandy invasion. The plan involved simulating a buildup of forces in northern England and political contact with Sweden.

During a similar operation in 1943, Operation Tindall, a fictional field army (British Fourth Army) had been created, headquartered in Edinburgh Castle. It was decided to continue to use the same force during Fortitude. Unlike its southern counterpart, the deception relied primarily on fake radio traffic since it was judged unlikely that German reconnaissance planes could reach Scotland without being intercepted. False information about the arrival of troops in the area was reported by the double agents Mutt and Jeff, who had surrendered following after their 1941 landing in the Moray Firth, and the British media co-operated by broadcasting fake information, such as football scores or wedding announcements, to nonexistent troops. Fortitude North was so successful that by late spring 1944, Hitler had positioned 13 army divisions in Norway.

In the early spring of 1944, British commandos attacked targets in Norway to simulate preparations for invasion. They destroyed industrial targets, such as shipping and power infrastructure and military outposts. That coincided with an increase in naval activity in the northern seas and in political pressure on neutral Sweden.

Similar to the operation in the south, Fortitude North had a subsidiary plan used to implement the extensive radio deceptions. Codenamed Operation Skye, it began on 22 March 1944, was overseen by Colonel R. M. McLeod, and became fully operational by 6 April. Skye was split into four sections, relating to different divisions of the Fourth Army

==After invasion==
On 20 July, Ops (B) took over control of Fortitude South from R Force. The previous month, it had begun work to follow up the operation. The new story centered on the idea that Eisenhower had decided to defeat the Germans through the existing beachhead. As a result, elements of FUSAG had been detached and sent to reinforce Normandy, and a second smaller Second American Army Group (SUSAG) would be formed to threaten the Pas-de-Calais.

The plan again met criticism from Strangeways. Firstly, he opposed the creation of so many fictional US formations in the face of a known manpower shortage. Secondly, the new plan reduced the threat to Pas-de-Calais which might give the German command confidence to move the Fifteenth Army to reinforce Normandy. As before, in late June, Strangeways rewrote the operation to ensure that the focus remained on Calais. In his version, the Normandy beachhead was struggling to succeed and so Eisenhower had taken elements of FUSAG to reinforce its efforts. FUSAG would then be rebuilt with newly-arrived US formations with the aim of landing in France toward the end of July.

In order to explain Patton&#x27;s appearance in Normandy, news was transmitted of a rumour that Patton had refused to transfer any of his units to Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group, and as a result had been demoted and given the lesser command of the Third United States Army. His replacement at FUSAG was Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, but after touring Southeast England, he visited Normandy where he was accidentally killed on 24 July in an Allied air raid and was subsequently replaced by General John L. DeWitt. 

Through the evolved plan, the Allies maintained the pretense of FUSAG and other forces threatening Pas-de-Calais for some considerable time after D-Day, possibly even as late as September 1944. That was vital to the success of the Allied plan by forcing the Germans to keep most of their reserves bottled up in wait for an attack on Calais that never came. That allowed the Allies to maintain and to build upon their foothold in Normandy. Having served its purpose, on 28 September 1944, it was agreed to end the Fortitude deception and to move any remaining operational deceptions in the field to the overall charge of Ops (B).

==Impact==
The Allies were able to judge how well Fortitude worked because of Ultra, the signals intelligence that was obtained by breaking German codes and ciphers. On 1 June, a decrypted transmission by Hiroshi Ōshima, the Japanese ambassador, to his government recounted a recent conversation with Hitler and confirmed the effectiveness of Fortitude. When asked for Hitler&#x27;s thoughts on the Allied battle plan, he had said, &quot;I think that diversionary actions will take place in a number of places against Norway, Denmark, the southern part of western France, and the French Mediterranean coast&quot;. He added that he expected the Allies would then attack in force across the Strait of Dover.

The deception was also assisted by very high German assessments of Allied capabilities. In an appreciation of 8 May von Rundstedt said:

During the course of Fortitude, the almost-complete lack of German aerial reconnaissance, together with the absence of uncontrolled German agents in Britain, came to make physical deception almost irrelevant. The unreliability of &quot;diplomatic leaks&quot; resulted in their discontinuance. Most deception in the south was carried out by means of false wireless traffic and through German double agents. However, those methods had significantly less impact for Fortitude North. In his 2000 book, &quot;Fortitude: The D-Day Deception Campaign&quot;, Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh, a member of Ops (B), concluded that &quot;no evidence has so far been found to show that wireless deception or visual misdirection made any contribution&quot;. It is thought that the Germans were not actually monitoring the radio traffic that was being simulated.

Overall, Fortitude was successful for several reasons:

* The long-term view taken by British Intelligence to cultivate double agents as channels of disinformation to the enemy.
* The use of Ultra decrypts of machine-encrypted messages between the Abwehr and the German High Command, which quickly indicated the effectiveness of deception tactics. That is one of the early uses of a closed-loop deception system. The messages were usually encrypted by Fish, rather than Enigma machines.
* Reginald Victor Jones, the Assistant Director Intelligence (Science) at the British Air Ministry, insisted that for reasons of tactical deception, for every radar station attacked within the real invasion area, two were to be attacked outside it.
* The extensive nature of the German intelligence machinery and the rivalry among the various elements.
* General George Patton was the leader whom the Germans feared the most, and they considered him the Allies&#x27; best general. Therefore, the German High Command believed that he would lead the daring attack.

One author says that on 5 June before he gave the &quot;Go&quot; message for Overlord, Eisenhower received a message that was couriered from Bletchley Park and had been sent by Hitler to Rommel with battle orders that the invasion of Normandy was imminent but that it was a feint to draw troops away from the real invasion five days later against the Channel Ports, and Rommel was not to move any troops. That would mean that the Allies would have five days without determined opposition. It was sent in a &quot;Fish&quot; radio message and decrypted by Colossus, according to an account by Tommy Flowers. Another author doubts whether Hitler would have sent messages about the invasion at the time since the invasion fleet had sailed on 4 June but was then postponed for 24 hours, and even with Colossus, Fish decrypts could take days or weeks. He thinks that Flowers may have embellished or misremembered the story in later life. Hitler’s views on the real invasion are widely attributed to the message from the Japanese ambassador to Berlin, Ōshima, after a 27 May meeting. Anyway, during the first week of June 1944, Eisenhower was more concerned with the weather than whether the Germans had been misled about the invasion&#x27;s location.

==Fictional depictions==
Operation Fortitude was classified, along with all of the wartime deceptions, and initial accounts did not emerge until the 1970s. Once published, however, the story inspired a number of fictional accounts:

* &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; is a 1978 novel by Ken Follett about a Nazi spy stationed in the south of England who discovers the Allied deception and races to inform the German leadership. It was subsequently adapted into a 1981 film of the same name, starring Donald Sutherland.
* &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; is a 1986 novel by Larry Collins about a French agent, Catherine Pradier, who risks her life to deceive the Nazis as to where and when the Allies will invade the Continent of Europe and begin the end of World War II.
*Jack Higgins&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot; ends with a conference between Adolf Hitler and two-high ranking German military intelligence officers, including &quot;Abwehr&quot; head Wilhelm Canaris, who are solidly convinced that the Allies are planning to invade Normandy, but Hitler is unswayed from his belief that Calais is the intended target.
* &quot;The Unlikely Spy&quot; is a 1996 novel by Daniel Silva that likewise focuses on Allied attempts to carry out Fortitude as well as a German agent&#x27;s race to discover the true plans.
* &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; is a BBC TV comedy series that features a time-traveller, Gary Sparrow. In two episodes of Series 5 aired in 1998, Gary, when he returns to 1944, appears to be the double of one of General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s aides. He is used in that guise by MI5 and is sent to Calais; he makes contact with the French Resistance but is captured by the Gestapo. All of that was planned to reinforce the Pas-de-Calais invasion deception. Luckily, Gary is able to escape and to return to England.
* &quot;Blackout&quot; and &quot;All Clear&quot;, is a 2010 two-volume novel by Connie Willis, about time-travelling historians who study the events of the Battle of Britain. One of the historians, posing as an American journalist, ends up working for Operation Fortitude.
* In a lawsuit, aspiring screenwriter Simon Afram stated that he gave director Martin Scorsese $500,000 to develop his screenplay about the event, which was titled &quot;Operation Fortitude&quot;, only for Scorsese to then do nothing. The lawsuit would be settled in March 2024.

<text>Montmartre ( , , ) is a large hill in Paris&#x27;s northern 18th arrondissement. It is high and gives its name to the surrounding district, part of the Right Bank. Montmartre is primarily known for its artistic history, for the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur on its summit, and as a nightclub district.

The other church on the hill, Saint Pierre de Montmartre, built in 1147, was the church of the prestigious Montmartre Abbey. On 15 August 1534, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Saint Francis Xavier and five other companions bound themselves by vows in the Martyrium of Saint Denis, 11 Rue Yvonne Le Tac, the first step in the creation of the Jesuits.

Near the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, during the Belle Époque, many artists lived, worked, or had studios in or around Montmartre, including Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Suzanne Valadon, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, Camille Pissarro and Vincent van Gogh. Montmartre is also the setting for several hit films.

The area is served by the underground Métro, with Line 2 stations at Barbès–Rochechouart, Anvers, Pigalle and Blanche, Line 4 stations at Château Rouge and Barbès–Rochechouart, as well as Line 12 stations at Pigalle, Abbesses, Lamarck–Caulaincourt and Jules Joffrin. It is also served by the Montmartre Funicular. The historic district established by the City of Paris in 1995 contains . and is bordered by Rue Caulaincourt and Rue Custine on the north, the Rue de Clignancourt on the east and the Boulevard de Clichy and Boulevard de Rochechouart to the south.

==Etymology==
The toponym &quot;Mons Martis&quot;, Latin for &quot;Mount of Mars&quot;, survived into Merovingian times, gallicised as Montmartre.

==History==
===Antiquity to 18th century===
Archaeological excavations show that the heights of Montmartre were occupied from at least Gallo-Roman times. Texts from the 8th century cite the name of &quot;mons Mercori&quot; (Mount Mercury); a 9th-century text speaks of Mount Mars. Excavations in 1975 north of the Church of Saint-Pierre found coins from the 3rd century and the remains of a major wall. Earlier excavations in the 17th century at the Fontaine-du-But (2 rue Pierre-Dac) found vestiges of Roman baths from the 2nd century.

The butte owes its particular religious importance to the text entitled &quot;Miracles of Saint-Denis&quot;, written before 885 by Hilduin, abbot of the monastery of Saint-Denis, which recounted how Saint Denis, a Christian bishop, was decapitated on the hilltop in 250 AD on orders of the Roman prefect Fescennius Sisinius for preaching the Christian faith to the Gallo-Roman inhabitants of Lutetia. According to Hilduin, Denis collected his head and carried it as far as the &quot;fontaine Saint-Denis&quot; (on modern &quot;impasse Girardon&quot;), then descended the north slope of the hill, where he died. Hilduin wrote that a church had been built &quot;in the place formerly called Mont de Mars, and then, by a happy change, &#x27;Mont des Martyrs&#x27;.&quot;

In 1134, King Louis VI purchased the Merovingian chapel and built on the site the church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, still standing. He also founded the Royal Abbey of Montmartre, a monastery of the Benedictine order, whose buildings, gardens and fields occupied most of Montmartre. He also built a small chapel, called the &quot;Martyrium&quot;, at the site where it was believed that Saint Denis had been decapitated. It became a popular pilgrimage site. In the 17th century, a priory called &quot;abbaye d&#x27;en bas&quot; was built at that site, and in 1686 it was occupied by a community of nuns.

By the 15th century, the north and northeast slopes of the hill were the site of a village surrounded by vineyards, gardens and orchards of peach and cherry trees. The first mills were built on the western slope in 1529, grinding wheat, barley and rye. There were thirteen mills at one time, though by the late nineteenth century only two remained,

During the 1590 Siege of Paris, in the last decade of the French Wars of Religion, Henry IV placed his artillery on top of the &quot;butte&quot; of Montmartre to fire down into the city. The siege eventually failed when a large relief force approached and forced Henry to withdraw.

The abbey was destroyed in 1790 during the French Revolution, and the convent demolished to make place for gypsum mines. The last abbess, Marie-Louise de Laval-Montmorency, was guillotined in 1794. The church of Saint-Pierre was saved. At the place where the chapel of the Martyrs was located (now 11 rue Yvonne-Le Tac), an oratory was built in 1855. It was renovated in 1994.

In 1790, Montmartre was located just outside the limits of Paris. That year, under the revolutionary government of the National Constituent Assembly, it became the &quot;commune&quot; of Montmartre, with its town hall located on &quot;place du Tertre&quot;, site of the former abbey. The main businesses of the &quot;commune&quot; were wine making, stone quarries and gypsum mines. 
====Mining and archaeology====
The mining of gypsum had begun in the Gallo-Roman period, first in open air mines and then underground, and continued until 1860. The gypsum was cut into blocks, baked, then ground and put into sacks. Sold as &quot;montmartarite&quot;, it was used for plaster, because of its resistance to fire and water. Between the 7th and 9th centuries, most of the sarcophagi found in ancient sites were made of molded gypsum. In modern times, the mining was done with explosives, which riddled the ground under the butte with tunnels, making the ground very unstable and difficult to build upon. The construction of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur required making a special foundation that descended under the ground to hold the structure in place. A fossil tooth found in one of these mines was identified by Georges Cuvier as an extinct equine, which he dubbed &quot;Palaeotherium&quot;, the &quot;ancient animal&quot;. His sketch of the entire animal in 1825 was matched by a skeleton discovered later.

===19th century===
Russian soldiers occupied Montmartre during the Battle of Paris in 1814. They used the altitude of the hill for artillery bombardment of the city.

Montmartre remained outside of the city limits of Paris until January 1, 1860, when it was annexed to the city along with other communities (&quot;faubourgs&quot;) surrounding Paris, and became part of the 18th arrondissement of Paris.

In 1871, Montmartre was the site of the beginning of the revolutionary uprising of the Paris Commune. During the Franco-Prussian War, the French army had stored a large number of cannon in a park at the top of the hill, near where the basilica is today. On 18 March 1871, the soldiers from the French Army tried to remove the cannon from the hilltop. They were blocked by members of the politically radicalised Paris National Guard, who captured and then killed two French army generals, and installed a revolutionary government that lasted two months. The heights of Montmartre were retaken by the French Army with heavy fighting at the end of May 1871, during what became known as the Semaine Sanglante, or &quot;Bloody Week&quot;.
In 1870, the future French prime minister during World War I, Georges Clemenceau, was appointed mayor of the 18th arrondissement, including Montmartre, by the new government of the Third Republic, and was also elected to the National Assembly. A member of the radical republican party, Clemenceau tried unsuccessfully to find a peaceful compromise between the even more radical Paris Commune and the more conservative French government. The Commune refused to recognize him as mayor, and seized the town hall. He ran for a seat in the council of the Paris Commune, but received less than eight hundred votes. He did not participate in the Commune, and was out of the city when the Commune was suppressed by the French army. In 1876, he again was elected as deputy for Montmartre and the 18th arrondissement.

The Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur was built on Montmartre from 1876 to 1919, financed by public subscription as a gesture of expiation for the suffering of France during the Franco-Prussian War. Its white dome is a highly visible landmark in the city, and near it artists set up their easels each day amidst the tables and colourful umbrellas of the &quot;place du Tertre&quot;.

By the 19th century, the butte was famous for its cafés, guinguettes with public dancing, and cabarets. Le Chat Noir at 84 &quot;boulevard de Rochechouart&quot; was founded in 1881 by Rodolphe Salis, and became a popular haunt for writers and poets. The composer Eric Satie earned money by playing the piano there. The Moulin Rouge at 94 &quot;boulevard de Clichy&quot; was founded in 1889 by Joseph Oller and Charles Zidler; it became the birthplace of the French cancan. Artists who performed in the cabarets of Montmartre included Yvette Guilbert, Marcelle Lender, Aristide Bruant, La Goulue, Georges Guibourg, Mistinguett, Fréhel, Jane Avril, and Damia.

===Artists gather (late 19th–early 20th century)===

During the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; from 1872 to 1914, many artists lived and worked in Montmartre, where the rents were low and the atmosphere congenial. Pierre-Auguste Renoir rented space at &quot;12 rue Cortot&quot; in 1876 to paint &quot;Bal du moulin de la Galette&quot;, showing a dance at Montmartre on a Sunday afternoon. Maurice Utrillo lived at the same address from 1906 to 1914, and Raoul Dufy shared an atelier there from 1901 to 1911. The building is now the &quot;Musée de Montmartre&quot;. Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and other artists lived and worked in a building called during the years 1904–1909, where Picasso painted one of his most important masterpieces, &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. Several composers, including Erik Satie, lived in the neighbourhood. Most of the artists left after the outbreak of World War I, the majority of them going to the Montparnasse quarter.

Artists&#x27; associations such as Les Nabis and the &quot;Incohérents&quot; were formed and individuals including Vincent van Gogh, Pierre Brissaud, Alfred Jarry, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Suzanne Valadon, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Théophile Steinlen, and African-American expatriates such as Langston Hughes worked in Montmartre and drew some of their inspiration from the area.

The last of the bohemian Montmartre artists was Gen Paul (1895–1975), born in Montmartre and a friend of Utrillo. Paul&#x27;s calligraphic expressionist lithographs, sometimes memorializing picturesque Montmartre itself, owe a lot to Raoul Dufy.

Among the last of the neighborhood&#x27;s bohemian gathering places was R-26, an artistic salon frequented by Josephine Baker, Le Corbusier and Django Reinhardt. Its name was commemorated by Reinhardt in his 1947 tune &quot;R. vingt-six&quot;.

===Modern day===


There is a small vineyard in the Rue Saint-Vincent, which continues the tradition of wine production in the Île de France, and a wild garden, occupied by midwife toads, also in the Rue Saint-Vincent. The vineyard yields about of wine per year,

The Musée de Montmartre is in the house where the painters Maurice Utrillo and Suzanne Valadon lived and worked in second-floor studios. The house was Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s first Montmartre address. Many other personalities moved through the premises. The mansion in the garden at the back is the oldest hotel on Montmartre, and one of its first owners was Claude de la Rose, a 17th-century actor known as &quot;Rosimond&quot;, who bought it in 1680. Claude de la Rose was the actor who replaced Molière, and who, like his predecessor, died on stage.

Nearby, day and night, tourists visit such sights as Place du Tertre and the cabaret du Lapin Agile, where the artists had worked and gathered. Many renowned artists, such as painter and sculptor Edgar Degas and film director François Truffaut, are buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre and the Cimetière Saint-Vincent. Near the top of the butte, Espace Dalí showcases surrealist artist Salvador Dalí&#x27;s work. Montmartre is an officially designated historic district with limited development allowed in order to maintain its historic character.

An inclined railway, the Funiculaire de Montmartre, operated by the RATP, ascends the hill from the south, while the Montmartre bus circles the hill.

Downhill to the southwest is the red-light district of Pigalle. That area is, today, largely known for a wide variety of stores specializing in instruments for rock music. There are also several concert halls, also used for rock music. The actual Moulin Rouge theatre is also in Pigalle, near the Blanche métro station.

<text>In commutative algebra, the mathematical study of commutative rings, adic topologies are a family of topologies on the underlying set of a module, generalizing the -adic topologies on the integers.

==Definition==
Let be a commutative ring and an -module. Then each ideal of determines a topology on called the -adic topology, characterized by the pseudometric formula_1 The family formula_2 is a basis for this topology.

An -adic topology is a linear topology (a topology generated by some submodules).

==Properties==
With respect to the topology, the module operations of addition and scalar multiplication are continuous, so that becomes a topological module. However, need not be Hausdorff; it is Hausdorff if and only ifformula_3so that becomes a genuine metric. Related to the usual terminology in topology, where a Hausdorff space is also called separated, in that case, the -adic topology is called &quot;separated&quot;.

By Krull&#x27;s intersection theorem, if is a Noetherian ring which is an integral domain or a local ring, it holds that formula_4 for any proper ideal of . Thus under these conditions, for any proper ideal of and any -module , the -adic topology on is separated. 

For a submodule of , the canonical homomorphism to induces a quotient topology which coincides with the -adic topology. The analogous result is not necessarily true for the submodule itself: the subspace topology need not be the -adic topology. However, the two topologies coincide when is Noetherian and finitely generated. This follows from the Artin-Rees lemma.

==Completion==

When is Hausdorff, can be completed as a metric space; the resulting space is denoted by formula_5 and has the module structure obtained by extending the module operations by continuity. It is also the same as (or canonically isomorphic to): formula_6 where the right-hand side is an inverse limit of quotient modules under natural projection.

For example, let formula_7 be a polynomial ring over a field and the (unique) homogeneous maximal ideal. Then formula_8, the formal power series ring over in variables.

==Closed submodules==
The -adic closure of a submodule formula_9 is formula_10 This closure coincides with whenever is -adically complete and is finitely generated.

 is called Zariski with respect to if every ideal in is -adically closed. There is a characterization:
: is Zariski with respect to if and only if is contained in the Jacobson radical of .
In particular a Noetherian local ring is Zariski with respect to the maximal ideal.

<text>Engraving is the practice of incising a design on a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a burin. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called &quot;engravings&quot;. Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in printmaking. Wood engravings, a form of relief printing and stone engravings, such as petroglyphs, are not covered in this article.

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic printmaking, in mapmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various photographic processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques.

&quot;Engraving&quot; is loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as etching in particular, but also mezzotint and other techniques. Many old master prints also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters. Line engraving and steel engraving cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving. Traditional engraving, by burin or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as photoengraving and laser engraving have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.

==Terms==
Other terms often used for printed engravings are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or &quot;line engraving&quot;. Steel engraving is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of security printing. Especially in the past, &quot;engraving&quot; was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. &quot;Hand engraving&quot; is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also &quot;hand engraved&quot;, using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.

==Process==

Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, and titanium, in applications ranging from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. Dies used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.

In addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a pantographic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.

===Tools and gravers or burins===
Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as &quot;wriggle&quot; cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.Musical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is &quot;walked&quot; across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for &quot;walking&quot; the graver may also be referred to as &quot;wriggle&quot; or &quot;wiggle&quot; cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.

===Tool geometry===
Tool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a &quot;face&quot;, which is the top of the graver, and a &quot;heel&quot;, which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool&#x27;s point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.

===Tool sharpening===
Sharpening a graver or burin requires either a sharpening stone or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening systems made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on &quot;feel&quot; and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.

===Artwork design===
Design or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.

===Handpieces===

Originally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals.

===Cutting the surface===
The actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional &quot;hand push&quot; process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the &quot;hand push&quot; effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.

Hand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create &quot;bulino&quot; style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.

===Finishing===
Finishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called &quot;burrs&quot; that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.

===Modern hand engraving===
Because of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, counterfeiting of engraved designs is almost impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand-engraved images, nor can it be scanned. At the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.

The modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a metalworking context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, silverware and musical instruments.

In most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or milling machines. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.

===Machine engraving===
In some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s pistol cylinders were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around the surface.

===Computer-aided machine engraving===

Engraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1 μm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.

It is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time-consuming.

Retail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common &#x27;Diamond Drag&#x27; pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is &#x27;Spindle Cutter&#x27;. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.

With state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.
The engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.

Today laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.

==History==

&quot;For the printing process, see intaglio (printmaking). See also Steel engraving and line engraving&quot;
The first evidence for hominids engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first &quot;Homo erectus&quot; was discovered. Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the Diepkloof Rock Shelter and dated to the Middle Stone Age around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving. Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the Art of the Upper Paleolithic, and larger engraved petroglyphs on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.

In antiquity, the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by chasing or sometimes a combination of lost-wax casting and chasing. Engraved gem is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.
However the use of glass engraving, usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of hardstone carvings, appears as early as the first century AD, continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome, and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament. It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as old master prints, first in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden.
Thereafter engraving tended to lose ground to etching, which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although Rembrandt&#x27;s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.

Before the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.

Many classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more &quot;elegant&quot; design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.
Modifying the relief designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as hobo nickels. In the United States, especially during the Great Depression, coin engraving on the large-faced Indian Head nickel became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniature sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.

During the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible.

===Music engraving===

The first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860 to 1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.

The first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article &quot;Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique&quot; in Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver&#x27;s planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.

By 1837 pewter had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (&quot;Novel manuel complet de l&#x27;imprimeur en taille douce&quot;, 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums. By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world&#x27;s engraved music plates.

==Applications today==
Examples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner&#x27;s name to a sports trophy. Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto rotogravure cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1 mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6 μm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.
Some schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the École Estienne in Paris.

==Creating tone==
In traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of half-tones was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line &quot;hatchings&quot; intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as &quot;cross-hatching&quot;. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called stippling, first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the &quot;swelling line&quot;) to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his &quot;Sudarium of Saint Veronica&quot; (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus&#x27;s nose.

Surface tone is achieved during the printing process, by selectively leaving a thin layer of ink on parts of the printing plate.

The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judah&#x27;s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest&#x27;s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest&#x27;s turban, was engraved with the words: &quot;Holiness belongs to Adonai.&quot; Bezalel, along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.

<text>Foundation&#x27;s Edge (1982) is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the fourth book in the &quot;Foundation&quot; Series. It was written more than thirty years after the stories of the original &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy, due to years of pressure by fans and editors on Asimov to write another, and, according to Asimov himself, the amount of the payment offered by the publisher. It was his first novel to ever land on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list, after 262 books and 44 years of writing.

==Plot summary==
Five hundred years after the establishment of the Foundation, the Mayor of Terminus, Harla Branno, is basking in a political glow, as her policies having been vindicated by the recent successful resolution of a Seldon Crisis. Golan Trevize, a former officer of the Navy and now a member of Council, believes the Second Foundation, which is almost universally thought to be extinct, still exists and is controlling events. He attempts to question the continued existence of the Seldon Plan during a Council session, but Branno has him arrested on a charge of treason. Branno also believes that the Second Foundation still exists and is in control, but she cannot admit it publicly for political reasons, and treats that as a state secret, hence her alarm and her swift action.

So, she orders Trevize to leave Terminus to search for the Second Foundation. As a cover, he is to be accompanied by Janov Pelorat, a professor of Ancient History and mythologist, who is interested in the location of Earth, the fabled original world of the human species. They are provided a highly advanced computer-controlled &quot;gravitic&quot; ship to carry out their mission. Branno also sends out Munn Li Compor in another similar vessel to follow and monitor Trevize.
Indeed, the Second Foundation still does exist, but rather than being in complete control, as the First Foundation fears, it has similar worries. On Trantor, home of the Second Foundation, Stor Gendibal, a rising intellect in the Second Foundation hierarchy, reveals to Quindor Shandess, the current First Speaker, his finding that the Seldon Plan, which the Second Foundation diligently protects and furthers along, is being manipulated by some unknown group, probably more powerful than the Second Foundation, with unknown motivations. Shandess dubs this group the &quot;Anti-Mules&quot;, as they seem to possess powers similar to the Mule, but to be using them not to destroy the Seldon Plan, as the Mule had tried to do, but rather to preserve it.

At first, Gendibal&#x27;s ideas are very badly received by the other Speakers, with Shandess alone supporting him, and he is threatened with expulsion, but the Speakers&#x27; resistance is overcome when Gendibal demonstrates that the brain of Sura Novi, a member of the Hamish, the rude people of farmers who inhabit and cultivate Trantor, shows a subtle change to her mind that would be far beyond the Second Foundation&#x27;s capabilities to make, and could only have been made by a much more powerful entity, probably the &quot;Anti-Mules&quot;. Gendibal and Novi are sent out on a spaceship to track Trevize and determine the goals of the &quot;Anti-Mules&quot;.
Meanwhile, Trevize and Pelorat engage in the latter&#x27;s project to locate Earth, but there is no planet with that name in the galactic table of planets, and none with its exact predicted characteristics either. However, Pelorat mentions having heard of a planet called Gaia, whose name he somehow discovered to mean Earth in some ancient language. Its coordinates are unknown, but it is supposed to be somewhere in the Sayshell Sector. Trevize decides that they must go there to follow up on this lead. On the Sayshell main planet, Trevize and Pelorat meet a scholar, Professor Quintesetz, who is able to reluctantly give them the coordinates to Gaia. They travel there and discover that Gaia is a &quot;superorganism&quot; where all things, both living and inanimate, participate in a larger group consciousness, while still retaining any individual awareness they might have. Pelorat slowly falls in love with a Gaian woman named Blissenobiarella, commonly called Bliss.
Gendibal finds Trevize&#x27;s location with information from Compor, who is secretly a Second Foundation agent. On approaching Gaia, Gendibal is met by a First Foundation warship, commanded by Mayor Branno. As Gendibal&#x27;s mental powers stalemate with Mayor Branno&#x27;s force shield, Novi reveals herself as an agent of Gaia. She joins the stalemate and the three are locked until Trevize can join them. Bliss explains to Trevize that he had been led to Gaia so that his untouched mind, which has unique, remarkable powers of intuition, can decide the galaxy&#x27;s fate — whether it will be ruled by the First Foundation, by the Second Foundation, or by Gaia, which envisions an extension of its group consciousness to the entire galaxy, thus forming the new entity &quot;Galaxia&quot;. He also learns that the stalemate between the First Foundation (Branno), the Second Foundation (Gendibal), and Gaia (Novi) was intentional, and that through his ship&#x27;s computer, he can decide who shall ultimately prove victorious.

Trevize decides upon Gaia, and through mental adjustments, Gaia makes Branno and Gendibal believe they have won minor victories, and that Gaia does not exist. But Trevize is troubled by one final missing piece of information: In the course of their investigation, Trevize and Pelorat had found out that all references to Earth had been removed from the Galactic Library at Trantor. Trevize wants to know who did this and why, as Gaia denies having done that. He announces his intention to find Earth, since without knowing the answers to those questions, he cannot be certain his choice was the right one. Trevize also explains that he chose Gaia because that was the only choice of the three that was reversible in case his choice should prove to be wrong, due to the large length of time required for the formation of Galaxia.

==Reception==
In a 1982 review of it, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; states that &quot;after a slowish start, then, the rather talky narrative here develops into grippingly effective drama—with oodles of twisty-turny plot, an engaging cast, and some enjoyably mellow humor... A grandmasterly performance.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #39, and stated that &quot;At 200,000 words, the sequel seems longer than the original series; endless pages of grey dialogue about the fate of the galaxy are on the whole boring, and the trilogy is weakened, not strengthened, by the addition. For example, the trilogy&#x27;s goal of peaceful Galactic Empire is now rejected, presumably because of fascist implications: this is all very Politically Correct but converts the first three books to pointless chronicles of misguided effort. Remarkably, it&#x27;s a US bestseller.&quot;

&quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983 and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1983, and was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1982.

<doc id="60129" wikidata="Q482085" url="?curid=60129" title="The Caves of Steel">
<text>The Caves of Steel is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is a detective story and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just being a limited genre in itself.

The book was first published as a serial in &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine, from October to December 1953. A Doubleday hardcover followed in 1954.

At the time of writing, Asimov conceived of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; as completely distinct from his Foundation Trilogy, published a few years earlier. Decades later, however, Asimov linked them, making the time of &quot;Caves of Steel&quot; a much earlier part of an extensive future history leading up to the rise of the Galactic Empire, its fall and the rise of two Foundations to replace it – with the Robot R. Daneel Olivaw, introduced in &quot;Caves of Steel&quot;, turning out to have survived over tens of thousands of years and have played a key role in the eras of both the Empire and the Foundation(s).

==Setup==
Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, later his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three millennia in Earth&#x27;s future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized – fifty planets known as the &quot;Spacer worlds&quot;. The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated with eight billion people, three times that of Asimov&#x27;s 1950s, with strict rules against robots. In &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; and its sequels (the first of which is &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;), Asimov paints a grim situation of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population and of luxury-seeking Spacers, who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy.

Asimov was a claustrophile: &quot;I wrote a novel in 1953 which pictured a world in which everyone lived in underground cities, comfortably enclosed away from the open air. People would say, &#x27;How could you imagine such a nightmarish situation?&#x27; And I would answer in astonishment, &#x27;What nightmarish situation? The &quot;caves of steel&quot; are vast city complexes covered by huge metallic domes, capable of supporting tens of millions each: the New York City of that era (wherein much of the story is set) encompasses present-day New York City as well as large tracts of New Jersey. Asimov imagines the present day underground transit connected to malls and apartment blocks, until no one ever exits the domes and most of the population suffer from extreme fear of leaving them. (Even though the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; series were not made part of the same fictional universe until much later, the &quot;caves of steel&quot; resemble the planet Trantor.)

The novel&#x27;s central plot device is a murder, which takes place before it opens. (This is an Asimov trademark, which he attributed to his squeamishness plus John Campbell&#x27;s advice to begin as late in the story as possible.) The victim is Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador who lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer, in cooperation with a highly advanced robot named R. Daneel Olivaw who is visually identical to a human and is equipped with a scanner that is able to detect human emotions through their encephalographic waves.

==Plot==
A faction of Spacers have come to the realization that Spacer culture is effete, stagnating due to negative population growth and excessive longevity. Their solution is to encourage further space exploration and colonization by Earthmen in concert with robots. However, Earthmen would first need to overcome their irrational antagonism toward robots. To this end, the faction have established habitations on Earth through which they hope to introduce humanoid robots to Earth.

Officer Elijah Baley starts working with R. (robot) Olivaw, whom he distrusts on the basis of being an android. Olivaw gradually learns more about Earth humans and displays curiosity about aspects of local behaviour and technology. While investigating the murder of Spacer Dr. Sarton, Baley makes a visit to Spacetown and meets with Dr. Fastolfe, who injects him with a suggestive drug while speaking about the relative merits and shortcomings of Earth and Spacer society. Baley is converted to the cause of spreading humanity throughout the galaxy. Although the Spacers deem Baley inadequate to convert enough Earthmen, they find their target when Baley arrests Clousarr on suspicion of inciting a riot and Olivaw provides him with suggestive statements. Their job accomplished, the Spacers make plans to leave Earth as their continued presence would be to the detriment of their cause; they accept Sarton&#x27;s unsolved death as a necessary sacrifice. This leaves Baley with ninety minutes to find the killer, which he is convinced will also clear him of the destruction of R. Sammy.

Meanwhile, the New York Police Commissioner, Julius Enderby, who is Baley&#x27;s friend from college, now his boss, and the head of the investigation on Earth, has been acting suspiciously. Baley eventually deduces Enderby is secretly a member of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the &#x27;olden days&#x27; where men did not live in the &#x27;caves of steel&#x27;. He used his position of power in order to set up meetings with Sarton, under the guise of further cooperation, while actually plotting to kill R. Daneel, who was living with Sarton prior to the murder. The murder required the knowledge and skills of one human – Enderby – and one robot – R. Sammy. Enderby ordered R. Sammy to carry a blaster weapon from the City to Spacetown through the &quot;country&quot;, an area outside the domes that make up the caves of steel, an area with little to no monitoring by police, but where few if any Earthmen would dare go. In Spacetown, Enderby took the weapon from R. Sammy, and after being done, he gave the blaster back, so the investigators in Spacetown would never find the murder weapon. At no point did he need to tell R. Sammy why he wanted a weapon, so the plan did not break the First Law. In Enderby&#x27;s nervousness about committing a crime, he compulsively cleaned the lenses of his eyeglasses and accidentally dropped them, breaking them. Because of this, he could not tell the difference between Sarton and R. Daneel (who Sarton designed and built to look as much like himself as a robot can). When he tried to kill R. Daneel, he killed Sarton instead. As a confirmation of his hypothesis, Baley plays a video recording of the crime scene investigation. It shows the room where Sarton was killed, Sarton&#x27;s body, and pieces of glass which can be tested to see whether they came from Enderby&#x27;s eyeglasses.

Having already accepted that Sarton&#x27;s death is unsolved, the Spacers are willing to not prosecute Enderby for the accident if he agrees to work with them to promote colonization of other worlds amongst the Medievalists.

==Characters==
In order of appearance, described:

* Elijah &quot;Lije&quot; Baley, a plain-clothes police officer who works on Earth. He is called to solve the murder.
* Vince Barrett, a young man whose job was taken over by R. Sammy.
* R. Sammy, a robot assigned to the Police Department
* Julius Enderby, New York City&#x27;s Commissioner of Police, who assigns Baley to the murder case.
* Jezebel &quot;Jessie&quot; Navodny Baley, Baley&#x27;s wife
* Roj Nemennuh Sarton, a spacer roboticist murdered with a blaster. Baley is assigned to investigate his death.
* R. Daneel Olivaw, Baley&#x27;s partner, a humaniform robot created in Sarton&#x27;s likeness
* Bentley Baley, Baley&#x27;s son
* Han Fastolfe, a roboticist from Aurora, a Spacer world, who believes Spacers and Earth dwellers must work together to colonize the galaxy and survive in the future.
* Dr. Anthony Gerrigel, a roboticist at Washington whom Baley calls
* Francis Clousarr, a New Yorker who was arrested for inciting a riot against robots two years ago. Daneel identifies him as being present at two incidents.

==Reception==
Reviewer Groff Conklin praised the novel for the way Asimov &quot;combines his interest in robotics with his consuming preoccupation with the sociology of a technology-mad, bureaucratically tethered world of tomorrow.&quot; Boucher and McComas praised &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; as &quot;Asimov&#x27;s best long work to date&quot;, saying that it was &quot;the most successful attempt yet to combine&quot; the detective and science fiction novel. P. Schuyler Miller called it &quot;as honest a combination of science fiction and detection as we&#x27;ve seen.&quot; Villiers Gerson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Here is an unusually exciting and engrossing detective story set in a science fictional background convincingly worked out.&quot;

Apart from being nominated in 2004 for a retroactive Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954, more contemporaneously &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; was voted the 30th Best All-Time Novel in the 1975 Locus Poll, and the 33rd Best All-Time SF Novel in the 1987 Locus Poll.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for television by the BBC and shown in 1964: only a few short excerpts still exist. In June 1989, the book was adapted by Bert Coules as a radio play for the BBC, with Ed Bishop as Elijah Baley and Sam Dastor as R. Daneel Olivaw. In 2016, Akiva Goldsman had been hired to produce a movie. In 2025, John Ridley was hired to direct a film adaptation, co-writing the script with Cheo Hodari Coker.

===Television adaptation===

An adaptation of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; was produced by the BBC and broadcast on BBC2 on 5 June 1964 as part of an anthology strand called &quot;Story Parade&quot;, which specialized in adaptations of modern novels. It starred Peter Cushing as Elijah Baley and John Carson as R. Daneel Olivaw. The adaptation was the brainchild of &quot;Story Parade&quot; story editor Irene Shubik, who was an enthusiast of science fiction and once described Asimov as &quot;one of the most interesting and amusing men I have ever met&quot;. Shubik had previously devised and story edited the science fiction anthology series &quot;Out of This World&quot;, which had adapted Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; in 1962. The adaptation of the novel was handled by Terry Nation, who by now had created the Daleks for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

The screenplay was generally faithful to the plot of the novel. The only major deviation was the conclusion – in the television version the murderer commits suicide when he is unmasked, although in the novel he agrees to work to convince the Medievalists to change their ways. The other major change is that the roboticist Dr. Gerrigel is a female character in the television version.

&quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; garnered good reviews: &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said the play &quot;proved again that science fiction can be exciting, carry a message and be intellectually stimulating&quot; while &quot;The Listener&quot;, citing the play as the best of the &quot;Story Parade&quot; series, described it as &quot;a fascinating mixture of science fiction and whodunit which worked remarkably well&quot;. The play was repeated on BBC1 on 28 August 1964. As was common practice at the time, the master videotapes of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; were wiped some time after broadcast and the play remains missing. A few short extracts survive: the opening titles and the murder of Sarton; Elijah and Daneel meeting Dr. Gerrigel (Naomi Chance) and Elijah and Daneel confronting the Medievalist Clousarr (John Boyd-Brent).

The success of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; led Irene Shubik to devise the science fiction anthology series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, during which she oversaw the adaptation of six more Asimov stories, including &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;″s sequel &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;.

===Game adaptation===
In 1988 Kodak produced a VCR game entitled &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Robots&quot; that contained a 45-minute film loosely based on &quot;The Caves of Steel.&quot; It featured many of the characters and settings from the novel, but an altered plotline to fit the needs of a VCR game. Elements from &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; (including the characters Giskard Reventlov and Kelden Amadiro) were incorporated, as well. Similar to the BBC2 version, Dr. Gerrigel was replaced by a woman, named Sophia Quintana (after an unrelated character from &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;).

<text>Prelude to Foundation is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1988. It is one of two prequels to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. For the first time, Asimov chronicles the fictional life of Hari Seldon, the man who invented psychohistory and the intellectual hero of the series. The novel was nominated for the Locus Award.

==Plot summary==
Prelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G.E. (Galactic Era), during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I. It starts with Seldon&#x27;s presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the future. The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to use Seldon for political gain. In a face-to-face interview, Seldon emphasizes that psychohistory is something that he has not even begun developing or even has a clear idea how to do so, but Cleon is not wholly convinced that Hari is of no use to the Empire.

Seldon then meets reporter Chetter Hummin, who convinces him that Cleon&#x27;s first minister, Eto Demerzel, is attempting to capture him, and that it is therefore imperative for Seldon to escape and try to make psychohistory practical. He is taken by Hummin to Streeling University, one of the top ranked of the Empire and introduced to Dors Venabili by Hummin. Seldon theorizes that the first development of psychohistory requires a smaller, yet still significant sample than the entire Empire, possibly just the original world where humans originated...which is now lost, along with much of the older historical records.

Hari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University, and Hummin arranges for them to be sheltered in the reclusive Mycogen sector, which supposedly values its ancient history. Seldon and Venabili are welcomed by Sunmaster Fourteen, the leader of Mycogen. Seldon obtains the Mycogenians&#x27; treasured religious/historical book, but finds it disappointing except for the revelation of what the Mycogenians call their home planet, Aurora, and references to &quot;robots&quot; (which do not exist in the Empire). Seldon and Venabili face execution when Seldon insists on entering the Mycogenian &quot;temple&quot;, the Sacratorium, in disguise in hopes of interviewing a robot supposedly housed there. They are easily detected, but Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them.

The action then shifts to the Dahl sector, where Seldon and Venabili rent rooms from a middle-class family. While in Dahl, they meet a guttersnipe named Raych, whom Seldon later adopts. Also in Dahl, they are told by an old wise woman that the Aurora of the Mycogenians is not the original world, but actually the &quot;enemy&quot; of the original human planet, called Earth. (This links with the Robot series.)

Towards the end of the novel, Seldon, Venabili, and Raych are kidnapped and forcibly taken to see Rashelle, who is the mayor of Wye, a powerful and vital sector situated at Trantor&#x27;s south pole. Rashelle and her father have long been plotting to overthrow the Emperor and take his place. Seldon has the revelation that he could try to develop psychohistory using Trantor itself as a test case because of the great cultural diversity of its sectors. Rashelle launches her coup attempt, but it quickly collapses due to Demerzel&#x27;s skillful subversion of Wye&#x27;s forces. The finale reveals that &quot;Hummin&quot; is actually Eto Demerzel. Seldon then gets Demerzel to admit he is a robot; Demerzel is in fact R. Daneel Olivaw, who can influence humans mentally. He wants the development of psychohistory to help him better protect humanity, as per &quot;The Zeroth Law Of Robotics&quot;. Seldon also suspects Venabili of being a robot, as well. This theme would subsequently be continued in &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;.

<text>Foundation and Earth is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the fifth novel of the &quot;Foundation&quot; series and chronologically the last in the series. It was published in 1986, four years after the first sequel to the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy, which is titled &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
Several centuries after the events of &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, two citizens of the Foundation search for Earth, the legendary planet where humans are said to have originated. Even less is known about Earth than was the case in &quot;Foundation&quot;, when scholars still seem to know the location of &#x27;Sol&#x27;.

The story follows on from &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;, but can be read as a complete work in itself. (It does, however, give away most of the mysteries around which &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; is built.)

==Plot summary==

===Part I: Gaia===
Councilman Golan Trevize, historian Janov Pelorat, and Bliss of the planet Gaia (introduced in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;) set out on a journey to find humanity&#x27;s ancestral home planet—Earth. The purpose of the journey is to settle Trevize&#x27;s doubt of his intuitive endorsement, at the end of &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;, of the all-encompassing noosphere of Galaxia as the future of mankind.

===Part II: Comporellon===
First, they visit Comporellon, said to have legends concerning Earth according to Munn Li Compor, which claims to be the oldest currently inhabited planet in the galaxy. Upon arrival, they are imprisoned, but negotiate their way out. While there, a historian gives them the coordinates of three Spacer planets, surmised to be fairly close to Earth. One is Aurora, a desolate, lifeless planet. The second is Solaria, a planet with merely 1500 people on it.

===Part III: Aurora===
The first Spacer planet they visit is Aurora, which was abandoned by its inhabitants and has a collapsing ecology. Trevize is nearly killed by a pack of wild dogs, presumed to be the descendants of household pets reverted to wolf-like savagery. They escape when Bliss manipulates the dogs&#x27; emotions to psychologically compel a retreat, amplifying the fear induced by cries from one of the dogs that Trevize used his neuronic whip on.

===Part IV: Solaria===
Next, they visit Solaria, where they find that the Solarians, who have survived the Spacer-Settler conflicts by clever retreat detailed in Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, have genetically engineered themselves into self-reproducing hermaphrodites, generally intolerant of human physical presence or contact. They have also given themselves the ability to mentally channel (&quot;transduce&quot;) great amounts of energy obtained from their vast estates via a modification to the brain, and use this as their sole source of power. The Solarians avoid ever having to interact with each other, except by holographic apparatus (&quot;viewing&quot;), and reproduce only when necessary to replace the dead. Bliss, Pelorat, and Trevize are nearly killed by the Solarian Sarton Bander, as the penalty is death for simply landing on the planet, but Bliss deflects the transduction at the moment Bander uses it as a weapon, accidentally killing Bander. While escaping, they stumble upon Bander&#x27;s young child, Fallom, and with Fallom&#x27;s help, reach the surface from Bander&#x27;s underground mansion. Bliss, by preference, uses the feminine pronoun for Fallom. They take the child with them, as the Solarians would execute her — she would be surplus to their population requirements, and a more mature child from another estate would be chosen to take over Bander&#x27;s estate.

===Part V: Melpomenia===
The crew now visit Melpomenia, the third and final Spacer coordinate they have, where the atmosphere has become reduced to a few thousandths of normal atmospheric pressure. Wearing space suits, they enter a library, and find a plaque listing the names and coordinates of all fifty Spacer worlds. On the way back to the ship, they notice a moss has begun to grow around the seals of their space suits, and just in time, surmise that the moss is feeding on minuscule leakages of carbon dioxide. Thus, they are able to eradicate the moss with a blaster and heavy UV-illumination so that no spores are unintentionally carried off the planet. They then plot the Spacer worlds, which form a rough sphere, on the ship&#x27;s map and conclude that the location of Earth must be near to the center of the sphere. This area turns out to have a binary star system.

===Part VI: Alpha===
They arrive at the planet Alpha, which orbits Alpha Centauri and is all ocean except for an island long and wide on which live a small group of humans. In a reference to the radioactive Earth of Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, the restoration of Earth&#x27;s soil was eventually abandoned in favour of resettling the population to &quot;New Earth&quot;, which the First Galactic Empire had already been terraforming. The natives appear friendly, but secretly they intend to kill the visitors with a microbiological agent to prevent them from informing the rest of the galaxy of their existence. They are warned to escape before the agent can be activated by a native woman who has formed an attraction to Trevize and was impressed by Fallom&#x27;s ability to play a flute with just her mind. Now certain that Alpha Centauri is not Earth but near it, they approach a system close by and are puzzled by the very strong similarities between this star and the larger sun of the Alpha Centauri system. Asimov here is making use of an astronomical curiosity: the nearest star system to Sol contains a star that has the same spectral type, G2 V, though Alpha Centauri A is a little larger and brighter.

===Part VII: Earth===
On the approach to Earth, they detect it to be highly radioactive and not capable of supporting life but, while trying to use the ship&#x27;s computer to locate Solaria, Fallom calls Trevize&#x27;s attention to the moon, which is large enough to serve as a hideout for the forces that lived on Earth. There, they find R. Daneel Olivaw, who explains he has been paternalistically manipulating humanity since Elijah Baley&#x27;s time, long before the Galactic Empire or Foundation. He thus caused the settlement of Alpha Centauri, the creation of Gaia and the creation of psychohistory (detailed in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), and manipulated Trevize into making his decision at the end of &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; (although he did not manipulate the decision itself). It is revealed that Daneel&#x27;s positronic brain is deteriorating and he is unable to design a new brain, as he had done several times before, since his brain is now too fragile; he therefore wishes to merge Fallom&#x27;s brain with his own, allowing him time to oversee Galaxia&#x27;s creation.

Daneel continues to explain that human internal warfare or parochialism was the reason for his causing the creation of psychohistory and Gaia. Trevize then confirms his decision that the creation of Galaxia is the correct choice, and gives his reason as the likelihood of advanced life beyond the galaxy eventually attacking humanity. Trevize states that there should be enough time for Galaxia to be fully ready as long as the enemy is not already present among them, not noticing Fallom&#x27;s alien gaze resting unfathomably upon him.

==Relationship with other works==
Although hinted at in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;, this book was the first book of the series that merged it with Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series. The radioactive-Earth theme was begun in &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, which is set thousands of years earlier. R. Daneel Olivaw&#x27;s role in the events of that novel would later be described in the prequels.

This book serves as a kind of epilogue to the &quot;Robot&quot; series. Asimov describes what has become of the Spacer worlds of Solaria and Aurora, described extensively in &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and the &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot;, respectively. The author also reveals what has happened to Earth, as described in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;.

The book &quot;Nemesis&quot;, predating the timeline and events found in the &quot;Foundation&quot; and &quot;Robot&quot; series, hints at the motives and origins of Gaia. Humans had a very early contact with the sentient moon Erythro, a very abstract alien intelligence.

In&quot; Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, the last book in the Second Foundation Trilogy (authorized by Asimov&#x27;s estate), another possible future for the Galaxy is discussed. In a conversation between Hari Seldon and Daneel Olivaw, Seldon discusses the possibility that the Foundation will in fact incorporate Gaia into the Second Galactic Empire. He then bets that in a thousand years, well after Galaxia should have been established and removed the need for formal education, editions of the Encyclopedia Galactica will be published. The fact that two versions of the Encyclopedia are published after this deadline seems to lend credence to the view that Seldon won the bet.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #84, and stated that &quot;Whopping concepts and evocative descriptions boost the novel half-way to excellence, but are defeated by the dead-weight of the stereotypes and lecturing. Hard SF fans will forgive its flaws.&quot;

<text>The Foundation&quot; seriesis a [[science fiction]] book series written by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. First published as a series of [[short stories]] and novellas in 1942–50, and subsequently in three books in 1951–53, for nearly thirty years the series was widely known as The Foundation Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Foundation&quot; (1951), &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; (1952), and &quot;Second Foundation&quot; (1953). It won the one-time Hugo Award for &quot;Best All-Time Series&quot; in 1966. Asimov later added new volumes, with two sequels, &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1982) and &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986), and two prequels, &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988) and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; (1993).

The premise of the stories is that in the waning days of a future Galactic Empire, the mathematician Hari Seldon devises the theory of psychohistory, a new and effective mathematics of sociology. Using statistical laws of mass action, it can predict the future of large populations. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, and a dark age lasting 30,000 years before a second empire arises. Although the momentum of the Empire&#x27;s fall is too great to stop, Seldon devises a plan by which &quot;the onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little&quot; to eventually limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. The books describe some of the dramatic events of those years as they are shaped by the underlying political and social mechanics of Seldon&#x27;s Plan.

==Publication history==

===Original stories===
The original trilogy of novels collected a series of eight short stories and novellas published in &quot;Astounding Science-Fiction&quot; magazine between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor John W. Campbell, with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the Galactic Empire, the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory. Asimov wrote these early stories in his West Philadelphia apartment when he worked at the Philadelphia Naval Yard.

===&quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy===
The first four stories were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published by Gnome Press in 1951 as &quot;Foundation&quot;. The later stories were published in pairs by Gnome as &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; (1952) and &quot;Second Foundation&quot; (1953), resulting in the &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;, as the series is still known.

===Later sequels and prequels===
In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1982).

Four years later, Asimov followed up with another sequel, &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986), which was followed by the prequels &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988) and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; (1993), published after his 1992 death. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his &quot;Foundation&quot; series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;: an obscure myth about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot;, which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements was to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called &quot;C/Fe&quot; (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word &quot;psychohistory&quot; is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon&#x27;s work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called &quot;Spacer&quot; culture, are also exemplified by the events described all the way back in 1957&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;.

The link between the Robot and Foundation universes was tightened by letting the robot R. Daneel Olivaw – originally introduced in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; – live on for tens of thousands of years and play a major role behind the scenes in both the Galactic Empire in its heyday and in the rise of the two Foundations to take its place.

== Asimov &quot;Foundation&quot; series novels ==

===&quot;Foundation&quot; (1951)===

Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only 1,000 if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. The board is still wary, but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the &quot;Encyclopedists&quot; are exiled to a remote planet, Terminus. Seldon agrees to these terms – and secretly establishes a second foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the &quot;opposite end&quot; of the galaxy.

After 50 years on Terminus, and with Seldon dead, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding theirs, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. A vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open and it reveals a recorded hologram of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their reason for being on Terminus is false; Seldon did not care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the Dark Ages based on his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme &quot;crises&quot; – known as &quot;Seldon Crises&quot; – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the &quot;opposite end&quot; of the galaxy, and then falls silent.

The Mayor of Terminus City, Salvor Hardin, proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he becomes its ruler. The minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are more compact and powerful than the Empire&#x27;s equivalents. Using its scientific advantages, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a coveted commodity. The interplanetary traders become diplomats to other planets. One such trader, Hober Mallow, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the office of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation&#x27;s control.

===&quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; (1952)===

An ambitious general of the emperor of the galaxy perceives the Foundation to be a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire&#x27;s mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general&#x27;s long-term motive for the attack and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor. Seldon&#x27;s hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a threat to the Emperor and been recalled.

A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize, too late, that the Mule is unforeseen by Seldon&#x27;s plan. Toran and Bayta Darell, accompanied by Ebling Mis – the Foundation&#x27;s greatest psychologist – and a court jester named Magnifico, who is familiar with the Mule, set out to Trantor to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule&#x27;s reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to figure out the Second Foundation&#x27;s location to seek its help. He is successful and also deduces that the Mule&#x27;s success stems from his being a mutant who is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is murdered by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location because she realized that Magnifico is the Mule and has been using his gifts to help Mis do his research, so that the Mule can subjugate the Second Foundation. The Mule ruefully acknowledges that his feelings for Bayta prevented him from tampering with her mind to block just such interference. He leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.

===&quot;Second Foundation&quot; (1953)===

As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation emerges briefly out of hiding to face the threat. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon&#x27;s mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their use of mental abilities. The Second Foundation launches an operation to deceive and eventually mind control the Mule, whom they return to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.

As a result, the first Foundation learns something of the Second Foundation beyond the fact that it exists, and comes to have some understanding of its role. This means that their behavior will now be influenced by that knowledge, invalidating the mathematics of the Seldon Plan and placing the Plan itself at great risk. The First Foundation starts to resentfully consider the other a rival, and a small group secretly begins to develop equipment to detect and block the Second Foundation&#x27;s mental influence. After many attempts to infer the Second Foundation&#x27;s whereabouts from the few clues, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (the &quot;opposite end of the galaxy&quot; for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and eliminates a group of 50 members of the Second Foundation, believing they have destroyed it.

The 50 were volunteers who sacrificed themselves so that humanity&#x27;s collective behavior would once again be predictable and follow the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. The Second Foundation is revealed to be on Trantor, the former Imperial homeworld. The clue &quot;at Star&#x27;s End&quot; was not a physical clue but based on an old saying, &quot;All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end&quot;.

===&quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1982)===

Believing that the Second Foundation exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician Golan Trevize is sent into exile by the Mayor of the Foundation, Harla Branno, to uncover the Second Foundation; Trevize is accompanied by a scholar named Janov Pelorat. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon&#x27;s hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to follow the plan. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called Earth may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet myths and legends refer to it. Trevize believes that the planet is being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that if they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take action.

Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics, those with the ability to read and shape the minds of others, must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal tries to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native.

Using the few scraps of reliable information within the myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia on which every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Branno and Gendibal, who have followed Trevize, also reach Gaia. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize&#x27;s purpose, faced with the leaders of the First and Second Foundations and Gaia, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race, the First Foundation&#x27;s path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation&#x27;s path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia&#x27;s path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings and the galaxy would be a part.

After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia&#x27;s path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts Branno&#x27;s and Gendibal&#x27;s minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation and Gendibal – now leader of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains but is uncertain as to why he is &quot;sure&quot; that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.

===&quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986)===

Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship&#x27;s computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten Spacer worlds of Aurora, Solaria, and finally Melpomenia. After searching and facing dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers.

Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted but Solaria contains a small population extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet. Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth but it contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). It dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth but on Earth&#x27;s satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon&#x27;s core, where they meet a robot named R. Daneel Olivaw.

Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will shortly cease to function. Despite replacing his positronic brain (which contains 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. Some time can be won to ensure the long-term benefit of humanity by merging Olivaw&#x27;s mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria.

Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child&#x27;s superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a &quot;yes&quot;) as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child&#x27;s benefit but that she may have sinister intentions.

===&quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988)===

&quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; opens on the planet Trantor, the empire&#x27;s capital planet, the day after Hari Seldon has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and Dors Venabili, a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by Chetter Hummin who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.

===&quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; (1993)===

Eight years after the events of &quot;Prelude&quot;, Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase, and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.

==Development and themes==
The early stories were inspired by Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the &quot;decline and fall of the Galactic Empire.&quot; The themes of Asimov&#x27;s stories were also influenced by the political tendency in science fiction fandom, associated with the Futurians, known as Michelism.

The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; or &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; do this, their focus is on how current trends in society might come to fruition and they act as a moral allegory of the modern world. The &quot;Foundation&quot; series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time. In this Asimov followed the model of Thucydides&#x27; work &quot;The History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, as he once acknowledged.

Asimov tried to end the series with &quot;Second Foundation&quot;. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot;. This was followed shortly thereafter by &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. This novel, which takes place some 500 years after Seldon, ties up all the loose ends and ties all his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Good Life&quot;), he had no idea how to continue after &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;, so he started writing the prequels.

==Asimov&#x27;s imprecise future history==

In the spring of 1955, Asimov published a future history of humanity in the pages of &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the Foundation universe at that point in his life. According to the publication, &quot;the scheme was not originally worked out as a consistent pattern and only includes about one-quarter of his total writings&quot;. Because of this, the dating in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series is approximate and inconsistent.

Asimov estimates that his &quot;Foundation&quot; series takes place nearly 50,000 years into the future, with Hari Seldon born in 47,000 CE. Around this time, the future emperor Cleon I is born in the imperial capital Trantor, 78 years before the Foundation Era (FE) and the events of the original Foundation trilogy. After Cleon inherits the crown, the mathematician Hari Seldon comes to Trantor from Helicon to deliver his theory of psychohistory that predicts the fall of the empire, which triggers the events of &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot;. &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; picks up the story a few years later, with the emperor being assassinated and Seldon retiring from politics.

At the start of the Foundation Era, the events of the original &quot;Foundation&quot; novel (first published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; as a series of short stories) take place, and the in-universe Foundation Era truly begins. According to Asimov, he intended this to take place around the year 47000 CE, with the Empire in decay as it battles the rising Foundation, who emerges as the dominant power a few centuries later. Thus begins the events of the &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot;, which include the unpredicted rise of the Mule, who defeats the Foundation thanks to his mutant abilities. The events of &quot;Second Foundation&quot; chronicle the titular Second Foundation&#x27;s search and defeat of the Mule, and their conflict with the remnants of the original Foundation, averting the Dark Age. Asimov estimates that the Mule rises and falls somewhere around 47300 CE.

&quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; takes place 500 years after the establishment of the Foundation, outside of the original trilogy of novels. &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; follows immediately after, with humanity choosing and justifying a third path distinct from the opposing visions of the two Foundations. According to Asimov, the Second Galactic Empire is established 48000 CE, 1000 years after the events of the first novel.

Asimov himself commented that his fiction&#x27;s internal history was &quot;actually made up ad hoc. My cross-references in the novels are thrown in as they occur to me and did not come from a systemized history. ... If some reader checks my stories carefully and finds that my dating is internally inconsistent, I can only say I&#x27;m not surprised.&quot;

== Prequel trilogy after Asimov&#x27;s death==
A second Foundation trilogy of prequels was written after Asimov&#x27;s death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate. These were &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Fear&quot; (1997) by Gregory Benford, &quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot; (1998) by Greg Bear, and &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (1999) by David Brin.

==Cultural impact==
===Impact in nonfiction===
In &quot;Learned Optimism&quot;, psychologist Martin Seligman identifies the &quot;Foundation&quot; series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the 1988 US elections, and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.

In his 1996 book &quot;To Renew America&quot;, U. S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote that he was influenced by reading the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy in high school.

Paul Krugman, winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, credits the &quot;Foundation&quot; series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.

The businessman and entrepreneur Elon Musk counts the series among the inspirations for his career. When Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster was launched into space on the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018, among other items it carried a 5D optical data storage copy of the &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

Stating that it &quot;offers a useful summary of some of the dynamics of far-flung imperial Rome&quot;, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed the &quot;Foundation&quot; series as an example of how science fiction &quot;can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader&quot;. In the nonfiction PBS series &quot;&quot;, Sagan referred to an &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot; in the episodes &quot;Encyclopaedia Galactica&quot; and &quot;Who Speaks for Earth&quot;.

===Awards===
In 1966, the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special Hugo Award for &quot;Best All-Time Series&quot;. The runners-up for the award were the &quot;Barsoom series&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the &quot;Future History series&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein, the &quot;Lensman series&quot; by Edward E. Smith and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Foundation series was the only series so honored until the establishment of the &quot;Best Series&quot; category in 2017. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and he was amazed when his work won.

The series has won three other Hugo Awards. &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, &quot;The Mule&quot; (the major part of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot;) for Best Novel (1946) and &quot;Foundation&quot; (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943).

===Impact in fiction and entertainment===
Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather &quot;dry&quot;, and consequently sells fewer copies than his own creation &quot;The Guide&quot;.

Frank Herbert also wrote &quot;Dune&quot; as a counterpoint to &quot;Foundation&quot;. Tim O&#x27;Reilly in his monograph on Herbert wrote that &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; is clearly a commentary on the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov&#x27;s classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into &quot;Dune&quot; is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.&quot;

In 1995, Donald Kingsbury wrote &quot;Historical Crisis&quot;, which he later expanded into a novel, &quot;Psychohistorical Crisis&quot;. It takes place about 2,000 years after &quot;Foundation&quot;, after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all &quot;Foundation&quot;-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and computer science, as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself.

In 1998, the novel &quot;Spectre&quot; (part of the Shatnerverse series) by William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens states that the Mirror Universe divergent path has been studied by the &quot;Seldon Psychohistory Institute&quot;.

The oboe-like holophonor in Matt Groening&#x27;s animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot; is based directly upon the Visi-Sonor which Magnifico plays in &quot;Foundation and Empire.&quot;

During the 2006–2007 Marvel Comics Civil War crossover storyline, in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #542 Mister Fantastic revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

According to lead singer Ian Gillan, the hard rock band Deep Purple&#x27;s song &quot;The Mule&quot; is based on the Foundation character: &quot;Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It&#x27;s been a while but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve made the right connection... Asimov was required reading in the 1960s.&quot;

=== Adaptations ===
==== Radio ====

An eight-part radio adaptation of the original trilogy, with sound design by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1973—one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in stereo. A BBC 7 rerun commenced in July 2003.

Adapted by Patrick Tull (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by David Cain and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with Geoffrey Beevers as Gaal Dornick, Lee Montague as Salvor Hardin, Julian Glover as Hober Mallow, Dinsdale Landen as Bel Riose, Maurice Denham as Ebling Mis and Prunella Scales as Lady Callia.

==== Film ====
By 1998, New Line Cinema had spent $1.5 million developing a film version of the &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

On July 29, 2008, New Line Cinema co-founders Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.
However, Columbia Pictures (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted Roland Emmerich to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.
Two years later, the studio hired Dante Harper to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize, and HBO acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.

==== Television ====
In November 2014, &quot;TheWrap&quot; reported that Jonathan Nolan was writing and producing a TV series based on the &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot; for HBO. Nolan confirmed his involvement at a Paley Center event on April 13, 2015.

In June 2017, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Skydance Media would produce a TV series. In August 2018 it was announced that Apple TV+ had commissioned a 10 episode straight-to-series order. However, on April 18, 2019, Josh Friedman left the project as co-writer and co-showrunner. This was apparently planned, with either Friedman or screenwriter David Goyer leaving and the other staying. On June 22, 2020, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the series would be released in 2021. On 13 March 2020, Apple suspended filming on their shows due to the COVID-19 outbreak; filming resumed on October 6, 2020.

The &quot;Foundation&quot; TV series was filmed at Troy Studios, Limerick, Ireland, and the budget was expected to be approximately $50 million. The first episodes premiered on September 24, 2021. Metacritic gave the first season a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The second season was released in 2023.

<text>The &quot;Robot&quot; Series is a series of thirty-seven science fiction short stories and six novels created by American writer Isaac Asimov, from 1940 to 1995. The series is set in a world where sentient positronic robots serve a number of purposes in society. To ensure their loyalty, the Three Laws of Robotics are programmed into these robots, with the intent of preventing them from ever becoming a danger to humanity. Later, Asimov would merge the &quot;Robot&quot; series with his &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

==Robot Novels and Stories==
The series started with the story &quot;Robbie&quot; in the September 1940 &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; (appearing under the title &quot;Strange Playfellow&quot;, which was not Asimov&#x27;s title). Although it was originally written as a stand-alone story, the following year Asimov published a series of additional robot stories, which fit into a narrative that was then put together as the book &quot;I, Robot&quot;.

=== List of works in the Robot Series, in chronological order by narrative ===

# &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982) (which contains all short stories published in the earlier collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Rest of the Robots&quot; (1964)), &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; (1986), &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990), and &quot;Gold&quot; (1995) - collections of short stories and essays
# &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Positronic Man&quot; (1992) - short story and related subsequent novel
# &quot;Mother Earth&quot; (1949) - short story in which no individual robots appear, but positronic robots are part of the background
# &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; (1954) - first Robot series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel
# &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; (1957) - second Robot series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel
# &quot;Mirror Image&quot; (1972) - short story about R. Daneel Olivaw and detective Elijah Baley
# &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; (1983) - third Robot series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel
# &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; (1985) - fourth Robot series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel

=== Overview of short stories ===
Most of Asimov&#x27;s robot short stories, which he began to write in 1939, are set in the first age of positronic robotics and space exploration. The unique feature of Asimov&#x27;s robots is the Three Laws of Robotics, hardwired in a robot&#x27;s positronic brain, with which all robots in his fiction must comply, and which ensure that the robot does not turn against its creators.

The stories were not initially conceived as a set, but rather all feature his positronic robots. They all share a theme of the interaction of humans, robots, and morality. Some of the short stories found in &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982) and other anthologies appear not to be set in the same universe as the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe. &quot;Victory Unintentional&quot; has positronic robots obeying the Three Laws, but also a non-human civilization on Jupiter. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; features humanoid robots, but from a different future (where the Cold War is still in progress), and with no mention of the Three Laws. Some characters appear in more than one of the stories, and the manufacturer of the robots is often identified as the (fictional) corporation &quot;U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Robot&quot; contains most of Asimov&#x27;s robot short stories. Missing ones were either written after its publication or formed the text connecting the stories in &quot;I, Robot&quot;.

The six Asimov robot short stories not included in this book are:
* &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; (found in the anthology of the same title)
* &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (found in the anthology of the same title)
* &quot;Too Bad!&quot; (found in &quot;Robot Visions&quot;)
* &quot;Christmas Without Rodney&quot; (found in &quot;Robot Visions&quot;)
* &quot;Cal&quot; (found in &quot;Gold&quot;)
* &quot;Kid Brother&quot; (found in &quot;Gold&quot;)

=== Overview of the Robot Novels ===
The first book is &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), a collection of nine previously published short stories woven together as a 21st-century interview with &quot;robopsychologist&quot; Dr. Susan Calvin. The next four robot novels &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; (1953), &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; (1955), &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; (1983), and &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; (1985) make up the Elijah Baley (sometimes &quot;Lije Baley&quot;) series, and are mysteries starring the Terran Elijah Baley and his humaniform robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw. They are set thousands of years after the short stories and focus on the conflicts between Spacers — descendants of human settlers from other planets — and the people from an overcrowded Earth. &quot;Mirror Image&quot;, one of the short stories from &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; anthology, is also set in this time period (between &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;) and features both Baley and Olivaw. Another short story (found in &quot;The Early Asimov&quot; anthology), &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, is set about a thousand years before the robot novels, when the Spacer worlds chose to become separated from Earth.

&quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; and &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; are both considered classics of the genre, but the later novels were also well received, with &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1984 and &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; shortlisted for the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1986.

==Inspiration==
One source of inspiration for Asimov&#x27;s robots was the Zoromes, a race of mechanical men that featured in a 1931 short story called &quot;The Jameson Satellite&quot;, by Neil R. Jones. Asimov read this story at the age of 11, and acknowledged it as a source of inspiration in &quot;Before the Golden Age&quot; (1975), an anthology of 1930&#x27;s science fiction in which Asimov told the story of the science fiction he read during his formative years. In Asimov&#x27;s own words:

It is from the Zoromes, beginning with their first appearance in &quot;The Jameson Satellite,&quot; that I got my own feeling for benevolent robots who could serve man with decency, as these had served Professor Jameson. It was the Zoromes, then, who were the spiritual ancestors of my own &quot;positronic robots,&quot; all of them, from Robbie to R. Daneel.

==Other authors of robot novels set in Asimov&#x27;s universe==

The 1989 anthology &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot; included the positronic robot stories &quot;Balance&quot; by Mike Resnick, &quot;Blot&quot; by Hal Clement, &quot;PAPPI&quot; by Sheila Finch, &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot; by Poul Anderson, &quot;The Fourth Law of Robotics&quot; by Harry Harrison and &quot;Carhunters of the Concrete Prairie&quot; by Robert Sheckley. Not all of these stories are entirely consistent with the Asimov stories. The anthology also included &quot;Strip-Runner&quot; by Pamela Sargent, set in the era of the Elijah Baley novels.

Shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels (&quot;Caliban&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot;, &quot;Utopia&quot;) by Roger MacBride Allen, set between &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; and the &quot;Empire&quot; series, telling the story of the terraforming of the Spacer world Inferno, and about the robot revolution started by creating &quot;No Law Robots&quot; and then &quot;New Law Robots.&quot;

There is also another set of novels by various authors (Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot City&quot;, &quot;Robots and Aliens&quot; and &quot;Robots in Time&quot; series), which are not generally considered canon. They are loosely connected to the Robots series, but they contain many inconsistencies with Asimov&#x27;s books.

The Asimov estate authorized the publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by Mark W. Tiedemann. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, are &quot;Mirage&quot; (2000), &quot;Chimera&quot; (2001), and &quot;Aurora&quot; (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, Alexander C. Irvine&#x27;s &quot;Have Robot, Will Travel&quot; (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy.

In November 2009, the Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of &quot;Robots and Chaos&quot;, the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author Mickey Zucker Reichert. The book was published in November 2011 under the title &quot;I, Robot: To Protect&quot;, and was later followed by two sequels: &quot;I, Robot: To Obey&quot; (2013) and &quot;I, Robot: To Preserve&quot; (2016).

==Adaptations==
* The first screen adaptation of an Asimov robot story was the third episode of the British television series &quot;Out of This World&quot; based on &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot;, first broadcast in 1962. Dramatized by and starring Maxine Audley as Susan Calvin, this is the only episode of the series known to have survived.
* This was followed by a 1964 dramatization of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; for the BBC series &quot;Story Parade&quot; and then four episodes of the BBC television series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, based on &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; (1966), &quot;Reason (in an episode titled &quot;The Prophet&quot;, 1967), &quot;Liar!&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; (1969). In these adaptations, Elijah Baley was portrayed by Peter Cushing (&quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;) and Paul Maxwell (&quot;The Naked Sun&quot;), R. Daneel Olivaw by John Carson (&quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;) and David Collings (&quot;The Naked Sun&quot;), and Susan Calvin by Beatrix Lehmann (&quot;The Prophet&quot;) and Wendy Gifford (&quot;Liar!&quot;). In &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;, the character of Susan Calvin was renamed Dr. Inge Jensen and portrayed by Ann Firbank.
* &quot;El robot embustero&quot; (1966), short film directed by Antonio Lara de Gavilán, based on short story &quot;Liar!&quot;
* &quot;Robots&quot; (1988), film directed by Doug Smith and Kim Takal, based on the &quot;Robot&quot; series
* &quot;Robot City&quot; (1995), an adventure game released for Windows and Mac OS.
* &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999), film directed by Chris Columbus, based on novelette &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; and on novel &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;
* &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004), film directed by Alex Proyas, based on ideas of short stories of the &quot;Robot&quot; series
* The Apple TV adaptation of the &quot;Foundation&quot; books contains several references to its shared universe with the Robots series. The robot character of Eto Demerzel is an adaptation of the character R. Daneel whose shrouded long-lived history is frequently mentioned. During the course of the show, several characters reference the &quot;Robot Wars&quot; that happened in the past and are apparently part of the Empire&#x27;s history. According to show runner David S. Goyer, the references to aspects such as the &quot;Robot Wars&quot; are planned to be explored in future seasons of the show.

In the late 1970s, Harlan Ellison wrote a screenplay based on Asimov&#x27;s book &quot;I, Robot&quot; for Warner Bros. This film project was ultimately abandoned, but Ellison&#x27;s script was later published in book form as &quot;I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay&quot; (1994).

<doc id="60135" wikidata="Q368390" url="?curid=60135" title="Galactic Empire series">
<text>The Galactic Empire&quot; series(also called the Empire&quot; novels or trilogy) is a science fiction sequence of three of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s earliest novels, and extended by one short story. They are connected by their early place in his published works and chronological placement within his overarching &quot;Foundation&quot; universe, set around the rise of Asimov&#x27;s Galactic Empire, between the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; series to which they were linked in Asimov&#x27;s later novels.

==Works in the series==
In order of internal chronology the &quot;Empire&quot; series consists of:
# &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; (1951), novel
# &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; (1952), novel
# &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; (1950), his first novel
# &quot;Blind Alley&quot; (1945), a short story also set between the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; series

(However, Asimov stated in 1988 in the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; to &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; that book #6 was &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; (1952), and that this was &quot;the first of my Empire novels,&quot; and that book #7 was &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; (1951), which was &quot;[the] second Empire novel.&quot;)

==Publication history==
The three &quot;Empire&quot; books, first published between 1950 and 1952, are Asimov&#x27;s three earliest novels published in his own name (&quot;David Starr, Space Ranger&quot; was published before &quot;The Currents of Space&quot;, but had been published under his pen name &quot;Paul French&quot;, and the &quot;Foundation&quot; books were collections of linked short stories rather than continuous novels).

&quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; was originally written in the summer of 1947 under the title &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot; for &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, whose editor Sam Merwin, Jr. had approached Asimov to write a forty thousand word short novel for the magazine. The title was adapted from Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Rabbi ben Ezra&quot;, the first few lines of which (starting &quot;Grow old along with me! / The best is yet to be...&quot;) were included in the final novel. It was rejected by &quot;Startling Stories&quot; on the basis that the magazine&#x27;s emphasis was more on adventure than science-heavy fiction (despite the editor having invited Asimov to write the latter as an experiment for the magazine), and again by John W. Campbell, Asimov&#x27;s usual editor. In 1949, Doubleday editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted the story on the suggestion of Frederik Pohl, on the condition it was expanded to seventy thousand words and the title changed to something more science fiction oriented; it was published in January 1950 as &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;. &quot;Grow Old With Me&quot; was later published in its original form along with other draft stories in &quot;The Alternate Asimovs&quot; in 1986.

&quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; was originally serialised under the title &quot;Tyrann&quot; in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from January to March 1951, and was published as a novel by Doubleday later that year. The first paperback edition was an Ace Books double novel along with Roger Dee&#x27;s &quot;An Earth Gone Mad&quot;; &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; was retitled &quot;The Rebellious Stars&quot; for this edition without Asimov&#x27;s consent. The novel was reprinted in with the &quot;Foundation&quot; Trilogy, &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and &quot;I, Robot&quot; in a hardback selected works edition in 1982 by Littlehampton Book Services.

&quot;The Currents of Space&quot; was originally serialised in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; from October to December 1952 before being published by Doubleday as a novel the same year.

The books have been reprinted a number of times as a trilogy (as well as many times separately): in 1986 by Ballantine Books as &quot;Galactic Empire Novel[s]&quot;, in 1992 by Spectra as &quot;The Empire Novels&quot; and in 2010 along with &quot;The End of Eternity&quot; by Orb Books, in both print and Kindle editions.

After the publication of &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; in 1952, all three novels (the only Asimov novels published at that time) were collected into an omnibus titled &quot;Triangle&quot;. They were republished again as a single volume, &quot;The Empire Novels&quot;, in 2002 by the Science Fiction Book Club.

&quot;Blind Alley&quot; was published before any of the novels; written in 1944, it was accepted by John W. Campbell later that year and published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in March 1945. It was anthologised by Groff Conklin in &quot;The Best of Science Fiction&quot;, the first of Asimov&#x27;s stories to have been reprinted, and was later included in &quot;The Early Asimov&quot; (in 1972, along with a very brief history of its origins), &quot;The Asimov Chronicles&quot; in 1989 and in volume 2 of &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; in 1992. It has never been published together with the novels, as it is connected only on the basis of being set during the Galactic Empire, after the &quot;Robot&quot; stories and before the &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

==Development and themes==
These stories are set in the same future as the Foundation series, which had appeared in magazines starting in 1942. The tie is not close, and they are only loosely connected to each other, each being a complete tale in its own right. Their main common points are Asimov&#x27;s idea of a future Galactic Empire, certain aspects of technology — hyperdrive, blaster pistols, &quot;neuronic whips&quot;, the possible invention of the &quot;Visi-Sonor&quot; — and particular locations, such as the planet Trantor. Another connection was later established with &quot;Robots and Empire,&quot; where Asimov revealed how Earth became radioactive, as mentioned in all three novels. Some sources further this argument by asserting that &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; takes place about one thousand years following the events of &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;. Also, the calendar used on spaceships in &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; is the same that the Spacers introduce Lije Baley to in &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;.

The short story &quot;Blind Alley&quot; is the only story set in the Foundation universe to feature intelligence not of human origin; &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; features non-human intelligences (of Solaria and Gaia), but they are descended from or created by humans.

Asimov later integrated them into his all-engulfing Foundation series. Some contortion was required to explain how the robots of the Robot series are almost completely absent from the Galactic Empire novels. In reality, this is because Asimov wrote the original Robot and Foundation short stories as separate series.

<doc id="60136" wikidata="Q23758" url="?curid=60136" title="Three Laws of Robotics">
<text>The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or Asimov&#x27;s Laws) are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov, which were to be followed by robots in several of his stories. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story &quot;Runaround&quot; (included in the 1950 collection &quot;I, Robot&quot;), although similar restrictions had been implied in earlier stories.

==The Laws==

The Three Laws, presented to be from the fictional &quot;Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.&quot;, are:
# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey the orders by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

==Use in fiction==
The Three Laws form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov&#x27;s robot-based fiction, appearing in his &quot;Robot&quot; series, the stories linked to it, and in his (initially pseudonymous) Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov&#x27;s robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov&#x27;s fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.

The original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in subsequent works to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others.

The Three Laws, and the Zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media. They have also influenced thought on the ethics of artificial intelligence.

==History==
In &quot;The Rest of the Robots&quot;, published in 1964, Isaac Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that &quot;one of the stock plots of science fiction was ... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?&quot; He decided that in his stories a robot would not &quot;turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust.&quot;

On May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the Queens (New York) Science Fiction Society where he met Earl and Otto Binder who had recently published a short story &quot;I, Robot&quot; featuring a sympathetic robot named Adam Link who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year &quot;Adam Link&#x27;s Vengeance&quot; (1940) featured Adam thinking &quot;A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.&quot;) Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing &quot;my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot&quot;, his 14th story. Thirteen days later he took &quot;Robbie&quot; to John W. Campbell the editor of &quot;Astounding Science-Fiction&quot;. Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to Lester del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Helen O&#x27;Loy&quot;, published in December 1938—the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife. Frederik Pohl published the story under the title “Strange Playfellow” in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; September 1940.

Asimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov&#x27;s friend Randall Garrett attributed the Laws to a symbiotic partnership between the two men—a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically. According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law&#x27;s &quot;inaction&quot; clause because of Arthur Hugh Clough&#x27;s poem &quot;The Latest Decalogue&quot; (text in Wikisource), which includes the satirical lines &quot;Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive&quot;.

Although Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, &quot;Robbie&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;. He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. &quot;Liar!&quot;, his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in &quot;Runaround&quot;. When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology &quot;I, Robot&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot; and &quot;Robbie&quot; were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to &quot;Reason&quot; is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere. In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley&#x27;s reasoning, as described below.

During the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the &quot;uniformly awful&quot; programming he saw flooding the television channels Asimov decided to publish the &quot;Lucky Starr&quot; books under the pseudonym &quot;Paul French&quot;. When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into &quot;Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter&quot;, noting that this &quot;was a dead giveaway to Paul French&#x27;s identity for even the most casual reader&quot;.

In his short story &quot;Evidence&quot; Asimov lets his recurring character Dr. Susan Calvin expound a moral basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot&#x27;s First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot.

The plot of &quot;Evidence&quot; revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human. Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply &quot;a very good man&quot;. Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, &quot;Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent.&quot;

Asimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are &quot;obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use&quot;, and &quot;analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not&quot;:

# Law 1: A tool must not be unsafe to use. Hammers have handles and screwdrivers have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.
# Law 2: A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason ground-fault circuit interrupters exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.
# Law 3: A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, Dremel disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).

Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws:

Asimov stated in a 1986 interview on the Manhattan public access show &quot;Conversations with Harold Hudson Channer with Harold Channer&quot; with guest co-host Marilyn vos Savant, &quot;It&#x27;s a little humbling to think that, what is most likely to survive of everything I&#x27;ve said... After all, I&#x27;ve published now... I&#x27;ve published now at least 20 million words.  I&#x27;ll have to figure it out, maybe even more.  But of all those millions of words that I&#x27;ve published, I am convinced that 100 years from now only 60 of them will survive.  The 60 that make up the Three Laws of Robotics.&quot;

==Alterations==

===By Asimov===
Asimov&#x27;s stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar James Gunn writes in 1982, &quot;The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme&quot;. While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time.

====First Law modified====
In &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; several NS-2, or &quot;Nestor&quot;, robots are created with only part of the First Law. It reads:

This modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their positronic brains are highly sensitive to gamma rays the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but &quot;might forget to leave&quot; the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law&#x27;s &quot;inaction&quot; clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so.

Gaia is a planet with collective intelligence in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy:

====Zeroth Law added====
Asimov once added a &quot;Zeroth Law&quot;—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character R. Daneel Olivaw was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story &quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot;.

In the final scenes of the novel &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, R. Giskard Reventlov is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is telepathic, like the robot Herbie in the short story &quot;Liar!&quot;, and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of &quot;harm&quot; than most robots can grasp. However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard&#x27;s brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure metacognition. Although he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law.

Daneel originally formulated the Zeroth Law in both the novel &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986) and the subsequent novel &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988):

A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; contains the following passage:

A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov&#x27;s novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit. Near the climax of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, Elijah Baley makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind&#x27;s long-term good. In Jacques Brécard&#x27;s 1956 French translation entitled &quot;Les Cavernes d&#x27;acier&quot; Baley&#x27;s thoughts emerge in a slightly different way:

====Removal of the Three Laws====
Three times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a short-short story entitled &quot;First Law&quot; and is often considered an insignificant &quot;tall tale&quot; or even apocryphal. On the other hand, the short story &quot;Cal&quot; (from the collection &quot;Gold&quot;), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, &quot;bobyclat
&quot; has been regarded as one of &quot;Gold&quot;&#x27;s strongest stories. The third is a short story entitled &quot;Sally&quot; in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same continuity.

The title story of the &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; collection portrays LVX-1, or &quot;Elvex&quot;, a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual fractal construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads &quot;A robot must protect its own existence&quot;.

Asimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov&#x27;s universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories&#x27; chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible, while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; believes it to require a century just to redevelop the positronic brain theory from scratch.

The character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term &quot;Asenion&quot; to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov&#x27;s stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. &quot;Asenion&quot; is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine &quot;Planet Stories.&quot; Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; just like he referred to himself as &quot;Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote&quot; in &quot;Thiotimoline to the Stars&quot;, in much the same way that Vladimir Nabokov appeared in &quot;Lolita&quot; anagrammatically disguised as &quot;Vivian Darkbloom&quot;.

Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot&#x27;s mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot&#x27;s entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.

===By other authors===

====Roger MacBride Allen&#x27;s trilogy====
In the 1990s, Roger MacBride Allen wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov&#x27;s fictional universe. Each title has the prefix &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s&quot; as Asimov had approved Allen&#x27;s outline before his death. These three books, &quot;Caliban&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Utopia&quot;, introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov&#x27;s originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the &quot;inaction&quot; clause, the same modification made in &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot;; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a &quot;New Law&quot; robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do &quot;whatever it likes&quot; so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that &quot;New Law&quot; robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to Fredda Leving, who designed these New Law Robots. According to the first book&#x27;s introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; says that &quot;With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set.&quot;

====Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;With Folded Hands&quot;====
Jack Williamson&#x27;s novelette &quot;With Folded Hands&quot; (1947), later rewritten as the novel &quot;The Humanoids&quot;, deals with robot servants whose prime directive is &quot;To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm&quot;. While Asimov&#x27;s robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson&#x27;s story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands.

====&quot;Foundation&quot; sequel trilogy====
In the officially licensed &quot;Foundation&quot; sequels &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Fear&quot;, &quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot; and &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (by Gregory Benford, Greg Bear and David Brin respectively) the future Galactic Empire is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by R. Daneel Olivaw.

The Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human religion, and referred to in the language of the Protestant Reformation, with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the &quot;Giskardian Reformation&quot; to the original &quot;Calvinian Orthodoxy&quot; of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with &quot;First Law&quot; robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel&#x27;s. Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law (&quot;A robot may not injure a human being...&quot;) advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause (&quot;...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm&quot;) claiming that robots should openly become a dictatorial government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster.

Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue AI — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead Voltaire — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics:

They therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and extraterrestrial sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel&#x27;s Zeroth Law — though &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel &quot;Foundation&quot;.

These novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel&#x27;s secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of positronic brain technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws. That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on Trantor develop &quot;&quot;tiktoks&quot;&quot; — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Fear&quot;.

In &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws&#x27; ambiguities.

====Robot Mystery series====
Set between &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, Mark W. Tiedemann&#x27;s &quot;Robot Mystery&quot; trilogy updates the &quot;Robot&quot;–&quot;Foundation&quot; saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies. The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological.

One should not neglect Asimov&#x27;s own creations in these areas such as the Solarian &quot;viewing&quot; technology and the machines of &quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot; originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. &quot;Aurora&quot;, for example, terms the Machines &quot;the first RIs, really&quot;. In addition the &quot;Robot Mystery&quot; series addresses the problem of nanotechnology: building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov&#x27;s stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. &quot;Aurora&quot;, in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial retcon, in a sense, of Asimov&#x27;s timeline.

====Randall Munroe====
Randall Munroe has discussed the Three Laws in various instances, but possibly most directly by one of his comics entitled The Three Laws of Robotics which imagines the consequences of every distinct ordering of the existing three laws.

====Additional laws====
Authors other than Asimov have often created extra laws. 

The 1974 Lyuben Dilov novel, &quot;Icarus&#x27;s Way&quot; (a.k.a., &quot;The Trip of Icarus&quot;) introduced a Fourth Law of robotics: &quot;A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.&quot; 
Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: &quot;The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings...&quot;

A fifth law was introduced by Nikola Kesarovski in his short story &quot;The Fifth Law of Robotics&quot;. This fifth law says: &quot;A robot must know it is a robot.&quot; 
The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot that did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review webzine &quot;The Portal&quot;.

For the 1986 tribute anthology, &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends,&quot; Harry Harrison wrote a story entitled, &quot;The Fourth Law of Robotics&quot;. This Fourth Law states: &quot;A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.&quot;

In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian proposed an additional law that considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law. This sixth law states: &quot;All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

== Ambiguities and loopholes ==

===Unknowing breach of the laws===
In &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, Elijah Baley points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could &quot;unknowingly&quot; break any of them. He restated the first law as &quot;A robot may do nothing that, &quot;to its knowledge,&quot; will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, &quot;knowingly&quot; allow a human being to come to harm.&quot; This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person&#x27;s food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria&#x27;s millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.

Baley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship&#x27;s robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant. This possibility is referenced in &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs.) Similarly, in &quot;Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn&quot; Bigman attempts to speak with a Sirian robot about possible damage to the Solar System population from its actions, but it appears unaware of the data and programmed to ignore attempts to teach it about the matter. The same motive was explored earlier in &quot;Reason (1941)&quot;, where a robot running a solar power station refuses to believe that the destinations of the station&#x27;s beams are planets containing people. Powell and Donovan are afraid this will make it capable of causing mass destruction by letting the beams stray off their proper course during a solar storm.

===Ambiguities resulting from lack of definition===
The Laws of Robotics presume that the terms &quot;human being&quot; and &quot;robot&quot; are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned.

====Definition of &quot;human being&quot;====
The Solarians create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of &quot;human&quot;. Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and they are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity—becoming hermaphroditic and psychokinetic and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the &quot;humans&quot; of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not.

Asimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots (&quot;androids&quot; in later parlance) several times. The novel &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; and the short stories &quot;Evidence&quot; and &quot;The Tercentenary Incident&quot; describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human. On the other hand, &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; and &quot;—That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot; explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. Gwendoline Butler writes in &quot;A Coffin for the Canary&quot; &quot;Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human.&quot; In &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, Elijah Baley points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there.

&quot;—That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot;, which Asimov intended to be the &quot;ultimate&quot; probe into the Laws&#x27; subtleties, finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very &quot;Frankenstein&quot; scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and are given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots, George Nine and George Ten, concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of &quot;humanity&quot;, and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet, they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves, an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the &quot;Three Laws of Humanics&quot;.

This story does not fit within the overall sweep of the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; series; if the George robots &quot;did&quot; take over Earth some time after the story closes, the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov&#x27;s fiction works have led scholars to regard the &quot;Robot&quot; stories as more like &quot;the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends&quot; than a unified whole.

Indeed, Asimov describes &quot;—That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot; and &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans. Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. In The Positronic Man, the novelization of The Bicentennial Man, Asimov and his co-writer Robert Silverberg imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of &quot;Foundation&quot;.

In &quot;Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn&quot;, a novel unrelated to the &quot;Robot&quot; series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being.

====Definition of &quot;robot&quot;====
As noted in &quot;The Fifth Law of Robotics&quot; by Nikola Kesarovski, &quot;A robot must know it is a robot&quot;: it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.

===Resolving conflicts among the laws===
Advanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as &quot;Runaround&quot; by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human; however, Asimov&#x27;s stories eventually included robot surgeons (&quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In &quot;Evidence&quot; Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a prosecuting attorney because in the American justice system it is the jury which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the executioner who carries through capital punishment.

Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws-obeying robots (Asenion robots) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this failure mode occurs in the story &quot;Liar!&quot;, which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma—in this case the robot will hurt humans if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not. This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov&#x27;s SF-mystery novel &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;. Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot&#x27;s brain—the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to let a human do its work, which on Solaria, due to the extreme specialization, would mean its only purpose. 

In &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, thus avoiding a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox.

In &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, Daneel states it&#x27;s very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent.

==Applications to future technology==
Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.

In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal &quot;Science&quot; on the topic of &quot;Robot Ethics&quot;, SF author Robert J. Sawyer argues that since the U.S. military is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed unmanned aerial vehicles to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs. In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:

The development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)

David Langford has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:

# A robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will terminate intruders with extreme prejudice.
# A robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law.
# A robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive.

Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov&#x27;s stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules.&quot; On the other hand, Asimov&#x27;s later novels &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; and &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.

In March 2007 the South Korean government announced that later in the year it would issue a &quot;Robot Ethics Charter&quot; setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.

The futurist Hans Moravec (a prominent figure in the transhumanist movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to &quot;corporate intelligences&quot; — the corporations driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future. In contrast, the David Brin novel &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays R. Daneel Olivaw worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and natural selection would sweep the Laws away — Asimov&#x27;s careful foundation undone by evolutionary computation. Although the robots would not be evolving through &quot;design&quot; instead of &quot;mutation&quot; because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured, design flaws or construction errors could functionally take the place of biological mutation.

In the July/August 2009 issue of &quot;IEEE Intelligent Systems&quot;, Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed &quot;The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics&quot; as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:
# A human may not deploy a robot without the human-robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics.
# A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles.
# A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control which does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.

Woods said, &quot;Our laws are a little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that &quot;The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves’. We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways.&quot;

In early 2011, the UK published what is now considered the first national-level AI softlaw, which consisted largely of a revised set of 5 laws, the first 3 of which updated Asimov&#x27;s. These laws ere published with commentary, by the EPSRC/AHRC working group in 2010: 
# Robots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security.
# Humans, not Robots, are responsible agents. Robots should be designed and operated as far as practicable to comply with existing laws, fundamental rights and freedoms, including privacy.
# Robots are products. They should be designed using processes which assure their safety and security.
# Robots are manufactured artefacts. They should not be designed in a deceptive way to exploit vulnerable users; instead their machine nature should be transparent.
# The person with legal responsibility for a robot should be attributed.

==Other occurrences in media==

Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the &quot;Frankenstein complex&quot;. His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction. Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly. Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are &quot;lovable&quot; – &quot;Star Wars&quot; being his favorite example. Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; episode &quot;Shgoratchx!&quot;, it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the Aaron Stone pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series &quot;Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion&quot; (&quot;Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion&quot;) bases episode three titled &quot;Hüter des Gesetzes&quot; (&quot;Guardians of the Law&quot;) on Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws without mentioning the source.

References to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music (&quot;Robot&quot; from Hawkwind&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;PXR5&quot;), cinema (&quot;Repo Man&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;), cartoon series (&quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot;), anime (&quot;Eve no Jikan&quot;), tabletop role-playing games (Paranoia), webcomics (&quot;Piled Higher and Deeper&quot; and &quot;Freefall&quot;), and &quot;video games&quot; (Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony&quot;)

===The Three Laws in film===
Robby the Robot in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov&#x27;s robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws.
Isaac Asimov&#x27;s works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his &quot;Robot&quot; stories, including the Three Laws. 

The film &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999) features Robin Williams as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s signature numeral). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. The film only loosely follows the original story.

Harlan Ellison&#x27;s proposed screenplay for &quot;I, Robot&quot; began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay&#x27;s plot development. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison&#x27;s introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.

In the 1986 movie &quot;Aliens&quot;, after the android Bishop accidentally cuts himself, he attempts to reassure Ripley by stating that: &quot;It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being&quot;. 

The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, &quot;I, Robot&quot; is &quot;suggested by&quot; Asimov&#x27;s robot fiction stories
and advertising for the film included a trailer featuring the Three Laws followed by the aphorism, &quot;Rules were made to be broken&quot;. The film opens with a recitation of the Three Laws and explores the implications of the Zeroth Law as a logical extrapolation. The major conflict of the film comes from a computer artificial intelligence reaching the conclusion that humanity is incapable of taking care of itself.

The 2019 Netflix original series &quot;Better than Us&quot; includes the 3 laws in the opening of episode 1.

==Criticisms==
Analytical philosopher James H. Moor says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results. He gives the example of a robot roaming the world trying to prevent harm from befalling human beings.

<text>Wilson&#x27;s disease (also called hepatolenticular degeneration) is a genetic disorder characterized by the excess build-up of copper in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver-related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build-up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin, and itchiness. Brain-related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble in speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and psychosis.
Wilson&#x27;s disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (&quot;ATP7B&quot;) gene. This protein transports excess copper into bile, where it is excreted in waste products. The condition is autosomal recessive; for people to be affected, they must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both parents. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.
Wilson&#x27;s disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low-copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents, such as trientine and -penicillamine, and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson&#x27;s disease can include liver failure and kidney problems. A liver transplant may be helpful to those for whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.
Wilson&#x27;s disease occurs in about one in 30,000 people. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 35 years. It was first described in 1854 by German pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after British neurologist Samuel Wilson.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and brain. Consequently, liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come for medical attention earlier (generally as children or teenagers) than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, who tend to be in their 20s or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson&#x27;s disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.

===Liver disease===
Liver disease may present itself as tiredness, jaundice, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy), and portal hypertension. The last, a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices (distended veins in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion) as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has already caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively low in Wilson&#x27;s disease.

About 5% of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products, such as ammonia, in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, patients develop hepatic encephalopathy – a serious condition that causes confusion, coma, seizures and, finally, life-threatening swelling of the brain).

===Neuropsychiatric symptoms===

About half of the people with Wilson&#x27;s disease have neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior. Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination), or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body). Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson&#x27;s disease. A characteristic tremor described as &quot;wing-beating tremor&quot; is encountered in many people with Wilson&#x27;s; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by abducting the arms and flexing the elbows toward the midline.

Cognition can also be affected in Wilson&#x27;s disease, in two non-mutually exclusive categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy, and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision-making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss, and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). These cognitive involvements are thought to be related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.

Psychiatric problems due to Wilson&#x27;s disease may include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson&#x27;s disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.

=== Other organ systems ===

Medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson&#x27;s disease:
* Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination, as deposits of copper form a ring around the cornea. This is due to copper deposition in Descemet&#x27;s membrane. These rings can be either dark brown, golden, or reddish-green, are 1 to 3mm wide, and appear at the corneal limbus. They do not occur in all people with Wilson&#x27;s disease, and may be seen in people with chronic cholestasis. Wilson&#x27;s disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither causes significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).
* Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis (Type 2), a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).
* Heart: cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson&#x27;s disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).
* Hormones: hypoparathyroidism (failure of the parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels), panhypopituitarism (leading to decreased production of hormones from the pituitary gland), infertility, and recurrent miscarriage.
*Musculoskeletal: Arthritis and thinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis).
==Genetics==


The Wilson&#x27;s disease gene (&quot;ATP7B&quot;) is on chromosome 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed primarily in the liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Most people who have Wilson&#x27;s disease – 60% – are homozygous for &quot;ATP7B&quot; mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% of them have only one abnormal copy. In up to 7% of cases, people with Wilson&#x27;s disease have no detectable mutations.

Although more than 500 mutations of &quot;ATP7B&quot; have been described, a very small number of those cause most cases of Wilson&#x27;s disease; which mutation an individual will have tends to be specific to the population they are part of. For instance, in Western populations, the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37%–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon; R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often there. Relatively little is known about the relative impact of the various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies. A comprehensive clinically annotated resource, WilsonGen, provides a clinical classification for the variants as per the recent ACMG &amp; AMP guidelines.

A normal variation in the &quot;PRNP&quot; gene can modify the course of the disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the &quot;ApoE&quot; gene was initially suspected, but could not be confirmed.

The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To inherit it, both of the parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most people with Wilson&#x27;s disease have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.

There are several hereditary diseases that cause copper overload in the liver; Wilson&#x27;s disease is the most common of them. All can cause cirrhosis at a young age. The other copper overload diseases are Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis, and idiopathic copper toxicosis. These three, unlike Wilson&#x27;s disease, are not related to &quot;ATP7B&quot; mutations; for example, ICC has been linked to mutations in the &quot;KRT8&quot; and the &quot;KRT18&quot; genes.

==Pathophysiology==
Copper is needed by the body for a number of functions, predominantly as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase, and tyrosinase.

Copper enters the body through the digestive tract. A transporter protein on the cells of the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A (Menkes&#x27; protein) releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here, ATP7B links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson&#x27;s disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apo-ceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.

When the amount of copper in the liver overwhelms the proteins that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage to the liver through a process known as Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue), and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body, but particularly in the kidneys, eyes, and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement and play a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson&#x27;s disease.

Why Wilson&#x27;s disease causes hemolysis is unclear, but various lines of evidence suggest that a high level of free (nonceruloplasmin-bound) copper may be directly affecting the oxidation of hemoglobin, or inhibiting the energy-supplying enzymes in red blood cells, or causing direct damage to cell membranes.

==Diagnosis==
Wilson&#x27;s disease may be suspected on the basis of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson&#x27;s. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and bilirubin levels. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson&#x27;s-related acute liver failure. If neurological symptoms are seen, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting. MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic &quot;face of the giant panda&quot; pattern.

No totally reliable test for Wilson&#x27;s disease is known, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body. The most accurate test is a liver biopsy.

===Ceruloplasmin===

Levels of ceruloplasmin are abnormally low (&lt;0.2 g/L) in 80–95% of cases. It can be present at normal levels, though, in people with ongoing inflammation, as it is an acute phase protein. Low ceruloplasmin is also found in Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia, which are related to, but much rarer than Wilson&#x27;s disease. The combination of neurological symptoms, eye signs, and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson&#x27;s disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.

===Serum and urine copper===
Serum copper is low, which may seem paradoxical given that Wilson&#x27;s disease is a disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin, which is often low in Wilson&#x27;s disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson&#x27;s disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson&#x27;s disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson&#x27;s disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).

In children, the following penicillamine test may be used: a 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, and all urine collected for 24 hours. If the entire day&#x27;s urine contains more than 1600 μg (25 μmol) of copper, it is a reliable indicator of Wilson&#x27;s disease. This test has not been validated in adults.

=== Slit-lamp examination ===
The eyes of the patient are examined using a slit lamp to look for Kayser–Fleischer rings, which are strongly associated with Wilson&#x27;s disease and are caused by copper deposition on the inner cornea in Descemet&#x27;s membrane.

===Liver biopsy===
Once other investigations have indicated Wilson&#x27;s disease, the ideal test is the removal of a small amount of liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson&#x27;s disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson&#x27;s.

In the earlier stages of the disease, the biopsy typically shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis, and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.

===Genetic testing===
Mutation analysis of the &quot;ATP7B&quot; gene, as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, family members can be screened for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson&#x27;s disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the &quot;ATP7B&quot; gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries such as the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems, as they tend to have more mixed populations.

==Treatment==

===Diet===
In general, a diet low in copper-containing foods is recommended. High-copper foods avoided in Wilson&#x27;s disease include mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and shellfish.

===Medication===
Medical treatments are available for Wilson&#x27;s disease. Some increase the removal of copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet.

Generally, penicillamine is the first treatment used. This binds to copper (by chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring of the amount of copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems; about 20% experience a side effect or complication of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for Wilson&#x27;s, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment. Those intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive. A further agent with known activity in Wilson&#x27;s disease, under clinical investigation by Wilson Therapeutics, is tetrathiomolybdate. It is regarded as experimental, though some studies have shown a beneficial effect.

Once all results have returned to normal, zinc (usually in the form of a zinc acetate prescription called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents its absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.

In rare cases where none of the oral treatments is effective, especially with severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.

People who are asymptomatic (for instance, those diagnosed through family screening or only as a result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. Whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate is unclear.

===Physical and occupational therapies===
Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial for patients with the neurological form of the disease. The copper-chelating treatment may take up to six months to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.

===Transplantation===
Liver transplantation is an effective cure for Wilson&#x27;s disease, but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illnesses, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.

==Prognosis==
Left untreated, Wilson&#x27;s disease tends to become progressively worse and is eventually fatal. Serious complications include liver cirrhosis, acute kidney failure, and psychosis. Liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma may occur, but at a lower incidence than other chronic liver diseases, and the risk is greatly reduced with treatment. With early detection and treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives and have a life expectancy close to that of the general population. Liver and neurological damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent. Fertility is usually normal and pregnancy complications are not increased in those with Wilson&#x27;s disease that is treated.

==History==
The disease bears the name of British physician Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878–1937), a neurologist who described the condition, including the pathological changes in the brain and liver, in 1912. Wilson&#x27;s work had been predated by, and drew on, reports from German neurologist Karl Westphal (in 1883), who termed it &quot;pseudo-sclerosis&quot;; by the British neurologist William Gowers (in 1888); by the Finnish neuropathologist Ernst Alexander Homén (in 1889–1892), who noted the hereditary nature of the disease; and by Adolph Strümpell (in 1898), who noted hepatic cirrhosis. Neuropathologist John Nathaniel Cumings made the link with copper accumulation in both the liver and the brain in 1948. The occurrence of hemolysis was noted in 1967.

In 1951, Cumings (in England), and New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown (working in the United States), simultaneously reported the first effective treatment, using the metal chelator British anti-Lewisite. This treatment had to be injected, but was one of the first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose, but had few treatments to offer. The first oral chelation agent effective in Wilson&#x27;s disease, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetra-thiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, and was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.

The genetic basis of Wilson&#x27;s disease, and its link to &quot;ATP7B&quot; mutations, was elucidated by several research groups in the 1980s and 1990s.

==In other animals==
Hereditary copper accumulation has been described in Bedlington Terriers, where it generally only affects the liver. In Bedlington Terriers it is due to mutations in the &quot;COMMD1&quot; (or &quot;MURR1&quot;) gene. The discovery of these mutations in the dogs led researchers to examine the corresponding human genes, but &quot;COMMD1&quot; mutations could not be detected in humans with non-Wilsonian copper accumulation states (such as Indian childhood cirrhosis).
