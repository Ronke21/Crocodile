<text>Boston University (BU) is a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. BU was founded in 1839 by a group of Boston Methodists with its original campus in Newbury, Vermont. It was chartered in Boston in 1869. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and the Boston Consortium for Higher Education.

The university has nearly 38,000 students and more than 4,000 faculty members and is one of Boston&#x27;s largest employers. It offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, doctorates, and medical, dental, business, and law degrees through 17 schools and colleges on three urban campuses.

The university is nonsectarian, though it retains its historical affiliation with the United Methodist Church. The main campus is situated along the Charles River in Boston&#x27;s Fenway–Kenmore and Allston neighborhoods, while the Boston University Medical Campus is located in Boston&#x27;s South End neighborhood. The Fenway campus houses the Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, formerly Wheelock College, which merged with BU in 2018. 

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. BU athletic teams compete in the Patriot League and Hockey East conferences, and their mascot is Rhett the Boston Terrier. The Boston University Terriers compete in the NCAA Division I.

== History ==
===19th century===


Boston University traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute in Newbury, Vermont, in 1839, and was chartered with the name &quot;Boston University&quot; by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1869. The university organized formal centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969. One or the other, or both dates may appear on various official seals used by different schools of the university.

On April 24–25, 1839, a group of Methodist ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school. Set up in Newbury, Vermont, the school was named the &quot;Newbury Biblical Institute&quot;.

In 1847, the Congregational Society in Concord, New Hampshire, invited the institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused Congregational church building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by New Hampshire designated the school the &quot;Methodist General Biblical Institute&quot;, but it was commonly called the &quot;Concord Biblical Institute&quot;.

With the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased on Aspinwall Hill in Brookline, Massachusetts, as a possible relocation site. The institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, and received a Massachusetts Charter as the &quot;Boston Theological Seminary&quot;.

In 1869, three trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by the name of &quot;Boston University&quot;. These trustees were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises, and they became the founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801–1872), Lee Claflin (1791–1871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802–1889), for whom Boston University&#x27;s three West Campus dormitories were later named. Lee Claflin&#x27;s son, William, was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869, after it was passed by the Legislature.

As reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book &quot;Transformations, A History of Boston University&quot; (see Further reading), the founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:

:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission ... on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.

Every department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.

Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the BU School of Theology.

On January 13, 1872, Isaac Rich died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the university was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston, which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university as of that time. By December, however, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the university, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the university in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.

As a result, the university was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill, and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of university ownership in this area. Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout Beacon Hill, and later expanded into the Boylston Street and Copley Square area, before building its Charles River Campus in the 1930s.

After receiving a year&#x27;s salary advance to allow him to pursue his research in 1875, Alexander Graham Bell, then a professor at the school, invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory. In 1876, Borden Parker Bowne was appointed professor of philosophy. Bowne, an important figure in the history of American religious thought, was an American Christian philosopher and theologian in the Methodist tradition. He is known for his contributions to personalism, a philosophical branch of liberal theology. The movement he led is often referred to as Boston Personalism.

The university continued its tradition of openness in this period. In 1877, Boston University became the first American university to award a PhD to a woman, when classics scholar Helen Magill White earned hers with a thesis on &quot;The Greek Drama&quot;. Then in 1878 Anna Oliver became the first woman to receive a degree in theology in the United States, but the Methodist Church would not ordain her. Lelia J. Robinson, who graduated from the university&#x27;s law school in 1881, became the first woman admitted to the bar in Massachusetts. Solomon Carter Fuller, who graduated from the university&#x27;s School of Medicine in 1897, became the first black psychiatrist in the United States and would make significant contributions to the study of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===20th century===

Seeking to unify a geographically scattered school and enable it to participate in the development of the city, school president Lemuel Murlin arranged that the school buy the present campus along the Charles River. Between 1920 and 1928, the school bought the of land that had been reclaimed from the river by the Riverfront Improvement Association. Plans for a riverside quadrangle with a Gothic Revival administrative tower modeled on the &quot;Old Boston Stump&quot; in Boston, England were scaled back in the late 1920s when the State Metropolitan District Commission used eminent domain to seize riverfront land for Storrow Drive. Murlin was never able to build the new campus, but his successor, Daniel L. Marsh, led a series of fundraising campaigns (interrupted by both the Great Depression and World War II) that helped Marsh to achieve his dream and to gradually fill in the university&#x27;s new campus. By spring 1936, the student body included 10,384 men and women.

In 1951, Harold C. Case became the school&#x27;s fifth president and under his direction the character of the campus changed significantly, as he sought to change the school into a national research university. The campus tripled in size to , and added 68 new buildings before Case retired in 1967. The first large dorms, Claflin, Rich and Sleeper Halls in West Campus were built, and in 1965 construction began on 700 Commonwealth Avenue, later named Warren Towers, designed to house 1800 students. Between 1961 and 1966, the BU Law Tower, the George Sherman Union, and the Mugar Memorial Library were constructed in the Brutalist style, a departure from the school&#x27;s traditional architecture. The College of Engineering and College of Communication were housed in a former stable building and auto-show room, respectively. Besides his efforts to expand the university into a rival for Greater Boston&#x27;s more prestigious academic institutions, such as Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (both in Cambridge across the Charles River from the BU campus), Case involved himself in the start of the student/societal upheavals that came to characterize the 1960s.

When a mini-squabble over editorial policy at college radio WBUR-FM – whose offices were under a tall radio antenna mast in front of the School of Public Relations and Communications (later College of Communications) – started growing in the spring of 1964, Case persuaded university trustees that the university should take over the widely-heard radio station (now a major outlet for National Public Radio and still a BU-owned broadcast facility). The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston&#x27;s broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case&#x27;s conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over BU student print publications, such as the &quot;B.U. News&quot; and the &quot;Scarlet&quot;, a fraternity association newspaper.

The Presidency of John Silber also saw much expansion of the campus and programs. In the late 1970s, the Lahey Clinic vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to Burlington, Massachusetts. The vacated building was purchased by BU to house the School of Education. After arriving from the University of Texas in 1971, Silber set out to remake the university into a global center for research by recruiting star faculty. Two of his faculty &quot;stars&quot;, Elie Wiesel and Derek Walcott, won Nobel Prizes shortly after Silber recruited them. Two others, Saul Bellow and Sheldon Glashow won Nobel Prizes before Silber recruited them.

In addition to recruiting new scholars, Silber expanded the physical campus, constructing the Photonics Center for the study of light, a new building for the School of Management, and the Life Science and Engineering Building for interdisciplinary research, among other projects. Campus expansion continued in the 2000s with the construction of new dormitories and the Agganis Arena.

====Student and faculty activism====

To protest the poor condition of Boston University&#x27;s African-American curriculum, on April 25, 1968 (three weeks after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.), African-American students conducted a sit-in and locked BU President Arland F. Christ-Janer out of his office for 12 hours. Umoja, BU&#x27;s Black Student Union, put forward ten demands to Christ-Janer and got nine of them approved that included the creation of a Martin Luther King Chair of Social Ethics, expansion of African-American library resources and tutoring services, opening an &quot;Afro-American coordinating center,&quot; admission and selection of more Black students and faculty. No disciplinary action was taken against the students who only opened the chains after their demands were met. &quot;There was no surprise, or feeling of victory on the students&#x27; parts,&quot; said Christ-Janer in response to the sit-in. &quot;They had confidence in their demands, and I had a confidence in them. The university, black and white alike, was the winner.&quot;
The late twentieth century saw a culmination in student activism at Boston University during the presidency of John R. Silber.

In 1972, student protests rose against the university administration&#x27;s endorsement of Marine Corps recruitment on campus which faced significant opposition from the Student Democratic Society.

On March 27, 1972, 50 police officers in &quot;riot gear&quot; defused a demonstration of 150 protesters at 195 Bay State Road, the BU Placement Office, where Marine recruiters were holding student interviews. A few protesters were arrested while some sustained minor injuries, including a student and two officers. Contrary to student claims of a peaceful protest, Silber said, &quot;Civilization doesn&#x27;t abdicate in face of barbarism. Those students or nonstudents who deliberately seek violent confrontation and refuse all efforts at peaceful resolution of issues must expect society to use its police power in its own defense.&quot; In response to Silber&#x27;s decision of a forceful police intervention, the Faculty State conducted a vote on Silber&#x27;s resignation which could not pass due to a &quot;vote of 140–25 with 32 abstentions.&quot; As a result of this failed motion, Peter P. Gabriel resigned his position as the dean of Boston University&#x27;s School of Management in protest of Silber&#x27;s presidency and his &quot;counterproductive&quot; leadership. Silber&#x27;s support of military recruitment on campus, which he pushed to make the university eligible for Federal grants, caused other demonstrations. On December 5, 1972, fifteen BU Student Government officers started a three-day hunger strike at Marsh Chapel demanding Silber &quot;to file a lawsuit against the Federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Herbert Amendment.&quot;

On March 16, 1978, about 900 Boston University students gathered at the George Sherman Union to protest against the $400 rise in tuition and $150 rise in housing charges declared by the trustees on March 7. The protest interrupted a board of trustees conference. While John Silber and Arthur G. B. Metcalf, chairman of the board of trustees, were negotiating with student government representatives to discuss the matter further on a separate occasion, the protesters marched into the building from two entrances, effectively trapping 40 trustees and 10 university administrators in the building for over thirty minutes. Twenty officers from the Boston University Police Department had to disperse the crowd from the stairwells. The protest resulted in the arrest of 19 year old Joshua Grossman, while another student and two BUPD officers were taken to hospitals.

On April 5, 1979, several hundred faculty members, as well as clerical workers and librarians, went on strike. The faculty members were seeking a labor contract while the clerical workers and librarians were seeking union recognition. The strike ended by mid-April under terms favorable to the employees.

On November 27, 1979, the committee to Defend Iranian Students—composed of Iranian students, Youths Against Foreign Fascism and the Revolutionary Communist Party—held a demonstration at the George Sherman Union against the deposed Shah of Iran and the deportation of Iranian students from the US. &quot;To the Iranian people, that man (the shah) is Adolf Hitler,&quot; students protested. &quot;The Shah Must Face the Wrath of the People.&quot; This was met with chants of &quot;God Bless America&quot; from the opposing group. Twenty policemen broke up the confronting parties though no arrests were made.

===21st century===
Following the trustees&#x27; push for the resignation of the university&#x27;s eighth president, Jon Westling, they voted unanimously to offer the presidency of the university to Daniel S. Goldin, former administrator of NASA under presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Goldin was set to take over the job on November 1, 2003, and be officially inaugurated on November 17, though the deal collapsed in the week leading up to his arrival in Boston.

The university eventually terminated Goldin&#x27;s contract at a cost of $1.8 million and initiated a second search to fill the presidential position, culminating with the inauguration of Robert A. Brown as the university&#x27;s 10th president on April 27, 2006. (Aram Chobanian, who had served as &quot;president ad interim&quot; during most of the second search, was formally recognized as the 9th president in 2005.) In the wake of this fiasco, several actions were taken to improve the image projected to potential presidential candidates as well as the functioning of the board itself.

In 2012, the university was invited to join the Association of American Universities, comprising 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. BU, one of four universities at the time invited to join the group since 2000, became the 62nd member. In the Boston area, Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and Brandeis are also members.

That same year, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was launched, its first comprehensive campaign, emphasizing financial aid, faculty support, research, and facility improvements. In 2016, the campaign goal was reached. The board of trustees voted to raise the goal to $1.5 billion and extend through 2019. The campaign has funded 74 new faculty positions, including 49 named full professorships and 25 Career Development Professorships. The campaign concluded in September 2019, raising a total of $1.85 billion over seven years.

In February 2015, the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.
The Charles River and Medical Campuses have undergone physical transformations since 2006, from new buildings and playing fields to dormitory renovations. The campus has seen the addition of a 26-floor student residence at 33 Harry Agganis Way, nicknamed StuVi2, the New Balance Playing Field, the Yawkey Center for Student Services, the Alan and Sherry Leventhal Center, the Law tower and Redstone annex, the Engineering Product Innovation Center (EPIC), the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering, and the Joan and Edgar Booth Theatre, which opened in fall 2017. The construction of the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering was funded by part of BU&#x27;s largest ever gift, a $115 million donation from Rajen Kilachand. The Dahod Family Alumni Center in the renovated BU Castle began in May 2017 and was completed in fall 2018. Development of the university&#x27;s existing housing stock has included significant renovations to BU&#x27;s oldest dorm, 610 Beacon Street (formerly Myles Standish Hall) and Annex, and to Kilachand Hall, formerly known as Shelton Hall, and a brand new student residence on the Medical Campus. In May 2024, Boston University removed Myles Standish&#x27;s name from the building. It is now referred to by its address, 610 Beacon Street.

In 2019, Boston University expanded its financial aid program so that it would &quot;meet the full need for all domestic students who qualify for financial aid,&quot; starting in fall 2020. 

In September 2022, Robert A. Brown announced he will step down at the end of the 2022–2023 academic year. Brown began his presidency in September 2005, and his contract was set to run through 2025. Although Brown chose to end his presidency, he will resume teaching at the university. On August 1, 2023, Kenneth W. Freeman started serving as president ad interim. In October 2023, Melissa Gilliam was named the incoming president, starting her term on July 1, 2024.

On July 1, 2024, Melissa Gilliam began her tenure as the university&#x27;s 11th president. 

==== Response to the COVID-19 pandemic ====
The university closed down due to the COVID-19 and shifted to online learning for the remainder of the semester on March 11, 2020. For the fall 2020 semester, BU offered a hybrid system that allows for students to decide whether to take a remote class or participate in-person. Larger classes would be broken down into smaller groups that rotate between online and in-person sessions. The school started administering its own COVID-19 testing for faculty, staff, and students on July 27, 2020. The new BU Clinical Testing Laboratory has accelerated testing that can give results to students, staff, and faculty by the next day. The lab uses eight robots to process up to 6,000 tests per day. A contact tracing team is part of the process to contain infections on campus. BU also started a new website &quot;Back2BU&quot; to provide students with the latest information on reopening. The results of the tests were published on BU&#x27;s public COVID-19 Testing Data Dashboard.

BU&#x27;s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) has been working with live coronavirus samples since March 2020, and—at the time—was the only New England lab to have live samples.

In August 2020, BU filed a service mark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to secure the phrase &quot;F*ck It Won&#x27;t Cut It&quot; for a student-led COVID-19 safety program on campus. The slogan is meant to promote &quot;safe and smart actions and behaviors for college and university students in a COVID-19 environment&quot;, according to the application.

In July 2021, BU announced faculty and staff will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for the fall 2022 semester. This comes after a vaccine requirement for all students, which was announced in April.

==== COVID-19 research and gain-of-function controversy ====
In October 2022, Boston University&#x27;s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories conducted research in a Biosafety Level 3 lab that modified the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 with the spike proteins of the Omicron variant. This resulted in a virus that was more lethal to lab mice than the Omicron variant itself, but less lethal than the original strain. Some medical authorities criticized the research as dangerous &quot;gain of function&quot; research, but others argued that it did not &quot;technically&quot; count as gain of function research because the modified virus happened not to be quite as lethal as the original strain. Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, however, argued &quot;these are unquestionably gain-of-function experiments. As many have noted, this is a very broad term encompassing many harmless and some potentially dangerous experiments. GOF is a scientific technique, not an epithet.&quot; While the BU researchers gained internal research and Boston government approvals for the research, they failed to notify the US Government&#x27;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that was a funder of the lab.

==Campus==
===Boston campuses and facilities===

The university&#x27;s main Charles River Campus follows Commonwealth Avenue and the Green Line, beginning near Kenmore Square and continuing for over a mile and a half to its end near the border of Boston&#x27;s Allston neighborhood. The Boston University Bridge over the Charles River into Cambridge represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and West Campus, home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex. Boston University also has a campus located in the Fenway area, housing undergraduate students. 

The main campus buildings of BU are separated from the Charles River Esplanade parkland and the Paul Dudley White Bike Path along the banks of the nearby Charles River, by heavily trafficked Storrow Drive, a high-speed limited-access major roadway connecting downtown Boston to its western suburbs. The separation occurred in the late 1920s, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized land by eminent domain for the construction of the new roadway along the riverbank. A narrow strip of grassy lawn between BU academic buildings lining Commonwealth Avenue and the torrent of traffic on Storrow Drive has been humorously dubbed &quot;BU Beach&quot;, because it is a favorite hangout for sunbathing in good weather. The lounging students are protected from traffic incursions by a raised earthen berm, which also muffles the traffic noise to a dull roar. To protect pedestrians from vehicular collisions, Storrow Drive is enclosed by fencing, with pedestrian bridges allowing safe crossings at Silber Way and at Marsh Chapel. An additional crossing is possible at the BU Bridge, which also allows street traffic to cross from the Boston side to the Cambridge side of the Charles River.

As a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel, and the School of Theology buildings are the university&#x27;s most recognizable, and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in collegiate gothic style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston brownstone, especially at Bay State Road and South Campus, where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories, but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices.

From the 1960s through the 1980s, several contemporary buildings were constructed, including the Mugar Library, BU Law School, and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the brutalist style of architecture. The Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering, constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as Structural Expressionism. Morse Auditorium, adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was originally constructed as a Jewish synagogue. The most recent architectural additions to BU&#x27;s campus are the Center for Computing &amp; Data Sciences, Photonics Center, Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the FitRec Center and Agganis Arena), and the Questrom School of Business. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone. Boston University converted the old Nickelodeon Cinemas complex into College of Engineering labs and offices. In 2016, the university sold the building that housed the Huntington Theatre Company and constructed the Joan &amp; Edgar Booth Theatre and College of Fine Arts Production Center to consolidate the theater program on campus.

BU has earned several historic preservation awards with recent extensive building renovation projects, such as the School of Law tower, the Alan &amp; Sherry Leventhal Center, 610 Beacon Street (formerly Myles Standish Hall), and the Dahod Family Alumni Center (formerly The Castle). Construction of the brick and glass Yawkey Center for Student Services was designed to follow the requirements of the Bay State Road historic district. Use of glass and steel for new construction on Commonwealth Avenue includes the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering, which opened in 2017, and the 19-story Center for Computing &amp; Data Sciences, which opened in 2022.

The ceremonial opening on December 8, 2022, was covered by publications including Bloomberg, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and CBS News which praised the building for being the largest carbon-neutral building in Boston and noted its unusual design. A ribbon cutting ceremony was performed by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, President Robert A. Brown, the associate provost for computing and data sciences Azer Bestavros, dean of Arts &amp; Sciences Stan Sclaroff, BU Board of Trustees chair Ahmass Fakahany, BU provost Jean Morrison, and Boston city councilor Kenzie Bok.

In 2018, following negotiations in the preceding year, Boston University purchased the former Wheelock College, which is now referred to as the Boston University Fenway Campus (although it is actually located in the adjacent neighborhood of Longwood).

, BU has sold or leased to real estate developers several building sites it owned in Kenmore Square next to its campus. Large multistory buildings are being constructed there, which will transform the long-time appearance of the busy traffic hub.

In September 2021, BU completed a $115 million project to renovate and expand the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine. The project expanded clinical spaces, added a simulation learning center, and improved collaborative spaces for students.

====Student housing====


Boston University&#x27;s housing system is the nation&#x27;s 10th largest among four-year colleges. BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.

Housing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century brownstone townhouses and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 1960s and 2000s.

The large dormitories include the 1,800-student Warren Towers, the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and The Towers. The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU&#x27;s townhouses, often called &quot;brownstones&quot;. South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.

Boston University&#x27;s newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, &quot;StuVi2&quot; unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory-style suite pattern. In total, the building houses 960 residents.

Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.

Boston University also provides specialty houses or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.

Kilachand Hall, formerly Shelton Hall, is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill. O&#x27;Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers&#x27; Corridor.

====John Hancock Student Village====
The Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering between Buick Street and Nickerson Field, ground formerly occupied by a National Guard Armory, which had been used by the university for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its demolition and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to &quot;StuVi&quot; by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, John Hancock Insurance announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.

The Agganis Arena, named after Harry Agganis, was opened to concerts and hockey games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for Terrier hockey games, replacing the smaller Walter Brown Arena. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center, was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body. Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.

====Other facilities====
 
The Mugar Memorial Library is the central academic library for the Charles River Campus. It also houses the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, formerly called the Twentieth Century Archive, where documents belonging to thousands of eminent figures in literature, journalism, diplomacy, the arts, and other fields are housed.

The George Sherman Union (GSU), located next to Mugar Memorial Library, provides students with a food court featuring many fast-food chains, including Panda Express, Basho, Starbucks, El Comal, Rhett&#x27;s, The Coop, Halal Shack, and Urban Table. The GSU also provides lounge areas for students to relax or study. The basement of the George Sherman Union is home to the BU Central lounge, which hosts concerts and other activities and events.

BU Castle, located on the West end of Bay State Road, is one of the older buildings on campus. The building was commissioned by William Lindsay for his own use in 1905, long before his daughter&#x27;s honeymoon on the ill-fated &quot;Lusitania&quot;. In 1939, the university acquired the property by agreement with the city to repay all back taxes owed; these funds were raised through donations from, among others, William Chenery, a University Trustee. It served as the residence of the university president until 1967, when President Christ-Janer found it too large for his needs as a residence and turned it to other uses. It is now a conference space. Underneath the Castle is the BU Pub, the only BU-operated drinking establishment on campus.
The Florence and Chafetz Hillel House on Bay State Road is the Hillel House for the university. With four floors and a basement, the facility includes lounges, study rooms and a kosher dining hall, open during the academic year (including Passover) to students and walk-ins from the community. The first floor also includes the Granby St. Cafe as well as TVs and ping-pong, pool and foosball tables. The Hillel serves as a focal point for BU&#x27;s large and active Jewish community. It hosts approximately 30 student groups, including social, cultural, and religious groups, and BU Students for Israel (BUSI), Holocaust Education, and the Center for Jewish Learning and Experience. It hosts a plethora of programs and speakers as well as Shabbat services and meals.

====Cultural life====

The university is located at the junction of Fenway-Kenmore, Allston, and Brookline. In the Fenway-Kenmore area are the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the nightlife of Landsdowne Street as well as Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. Allston has been Boston&#x27;s largest bohemian neighborhood since the 1960s. Nicknamed &quot;Allston Rock City&quot;, the neighborhood is home to many artists and musicians, as well as a variety of cafés, and many of Boston&#x27;s small music halls.

Beyond the southern border of the campus in Brookline, Harvard Avenue offers independent and foreign films at Coolidge Corner Theatre, and author readings at the Brookline Booksmith. Other nearby cultural institutions include Symphony Hall, Jordan Hall, the main branch of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, the art and commerce of fashionable Newbury Street, and across the Charles River, the museums, shops, and galleries in Harvard Square and elsewhere in Cambridge.

The university is home to the Boston Playwrights&#x27; Theatre. Previously associated with the Huntington Theatre Company on Huntington Avenue, but put the BU Theatre property up for sale in 2016, it cast a shadow over the future of the organization. BU replaced the old Huntington Theatre facilities with the new Joan and Edgar Booth Theatre, located next to the Fuller Building housing the College of Fine Arts.

BU hosts campus and non-campus musical performances in the Tsai Performance Center at 685 Commonwealth Avenue, and the CFA Concert Hall at 855 Commonwealth Avenue.

Visual art works by students and by visiting artists are displayed in rotating exhibitions in the university&#x27;s three galleries: the BU Art Gallery (BUAG) at the Stone Gallery, the 808 Gallery, and the Sherman Gallery, located respectively at 855, 808, and 775 Commonwealth Avenue. In addition, BU had been associated with the Photographic Resource Center located at 832 Commonwealth Avenue, which mounts several exhibitions yearly, as well as special events for student and professional photographers. However, BU withdrew its support , and the Photographic Resource Center is now a resident partner with the College of Art and Design at Lesley University.

==== Guest and visitor policies ====
Prior to September 2007, Boston University had a restrictive visitor policy, which limited the ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night. This changed when a new policy approved by Brown took effect. The new policy allows for students living on campus to swipe into any on-campus dormitory between the hours of 7 am and 2 am using their Terrier cards. Student residents can also sign in guests with photo identification at any time, day or night. Overnight visitors of the opposite sex are no longer required to seek a same-sex &quot;co-host&quot;. However, during reading period and the week before final exams, no guests are permitted in the halls overnight, and are expected to be out of the hall by 2 am.

====Mass transit====

Most of the buildings of the main campus are located on or near Commonwealth Avenue, served by the subway stop on the Green Line and five surface stops on the Green Line B branch. Crowding on the busy B branch is very seasonal; during the summer, ridership falls by more than half, largely due to the reduced student population. The South Campus and Fenway Campus areas are served by on the C branch and on the D branch. MBTA bus route parallels the B branch on Commonwealth Avenue; on the MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham/Worcester Line is located near East Campus.

Bicycle traffic on Commonwealth Avenue is heavy, and advocacy groups have held public meetings with BU, the MBTA, and the City of Boston to improve safety and congestion along this travel corridor. The MBTA plans to consolidate and reduce the number of stops along Commonwealth Avenue to speed travel and to reduce construction costs to upgrade the remaining stations. Improvements planned include full handicapped accessibility at the new stations, fencing to encourage pedestrians to use protected crosswalks, traffic signal prioritization for transit vehicles, and improved esthetics. The Commonwealth Avenue Improvement Project is coordinated by the Massachusetts Highway Department, in cooperation with BU, the MBTA, the City of Boston, the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, and other organizations.

The medical campus is served by the #1 and CT1 crosstown buses, which run along Massachusetts Avenue, and the No. 47 and CT3 crosstown buses, which connect the Boston University Medical Center with the Longwood Medical Area. The Silver Line Washington Street Branch runs the entire length of the Medical Campus, one block north of most parts of the campus; it connects Boston University Medical Center with Tufts Medical Center station and downtown Boston. The nearest rapid transit subway station is the Massachusetts Avenue station on the Orange Line, located three blocks north of the Medical Center.

==== Sustainability ====
The university has a sustainability initiative and a sustainability office. Boston University&#x27;s Strategic Plan for Campus Sustainability is also integrated into the university&#x27;s overarching strategic plan in many areas including the Climate Action Plan Task Force, a faculty-led initiative developing the university&#x27;s first Climate Action Plan. The Campus Climate Lab, led by the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability in partnership with Boston University Sustainability and the Office of Research, provides opportunities for student-led research projects that support sustainability on the campus.

In July 2022, social scientist Benjamin Sovacool led the establishment of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability. Formerly the Institute for Sustainable Energy, the university-wide institute advances cross-disciplinary research on sustainability with a focus on justice and equity.

The university bought a wind farm in South Dakota to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2040.

BU is one of 146 American universities receiving the highest research classification (&quot;RU/VH&quot;) by the Carnegie Foundation.

===Research===

In 2024, the university reported in $579.5M million in total research awards, and in fiscal year 2023 it ranked 16th in the U.S. among private institutions for all research and development expenditures. Funding sources included the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Department of Defense, the European Commission, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The university&#x27;s research enterprise encompasses dozens of fields, but its primary focus currently lies in seven areas: data science, engineering biology, global health, infectious diseases, neuroscience, photonics, and urban health.

In 2017, BU received a $20 million grant over five years from the NSF in order to establish an Engineering Research Center (ERC). The ERC&#x27;s goal is to bioengineer functional heart tissue. The director of the center is David Bishop, a professor of physics and computer and electrical engineering.

In 2003, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded Boston University a grant to build one of two National Biocontainment Laboratories. The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) was created to study emerging infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to public health. NEIDL has biosafety level 2, 3, and 4 (BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4, respectively) labs that enable researchers to work safely with the pathogens. BSL-4 labs are the highest level of biosafety labs and work with diseases with a high risk of aerosol transmission.

The strategic plan also encouraged research collaborations with industry and government partners. In 2016, as part of a broadbased effort to solve the critical problem of antibiotic resistance, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) selected the BU School of Law (LAW)—and Kevin Outterson, a BU professor of law—to lead a $350 million trans-Atlantic public-private partnership called CARB-X to foster the preclinical development of new antibiotics and antimicrobial rapid diagnostics and vaccines. CARB-X was allotted an additional $370 million in funding in May 2022. HHS will continue to support CARB-X with up to $300 million over 10 years, and global charity Wellcome will fund up to $70 million over three years. In May 2023, CARB-X secured renewed funding from the UK government (£24M over four years) and the German government (€39M over four years, and €2M for accelerator), and the Canadian government also announced its plan to support CARB-X with CAD $6.3 million over two years.

In its effort to increase diversity and inclusion, Boston University appointed Ibram X. Kendi in July 2020 as a history professor and the director and founder of its newly established Center for Antiracist Research. The university also appointed alumna Andrea Taylor as its first senior diversity officer. Later in August, Twitter founder and then CEO Jack Dorsey donated $10 million to the Center, noting that the gift came with &quot;no string attached.&quot; Ibram Kendi was named a 2021 MacArthur fellow and will receive a &quot;genius grant&quot; of $625,000 split over five years for his center&#x27;s research.

=== Grade deflation ===
The independently run student newspaper at Boston University, &quot;The Daily Free Press&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, have published articles exploring the existence of grade deflation. The &quot;Times&quot; discovered that administrators have suggested to faculty members deflated ideal grade distributions. Although an article in the official publication &quot;BU Today&quot; asserted that &quot;the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has found BU grades have been rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.

In 2014, the average GPA of a BU undergraduate was 3.16, compared to the averages of 3.35 for Boston College (2007), 3.48 for Amherst College (2006), 3.52 for New York University (2015), and 3.65 for Harvard University (2015).

About 81 percent of all grades earned in either the A or B range (75% in the B range). The article went on to note that although the university attempted to curb grade inflation and inconsistency in the late 1990s, both the percentage of As and GPAs have been rising since. They attributed the grade inflation that has occurred not to teachers&#x27; grading policies, but to the increasing quality of each incoming class which leads to more top grades.

===Journals and publication ===

Boston University is home to several academic journals and publications. The School of Law hosts six nationally recognized law journals: the &quot;Boston University Law Review&quot;, &quot;American Journal of Law and Medicine&quot;, &quot;Review of Banking &amp; Financial Law&quot;, &quot;Boston University International Law Journal&quot;, &quot;Journal of Science and Technology Law&quot;, and &quot;Public Interest Law Journal&quot;. The School of Education houses the &quot;Journal of Education&quot;, which is the oldest continuously published journal in the field of education in the country. In the College of Arts and Sciences, &quot;Studies in Romanticism&quot; is housed at the Department of English and the &quot;Journal of Field Archeology&quot; is housed at the Department of Archeology. The Department of History is affiliated with The Historical Society, which publishes &quot;The Journal of the Historical Society&quot; and &quot;Historically Speaking&quot;.

====Kilachand Honors College====
Boston University&#x27;s honors college matriculated its first class in 2010. In 2011, it was renamed Arvind and Chandan Nandlal Kilachand Honors College following a $25 million donation from alum and billionaire businessman, Rajen Kilachand. The Kilachand Honors College is a university-wide community of faculty and students dedicated to preserving, renewing, and rethinking classic ideals of liberal education: love of learning, intellectual curiosity, self-discovery, empathy, clarity of thought and expression. It rests on three pillars: an integrated, four-year curriculum; an extensive series of co-curricular events that include site-visits to leading cultural institutions as well as talks and readings by leading figures in the arts, sciences, and professions; and, finally, a &quot;living and learning&quot; community that offers students the personal atmosphere of a small liberal arts college and fosters responsibility and citizenship.

In 2013, Kilachand donated an additional $10 million to fund a renovation of Kilachand Hall, where first year students in the honors college are required to live. Kilachand would go on to become one of Boston University&#x27;s largest benefactors upon donating $115 million to bolster the university&#x27;s research at the intersection of the life sciences and engineering in 2017. The gift created the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering and a $100 million endowment that advances, in perpetuity, groundbreaking research at the intersection of the life sciences and engineering.

=== Mathematics and sciences ===

Affiliates of Boston University have won seven Nobel Prizes. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, conducted many of his experiments on the BU campus when he was professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution. In Boston, Bell was &quot;swept up&quot; by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. In 1875, the university gave Bell a year&#x27;s salary advance to allow him to pursue his research. The following year, he invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory. In the twenty-first century, the university has become a pioneering center for synthetic biology thanks to the work of James Collins. Collins and co-workers also discovered that sublethal levels of antibiotics activate mutagenesis by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to multidrug resistance. This discovery has important implications for the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics.

<text>The University of Warwick ( ; abbreviated as Warw. in post-nominal letters) is a public research university on the outskirts of Coventry between the West Midlands and Warwickshire, England. The university was founded in 1965 as part of a government initiative to expand higher education. The Warwick Business School was established in 1967, the Warwick Law School in 1968, Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) in 1980, and Warwick Medical School in 2000. Warwick incorporated Coventry College of Education in 1979 and Horticulture Research International in 2004.
Warwick is primarily based on a campus on the outskirts of Coventry, with a satellite campus in Wellesbourne and a central London base at the Shard. It is organised into three faculties—Arts; Science, Engineering and Medicine, and Social Sciences—within which there are thirty-two departments. Warwick has around 29,534 full-time students and 2,691 academic and research staff, with an average intake of 4,950 undergraduates out of 38,071 applicants (7.7 applicants per place). The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £850.5 million of which £146.5 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £559.6 million. Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex in the university&#x27;s main campus and is the largest venue of its kind in the UK, which is not in London.
Warwick is a member of AACSB, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Association of MBAs, EQUIS, the European University Association, the Midlands Innovation group, the Russell Group, Sutton 13 and Universities UK. It is the only European member of the Center for Urban Science and Progress, a collaboration with New York University. The university has extensive commercial activities, including the University of Warwick Science Park and WMG, University of Warwick.

Warwick&#x27;s alumni and staff include winners of the Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Medal, Richard W. Hamming Medal, Emmy Award, Grammy, and the Padma Vibhushan, and are fellows to the British Academy, the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society. Alumni also include heads of state, government officials, leaders in intergovernmental organisations, and a former chief economist at the Bank of England. Researchers at Warwick have also made significant contributions such as the development of penicillin, music therapy, the Washington Consensus, computing standards, including ISO and ECMA, complexity theory, contract theory, and the International Political Economy as a field of study.
==History==
===Twentieth century===

The idea for a university in Warwickshire was first mooted shortly after World War II, although it was not founded for a further two decades. A partnership of the city and county councils ultimately provided the impetus for the university to be established on a site jointly granted by the two authorities. There was some discussion between local sponsors from both the city and county over whether it should be named after Coventry or Warwickshire. The name &quot;University of Warwick&quot; was adopted, even though Warwick, the county town, lies some to its southwest and Coventry&#x27;s city centre is only northeast of the campus. The establishment of the University of Warwick was given approval by the government in 1961 and it received its Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1965. Since then, the university has incorporated the former Coventry College of Education in 1979 and has extended its land holdings by the continuing purchase of adjoining farm land. The university also benefited from a substantial donation from the family of John Martin, a Coventry businessman who had made a fortune from investment in Smirnoff vodka, and which enabled the construction of the Warwick Arts Centre.

The university admitted its first, small intake of graduate students in 1964, and took its first 450 undergraduates in October 1965. Since its establishment Warwick has expanded its grounds to , with many modern buildings and academic facilities, lakes, and woodlands. In the 1960s and 1970s, Warwick had a reputation as a politically radical institution. Under Vice-Chancellor Lord Butterworth, Warwick was the first UK university to adopt a business approach to higher education, develop close links with the business community and exploit the commercial value of its research. These tendencies were discussed by British historian and then-Warwick lecturer, E. P. Thompson, in his 1970 edited book &quot;Warwick University Ltd.&quot;. The Leicester Warwick Medical School, a new medical school based jointly at Warwick and Leicester University, opened in September 2000.

On the recommendation of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bill Clinton chose Warwick as the venue for his last major foreign policy address as US President in December 2000. Sandy Berger, Clinton&#x27;s National Security Advisor, explaining the decision in a press briefing on 7 December 2000, said that: &quot;Warwick is one of Britain&#x27;s newest and finest research universities, singled out by Prime Minister Blair as a model both of academic excellence and independence from the government.&quot;

===Twenty-first century===
The university was seen as a favoured institution of the Labour government during the New Labour years from 1997 to 2010. It was academic partner for a number of flagship Government schemes including the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth and the NHS University which is now defunct. Tony Blair described Warwick as &quot;a beacon among British universities for its dynamism, quality and entrepreneurial zeal&quot;. In a 2012 study by Virgin Media Business, Warwick was described as the most &quot;digitally-savvy&quot; UK university.
In February 2001, IBM donated a new S/390 computer and software worth £2 million to Warwick, to form part of a &quot;Grid&quot; enabling users to remotely share computing power. In April 2004 Warwick merged with the Wellesbourne and Kirton sites of Horticulture Research International. In July 2004 Warwick was the location for an important agreement between the Labour Party and the trade unions on Labour policy and trade union law, which has subsequently become known as the &quot;Warwick Agreement&quot;.

In June 2006, the new University Hospital Coventry opened, including a university clinical sciences building. Warwick Medical School was granted independent degree-awarding status in 2007, and the School&#x27;s partnership with the University of Leicester was dissolved in the same year. In February 2010, Lord Bhattacharyya, director and founder of the WMG unit at Warwick, made a £1 million donation to the university to support science grants and awards.

In February 2012, Warwick and Melbourne-based Monash University announced the formation of a strategic partnership, including the creation of ten joint senior academic posts, new dual master&#x27;s and joint doctoral degrees, and co-ordination of research programmes. In March 2012, Warwick and Queen Mary, University of London announced the creation of a strategic partnership, including research collaboration, some joint teaching of English, history and computer science undergraduates, and the creation of eight joint post-doctoral research fellowships. 
In April 2012, it was announced that Warwick would be the only European university participating in the Center for Urban Science and Progress, an applied science research institute to be based in New York consisting of an international consortium of universities and technology companies led by New York University and NYU-Poly. In August 2012, Warwick and five other Midlands-based universities—Aston University, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, Loughborough University and the University of Nottingham—formed the M5 Group, a regional bloc intended to maximise the member institutions&#x27; research income and enable closer collaboration.

In September 2013, it was announced that a new National Automotive Innovation Centre would be built by WMG at Warwick&#x27;s main campus at a cost of £100 million, with £50 million to be contributed by Jaguar Land Rover and £30 million by Tata Motors. The centre will open in Summer 2018. The building was opened by HRH The Prince of Wales on 18 February 2020.

In July 2014, the government announced that Warwick would be the host for the £1 billion Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC), a non-profit organization that facilitates funding to UK-based research and development projects developing low-carbon emission powertrain technologies. The APC manages a £1 billion investment fund, which is jointly supplied by the automotive industry – via the Automotive Council – and the UK government through the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and managed by Innovate UK.

In September 2015, Warwick celebrated its 50th anniversary and was designated &quot;University of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In December 2017, the university announced it would not continue with a project to open a Campus in Roseville, California. The university had spent £1.2 million on the project.

In 2023, the students&#x27; union voted for all the union-run catering to offer all plant-based meals. The vote was supported in order to reduce climate change emissions. By the following academic year, the menus will be 50% vegan and then will be fully plant-based by 2027. It is the eighth student union at a U.K. university to adopt plant-based catering.

==Campus==
Warwick is located on the outskirts of Coventry, southwest of the city centre and not in the town of Warwick as its name suggests. The university&#x27;s main site comprises three contiguous campuses, all within walking distance of each other. The university also owns a site in Wellesbourne, acquired in 2004 when it merged with Horticulture Research International.

===Main campus===
The main Warwick campus occupies between the City of Coventry and the County of Warwickshire. The original buildings of the campus are in contemporary 1960s architecture. The campus contains all of the main student amenities, all but four of the student halls of residence, and the Students&#x27; Union. The campus is split between the parliamentary constituencies of Kenilworth and Southam and Coventry South.

==== Warwick Arts Centre ====

The Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex situated at the centre of Warwick&#x27;s main campus. It attracts around 300,000 visitors a year to over 3,000 individual events spanning contemporary and classical music, drama, dance, comedy, films and visual art. The centre comprises six principal spaces: the Butterworth Hall, a 1,500-seat concert hall; a 550-seat theatre; a 180-seat theatre studio; three cinema screens; the Mead Gallery, an art gallery; and the Music Centre, with practice rooms, and an ensemble rehearsal room where music societies and groups can rehearse. In addition the site includes a restaurant/ café.

====University House====
In 2003, Warwick acquired the former headquarters of National Grid, which it converted into an administration building renamed University House. There is a student-run facility called the ‘Learning Grid’ in the building, which includes two floors of PC clusters, scanners, photocopiers, a reference library, interactive whiteboards and plasma screens for use by individuals and for group work.

====Koan====

The &quot;White Koan&quot; is a modern art sculpture by Liliane Lijn which is installed outside the back entrance to the Warwick Arts Centre. The &quot;Koan&quot; is high, white in colour, decorated with elliptical of fluorescent lights and is rotated by an electric motor whilst illuminated. It is intended to represent the Buddhist quest for questions without answers, the Kōan. The &quot;Koan&quot; was made in 1971 as part of the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation City Sculpture Project and was originally sited in Plymouth; it moved to the Hayward Gallery in London before being purchased by Warwick in 1972. 

The &quot;Koan&quot; was temporarily relocated to the university&#x27;s Gibbet Hill campus during refurbishments to the Warwick Arts Centre; it was returned upon completion of the project. According to student newspaper &quot;The Boar&quot;, the white Koan has played a role in many of campus&#x27; myths and legends – it was allegedly the nose-cap of the Blue-Streak Missile, a supposed quick escape route for senior staff, and even a signalling device for aliens in outer space.
The &quot;Koan&quot; even garnered its own cartoon strip in the 1990s, with thirty-two episodes created by Steve Shipway. The Koan Worshipping Society, led by the Koanists, believe the &quot;Koan&quot; is “the earth-bound manifestation of the immortal Koan, the creator of the universe”.

====Sports facilities====
In April 2019, the university opened a new £49 million Sports and Wellness Hub, on the main campus, featuring two sports halls with arena style balcony, the largest gym in the Higher education sector, a 12-lane 25 metre pool with movable floor, climbing and bouldering walls, squash courts, studio spaces and a café. The previous main sports centre was closed on 7 April 2019, 

Elsewhere on campus is another sports hall, a £2.5 million 4-court indoor tennis centre with floodlit outdoor courts, a 400 m athletics track, multi-purpose outdoor surfaces, and over of outdoor playing fields, including a football pitch and cricket grounds. Warwick was an official training venue for the London 2012 Olympics. During the Games, some football matches were played at the nearby Ricoh Arena, home at the time to Coventry City Football Club, and Warwick provided training and residential facilities for the Olympic teams.

====Esports facilities====
In September 2021, Warwick opened its esports centre in the new Junction building on central campus, marking it as the first esports facility opened in a Russell Group university and also the first university esports facility to be opened in the UK that is not tied to a degree. The centre is equipped with 24 PCs, and is designed to be easily configurable and moveable to facilitate the hosting of larger scale events. The centre is open to all of the public, not just students of the university, and this is all only part of &quot;Phase 1&quot; of a larger push from the university to invest in esports. The centre is sponsored by Uninn and Coventry City Football Club, partnered with Sky Blues in the Community, Women in Games and Special Effect and has its tech supplied by Chillblast and HyperX.

===Other sites===

Other Warwick sites include:
* The Gibbet Hill Campus, located contiguous to the main campus; home to the department of Life Sciences and the pre-clinical activities of Warwick Medical School.
* The Westwood Campus, located contiguous to the main campus; home to the Centre for Professional Education, Centre for Lifelong Learning, the Arden House conference centre, an indoor tennis centre, a running track and some postgraduate facilities and student residences.
* The University of Warwick Science Park.
* University Hospital Coventry, in Walsgrave on Sowe area and home to the Clinical Sciences Building of the medical school.
* Warwick Horticulture Research International Research &amp; Conference Centre, located in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire.
* The Shard skyscraper, in the city of London, houses Warwick Business School&#x27;s metropolitan campus where the Executive MBA is taught.

===Recent developments===
In November 2005, Warwick outlined proposals for how it would like to develop its campus over the next fifteen years. The proposals built upon recent construction activity including a new Mathematics and Statistics Building, new Computer Science Building, new Business School buildings, a Digital Laboratory, new Residences and an expanded Sports Centre. The proposals envisage a shift in the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; of the campus away from the Students&#x27; Union towards University House and a proposed &quot;Academic Square&quot;.

Developed projects included an inter-disciplinary biosciences research facility; a £25 million upgrade to Warwick Business School; and the National Automotive Innovation Campus (NAIC), a new £150 million venture funded by Jaguar Land Rover and the UK government. The NAIC&#x27;s purpose was to research and develop novel technologies to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and to reduce emissions. The new campus for postgraduates was opened in early-2020. The campus has been dubbed a &quot;brain trust&quot; and is intended to pioneer the green and high-tech sports and luxury cars of tomorrow, doubling the size of Jaguar&#x27;s research team.

In 2017, the university announced its intention to see an exponential growth of its main campus in order to remain &quot;world-class&quot; and cope with the growing number of applications it receives each year, especially from non-UK students. This growth included a new £33 million Faculty of Arts, a £55 million new sports centre which was finished in April 2019, a new £54.3 million Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research Building (IBRB), a new type of student accommodation called &quot;Cryfield Village&quot;, the expansion of Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a redevelopment for the Art centre and a new Library. For this occasion, Vice-Chancellor of Warwick University Stuart Croft declared: &quot;New buildings are and will continue to be a part of our everyday existence. We need to open one new academic building a year from now until at least 2023. In order to do this and to keep Warwick as one of the world’s leading universities, we need to do this together, involving the whole community.&quot;

==Organisation and administration==
Warwick is governed by two formal bodies: the Council and the Senate. In addition to these, a steering committee provide strategic leadership in between meetings of the formal bodies. Faculties are overseen by faculty boards which report to the Senate. The principal officers of the university have responsibility for day-to-day operations of the university. These include the registrar, the secretary to council, the group finance director, the director of commercial, the chief information and digital officer, and the chief communications officer The latter two roles were created after it emerged that the current registrar, Rachel Sandby-Thomas, had failed in her duty as the then data protection officer to notify staff, students, and partners of a series of significant breaches.

===Faculties and departments===
Warwick&#x27;s academic activities are organised into the following faculties and departments:
=== Finances ===
In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Warwick had a total income of £850.5 million (2022/23 – £828.2 million) and total expenditure of £559.6 million (2022/23 – £722.1 million). Key sources of income included £459.6 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £453.8 million), £74.1 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £74.4 million), £146.5 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £144.1 million), £24 million from investment income (2022/23 – £14.5 million) and £4.5 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £3.9 million).

At year end, Warwick had endowments of £7.3 million (2023 – £6.7 million) and total net assets of £733.3 million (2023 – £444.7 million).

=== Coat of arms ===
Warwick&#x27;s coat of arms depicts atoms of two isotopes of lithium, a DNA helix to represent science and also the &quot;Bear and Ragged Staff&quot;, historically associated with Warwickshire and previously the Earls of Warwick as well as the Elephant and Castle of Coventry. The Bear is not chained in the current depiction of the university&#x27;s coat of arms, although it had been in its original grant of Letters Patent by the College of Arms.

The 2020 QS World University Rankings ranked WBS 4th in the UK and 23rd globally. However, Law and Legal Studies at Warwick has dropped from 36th globally in 2013 to 51–100th in 2020.

Warwick is consistently ranked amongst the top ten in the three major national rankings of British universities. Warwick is a member of the &#x27;Sutton 13&#x27; of top ranked universities in the UK. Warwick was declared as &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; &quot;University of the Year&quot; 2015. Overall, nineteen of the twenty-seven subjects offered by Warwick were ranked within the top 10 nationally in 2019 by the Complete University Guide. In 2017, Warwick was named as the university with the joint second highest graduate employment rate of any UK university, with 97.7% of its graduates in work or further study three and a half years after graduation.

===Admissions===

Warwick students also average top A-Level grades with new entrants in 2015 amassing an average of 478 UCAS points, the equivalent of AAAaa at A-level—the 13th highest in the country. The university gave offers of admission to 62% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 34th lowest offer rate across the country. For 2017 entry, the university was one of only a few mainstream universities (along with Cambridge, Imperial College, LSE, Oxford, St Andrews, and UCL) to have no courses available in Clearing.

22% of Warwick&#x27;s undergraduates are privately educated, the fifteenth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities. In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 66:9:25 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 50:50.

===Library===
The main university library is located in the middle of the main campus. It houses approximately 1,265,000 books and over 13 kilometres of archives and manuscripts. The main library houses services to support Research and Teaching practice and collaboration between departments. The Wolfson Research Exchange opened in October 2008 and provides collaboration spaces, seminar rooms, conference facilities and study areas for Postgraduate Research students. The Teaching Grid, which opened in 2008, is a flexible space which allows teaching staff to try out new technologies and techniques. Adjacent to the main library building is the Modern Records Centre, a sizeable archive collection, including the UK&#x27;s largest industrial relations collection.

==Research==
In 2013, Warwick had a total research income of £90.1 million, of which £33.9 million was from Research Councils; £25.9 million was from central government, local authorities and public corporations; £12.7 million was from the European Union; £7.9 million was from UK industry and commerce; £5.2 million was from UK charitable bodies; £4.0 million was from overseas sources; and £0.5 million was from other sources. In the 2014 UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), Warwick was again ranked 7th overall amongst multi-faculty institutions and was the top-ranked university in the Midlands. 87% of the university&#x27;s academic staff were rated as being in &quot;world-leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot; departments with top research ratings of 4* or 3*.

Warwick is particularly strong in the areas of decision sciences research including economics, finance, management, mathematics and statistics. For instance, researchers of the Warwick Business School have won the highest prize of the prestigious European Case Clearing House. Warwick has also established a number of stand-alone units to manage and extract commercial value from its research activities. The four most prominent examples of these units are University of Warwick Science Park; Warwick HRI; Warwick Ventures; and WMG.

===Commercial focus===
Warwick has at times received criticism for being too commercially focused, at the expense of academic creativity and diversity. The most famous proponent of this critique was the noted historian E. P. Thompson, who edited and wrote much of &quot;Warwick University Ltd&quot; in 1971. The book focuses on the brief student occupation of the Registry in 1967, and its causes, the files that were discovered and published, and the subsequent actions of the university, students and staff.

Nevertheless, with the appointment of Sir Nicholas Scheele as Chancellor in 2002, the university signalled that it intended to continue and expand its commercial activities. In an interview for the BBC, Scheele said: &quot;I think in the future, education and industry need to become even more closely linked than they have been historically. As government funding changes, the replacement could well come through private funding from companies, individuals and grant-giving agencies.&quot;

==Student life==
The university has a campus cat named Rolf.

===Students&#x27; Union===

The University of Warwick Students&#x27; Union is one of the largest students&#x27; unions in the UK, and currently has over 260 societies and 67 sports clubs including basketball, rowing and ice hockey.

The Union Building contains a three-room club venue known as &quot;The Copper Rooms&quot;; CAMRA-accredited &quot;The Dirty Duck&quot; pub; a popular bar called &quot;The Terrace Bar&quot;; Curiositea, a tea shop known for its hot chocolates, cakes and vintage atmosphere; The Graduate, a postgraduate social and study space; and The Bread Oven, a design-your-own sandwich shop.

===Student media===
Student media at Warwick includes:
* Radio Warwick (RAW) – student radio station.
* &quot;The Boar&quot; – newspaper distributed free across campus every second Wednesday.

===&quot;University Challenge&quot;===
The university won BBC television&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge&quot; competition in 2021. This was their second win – their first was in 2007, beating the title-holders University of Manchester in the final.

===Esports===
The University of Warwick are the five-time UK Esports &quot;University of the Year&quot;, having won the title every year since its inception. In August 2022, Warwick became the first UK university to receive a finalist nomination for the Esports Awards, for Esports Collegiate Program of the Year, with Head of Esports Jack Fenton also becoming the first UK nominee for Collegiate Ambassador of the Year. Warwick fields numerous esports teams each year through its student-run esports society, Warwick Esports, who compete out of the Esports Centre.

===Student housing===

The Warwick campus currently has around 6,300 student bedrooms across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate residences. All of the residences are self-catered, and each has residential tutors and a warden. Warwick guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students, regardless of their present address. Many of the university&#x27;s postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living. Each residence accommodates a mixture of students both with home and international status, male and female, and, sometimes, undergraduate and postgraduate.

In their second and third years, many students live in one of the surrounding towns: either Coventry, Canley, Kenilworth or Royal Leamington Spa, where they can live in student accommodation or independently owned residences. Since 2011, Warwick has constructed two new halls of residences for the students. Bluebell, opened in 2011, offers accommodation in flats of eight people, with a total of 505 single rooms for first-year undergraduates. The Sherbourne residences was opened in 2012, which similarly provides 527 ensuite rooms to first-years, and was extended with a further 267 rooms in 2017. A further 700 new rooms were built in the Cryfield Village, namely Cryfield ‘Townhouse’ and ‘Standard’ residences.

=== Political incidents ===
In June 2014, the university announced Alex Davies, a member of the proscribed terrorist organisation National Action, voluntarily withdrew from his course. In early 2018, it was made public that a group of male students had constituted a group chat in which many references to rape, occasionally targeted at particular other students, and other sexual offences were made, in such a way which left significant cause for concern. As a result of this and other incidents, students staged a Sit-in in 2021 in the central plaza of the university. In January 2020, the university was criticised for choosing not to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This decision was later reversed in October following intervention by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. In June 2024, Students of the University&#x27;s Conservative association were filmed singing and dancing to the Nazi-era World War II marching song &quot;Erika&quot; at their annual black-tie dinner.

<text>Imperial College London (Imperial) is a public research university in London, England. Its history began with Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband, Prince Albert, who envisioned a cultural area in South Kensington that included museums, colleges, and the Royal Albert Hall. In 1907, these colleges – the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines, and the City and Guilds of London Institute – merged to form the Imperial College of Science and Technology. 

In 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School and then with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School to form the Imperial College School of Medicine. The Imperial College Business School was established in 2003 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Formerly a constituent college of the University of London, Imperial became an independent university in 2007. 
Imperial is organised into four faculties: Engineering, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Business. The university fosters innovation and enterprise across all its faculties by integrating business courses into science degrees and providing business students with a scientific education. The main campus is located in South Kensington, with an additional campus in White City. The Faculty of Medicine also operates five teaching hospitals across London and is a founding institution of the Francis Crick Institute. Its graduates and lecturers include 14 Nobel Prize winners, 3 Fields Medal winners, 74 Fellows of the Royal Society and 84 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
The earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament. This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines. The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in 1851.

In 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington. Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.

In 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines. The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890. The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in 1884, with courses beginning in 1885.

===20th century===
At the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – its Central Technical College. 

On 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London. The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910. The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.

As students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London. In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a Bachelor of Science. In October 1945, George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. &quot;Commemoration Day&quot;, named after this visit, is held every October as the university&#x27;s main graduation ceremony. The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947

Following World War II, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science – this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a &quot;British MIT&quot;-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton. The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however, and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years. The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962–63, and the Imperial Institute&#x27;s building by 1967. Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen&#x27;s Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing. New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a £350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.

In 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to &quot;The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine&quot; and made St Mary&#x27;s a constituent college. This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened. The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London. Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.

In April 2011, Imperial and King&#x27;s College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of £40 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub. This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.

In 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being told that he was &quot;struggling to fulfil the metrics&quot; of his professorial post. The college announced an internal inquiry into his death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.

==Campuses==
=== South Kensington ===
The South Kensington campus is the college&#x27;s main campus, where most teaching and research takes place. It is home to many notable buildings, such as the Business School, Royal School of Mines, and Royal College of Science. It is also the original site of the Imperial Institute, whose Queen&#x27;s Tower stands at the heart of the campus overlooking Queen&#x27;s Lawn. As part of a cultural centre known as Albertopolis the campus is surrounded by many of London&#x27;s most popular attractions, including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, museums including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and Victoria and Albert Museum, and institutions such as the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music, and the National Art Library.

The campus has many restaurants and cafés run by the college, and contains much of the college&#x27;s student accommodation, including the Prince&#x27;s Garden Halls, and Beit Hall, home to the college union, which runs student pubs, a nightclub, and a cinema on site. To the north, within easy walking distance of the college, are Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, with green spaces and sports facilities used by many of the student clubs.

=== White City ===

Imperial has a new second major campus in White City providing a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. This campus was built on land previously owned by BBC. The hub houses research facilities, postgraduate accommodation, as well as a commercialisation space. The campus is home to the Scale Space and incubator, Invention Rooms, a college hackerspace and community outreach centre. The White City campus also includes another biomedical centre funded by Sir Michael Uren.

=== Finances and endowment ===

The college&#x27;s endowment is sub-divided into three distinct portfolios:
* Unitised Scheme – a unit trust vehicle for the college, Faculties and Departments to invest endowments and unfettered income to produce returns for the long term
* Non-Core Property – a portfolio containing around 120 operational and developmental properties which the college has determined are not core to the academic mission
* Strategic Asset Investments – containing the college&#x27;s shareholding in Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings.

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Imperial had a total income of £1.309 billion (2022/23 – £1.256 million) and total expenditure of £1.051 billion (2022/23 – £1.235 billion). Key sources of income included £507.5 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £452.1 million), £165.4 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £183.3 million), £396.2 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £383.1 million), £28.8 million from investment income (2022/23 – £24.1 million) and £35.5 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £51.5 million).

=== Affiliations and partnerships ===
Imperial is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, Global Alliance of Technological Universities, League of European Research Universities and the Russell Group. It is a founding member of the Imperial College academic health sciences centre, the Francis Crick Institute and MedCity. Imperial is a long-term partner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first formal large-scale collaboration agreement dating back to 1944 as part of World War II scientific effort. The partnership between the two institutions continues with exchange programs for students and academic staff.

==Academic profile==
=== Research ===
In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Imperial&#x27;s research profile was assessed as 66 per cent world class (4*) 30 per cent internationally important (3*) and 3 per cent internationally recognised (2*), with insignificant quantities of research in lower categories. This led to Imperial being ranked first in the UK on GPA and ninth for research power by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, with a GPA of 3.63 and research power 47.3 per cent of the top-ranked University of Oxford.

The college promotes research commercialisation, partly through its dedicated technology transfer company, Imperial Innovations, which has given rise to a large number of spin-out companies based on academic research. Imperial researcher Narinder Singh Kapany made critical contributions to the invention of fibre optics.

The United States is the college&#x27;s top foreign country for collaborations, and Imperial College has a long-term partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that dates from World War II.

In January 2018, the mathematics department of Imperial and the French National Centre for Scientific Research launched an &quot;international joint research unit&quot; (; UMI) at Imperial, known as 
UMI Abraham de Moivre after the French mathematician, focused on unsolved problems and bridging British and French scientific communities. In October 2018, Imperial College launched the Imperial Cancer Research UK Center, a research collaboration that aims to find innovative ways to improve the precision of cancer treatments, inaugurated by Joe Biden as part of his Biden Cancer Initiative.

Neil Ferguson&#x27;s 16 March 2020 report entitled &quot;Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand&quot; was described in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article as the coronavirus &quot;report that jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action&quot;. Since 18 May, Imperial College&#x27;s Dr. Samir Bhatt advised the state of New York for its reopening plan. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said at the time that &quot;the Imperial College model, as we&#x27;ve been following this for weeks, was the best, most accurate model.&quot;

===Admissions===

In the academic year 2021/22, the ratio of applicants to admissions was 9:1 for undergraduates and 7.7:1 for postgraduates. The university gave offers of admission to 30.1% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 7th lowest offer rate across the country. The undergraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (19.2:1), mathematics (14.6:1) and mechanical engineering (11.2:1).

The postgraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (21:1), mathematics (17.9:1), and electrical engineering (14:1). Imperial is among the most international universities in the United Kingdom, with 50% of students from the UK, 16% of students from the EU, and 34% of students from outside the UK or EU. The student body is 39% female and 61% male. 36.5% of Imperial&#x27;s undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.

===Libraries===
The college&#x27;s main library is located next to Queen&#x27;s Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college&#x27;s collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum&#x27;s library until 2014. The Fleming library is located at St Mary&#x27;s in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.

===Medicine===

The Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary&#x27;s, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.
Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary&#x27;s NHS Trust (St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of £971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.
Other (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark&#x27;s Hospital, St Charles&#x27; Hospital and St Peter&#x27;s Hospital.

===Reputation and rankings===

Imperial College London is widely recognised as one of the UK&#x27;s elite universities. According to the 2025 QS World University Rankings, Imperial was ranked 2nd in the world, following MIT, and 9th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

Imperial is known for its hardworking and fast-paced entrepreneurial culture, which blends business studies with a science-based curriculum. Facilities such as the Enterprise Lab—which one in eight students uses and which reports a 79 per cent startup survival rate—demonstrate a commitment to innovation. Reflecting this, the 2023 QS MBA Rankings by Career Specialisation ranked its MBA programme 3rd in the world for entrepreneurship.

Imperial is also recognised for its interdisciplinary scientific research. Its strategic collaborations with institutions around the world have led to advancements that inform industries and public policy. The college’s portfolio of basic and translational research reinforces its reputation as an institution where research and entrepreneurship complement one another. 

Imperial&#x27;s specialised focus on practical subjects—engineering, science, medicine, and business—along with its emphasis on entrepreneurship and industry collaborations, has made it a leader in the UK for successful career outcomes. In 2024, Imperial was ranked 1st in the UK for highly skilled employment or further studies by the Complete University Guide, the Guardian University Guide, and the Times Good University Guide. An analysis of Higher Education Statistics Agency salary data for 2021 found that Imperial graduates had the highest median salaries of any UK university.

==Student life==

===Student body===
For the academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of , consisting of undergraduate students and postgraduates. 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK. 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013–14, and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007–08. Imperial&#x27;s male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall, and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.

===Imperial College Union===
Imperial College Union is the students&#x27; union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students&#x27; Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students&#x27; Union. The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies. 

Examples of notable student groups and projects are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America. The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club. The Union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly medical school events at the Reynold&#x27;s bar, Charing Cross.

=== Facilities ===

Sports facilities at Imperial&#x27;s London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls. Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds. On the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.

There are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside.
There are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial&#x27;s students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.

=== Student media ===
====Imperial College Radio====
&quot;Imperial College Radio&quot; (&quot;ICRadio&quot;) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976. It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet.

====Imperial College TV====
Imperial College Television (ICTV) is the university&#x27;s TV station, founded in 1969 as STOIC (Student Television of Imperial College) and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972.

====Felix Newspaper====

&quot;Felix&quot; is weekly student newspaper, first released on 9 December 1949. In addition to news, Felix also carries comic strips, features, opinions, puzzles and reviews, plus reports of trips and Imperial College sporting events.

===Student societies===
====Imperial College Boat Club====

The Imperial College Boat Club is the rowing club of Imperial and was founded on 12 December 1919. The college&#x27;s boat house is located in Putney on the Thames, and has been refurbished, reopening in 2014.

====Sports====

Imperial College has over 60 sports clubs, of which many participate in the British Universities and Colleges Sport Association leagues such as American Football, Rugby, Badminton, Lacrosse, Football, Ice Hockey, and many others.

====Exploration Club====
 Imperial&#x27;s Exploration Board was established in 1957 to assist students with a desire for exploration. Trips have included Afghanistan, Alaska, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Himalayas, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Yukon. 

====Dramatic Society====

The Imperial College Dramatic Society (DramSoc) is one of two major theatrical arts societies, with the other being the Musical Theatre Society, and it was founded in 1912. The society puts on three major plays each year, in addition to several smaller fringe productions. It is additionally one of the London-based dramatic societies to participate in the London Student Drama Festival, and regularly attends the Edinburgh Fringe. DramSoc is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the Union&#x27;s theatrical space, the Union Concert Hall.

====The Techtonics====

The Techtonics are an all-male a cappella group from Imperial College London, and are a part of the Imperial College A Cappella Society. The group was formed in 2008, and has since risen to prominence in the world a cappella scene. The group is best known for winning the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.

===Student housing===
Imperial College owns and manages ten halls of residence in Inner London, Acton and Ascot, Berkshire. Over three thousand rooms are available, with first year undergraduates guaranteed a place in one of the six main college residences (subject to certain requirements). The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.

Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a &quot;hall senior&quot;, and places are available for a small number of returning students in three small halls. The accommodation in Ascot is only for postgraduate students based at the Silwood Park site.

<doc id="61117" wikidata="Q171180" url="?curid=61117" title="Taboo">
<text>A taboo is a social group&#x27;s ban, prohibition or avoidance of something (usually an utterance or behavior) based on the group&#x27;s sense that it is excessively repulsive, offensive, sacred or allowed only for certain people. Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies. Taboos may be prohibited explicitly, for example within a legal system or religion, or implicitly, for example by social norms or conventions followed by a particular culture or organization.

Taboos are often meant to protect the individual, but there are other reasons for their development. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help use a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress said subsection of the community. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of &quot;belonging&quot;.

The meaning of the word &quot;taboo&quot; has been somewhat expanded in the social sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on moral judgment, religious beliefs, or cultural norms.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;taboo&quot; comes from &quot;tapu&quot; in Oceanic languages, particularly Polynesian languages, with such meanings as &quot;prohibited&quot; or &quot;forbidden&quot;. That root &quot;tapu&quot; is reflected, among others, by Tongan or Māori &quot;tapu&quot;, and by Hawaiian &quot;kapu&quot;. Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer James Cook visited Tonga, and referred to the Tongans&#x27; use of the term &quot;taboo&quot; for &quot;any thing that is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of&quot;. Having invited some of the Tongan aristocracy to dinner aboard his ship, Cook wrote:
The term was translated to him as &quot;consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed&quot;. &quot;Tapu&quot; is usually treated as a unitary, non-compound word inherited from Proto-Polynesian *&quot;tapu&quot;. It also exists in other Oceanic languages outside Polynesian, such as Fijian &quot;tabu&quot;, or Hiw (Vanuatu) &quot;toq&quot;.

Those words descend from an etymon *&quot;tabu&quot; in the ancestral Proto-Oceanic language, whose meaning was reconstructed as &quot;forbidden, off limits; sacred, due to a sentiment of awe before spiritual forces&quot;.

In its current use in Tongan, the word &quot;tapu&quot; means &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;, often in the sense of being restricted or protected by custom or law. On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of &quot;Tonga&quot; as &quot;Tongatapu&quot;, here meaning &quot;Sacred South&quot; rather than &quot;Forbidden South&quot;.

==Examples==
Sigmund Freud speculated that incest and patricide were the only two universal taboos that formed the basis of civilization. Through an analysis of the language surrounding these laws, it can be seen how the policy makers, and society as a whole, find these acts to be immoral.

Common taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the dead and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and dietary laws such as vegetarianism, &quot;kashrut&quot;, and &quot;halal&quot;) or religious (treif and haram). In Madagascar, a strong code of taboos, known as &quot;fady&quot;, constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own &quot;fady&quot;.

The word &quot;taboo&quot; gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, J. M. Powis Smith, in his book &quot;The American Bible&quot; (editor&#x27;s preface 1927), used &quot;taboo&quot; occasionally in relation to Israel&#x27;s Tabernacle and ceremonial laws, including , ; ; , , and .

Albert Schweitzer wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.

==In religion and mythology==

According to Joseph Campbell, taboos are used in religion and mythology to test a person&#x27;s ability to withhold from violating a prohibition given to them. Should one fail the test and violate a taboo, they will be subsequently punished or face the consequences of their actions. Taboos are not societal prohibitions (such as incest); rather, the use of &quot;taboo&quot; in these stories relates to its original meaning of &quot;prohibition&quot;: for example, a character could be prohibited from looking, eating, and speaking or uttering a certain word.

=== Greek ===

An example of an eating taboo in Greek mythology could be found in the tale of the rape of Persephone. Hades, who had fallen in love with Persephone and wished to make her his queen, burst through a cleft in the earth and abducted Persephone as she was gathering flowers in a field. When Demeter, Persephone&#x27;s mother, finds out of her daughter&#x27;s abduction, she forbids the earth to produce (or she neglects the earth) and, in the depth of her despair, causes nothing to grow. Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. It was explained to Demeter that Persephone would be released, so long as she did not taste the food of the dead. Hades complies with the request to return Persephone to Demeter, but first, he tricks Persephone, forcing her to break the eating taboo by giving her some pomegranate seeds to eat. In other interpretations, Persephone is seen eating the pomegranate seeds as a result of temptation or hunger. In the end, Hermes is sent to retrieve her but, because she had tasted the food of the underworld, she was obliged to spend a third of each year (the winter months) there, and the remaining part of the year with the gods above. With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus, Persephone&#x27;s time in the underworld becomes half the year.

The most notable looking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus, the son of Apollo, was well-renowned as a legendary musician whose music could move anything and everything, living or not, in the world. While walking among her people in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a satyr. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the humans, nymphs, and gods learnt about his sorrow and grief and wept with him. On the gods&#x27; advice, Orpheus traveled to the Underworld wherein his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone, who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should guide her out and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. As he reached the upper world, Orpheus looked back toward Eurydice in his eagerness to reunite with her, tragically forgetting about the looking taboo given to him by Hades, and since Eurydice had not crossed into the upper world, she vanishes back into the Underworld, this time forever.

A speaking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Anchises, the father of the Trojan warrior Aeneas. Aphrodite had fallen in love with the mortal Anchises after Zeus persuaded Eros to shoot her with an arrow to cause these emergent feelings. One interpretation recounts that Aphrodite pretended to be a Phrygian princess and seduced him, only to later reveal herself as a goddess and inform Anchises that she will bear him a son named Aeneas and warns him not to tell anyone that he lay with a goddess. Anchises does not heed this speaking taboo and later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result, he is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus. Thereafter, he is lame in that foot so that Aeneas has to carry him from the flames of Troy.

Another, albeit lesser-known, speaking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Actaeon. Actaeon, whilst on a hunting trip in the woods, mistakenly and haplessly happened upon the bathing Artemis. When Artemis realized that Actaeon had seen her undressed, thus desecrating her chastity, she punished him for his luckless profanation of her virginity&#x27;s mystery by forbidding him from speech. Whether it be due to forgetfulness or outright resistance, Actaeon defied his speaking taboo and called for his hunting dogs. Due to his failure in abiding by his speaking taboo, Artemis turned Actaeon into a stag and turned his dogs upon him. Actaeon was torn apart and ravaged by his loyal dogs who did not recognize their former master.

=== Abrahamic ===

Possibly the most famous eating taboo (if not taboo, in general) is in the story of Adam and Eve in the Abrahamic religions. In the Judeo-Christian telling, found in , Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden by God and are told not to eat from a tree lest they die, but Eve is promptly tempted by a serpent (often identified as Satan in disguise) to eat from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil because they will surely not die, rather, they might become &quot;like God&quot;. Eve violates the eating taboo and eats from the forbidden fruit of the tree, shortly giving some fruit to her companion, Adam. After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve are aware of their nakedness and cover themselves with fig leaves and hide from God. God realizes that they are hiding and interrogates them about having eaten from the tree whereupon Adam assigns the blame to Eve and Eve assigns it to the serpent. As a result, God condemns Eve with pain in childbirth and subordination to her husband, he condemns Adam to have to labor on the earth for his food and be reduced into the earth at death, and in the Christian tradition, he condemns all of humanity for this original sin. God then expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden lest they eat from the Tree of Life and become immortal &quot;like Him&quot;.

In Islam, the story of Adam and Eve is quite different, though it contains an eating taboo: the Quran mentions that Adam (Arabic: ), as the successive authority of earth by decree of Allah, is placed in a paradisal garden (not Jannah nor the Garden of Eden) therein along with his wife (unnamed in the Quran, though the Hadith gives her the name Ḥawwā’, Arabic: ); such a paradise this garden was, that they would never go hungry nor unclothed, nor would they ever thirst or be exposed to the sun&#x27;s heat. Allah took a promise from Adam:

Iblis, angered at his expulsion from Jannah for refusing to bow to Adam at his inception, decided to trick Adam and his wife into being shunned by Allah, just as he was. Allah had warned Adam and his wife about Iblis, telling them that he was a &quot;clear enemy&quot;. Iblis swore in the name of Allah that he was their sincere advisor, revealed unto Adam and his wife each other&#x27;s nakedness, and convinced them to eat from the forbidden tree so that they may never taste death. After eating from the tree (thus breaking the eating taboo), Allah removes Adam and his wife from their paradisal garden, telling them that mankind will be condemned with some being enemies with others on the earth wherein they will be provided habitation and provision, for a while, and “There you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.”

In the Gnostic telling of this story, the taboo is a plot by the archons to keep Adam in a state of ignorance by preventing him from eating the fruit, which allows him to attain gnosis after the serpent, who is viewed as representative of the divine world, convinces him and Eve to eat it.

A looking taboo can be found in the Judeo-Christian telling of the story of Lot found within the Book of Genesis. In , two angels in the form of men arrived in Sodom at eventide and were invited by Lot to spend the night at his home. The men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and demanded Lot that he bring his two guests out so that they might &quot;know&quot; them; instead, Lot offered up his two daughters, who had not &quot;known&quot; man, but they refused. As dawn was breaking, Lot&#x27;s visiting angels urged him to get his family and flee, so as to avoid being caught in the impending disaster for the iniquity of the city. The command was given, &quot;Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away.&quot; Whilst fleeing, Lot&#x27;s wife broke the looking taboo by turning to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and was turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for disobeying the angels&#x27; warning.

==Function==
Communist and materialist theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking. Marvin Harris explains taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.

==Modernity==
Some argue that contemporary Western multicultural societies have taboos against tribalisms (for example, ethnocentrism and nationalism) and prejudices (racism, sexism, homophobia, extremism and religious fanaticism).

Changing social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on slavery; extension of the pedophilia taboo to ephebophilia; prohibitions on alcohol, tobacco, or psychopharmaceutical consumption (particularly among pregnant women), also sexual harassment and sexual objectification are increasingly becoming taboo in recent decades.

Incest itself has been pulled both ways, with some seeking to normalize consensual adult relationships regardless of the degree of kinship (notably in Europe) and others expanding the degrees of prohibited contact (notably in the United States). Although the term &quot;taboo&quot; usually implies negative connotations, it is sometimes associated with enticing propositions in proverbs such as &quot;forbidden fruit is the sweetest&quot;.

In medicine, professionals who practice in ethical and moral grey areas, or fields subject to social stigma such as late termination of pregnancy, may refrain from public discussion of their practice. Among other reasons, this taboo may come from concern that comments may be taken out of the appropriate context and used to make ill-informed policy decisions that would lead to (otherwise preventable) maternal death.

<text>In computing, load balancing is the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.

Load balancing is the subject of research in the field of parallel computers. Two main approaches exist: static algorithms, which do not take into account the state of the different machines, and dynamic algorithms, which are usually more general and more efficient but require exchanges of information between the different computing units, at the risk of a loss of efficiency.

==Problem overview==
A load-balancing algorithm always tries to answer a specific problem. Among other things, the nature of the tasks, the algorithmic complexity, the hardware architecture on which the algorithms will run as well as required error tolerance, must be taken into account. Therefore compromise must be found to best meet application-specific requirements.

===Nature of tasks===
The efficiency of load balancing algorithms critically depends on the nature of the tasks. Therefore, the more information about the tasks is available at the time of decision making, the greater the potential for optimization.

====Size of tasks====
Perfect knowledge of the execution time of each of the tasks allows to reach an optimal load distribution (see algorithm of prefix sum). Unfortunately, this is in fact an idealized case. Knowing the exact execution time of each task is an extremely rare situation.

For this reason, there are several techniques to get an idea of the different execution times. First of all, in the fortunate scenario of having tasks of relatively homogeneous size, it is possible to consider that each of them will require approximately the average execution time. If, on the other hand, the execution time is very irregular, more sophisticated techniques must be used. One technique is to add some metadata to each task. Depending on the previous execution time for similar metadata, it is possible to make inferences for a future task based on statistics.

====Dependencies====
In some cases, tasks depend on each other. These interdependencies can be illustrated by a directed acyclic graph. Intuitively, some tasks cannot begin until others are completed.

Assuming that the required time for each of the tasks is known in advance, an optimal execution order must lead to the minimization of the total execution time. Although this is an NP-hard problem and therefore can be difficult to be solved exactly. There are algorithms, like job scheduler, that calculate optimal task distributions using metaheuristic methods.

====Segregation of tasks====
Another feature of the tasks critical for the design of a load balancing algorithm is their ability to be broken down into subtasks during execution. The &quot;Tree-Shaped Computation&quot; algorithm presented later takes great advantage of this specificity.

===Static and dynamic algorithms===

====Static====
A load balancing algorithm is &quot;static&quot; when it does not take into account the state of the system for the distribution of tasks. Thereby, the system state includes measures such as the load level (and sometimes even overload) of certain processors. Instead, assumptions about the overall system are made beforehand, such as the arrival times and resource requirements of incoming tasks. In addition, the number of processors, their respective power and communication speeds are known. Therefore, static load balancing aims to associate a known set of tasks with the available processors in order to minimize a certain performance function. The trick lies in the concept of this performance function.

Static load balancing techniques are commonly centralized around a router, or Master, which distributes the loads and optimizes the performance function. This minimization can take into account information related to the tasks to be distributed, and derive an expected execution time.

The advantage of static algorithms is that they are easy to set up and extremely efficient in the case of fairly regular tasks (such as processing HTTP requests from a website). However, there is still some statistical variance in the assignment of tasks which can lead to the overloading of some computing units.

====Dynamic====
Unlike static load distribution algorithms, dynamic algorithms take into account the current load of each of the computing units (also called nodes) in the system. In this approach, tasks can be moved dynamically from an overloaded node to an underloaded node in order to receive faster processing. While these algorithms are much more complicated to design, they can produce excellent results, in particular, when the execution time varies greatly from one task to another.

Dynamic load balancing architecture can be more modular since it is not mandatory to have a specific node dedicated to the distribution of work. When tasks are uniquely assigned to a processor according to their state at a given moment, it is a unique assignment. If, on the other hand, the tasks can be permanently redistributed according to the state of the system and its evolution, this is called dynamic assignment. Obviously, a load balancing algorithm that requires too much communication in order to reach its decisions runs the risk of slowing down the resolution of the overall problem.

===Hardware architecture===
====Heterogeneous machines====
Parallel computing infrastructures are often composed of units of different computing power, which should be taken into account for the load distribution.

For example, lower-powered units may receive requests that require a smaller amount of computation, or, in the case of homogeneous or unknown request sizes, receive fewer requests than larger units.

====Shared and distributed memory====
Parallel computers are often divided into two broad categories: those where all processors share a single common memory on which they read and write in parallel (PRAM model), and those where each computing unit has its own memory (distributed memory model), and where information is exchanged by messages.

For shared-memory computers, managing write conflicts greatly slows down the speed of individual execution of each computing unit. However, they can work perfectly well in parallel. Conversely, in the case of message exchange, each of the processors can work at full speed. On the other hand, when it comes to collective message exchange, all processors are forced to wait for the slowest processors to start the communication phase.
In reality, few systems fall into exactly one of the categories. In general, the processors each have an internal memory to store the data needed for the next calculations and are organized in successive clusters. Often, these processing elements are then coordinated through distributed memory and message passing. Therefore, the load balancing algorithm should be uniquely adapted to a parallel architecture. Otherwise, there is a risk that the efficiency of parallel problem solving will be greatly reduced.

====Hierarchy====
Adapting to the hardware structures seen above, there are two main categories of load balancing algorithms. On the one hand, the one where tasks are assigned by “master” and executed by “workers” who keep the master informed of the progress of their work, and the master can then take charge of assigning or reassigning the workload in case of the dynamic algorithm. The literature refers to this as &quot;Master-Worker&quot; architecture. On the other hand, the control can be distributed between the different nodes. The load balancing algorithm is then executed on each of them and the responsibility for assigning tasks (as well as re-assigning and splitting as appropriate) is shared. The last category assumes a dynamic load balancing algorithm.

Since the design of each load balancing algorithm is unique, the previous distinction must be qualified. Thus, it is also possible to have an intermediate strategy, with, for example, &quot;master&quot; nodes for each sub-cluster, which are themselves subject to a global &quot;master&quot;. There are also multi-level organizations, with an alternation between master-slave and distributed control strategies. The latter strategies quickly become complex and are rarely encountered. Designers prefer algorithms that are easier to control.

====Adaptation to larger architectures (scalability)====
In the context of algorithms that run over the very long term (servers, cloud...), the computer architecture evolves over time. However, it is preferable not to have to design a new algorithm each time.

An extremely important parameter of a load balancing algorithm is therefore its ability to adapt to scalable hardware architecture. This is called the scalability of the algorithm. An algorithm is called scalable for an input parameter when its performance remains relatively independent of the size of that parameter.

When the algorithm is capable of adapting to a varying number of computing units, but the number of computing units must be fixed before execution, it is called moldable. If, on the other hand, the algorithm is capable of dealing with a fluctuating amount of processors during its execution, the algorithm is said to be malleable. Most load balancing algorithms are at least moldable.

===Fault tolerance===
Especially in large-scale computing clusters, it is not tolerable to execute a parallel algorithm that cannot withstand the failure of one single component. Therefore, fault tolerant algorithms are being developed which can detect outages of processors and recover the computation.

==Approaches==

===Static distribution with full knowledge of the tasks: prefix sum===
If the tasks are independent of each other, and if their respective execution time and the tasks can be subdivided, there is a simple and optimal algorithm.

By dividing the tasks in such a way as to give the same amount of computation to each processor, all that remains to be done is to group the results together. Using a prefix sum algorithm, this division can be calculated in logarithmic time with respect to the number of processors.

If, however, the tasks cannot be subdivided (i.e., they are atomic), although optimizing task assignment is a difficult problem, it is still possible to approximate a relatively fair distribution of tasks, provided that the size of each of them is much smaller than the total computation performed by each of the nodes.

Most of the time, the execution time of a task is unknown and only rough approximations are available. This algorithm, although particularly efficient, is not viable for these scenarios.

===Static load distribution without prior knowledge===
Even if the execution time is not known in advance at all, static load distribution is always possible.

====Round-robin scheduling====
In a round-robin algorithm, the first request is sent to the first server, then the next to the second, and so on down to the last. Then it is started again, assigning the next request to the first server, and so on.

This algorithm can be weighted such that the most powerful units receive the largest number of requests and receive them first.

====Randomized static====
Randomized static load balancing is simply a matter of randomly assigning tasks to the different servers. This method works quite well. If, on the other hand, the number of tasks is known in advance, it is even more efficient to calculate a random permutation in advance. This avoids communication costs for each assignment. There is no longer a need for a distribution master because every processor knows what task is assigned to it. Even if the number of tasks is unknown, it is still possible to avoid communication with a pseudo-random assignment generation known to all processors.

The performance of this strategy (measured in total execution time for a given fixed set of tasks) decreases with the maximum size of the tasks.

====Others====
Of course, there are other methods of assignment as well: 
* Less work: Assign more tasks to the servers by performing less (the method can also be weighted).
* Hash: allocates queries according to a hash table.
* Power of Two Choices: pick two servers at random and choose the better of the two options.

===Master-Worker Scheme===
Master-Worker schemes are among the simplest dynamic load balancing algorithms. A master distributes the workload to all workers (also sometimes referred to as &quot;slaves&quot;). Initially, all workers are idle and report this to the master. The master answers worker requests and distributes the tasks to them. When he has no more tasks to give, he informs the workers so that they stop asking for tasks.

The advantage of this system is that it distributes the burden very fairly. In fact, if one does not take into account the time needed for the assignment, the execution time would be comparable to the prefix sum seen above.

The problem with this algorithm is that it has difficulty adapting to a large number of processors because of the high amount of necessary communications. This lack of scalability makes it quickly inoperable in very large servers or very large parallel computers. The master acts as a bottleneck.
However, the quality of the algorithm can be greatly improved by replacing the master with a task list that can be used by different processors. Although this algorithm is a little more difficult to implement, it promises much better scalability, although still insufficient for very large computing centers.

===Non-hierarchical architecture, without knowledge of the system: work stealing===
Another technique to overcome scalability problems when the time needed for task completion is unknown is work stealing.
The approach consists of assigning to each processor a certain number of tasks in a random or predefined manner, then allowing inactive processors to &quot;steal&quot; work from active or overloaded processors. Several implementations of this concept exist, defined by a task division model and by the rules determining the exchange between processors. While this technique can be particularly effective, it is difficult to implement because it is necessary to ensure that communication does not become the primary occupation of the processors instead of solving the problem.

In the case of atomic tasks, two main strategies can be distinguished, those where the processors with low load offer their computing capacity to those with the highest load, and those were the most loaded units wish to lighten the workload assigned to them. It has been shown that when the network is heavily loaded, it is more efficient for the least loaded units to offer their availability and when the network is lightly loaded, it is the overloaded processors that require support from the most inactive ones. This rule of thumb limits the number of exchanged messages.

In the case where one starts from a single large task that cannot be divided beyond an atomic level, there is a very efficient algorithm &quot;Tree-Shaped computation&quot;, where the parent task is distributed in a work tree.

====Principle====
Initially, many processors have an empty task, except one that works sequentially on it. Idle processors issue requests randomly to other processors (not necessarily active). If the latter is able to subdivide the task it is working on, it does so by sending part of its work to the node making the request. Otherwise, it returns an empty task. This induces a tree structure. It is then necessary to send a termination signal to the parent processor when the subtask is completed so that it, in turn, sends the message to its parent until it reaches the root of the tree. When the first processor, i.e. the root, has finished, a global termination message can be broadcast. In the end, it is necessary to assemble the results by going back up the tree.

====Efficiency====
The efficiency of such an algorithm is close to the prefix sum when the job cutting and communication time is not too high compared to the work to be done. To avoid too high communication costs, it is possible to imagine a list of jobs on shared memory. Therefore, a request is simply reading from a certain position on this shared memory at the request of the master processor.

==Use cases==
In addition to efficient problem solving through parallel computations, load balancing algorithms are widely used in HTTP request management where a site with a large audience must be able to handle a large number of requests per second.

===Internet-based services===
One of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple servers, sometimes known as a server farm. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular web sites, large Internet Relay Chat networks, high-bandwidth File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites, Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) servers, Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and databases.

====Round-robin DNS====
Round-robin DNS is an alternate method of load balancing that does not require a dedicated software or hardware node. In this technique, multiple IP addresses are associated with a single domain name; clients are given IP in a round-robin fashion. IP is assigned to clients with a short expiration so the client is more likely to use a different IP the next time they access the Internet service being requested.

====DNS delegation====

Another more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the website. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example:
:one.example.org A 192.0.2.1
:two.example.org A 203.0.113.2
:www.example.org NS one.example.org
:www.example.org NS two.example.org

However, the zone file for on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record. On server &quot;one&quot; the zone file for reports:
:@ in a 192.0.2.1

On server &quot;two&quot; the same zone file contains:
:@ in a 203.0.113.2

This way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network&#x27;s closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing . A short TTL on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given to the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.

====Client-side random load balancing====
Another approach to load balancing is to deliver a list of server IPs to the client, and then to have the client randomly select the IP from the list on each connection. This essentially relies on all clients generating similar loads, and the Law of Large Numbers to achieve a reasonably flat load distribution across servers. It has been claimed that client-side random load balancing tends to provide better load distribution than round-robin DNS; this has been attributed to caching issues with round-robin DNS, that in the case of large DNS caching servers, tend to skew the distribution for round-robin DNS, while client-side random selection remains unaffected regardless of DNS caching.

With this approach, the method of delivery of a list of IPs to the client can vary and may be implemented as a DNS list (delivered to all the clients without any round-robin), or via hardcoding it to the list. If a &quot;smart client&quot; is used, detecting that a randomly selected server is down and connecting randomly again, it also provides fault tolerance.

====Server-side load balancers====
For Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the port where external clients connect to access services. The load balancer forwards requests to one of the &quot;backend&quot; servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel&#x27;s network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.

Some load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable. This might include forwarding to a backup load balancer or displaying a message regarding the outage.

It is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a single point of failure. Usually, load balancers are implemented in high-availability pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application. Certain applications are programmed with immunity to this problem, by offsetting the load balancing point over differential sharing platforms beyond the defined network. The sequential algorithms paired to these functions are defined by flexible parameters unique to the specific database.

=====Scheduling algorithms=====
Numerous scheduling algorithms, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.
Simple algorithms include random choice, round robin, or least connections. More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server&#x27;s reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), a number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.

=====Persistence=====
An important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user&#x27;s session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.

Ideally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected. This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database like Memcached.

One basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as &quot;persistence&quot; or &quot;stickiness&quot;. A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic failover: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are &quot;stateless&quot; and not &quot;sticky&quot;, the central database is (see below).

Assignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client IP address, or random. Because of changes in the client&#x27;s perceived address resulting from DHCP, network address translation, and web proxies this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled the storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.

Another solution is to keep the per-session data in a database. This is generally bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a single point of failure, and to improve scalability, the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas. Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.net State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.

In the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a browser cookie, suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is URL rewriting. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.

Yet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a distributed hash table to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.

=====Load balancer features=====
Hardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:

; Asymmetric load
: A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.
; Priority activation
: When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or the load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.
; TLS Offload and Acceleration
: TLS (or its predecessor SSL) acceleration is a technique of offloading cryptographic protocol calculations onto specialized hardware. Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of a TLS request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server&#x27;s CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the TLS overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end-users. The downside of this approach is that all of the TLS processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process TLS. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo TLS offload and add a few web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated TLS acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting TLS traffic. One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.
; Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack protection
: Load balancers can provide features such as SYN cookies and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don&#x27;t see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate SYN flood attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.
; HTTP compression
: HTTP compression reduces the amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilising gzip compression available in all modern web browsers. The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times. The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.
; TCP offload
: Different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection. This feature utilises HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.
; TCP buffering
: The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the webserver to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.
; Direct Server Return
: An option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.
; Health checking
: The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.
; HTTP caching
: The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.
; Content filtering
: Some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.
; HTTP security
: Some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.
; Priority queuing
: Also known as rate shaping, the ability to give different priorities to different traffic.
; Content-aware switching
: Most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.
; Client authentication
: Authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.
; Programmatic traffic manipulation
: At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.
; Firewall
: Firewalls can prevent direct connections to backend servers, for network security reasons.
; Intrusion prevention system
: Intrusion prevention systems offer application layer security in addition to the network/transport layer offered by firewall security.

===Telecommunications===
Load balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links. For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A failover arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.

Using load balancing, both links can be in use all the time. A device or program monitors the availability of all links and selects the path for sending packets. The use of multiple links simultaneously increases the available bandwidth.

====Shortest Path Bridging====
TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) facilitates an Ethernet to have an arbitrary topology, and enables per flow pair-wise load splitting by way of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, without configuration and user intervention. The catalyst for TRILL was an event at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center which began on 13 November 2002. The concept of Rbridges [sic] was first proposed to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in the year 2004, whom in 2005 rejected what came to be known as TRILL, and in the years 2006 through 2012 devised an incompatible variation known as Shortest Path Bridging.

The IEEE approved the IEEE 802.1aq standard in May 2012, also known as Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB allows all links to be active through multiple equal-cost paths, provides faster convergence times to reduce downtime, and simplifies the use of load balancing in mesh network topologies (partially connected and/or fully connected) by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a network. SPB is designed to virtually eliminate human error during configuration and preserves the plug-and-play nature that established Ethernet as the de facto protocol at Layer 2.

====Routing 1====

Many telecommunications companies have multiple routes through their networks or to external networks. They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid network congestion on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve network reliability.

Another way of using load balancing is in network monitoring activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like 10GbE or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at wire speed.

===Data center networks===
Load balancing is widely used in data center networks to distribute traffic across many existing paths between any two servers. It allows more efficient use of network bandwidth and reduces provisioning costs. In general, load balancing in datacenter networks can be classified as either static or dynamic.

Static load balancing distributes traffic by computing a hash of the source and destination addresses and port numbers of traffic flows and using it to determine how flows are assigned to one of the existing paths. Dynamic load balancing assigns traffic flows to paths by monitoring bandwidth use on different paths. Dynamic assignments can also be proactive or reactive. In the former case, the assignment is fixed once made, while in the latter the network logic keeps monitoring available paths and shifts flows across them as network utilization changes (with arrival of new flows or completion of existing ones). A comprehensive overview of load balancing in datacenter networks has been made available.

===Failovers===
Load balancing is often used to implement failover—the continuation of service after the failure of one or more of its components. The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes unresponsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it. When a component comes back online, the load balancer starts rerouting traffic to it. For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service&#x27;s capacity (N+1 redundancy). This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where every single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure (dual modular redundancy). Some RAID systems can also utilize hot spare for a similar effect.

=== Data Ingestion for AI Model Training ===
Increasingly, load balancing techniques are being used to manage high-volume data ingestion pipelines that feed artificial intelligence training and inference systems—sometimes referred to as “AI factories.” These AI-driven environments require continuous processing of vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, placing heavy demands on networking, storage, and computational resources. To maintain the necessary high throughput and low latency, organizations commonly deploy load balancing tools capable of advanced TCP optimizations, connection pooling, and adaptive scheduling. Such features help distribute incoming data requests evenly across servers or nodes, prevent congestion, and ensure that compute resources remain efficiently utilized.

When deployed in large-scale or high-performance AI environments, load balancers also mitigate bandwidth constraints and accommodate varying data governance requirements—particularly when sensitive training data cannot be sent to third-party cloud services. By routing data locally (on-premises) or across private clouds, load balancers allow AI workflows to avoid public-cloud bandwidth limits, reduce transit costs, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. As AI models expand in size (often measured by billions or even trillions of parameters), load balancing for data ingestion has grown in importance for maintaining the reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency of AI factories.

A Florence flask has a round body, a long neck, and often a flat bottom. It is designed for uniform heating, boiling, distillation and ease of swirling; it is produced in a number of different glass thicknesses to stand different types of use. They are often made of borosilicate glass for heat and chemical resistance. Traditional Florence flasks typically do not have a ground glass joint on their rather longer necks, but typically have a slight lip or flange around the tip of the neck. The common volume for a Florence flask is 1 litre.

<doc id="61123" wikidata="Q51482" url="?curid=61123" title="Red Bull">
<text>Red Bull is a brand of energy drink created and owned by the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH. With a market share of 43%, it is the most popular energy drink brand as of 2020, and the third most valuable soft drink brand, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Since its launch in 1987, more than 100 billion cans of Red Bull have been sold worldwide, including over 12.6 billion in 2024.

Originally available only in a single nondescript flavour sold in a tall and slim silver and blue can, called Red Bull Energy Drink, the drink added numerous variants over time. Its slogan, &quot;Red Bull Gives You Wings&quot;, is considered one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the world. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a &quot;brand myth&quot; through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.

Red Bull was derived from a similar drink called Krating Daeng which originated in Thailand and was introduced by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya. While doing business in Thailand, Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Yoovidhya and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as by carbonating the drink. In 1984, the two founded Red Bull GmbH in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their new product, Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng&#x27;s name: in Thai, &quot;daeng&quot; means red, and a &quot;krating&quot; (known in English as a gaur) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. Red Bull and Krating Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.

==History==

In 1976, Chaleo Yoovidhya introduced a drink called Krating Daeng in Thailand, which means &quot;red gaur&quot; in English. It was popular among Thai truck drivers and labourers. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble) in 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz travelled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of T.C. Pharmaceutical. During his visit, Mateschitz discovered that Krating Daeng helped cure his jet lag. In 1984, Mateschitz co-founded Red Bull GmbH with Yoovidhya and turned it into an international brand. Each partner invested US$500,000 of savings to fund the company. Yoovidhya and Mateschitz each held a 49 percent share of the new company. They gave the remaining two percent to Yoovidhya&#x27;s son, Chalerm, but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. The product was first launched in Austria on 1 April 1987.

In Thailand, energy drinks are most popular with blue-collar workers. Red Bull re-positioned the drink as a trendy, upscale drink, first introducing it at Austrian ski resorts. Pricing was a key differentiator, with Red Bull positioned as a premium drink and Krating Daeng as a lower cost item. In many countries, both drinks are available, dominating both ends of the price spectrum. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.

During the 1990s, the product expanded into Hungary, Slovenia, Germany, the Czech Republic, Croatia, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. It entered Germany and the UK in 1994, the United States (via California) in 1996, the Middle East in 2000 and the Philippines in 2012. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as the 250th richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of US$4 billion.

Red Bull GmbH is headquartered in Fuschl am See, an Austrian village of about 1,500 inhabitants near Salzburg. The company is 51 percent controlled by the Yoovidhya family who, for technical reasons, own the trademark in Europe and the US.

Claims about the drink&#x27;s effects and performance have been challenged on various occasions, with the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority imposing advertising restrictions in 2001 in response to complaints recorded as early as 1997.

==Ingredients==
Depending on the country, Red Bull contains different amounts of caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12), glucuronolactone and simple sugars (sucrose and glucose) in a buffer solution of carbonated water, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium carbonate (substituted in some flavours with a trisodium citrate/citric acid buffer, each solution providing electrolytes). To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sucrose and glucose have been replaced by artificial sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame or sucralose.

===Caffeine content===
The caffeine content of a single 250 ml can of Red Bull is approximately 40–80 mg250 ml (15–32 mg100 ml). The caffeine level in Red Bull varies depending on the country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks. As is the case with other caffeinated beverages, Red Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse. Excessive consumption may induce mild to moderate euphoria primarily caused by stimulant properties of caffeine and may also induce agitation, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.

== Variants ==
Over the years, Red Bull has offered many variations of its drink, all based on the same formula but differing in taste and colour. 

Red Bull began offering variations on its drinks in 2003 with a sugar-free version of the drink with a different flavour from the original, called Red Bull Sugarfree. In 2012, Red Bull released Red Bull Total Zero, a variant with zero calories. In 2018, the company released Red Bull Zero, a different sugar-free formulation designed to taste more like the original flavour.

In 2009, Red Bull unveiled a highly concentrated variant of its drink called Red Bull Energy Shot, supplied in 2 oz (60 ml) cans.

The company began expanding its flavour offerings in 2013 with the launch of Red Bull Editions. Initially available in cranberry, lime, and blueberry, the Editions line has expanded to include a variety of flavours, including some available only during specific seasons or in certain regions. Currently, a blue (blueberry), peach (peach-nectarine), winter (iced vanilla berry), sea blue (juneberry) and red (watermelon) are offered.

=== Other products ===
Red Bull released a cola drink, called Simply Cola, in 2008. A new version of the cola was released in 2019, as part of Red Bull&#x27;s Organics line.

In 2018, the company launched Organics by Red Bull, a line of organic sodas with four flavours; bitter lemon, ginger ale, tonic water, and a new version of Red Bull Simply Cola.

==Regulatory approval and legal status==
Authorities in France, Denmark, and Norway initially did not permit the sale of Red Bull. However, , it is on sale in all 27 member states of the European Union and in 171 countries around the world.

The French food safety agency was concerned about taurine; a Red Bull drink that did not contain taurine was introduced. The French refusal of market approval was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008, because it was unable to prove a definite health risk, taurine-related or not.

==Litigation==
In 2013, Red Bull told the Redwell Brewery, a Norfolk micro brewery, to change its name or face legal action, because it sounded too similar to Red Bull. The eight-man brewery in Norwich was told its name could &quot;confuse&quot; customers and &quot;tarnish&quot; its trademark. The two companies reached a settlement permitting Redwell to continue using its name.

In 2014, Red Bull entered into a US$13 million settlement to resolve two consumer class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Named as plaintiffs were Benjamin Careathers, David Wolf, and Miguel Almarez, who had sued the company claiming breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment, saying that Red Bull falsely asserted performance-enhancing benefits from the drink&#x27;s ingredients that were unsubstantiated by scientific studies. On 1 May 2015, the Court approved the settlement, giving customers who had submitted claims the opportunity to receive a US$10 cash reimbursement or US$15 in Red Bull products within 150 days of affirmance on any appeal. Contrary to reports from some news outlets, the plaintiffs had not alleged that the drink did not give consumers actual wings.

<doc id="61125" wikidata="Q6623385" url="?curid=61125" title="Hitch (knot)">
<text>A hitch is a type of knot used to secure a rope to an object or another rope. Hitches are used in a variety of situations, including climbing, sailing, and securing loads. They are classified based on their ability to be tightened or released, their resistance to slipping, and their strength. Some common types of hitch knots include the clove hitch, the timber hitch, and the round turn and two half-hitches.

==Physical theory==
A simple mathematical theory of hitches has been proposed by Bayman. It predicts whether or not a hitch will hold, given the diameter of the post, the diameter of the rope, and the coefficient of friction between the post and the rope. The theory has been extended by Maddocks and Keller, including an approximate treatment of knots that are not hitches. For example, they predict that a square knot will hold when the coefficient of friction of the rope with itself is greater than 0.24. These predictions are approximately correct when tested empirically.

<text>Balochi (, romanized: ) is a Northwestern Iranian language, spoken primarily in the Balochistan region of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. In addition, there are speakers in Oman, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Turkmenistan, East Africa and in diaspora communities in other parts of the world. The total number of speakers, according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, is million. Of these, 6.28 million are in Pakistan.

Balochi varieties constitute a dialect continuum and collectively at least have 10 million native speakers. The main varieties of Balochi are Eastern(Soleimani), Southern(Makrani) and Western(Rakhshani). The Koroshi dialect is a dialect of the Balochi language, spoken mainly in the provinces of Fars and Hormozgan.

According to Brian Spooner,

Balochi belongs to the Western Iranian subgroup, and its original homeland is suggested to be around the central Caspian region.

== Classification ==
Balochi is an Indo-European language, spoken by the Baloch and belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the family. As an Iranian language, it is classified in the Northwestern group.

&quot;Glottolog&quot; classifies four different varieties, namely Koroshi, Southern Balochi and Western Balochi (grouped under a &quot;Southern-Western Balochi&quot; branch), and Eastern Balochi, all under the &quot;Balochic&quot; group.

According to Carina Jahani research, ISO 639-3 groups Southern, Eastern, and Western Baloch under the Balochi macrolanguage, keeping Koroshi separate.
Balochi, somehow near similarity with the Parthian and on the other hand, it has near kinship to the Avestan.

== Dialects ==

These dialects are broadly categorized into three main groups:

*Eastern group (the Soleimani dialect group): Found mainly in eastern Balochistan, covering parts of Pakistan, particularly in areas like Quetta, Kalat, and Khuzdar.
*Southern group or Makrani dialect (part of the Makrani dialect group): Spoken in the southern parts of Balochistan, including coastal areas like Gwadar, Chabahar, and southern Pakistan.
*Western group (part of the Rakhshani dialect group) : Predominantly spoken in western Balochistan, including parts of Iran and Afghanistan. Commonly spoken in Sistan and Balochestan province and Khorasan in Iran.

Koroshi is also classified as Balochi.

Elfenbein divides the dialects of the Balochi language into six categories: Rakhshani (subdialects: Kalati and Sarhaddi), Panjguri, Saravani, Lashari, Kechi, and Coastal Dialects.

Rakhshani 
*Kalati (areas between Las Bela in the north of Karachi to Mastung in the south of Quetta Chaghi and Kharan (northern areas of Balochistan, Pakistan, including Noshki, Dalbandin, Kharan, and Kalat).

*Panjguri(southern and southwestern areas of Afghanistan, mainly the areas around the Helmand River).

*Sarhadhi (an area that extends from the east to Dalbandin in Pakistan and from the northeast to Chahar Burjak in Afghanistan, and includes Merv in the Republic of Turkmenistan and Sistan in Iran, with Nosratabad in Balochistan, Iran, forming its southernmost part).

Panjguri
It includes most of the Kharan region, with the kech River forming its southern border and the Rakhshan River its northern border, and Kolwa located to its east.

Saravani
Saravan and its surrounding areas, with Khash as its northern border and Espidan as its western border. In later works, Elfenbein, Iranshahr, and Bampur are also considered to be within the Saravani dialect area.

Kechi
Kich region in Balochistan, including Turbat.

Lashari
centered on the village of Lashar , south of Iranshahr where Balochi close to Persian and Baskardi.

Coastal dialects
Including Qasr-e Qand, Nikshahr, Rask and the southern coastal areas of Balochistan from near Bandar Abbas to Karachi Port, including the ports of Chahbahar, Gwadar, Pasni.

There are two main dialects: the dialect of the Mandwani (northern) tribes and the dialect of the Domki (southern) tribes. The dialectal differences are not very significant. One difference is that grammatical terminations in the northern dialect are less distinct compared with those in the southern tribes. An isolated dialect is Koroshi, which is spoken in the Qashqai tribal confederation in the Fars province. Koroshi distinguishes itself in grammar and lexicon among Balochi varieties.

The Balochi Academy Sarbaz has designed a standard alphabet for Balochi.

Uppsala University offers a course titled Balochi A, which provides basic knowledge of the phonetics and syntax of the Balochi language. Carina Jahani is a prominent Swedish Iranologist and professor of Iranian languages at Uppsala University, deeply researching in the study and preservation of the Balochi language.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
The Balochi vowel system has at least eight vowels: five long and three short. These are , , , , , , and . The short vowels have more centralized phonetic quality than the long vowels. The variety spoken in Karachi also has nasalized vowels, most importantly and . In addition to these eight vowels, Balochi has two vowel glides, that is /aw/ and /ay/.

=== Consonants ===
The following table shows consonants which are common to both Western (Northern) and Southern Balochi. The consonants /s/, /z/, /n/, /ɾ/ and /l/ are articulated as alveolar in Western Balochi. The plosives /t/ and /d/ are dental in both dialects. The symbol ń is used to denote nasalization of the preceding vowel.


In addition, occurs in a few words in Southern Balochi. (voiceless velar fricative) in some loanwords in Southern Balochi corresponding to (voiceless uvular fricative) in Western Balochi; and (voiced velar fricative) in some loanwords in Southern Balochi corresponding to (voiced uvular fricative) in Western Balochi.

In Eastern Balochi, it is noted that the stop and glide consonants may also occur as aspirated allophones in word initial position as and . Allophones of stops in postvocalic position include for voiceless stops, and for voiced stops . are also dentalized as .

=== Intonation ===
Difference between a question and a statement is marked with the tone, when there is no question word. Rising tone marks the question and falling tone the statement. Statements and questions with a question word are characterized by falling intonation at the end of the sentence.
Questions without a question word are characterized by rising intonation at the end of the sentence.

Both coordinate and subordinate clauses that precede the final clause in the sentence have rising intonation. The final clause in the sentence has falling intonation.
== Grammar ==
The normal word order is subject–object–verb. Like many other Indo-Iranian languages, Balochi also features split ergativity. The subject is marked as nominative except for the past tense constructions where the subject of a transitive verb is marked as oblique and the verb agrees with the object. Balochi, like many Western Iranian languages, has lost the Old Iranian gender distinctions.

=== Numerals ===
Much of the Balochi number system is identical to Persian. According to Mansel Longworth Dames, Balochi writes the first twelve numbers as follows:


;Notes
== Writing system ==
Balochi was not a written language before the 19th century, and the Persian script was used to write Balochi wherever necessary. However, Balochi was still spoken at the Baloch courts.

British colonial officers first wrote Balochi with the Latin script. Following the creation of Pakistan, Baloch scholars adopted the Persian alphabet. The first collection of poetry in Balochi, Gulbang by Mir Gul Khan Nasir was published in 1951 and incorporated the Arabic Script. It was much later that Sayad Zahoor Shah Hashemi wrote a comprehensive guidance on the usage of Arabic script and standardized it as the Balochi Orthography in Pakistan and Iran. This earned him the title of the &#x27;Father of Balochi&#x27;. His guidelines are widely used in Eastern and Western Balochistan. In Afghanistan, Balochi is still written in a modified Arabic script based on Persian.

In 2002, a conference was held to help standardize the script that would be used for Balochi.

=== Old Balochi Alphabet ===
The following alphabet was used by Syed Zahoor Shah Hashmi in his lexicon of Balochi &quot;Sayad Ganj&quot; () (lit. &quot;Sayad&#x27;s Treasure&quot;). Until the creation of the Balochi Standard Alphabet, it was by far the most widely used alphabet for writing Balochi, and is still used very frequently.

=== Standard Perso-Arabic Alphabet ===
The Balochi Standard Alphabet, standardized by Balochi Academy Sarbaz, consists of 29 letters. It is an extension of the Perso-Arabic script and borrows a few glyphs from Urdu. It is also sometimes referred to as Balo-Rabi or Balòrabi. Today, it is the preferred script to use in a professional setting and by educated folk.

=== Latin alphabet ===
The following Latin-based alphabet was adopted by the International Workshop on &quot;Balochi Roman Orthography&quot; (University of Uppsala, Sweden, 28–30 May 2000).

;Alphabetical order:

 (33 letters and 2 digraphs)

==== Soviet alphabet ====
In 1933, the Soviet Union adopted a Latin-based alphabet for Balochi as follows:

The alphabet was used for several texts, including children&#x27;s books, newspapers, and ideological works. In 1938, however, the official use of Balochi was discontinued.

=== Cyrillic alphabet ===
In 1989, Mammad Sherdil, a teacher from the Turkmen SSR, approached Balochi language researcher Sergei Axenov with the idea of creating a Cyrillic-based alphabet for Balochi. Before this, the Cyrillic script was already used for writing Balochi and was used in several publications but the alphabet was not standardized. In 1990, the alphabet was finished. It included the following letters:

The project was approved with some minor changes (, , and were removed due to the rarity of those sounds in Balochi, and was added). From 1992 to 1993, several primary school textbooks were printed in this script. In the early 2000s, the script fell out of use.

<text>Finistère (, ; ) is a department of France in the extreme west of Brittany. Its prefecture is Quimper and its largest city is Brest. In 2019, it had a population of 915,090.

==History==
The present department consists of the historical region of Léon and parts of Cornouaille and Trégor, both parts of pre-revolutionary Brittany.

The name &quot;Finistère&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;Finis Terræ&quot;, meaning &quot;end of the earth.&quot; In England, a similar area is called Land&#x27;s End. The Breton name for Finistère, &quot;Penn ar Bed,&quot; translates as &quot;Head/End of the World&quot; and is similar to the Cornish name for Land&#x27;s End, &quot;Pedn-an-Wlas&quot; (Head/End of the country), and also Penfro (English: Pembroke) in Wales (pen = end, bro = country). Finistère is not to be confused with Fisterra in Galicia, Spain, which shares the same etymology.

==Geography==
The largest population centre in Finistère is Brest. Other large towns in the department include Quimper (the capital), Concarneau, Morlaix, Carhaix, Quimperlé and Douarnenez. Finistère includes the island of Ushant (&quot;Eusa&quot; in Breton, &quot;Ouessant&quot; in French).

Finistère is the westernmost department of Metropolitan France and can also claim to be the &quot;most coastal&quot; department in Metropolitan France. Of its 277 communes, 117 are located on the coast. Its total coastline of approximately accounts for almost a quarter of the entire Brittany coast-line.

The &quot;abers&quot;, rugged fjord-like inlets on the north coast, are a notable feature of the landscape.

The westernmost point of continental France, known as the Pointe de Corsen, extends from the northwestern tip of Finistère. About 40 kilometres to the south (as the crow flies) is the slightly less westerly, but rugged and isolated, headland of Pointe du Raz.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Brest; the prefecture Quimper is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Agriculture, fisheries, food processing and various related industries occupy an important place in Finistère&#x27;s economy.

The military presence in Finistère (Île Longue nuclear submarine base and the Naval Air base of Lanvéoc-Poulmic), as well as military-related industries, such as the Brest headquarters of DCNS, employ a significant number of the &quot;département&quot;&#x27;s population.

The port of Roscoff links Brittany by ferry with Ireland and Great Britain.

==Politics==
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Culture==
Finistère is the area where Breton survives most strongly as a spoken language. Breton-speaking schools are called Diwan, Divyezh and Dihun.

The Festival de Cornouaille, which takes place in Quimper, is a celebration of Breton music and traditions. One of the highlights of summer in Finistère is the &quot;Festival des Vieilles Charrues&quot; held in Carhaix-Plouguer. Major international stars attract tens of thousands of spectators.

The painter Raymond Wintz (1884–1956) featured many locations around Finistère.

Roland Doré was a sculptor who executed many of the calvaries in Finistère.

<text>Brittany ( ; ; Gallo: &quot;Bertaèyn&quot; ) is the westernmost region of Metropolitan France. It covers about four fifths of the territory of the historic province of Brittany. It is one of two regions in Metropolitan France that do not contain any landlocked departments, the other being Corsica.

Brittany is a peninsular region bordered by the English Channel to the north and the Bay of Biscay to the south, and its neighbouring regions are Normandy to the northeast and Pays de la Loire to the southeast. &quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot; is the anthem of Brittany. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of Wales, &quot;&quot;, and has similar words. As a region of France, Brittany has a Regional Council, which was most recently elected in 2021.
The capital of the administrative region is Rennes, although Nantes is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in Loire-Atlantique.

== Territory ==

The region of Brittany was created in 1941 from four of the five departments constituting the territory of traditional Brittany. The other is Loire-Atlantique, which is included in the region of Pays de la Loire, whose capital, Nantes, was a historical capital of the Duchy of Brittany.

The capital of the administrative region is Rennes, although Nantes is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in Loire-Atlantique. The reunification of Brittany is supported by a majority of Loire-Atlantique and is considered a prerequisite to further autonomy of Brittany as a whole.

Part of the reason Brittany was split between two present-day regions was to avoid the rivalry between Rennes and Nantes. Although Nantes was the principal capital of the Duchy of Brittany until the sixteenth century, Rennes had been the seat of the Duchy&#x27;s supreme court of justice between 1560 and 1789. Rennes had also been the administrative capital of the Intendant of Brittany between 1689 and 1789, and Intendances were the most important administrative units of the kingdom of France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As for the provincial States of Brittany, a legislative body which had originally met every two years in a different city of Brittany, that had met in Rennes only between 1728 and 1789, although not in the years 1730, 1758, and 1760. Despite that, the &quot;Chambre des comptes&quot; had remained in Nantes until 1789. However, from 1381 until the end of the 15th century Vannes (&quot;Gwened&quot; in Breton) had served as the administrative capital of the Duchy, remaining the seat of its &quot;Chambre des comptes&quot; until the 1490s, and also the seat of its &quot;Parlement&quot; until 1553 and then again between 1675 and 1689.

Although there were previous plans to create regions out of the departments, like the Clémentel plan (1919) or the Vichy regionalisation programme (1941), these plans had no effect or else were abolished in 1945. The current French regions date from 1956 and were created by gathering departments together. In Brittany, this led to the creation of the new region of Brittany, which included only four out of the five historical Breton departments. The term &quot;région&quot; was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.

== History ==

Brittany, located in the west-north-west corner of France, is one of the historic provinces of France. The most Atlantic of France&#x27;s regions, Brittany is noted for its Celtic heritage, which sets it apart from the rest of France. It enjoys a mild climate somewhat warmer though not necessarily drier than the climate of the Cornish peninsula in south-west Britain.

The name &quot;Brittany&quot; derives from the Britons, an Insular Celtic (Brythonic) people who inhabited most of Great Britain during the Roman and Sub-Roman periods. During the migration period of the Early Middle Ages the Britons were displaced from most of what is now England by the Anglo-Saxon invasions, leading many to settle in western Armorica, present-day Brittany. As a result the modern Bretons have strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties with those areas of Great Britain which remained Brythonic into the modern era: Wales and Cornwall.

Initially divided into several small petty kingdoms, Brittany as a united political entity emerged in the 9th century as the Kingdom of Brittany. In the early 10th century the kingdom was devastated by Norse raids and occupation and from the mid-10th century became a vassal state of France as the Duchy of Brittany. The level of control exerted by the French kings varied over time; at various points Brittany was either subject to, aligned with or heavily influenced by the English Kings; at others it was &quot;de facto&quot; independent.

Following the Breton defeat at the hands of the French army in 1488, the duchy was forced into a dynastic union with the French crown in 1491; in 1547 it was formally incorporated as a province of France.

Following the French Revolution the French provinces were dissolved and replaced with departments; what had been Brittany became the Côtes-du-Nord (22) (renamed Côtes-d&#x27;Armor in 1990) in the north, Finistère (29) in the far west, Morbihan (56) in the south, Ille et Vilaine (35) in the east and Loire-Inférieure (44) (renamed Loire-Atlantique in 1957) in the southeast.

When the modern regions were established, Loire-Inférieure (44), which includes the historic capital Nantes, became part of Pays de la Loire, while the other four departments became part of the Brittany region. The capital city of the modern Brittany region is Rennes, located in the central eastern part of the region; most of the major lines of communication between Brittany and Paris pass through Rennes, which is a large industrial and university city. Other important cities in the region are Brest, one of the two most important French naval ports, Saint-Malo, an imposing walled city on the north coast, and Vannes, the capital of the Morbihan, with an attractive old town centre. Quimper, the capital of the Finistère, and Saint-Brieuc, the capital of the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, are less important. Lorient, in the Morbihan, was once a major shipping port trading with – as its name suggests – the Orient; but its shipping and shipbuilding industries have largely declined, and like other ports on the south coast of Brittany, is better known today for its yachting and yacht-building industry. It is also the venue for Brittany&#x27;s annual Interceltiques music and culture festival.

Despite its limited size, Brittany is quite a diverse region; the north and west coasts, open to the force of the North Atlantic, are rugged and rocky, with sandy coves and beaches. The south coast, facing onto the Bay of Biscay, is flatter, much milder, and has a number of large sandy beaches. There are also many inlets on the south coast, such as La Trinité sur Mer, which in the past have been ports and commercial harbours, but today are more popular with yachtsmen and a dwindling fishing industry. The sea here is warmer in summer. The backbone of Brittany is a granite ridge stretching from east to west, peaking in the Monts d&#x27;Arrée. But most of inland Brittany is farming country, a region known for its milk and butter and its early crops.

As a holiday region, it is Brittany&#x27;s coasts that attract the greatest number of visitors; the inland regions have attracted many second-home owners from other parts of France, and from Britain.
In cultural terms, Brittany has its own language and Celtic cultural tradition that set it apart from the rest of France. The Breton language, though not much used in everyday life, and not understood by most of the modern population, has made a comeback in recent years, and is taught in many schools. Celtic traditions are reflected in Breton folk music, its Celtic festivals, and its prehistoric monuments.

== Language and culture ==
The name of Brittany derives from settlers from Great Britain, who fled the island in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon invasions of England between the fifth and seventh centuries. Unlike the rest of France and Brittany, Lower Brittany (roughly, west of a boundary from Saint Brieuc to Vannes) has maintained a distinctly Celtic language, Breton, which is related to Cornish and Welsh. It was the dominant language in Lower, or western, Brittany until the mid-20th century. It has been granted regional language status and revival efforts are underway. In Upper, or eastern, Brittany, the traditional language is Gallo, an Oïl language, which has also received regional recognition and is in the process of being revived.

The French administration now allows for some Breton or Gallo to be used by the region and its communes, in road signs and names of towns and cities, alongside the official French language version. The two regional languages are also taught in some schools, and many folklore associations and clubs are trying to revive them.

Brittany has historically been a stronghold of the Roman Catholic Church, and its rates of church attendance have tended to be considerably higher than the national average. However, in recent years the influence of the church has declined.

== Politics ==

The Region of Brittany is administered by the Regional Council of Brittany.

The region was a traditionally conservative and Christian democratic region, with the notable exception of the department of Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, a longtime stronghold of the political left. However, the whole of Brittany has recently been moving towards the left, in 2004 electing Jean-Yves Le Drian as its first Socialist regional president, and in the 2007 presidential election voting for Socialist Ségolène Royal. The centrist candidate François Bayrou also polled relatively highly in the region and Fougères elected a MoDem deputy to the National Assembly (he has since joined the pro-UMP New Centre). The French Communist Party&#x27;s support is largely concentrated in the south-west of the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor and north-west of Morbihan. The Greens and other environmentalist parties have traditionally been strong in the region, especially in urban areas such as Rennes or Quimper. The region was one of the few which voted &quot;Yes&quot; to the European constitution in the 2005 referendum, and Brittany continues, along with Alsace, to be a strongly pro-European region.

The Socialist Party controls three departmental councils (Ille-et-Vilaine, Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, and Finistère), while the centrist MoDem controls that of Morbihan, in a coalition with the right.
== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 99.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.2% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,700 euros or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 100% of the EU average.

== Transport ==


There are several airports in Brittany (Rennes, Brest, Lorient...) serving destinations in Europe. TGV train services link the region with cities such as Paris in 1h27m due to the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Lyon, Lille and the largest French cities. TER Bretagne is the regional rail network serving Brittany in order to link the cities of Brittany to each other. OUIBUS coach services link the region with the largest cities in France at low cost. In addition there is Brittany Ferries that take passengers, vehicles and freight to Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Condor Ferries to the Channel Islands.

== Geography ==
=== Departments ===
Brittany comprises four departments: Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine, and Morbihan.

=== Major communities ===
The following table is the list of communes in Brittany with a population over 15,000 inhabitants. Rennes is situated in the east of Brittany, being the capital of the region, the capital of the Ille-et-Vilaine department, as well as the most populous metropolitan area in Brittany with 700,000 inhabitants (2013).

=== Climate ===
The Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel provide Brittany with an oceanic climate. Prevailing northwest winds reduce variations of temperature in the region. The climate is drier in southern sections. The extreme northwest has up to 10 days with temperatures above 25 °C, while southeastern Brittany can have up to 50.

== Sport ==
Three Breton clubs play in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football: Stade Rennais, Stade Brestois, and FC Lorient. Another historical club, En Avant Guingamp, plays in Ligue 2, and Vannes OC plays in the third tier Championnat National. In rugby union, RC Vannes currently plays in the second level, Pro D2.

The Brest Albatros Hockey is a Brest ice hockey club that plays in FFHG Division 1. The Cesson Rennes Métropole Handball plays in LNH Division 1. The Brest Bretagne Handball plays in French Women&#x27;s Handball Championship. The Rennes Volley 35 plays in Ligue B. The Fortuneo–Vital Concept cycling pro team participate every year at the Tour de France, the Bretagne Classic, and the Route Adélie de Vitré. Gaelic games are also increasingly popular in the region, particularly Gaelic football where the region has multiple teams that compete in Gaelic Games Europe.

<text>James Franklin Baskett (February 16, 1904 – July 9, 1948) was an American actor who portrayed Uncle Remus, singing the song &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; in the 1946 Disney feature film &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

In recognition of his portrayal of Remus, he was given an Honorary Academy Award in 1948.

==Career==
Baskett studied pharmacology as a young man but gave it up to pursue an acting career. He first moved to New York City, New York, where he joined up with Bill &#x27;Mr. Bojangles&#x27; Robinson. Using the name Jimmie Baskette, he appeared with Louis Armstrong on Broadway in the 1929 black musical revue &quot;Hot Chocolates&quot; and in several all-black New York films, including &quot;Harlem is Heaven&quot; (1932).

He later moved to Los Angeles, California, and had a supporting role in the film &quot;Straight to Heaven&quot; (1939), starring Nina Mae McKinney. In 1941 he voiced Fats Crow in the animated Disney film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, and he also had bit parts in several B movies, including that of Lazarus in &quot;Revenge of the Zombies&quot; (1943), a porter in &quot;The Heavenly Body&quot; (1944), and native tribal leader Orbon in &quot;Jungle Queen&quot; (1945). From 1944 until 1948, he was part of the cast of the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy Show&quot; live radio program as lawyer Gabby Gibson.

In 1945, he auditioned for a bit part voicing one of the animals in the new Disney feature film &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), based on the Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris. Walt Disney was impressed with Baskett&#x27;s talent and hired him on the spot for the lead role of Uncle Remus. Baskett was also given the voice role of Brer Fox, one of the film&#x27;s animated antagonists, and also filled in as the main animated protagonist, Brer Rabbit, in one sequence. This was one of the first Hollywood portrayals of a black actor as a non-comic character in a leading role in a film meant for general audiences.

Baskett was prohibited from attending the film&#x27;s premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, because Atlanta was racially segregated by law.

Although Baskett was occasionally criticized for accepting such a &quot;demeaning&quot; role (most of his acting credits were that of African-American stereotypes), his acting was almost universally praised, and columnist Hedda Hopper, along with Walt Disney, was one of the many journalists and personalities who declared that he should receive an Academy Award for his work. Baskett defended the film and his character in it, saying, &quot;I believe that certain groups are doing my race more harm in seeking to create dissension, than can ever possibly come out of the &quot;Song of the South&quot;.&quot;

===Academy Honorary Award===
On March 20, 1948, Baskett received an Academy Honorary Award for his performance as Uncle Remus.

He was the first African-American male actor to earn an Academy Award. Additionally, Baskett was the last adult actor to receive an Honorary Oscar for a single performance.

==Illness and death==
Baskett had been in poor health during the filming of &quot;Song of the South&quot; due to diabetes and he suffered a heart attack in December 1946 shortly after its release. His health continued to decline, and he was often unable to attend the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show he was on, missing almost half of the 1947–1948 season. On July 9, 1948, during the show&#x27;s summer hiatus, James Baskett died at his home of heart failure resulting from diabetes at age 44. He was survived by his wife Margaret and his mother Elizabeth. He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

<doc id="61136" wikidata="Q7312137" url="?curid=61136" title="Remote concentrator">
<text>In modern telephony a remote concentrator, remote concentrator unit (RCU), or remote line concentrator (RLC) is a concentrator at the lowest level in the telephone switch hierarchy.

Subscribers&#x27; analogue telephone/PSTN lines are terminated on concentrators. They have three main functions:
* Digitize: convert voice (and sometimes data) from analogue to a digital form.
* Connect off-hook lines to the local exchange—the concentration function.
* Multiplex, interleaving many calls together on a single wire or optical fiber.

Only a few hundred telephone lines attach to each remote concentrator. In North America concentrators are located in a serving area interface (SAI) or other enclosure in each neighborhood. In Europe the buildings which once contained local Strowger switch telephone exchanges are now usually empty except for a remote concentrator.
Only call packets from or destined to a phone serviced by the concentrator actually are processed by the concentrator; nonlocal phones&#x27; time slots just pass through the concentrator unchanged. If the concentrator malfunctions, a fail-safe relay connects the &quot;in&quot; wires to the &quot;out&quot; wires, and nonlocal phones detect no difference. The central switch periodically counts concentrators, and schedules maintenance, probably before users notice the failure. Concentrators for several hundred customers can be threaded on this loop like pearls.

The interface between remote concentrators and their parent telephone switches has been standardised by ETSI as the V5 interface.

== Operation ==
When a user picks up their phone, the concentrator produces the dial tone. When the user dials, it reads the tones. Once the user has completed dialing, the concentrator&#x27;s microcomputer sends the dialing data to the central switch, which allocates a time slot for the dialing phone on the wire pairs that pass through the concentrator and through the switch. 

After the central switch tells the concentrator which time slot to use, the concentrator &quot;opens&quot; a time-slot on the loop to a local phone. The allocated time slot on the wiring into the concentrator is used to send data from the remote telephone&#x27;s microphone to the local telephone&#x27;s speaker. The allocated time slot on the wiring out of the concentrator (with the same time slot number) carries data from the local microphone to the remote speaker.

To arrange a connection, the switch just completes the circle between the user&#x27;s phone and the remote phone. It interchanges the data from one to the other. In this limited sense, telephone &quot;exchange&quot; is exactly correct terminology.

==Technology implications==
Having a concentrator near a subscriber&#x27;s telephone results in very low signal degradation before the analog signal is digitized. This provides reliably good voice quality.

Concentrators are often placed alongside a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM). This can provide access to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) Internet service for subscribers who are beyond the normal signaling limit on a copper wire loop. For example, a fiber optic cable might run up to without a repeater from the telephone exchange to a concentrator site, and local subscriber wire local loops can extend an additional 4 km beyond the concentrator and its DSLAM. With repeaters in the fiber optic cable the distance from the telephone exchange can be extended much farther.

<doc id="61138" wikidata="Q461190" url="?curid=61138" title="Padre Island National Seashore">
<text>Padre Island National Seashore (PINS) is a national seashore administered by the National Park Service, located on Padre Island off the coast of South Texas, USA. In contrast to South Padre Island, known for its beaches and vacationing college students, PINS is located on the north end of Padre Island and consists of a long beach where nature is preserved.

Most of the park is primitive, but camping is available, and most of the beach is only accessible to four-wheel-drive vehicles. All but four miles is open to vehicle traffic. PAIS is the fourth designated national seashore in the United States.

Padre Island is the longest undeveloped barrier island in the world. The national seashore is long with of Gulf beach. PAIS hosts a variety of pristine beach, dune, and tidal flat environments, including the Laguna Madre on its west coast, a famous spot for windsurfing. It is located in parts of Kleberg, Kenedy, and Willacy counties, with Kenedy County having the majority of its land area.

==Padre Island==

Padre Island National Seashore is located on Padre Island, the largest of the Texas barrier islands and the world&#x27;s longest barrier island. The island is located along Texas&#x27;s southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches. Meaning &quot;father&quot; in Spanish, it was named after Father José Nicolás Ballí (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County.

It is about long and wide, Padre Island is the second-largest island by area in the contiguous United States, after Long Island in New York on the Atlantic Coast.

==Geology==
The geology of Padre Island National Seashore doesn&#x27;t just belong within the park itself. PAIS is part of the world&#x27;s longest natural barrier bar system. Padre Island is a very young geological feature that only developed merely 4,500 to 5,000 years ago, according to radio carbon dating of shells.

===General physiography===
Geologically extremely young, Padre Island is a vastly geologic feature. Unlike most of today&#x27;s geologic features, such as the Grand Canyon, Padre Island changes constantly. Situated in a stable depository basin, there isn&#x27;t much that can intervene with the barrier bars, except for the occasional hurricanes that come by. Most of Padre Island is less than 20 feet above mean sea level. Constant bombardment of prevailing southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico heap beach of sand into high foredunes. In some places, the onshore wind may blow loose sand from the foredunes and beach across the flats beyond. Active sand dunes march across the island, smothering vegetation in their paths and leaving barren sandflats in their wakes. In other places, vegetation may win a battle of its own and stabilize the blowing sand by binding it with roots and vines. Slower daily movements of the sand and stabilizing effects of vegetation are interrupted occasionally by the brutal force of hurricane winds, waves, and tides. During storms, beaches are eroded, vegetation is ripped up, dunes are flattened, and channels are scoured across the island.

====Laguna Madre====
Laguna Madre, separating Padre Island from the Texas mainland, is locked in by the barrier island. Consequently, circulation of seawater in and out of the lagoon is highly restricted. The combination of a high rate of evaporation under the hot Texas sun and little mixing with either freshwater or normal seawater has made Laguna Madre extremely salty.

The maximum width of the lagoon is approximately 10 miles. In many places, however, lagoon width fluctuates considerably with the height of wind-generated tides. The lagoon is widest during highest wind tides, which produce maximum flooding of the vast tidal flats.

Like the island environments, the environments of Laguna Madre vary considerably. Within the national seashore, the northern part of the lagoon is occupied largely by grassflats having an average water depth of about 3 feet. These grassflats are environments of very high biologic activity, serving as spawning grounds for a number of fish, clams, and snails.

The shallowest parts of the lagoon lie in the central part of the national seashore. These areas are known as Middle Ground and the Land-Cut Area, where the Intracoastal Waterway was dredged through the rarely flooded wind-tidal flats (pl. I). The Hole, which lies between Middle Ground and the Land-Cut Area, is not really much of a hole; its average depths are only 1 to 2 feet. This &quot;hole&quot; is occupied mostly by flats supporting shoalgrass and algae. The deepest parts of the lagoon are south of the Land-Cut Area, where the muddy sand bottoms lie at depths as great as 8 feet.

Two small natural islands in Laguna Madre are unique environments within the national seashore. North and South Bird Islands, each a series of sand berms or ridges, have become important bird rookeries. Some of the man-made spoil islands along the Intracoastal Waterway are also nesting grounds for a variety of birds.

==Biology==
===Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtles===
A program to re-establish a nesting beach for Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtles on Padre Island was begun in 1978. In 1992, the first two turtles from the program returned to Padre Island beach to lay their eggs. The number of Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle nests on Padre Island has increased ever since with 28 being found in 2005. Park rangers at PAIS are involved in an effort to help this endangered species. In the summer, visitors can witness the release of newborn turtles.

In September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas wildlife officials found a record of 128 Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and 4 on Mustang Island. Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp&#x27;s ridleys hatchlings along the Texas coast this year. The turtles are endangered due to shrimpers&#x27; nets and they are popular in Mexico as boot material and food.

===Birdwatching===
Due to the location of Padre Island National Seashore on the Central Flyway, a major migratory route for birds, about 380 species of birds have been documented within the park, which represents approximately 45% of all bird species documented within North America. The park was designated as a &quot;Globally Important Bird Area&quot; by the American Bird Conservancy in 1998 for providing an &quot;important habitat for globally significant numbers of Brown Pelicans, Redheads (5% of the world&#x27;s population), Least Terns (8% of the North American population), Piping Plovers (10% of the world&#x27;s population), Reddish Egrets (7% of the biogeographic population) and Peregrine Falcons (7% of the North American population).&quot;

The best time to see the multitude of the park&#x27;s bird migrants is during either early spring or fall and winter, when thousands of birds spend the winter there or migrate through the area. During the summer the most common birds are shore and marshbirds as well as some raptors and songbirds. The most common birds on the Gulf beach of the park during the year are the willet, sanderling, black skimmer, great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, cattle egret, grey plover, laughing gull, brown pelican, reddish egret, and five species of terns, including the least tern, Caspian tern, black tern, Sandwich tern, and royal tern. The two periodically appearing birds nesting on the park&#x27;s shores are the least tern and piping plover.

Bird Island Basin, on the Laguna Madre side of the park, may be periodically dry during the summer or during periods of extended drought. It is home to a wide variety of birds when wet, including black-necked stilts, roseate spoonbills, great egrets, American white ibis, and many others.

==Shoreline trash==
During periods throughout the summer months there may be a large amount of &quot;Sargassum&quot;, a brown seaweed, which washes up on the shore which aids in shore development by acting to hold sand in place, which can eventually build up the shoreline. Currents within the Gulf of Mexico are responsible for the transport of this seaweed mainly from the Sargasso Sea, but have also been responsible for the transport of trash to the shores of the park. This trash can be anything that is tossed overboard into the Gulf of Mexico as well as items that are either washed into the Gulf from land, or from the interior of the country by means of sewers that empty into the Gulf. These items can range from tiny pieces of plastic, hypodermic needles, and lumber, to nets or bleach bottles tossed overboard by shrimpers and even objects as large as buoys and steel containers. An international treaty known as MARPOL is designed to limit the dumping of wastes into the Gulf but there can be violators and the enforcement of the treaty is difficult, as well as the fact that some trash can originate from sewage transport or even come from the Equator. Oil and tar can commonly wash up onto the beaches as well, 94% of which originates from oil spills, engine lubrication oil, and tanker washings. The park relies on a &quot;grass roots&quot; policy that encourages park visitors to take out more trash than they bring in. Organization such as the Friends of Padre have removed over 2,000 tons of trash at their yearly Billy Sandifer Big Shell Beach Clean Up the last weekend of February every year.

A study by the park, started in 1994, to analyze the origin of debris, titled the PAIS Marine Debris Point Source Investigation. The park began collecting data in 1998 to catalogue and remove debris from of beach. Currently the park has collected over 1,000 days of data for the project, covering a collective area of over of shoreline surveyed. This study is one of the first long-term and comprehensive marine debris research projects started within the United States. From its result the vast majority of the debris is traced to the commercial shrimping industry while approximately 14% comes from the offshore oil and gas industry.

Naturalist and fishing guide Billy Sandifer founded an annual beach cleanup at the park in 1996. The cleanup targets the Big Shell Beach portion of the island, around the 20-25 mile marker. In 2007, Sandifer established the Friends of Padre, a non-profit association to fund park projects and to organize the cleanup.

==Oil and natural gas drilling==
Oil and natural gas drilling is allowed within the park. Congress has not approved the purchase of the mineral rights within the park even though the boundaries were surveyed as early as 1957. This has caused some controversy because the land is a protected seascape under IUCAN. Heavy equipment is used within the park and is transported across beaches that are nesting areas for not only sea turtles but many birds, including the piping plover, least tern, and other animals that may nest within the park.

<text>Song of the South is a 1946 American live-action/animated musical comedy-drama film directed by Harve Foster and Wilfred Jackson, produced by Walt Disney, and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the Uncle Remus stories as adapted by Joel Chandler Harris, stars James Baskett in his final film role, and features the voices of Johnny Lee, Baskett, and Nick Stewart. The film takes place in the U.S. state of Georgia during the Reconstruction era, a period of American history after the end of the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. The story follows seven-year-old Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) who is visiting his grandmother&#x27;s (Lucile Watson) plantation for an extended stay. Johnny befriends Uncle Remus (Baskett), an elderly worker on the plantation, and takes joy in hearing his tales about the adventures of Br&#x27;er Rabbit (Lee), Br&#x27;er Fox, and Br&#x27;er Bear (Baskett and Stewart). Johnny learns from the stories how to cope with the challenges he is experiencing while living on the plantation.

Walt Disney had wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus stories for some time. In 1939, he began negotiating with the Harris family for the film rights, and in 1944, filming for &quot;Song of the South&quot; began. The studio constructed a plantation set, for the outdoor scenes, in Phoenix, Arizona, while other scenes were filmed in Hollywood. The film is predominantly live action, but includes three animated segments, which were later released as stand-alone television features. Some scenes also feature a combination of live action with animation. &quot;Song of the South&quot; premiered in Atlanta in November 1946 and the remainder of its initial theater run was a financial success. The song &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Original Song and Baskett received an Academy Honorary Award for his performance as Uncle Remus.

Since its initial release the film has attracted controversy, with critics characterizing its portrayal of African Americans and plantation life as racist. As a result of the film&#x27;s controversial legacy, Disney has not released &quot;Song of the South&quot; on any home video format in the United States, and the film has never been available on its streaming platform Disney+. Some of the musical and animated sequences have been released through other means, and the full film has seen home video distribution in other countries. The cartoon characters from the film continued to appear in a variety of books, comics, and other Disney media for many decades after the film&#x27;s release. The theme park ride Splash Mountain, located at Tokyo Disneyland and formerly located at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, is based on the film&#x27;s animated sequences.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
The film is set on a plantation in Georgia, part of the Southern United States; specifically in a location some distance from Atlanta. Although sometimes misinterpreted as taking place before the American Civil War while slavery was still legal in the region, the film takes place during the Reconstruction era after slavery was abolished. Harris&#x27; original Uncle Remus stories were all set after the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Born in 1848, Harris was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction era. The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction era: clothing is in the newer late-Victorian style; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will; Black field hands are sharecroppers, etc.

=== Plot ===
Seven-year-old Johnny is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother&#x27;s Georgia plantation with his parents, Sally and John Sr. When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart temporarily, and he will live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship of that city&#x27;s newspaper. Distraught at his father&#x27;s departure, Johnny secretly leaves for Atlanta that night with a bindle.

As Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he discovers Uncle Remus telling tales of a character named Br&#x27;er Rabbit to other sharecroppers on the plantation. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him, offers him food for his journey, and takes him back to his cabin, where he tells the boy the traditional African-American folktale, &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute&quot;. In the story, Br&#x27;er Rabbit attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with Br&#x27;er Fox and Br&#x27;er Bear. Johnny takes the advice and lets Uncle Remus take him back to Sally.

Johnny makes friends with Toby, a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers, a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe and Jake, threaten to drown it. Sally refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes it to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with the fable of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby, stressing that people should not get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny imitates Br&#x27;er Rabbit&#x27;s use of reverse psychology from the tale and begs the Favers brothers not to tell their mother about the dog. The trick works and the boys get in trouble after telling their mother. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. Sally becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus), and she instructs him not to tell any more stories to Johnny.

Johnny&#x27;s birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus, who reprimands Joe and Jake and warns them to keep away from Johnny and Ginny. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go to the party either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and his &quot;Laughing Place&quot;. When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his party, and tells Uncle Remus to stay away from him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and begins to leave for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, and his grandmother escorts him in. Uncle Remus begins telling a Br&#x27;er Rabbit tale, and the boy miraculously survives.

Later, a fully recovered Johnny sings with Ginny and Toby while Johnny&#x27;s returned puppy runs alongside them. Nearby, Uncle Remus is shocked when Br&#x27;er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and, together, they all walk into the sunset.

== Development ==
In the aftermath of World War II, Walt Disney Studios faced financial difficulties due to a lack of foreign markets for animated films during wartime. The studio produced few theatrical animated shorts then, focusing instead on military training films that broke even, but produced no profit. The studio only profited in 1945 and 1946 by reissuing &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and still had to lay off half of its employees in 1946. With additional financial difficulties due to a union strike in 1941, Disney sought to produce live-action films to generate additional revenue. While Disney&#x27;s contract with RKO was for animated films, films that mixed live-action with animation fell under the contract, allowing the studio to lower production costs on &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;. Additionally, Disney owned the rights to several properties purchased after the success of &quot;Snow White&quot;, which could be made into family films.

In 1938, Walt Disney became interested in the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus storybook, claiming to remember hearing the stories as a child, and prepared two research reports to determine if it was possible to film the stories, dated April 8 and 11, 1938. He purchased the rights to the stories in 1939, paying Harris&#x27;s family $10,000 (). By 1986, the film based on the stories, &quot;Song of the South&quot;, had earned $300 million.

Beginning in 1939, Disney began developing &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; as an entirely animated feature. The stories were also considered as two-reel animated shorts. Stories considered for the production included &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit Rides the Fox&quot;, in which Br&#x27;er Rabbit tricks Br&#x27;er Fox into riding him like a horse to a party, and &quot;De Wuller-De-Wust&quot;, in which Br&#x27;er Rabbit pretends to be a ghost to scare Br&#x27;er Bear. In another treatment, Uncle Remus gathers the critters together for a prayer meeting and to encourage them to build a church that would bring peace between predators and prey. Also proposed was a storyline in which Br&#x27;er Rabbit&#x27;s addiction to gambling would be at the root of the troubles that led to the film&#x27;s adventures.

Disney first began to negotiate with Harris&#x27;s family for the rights in 1939, and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards&#x27; worth of story sketches. In November 1940, Disney visited the Harris&#x27;s home in Atlanta. He told &quot;Variety&quot; that he wanted to &quot;get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories.&quot; Disney&#x27;s brother Roy had misgivings about the project, doubting that it was &quot;big enough in caliber and natural draft&quot; to warrant a budget over $1 million and more than twenty-five minutes of animation. Disney planned to produce a series of Uncle Remus films if the first one was successful, each with the same live-action cast but different animated shorts. Ultimately, the studio decided that only a third of the film would be animated and the rest would be live-action.

Disney was initially going to have the screenplay written by the studio animators, but later sought professional writers. In June 1944, Disney hired Southern-born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay, and he met frequently with King Vidor, whom he was trying to interest in directing the live-action sequences.

Dalton Reymond delivered a 51-page outline on May 15, 1944. The Hays Office reviewed Reymond&#x27;s outline, and demanded that some terminology, such as characters referring to Remus as an &quot;old darkie&quot; be removed from Reymond&#x27;s treatment.

Disney hired African-American performer and writer Clarence Muse to be consulted on the screenplay, but Muse quit when Reymond ignored Muse&#x27;s suggestions to portray African-American characters in a way that would be perceived as being dignified and more than Southern stereotypes. Muse subsequently wrote letters to the editors of black publications to criticize the depiction of African-Americans in Reymond&#x27;s script. Disney claimed that Muse attacked the film because Disney did not choose Muse to play the part of Uncle Remus, which Muse had lobbied for.

In addition to concerns about his racial stereotyping, Reymond had never written a screenplay before (nor would he write another). Maurice Rapf, who had been writing live-action features at the time, was asked by Walt Disney Productions to work with Reymond and co-writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay. According to Neal Gabler, one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond&#x27;s &quot;white Southern slant&quot;.

Reymond&#x27;s treatment included the phrases &quot;massa&quot;, in reference to white characters, and &quot;darkey&quot;, in reference to plantation workers, prominently. Rapf removed the offending phrase and added dialogue to make it clear that the film was set after slavery had ended; one character in Rapf&#x27;s script states, in reference to the Black plantation workers, &quot;We gotta pay these people. They&#x27;re not slaves.&quot; Uncle Remus also states, after being told that he cannot read any more stories to Johnny, &quot;I&#x27;m a free man; I don&#x27;t have to take this.&quot;

Rapf saw the animal stories as metaphors for slave resistance, and intended to portray Br&#x27;er Rabbit as a smaller, less powerful Black man, and in place of the oppressive whites would be Br&#x27;er Fox, Br&#x27;er Bear and the deleted character Br&#x27;er Coon.
Rapf initially hesitated, but when he found out that most of the film would be live-action and that he could make extensive changes, he accepted the offer. Rapf worked on &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; for about seven weeks. When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond, Rapf was taken off the project. According to Rapf, Disney &quot;ended every conference by saying &#x27;Well, I think we&#x27;ve really licked it now.&#x27; Then he&#x27;d call you the next morning and say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got a new idea.&#x27; And he&#x27;d have one. Sometimes the ideas were good, sometimes they were terrible, but you could never really satisfy him.&quot; Morton Grant was assigned to the project. Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio.

On May 10, 1944, the title was changed from &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; to &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Casting ===
In February 1941, Disney talked with Paul Robeson about him playing Uncle Remus, and the two remained in talks about the project for several years, but ultimately he was not cast. It is speculated that Robeson&#x27;s politics made him too controversial for the role. Other actors considered included Rex Ingram. Clarence Muse lobbied for the role of Uncle Remus while consulting on the screenplay, but left the project due to Dalton Reymond&#x27;s depiction of African-Americans in the original treatment.

James Baskett was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly. Baskett is quoted as saying; &quot;I thought that, maybe, they&#x27;d try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus&#x27;s animals.&quot; Upon review of his voice, Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally, and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus. In addition to the role of Uncle Remus, Baskett also received the voice roles of the butterfly and Br&#x27;er Fox. Baskett also filled in as the voice of Br&#x27;er Rabbit for Johnny Lee in the &quot;Laughing Place&quot; sequence after Lee was called away to do a USO tour. Disney told Baskett&#x27;s sister Ruth that Baskett was &quot;the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years&quot;. After the film&#x27;s release, Disney maintained contact with him. Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an Academy Award for his performance, saying that he had worked &quot;almost wholly without direction&quot; and had devised the characterization of Remus himself. Baskett won an honorary Oscar in 1948. After Baskett&#x27;s death, his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a &quot;friend indeed and [we] certainly have been in need&quot;.

Also cast in the production were child actors Bobby Driscoll, Luana Patten, and Glenn Leedy (his only credited screen appearance). Driscoll was the first actor to be under a personal contract with the Disney studio. Patten had been a professional model since age three, and caught the attention of Disney when she appeared on the cover of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;. Leedy was discovered on the playground of the Booker T. Washington school in Phoenix, Arizona, by a talent scout from the Disney studio. Ruth Warrick and Erik Rolf, cast as Johnny&#x27;s mother and father, had actually been married during filming, but divorced in 1946. Hattie McDaniel also appeared in the role of Aunt Tempe.

=== Filming ===
Production started under the title &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;. The budget was originally $1.35 million. The animated segments of the film were directed by Wilfred Jackson, while the live-action segments were directed by Harve Foster. Filming began in December 1944 in Phoenix, Arizona where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes, and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called &quot;atmospheric shots&quot;. Back in Hollywood, the live action scenes were filmed at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio.

On the final day of shooting, Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, had not been properly blocked. According to Jackson, &quot;We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody came up with anything. Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt&#x27;s idea for Bambi on ice, it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film.&quot;

=== Animation ===

There are three animated segments in the film (they total 25 minutes). The last few minutes of the film also combines animation with live-action. The three sequences were later shown as stand-alone cartoon features on television.
* &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit Runs Away&quot;: (~8 minutes) Based on &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute&quot;. Includes the song &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;
* &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit and the Tar Baby&quot;: (~12 minutes) Based on &quot;Tar-Baby&quot;. The segment is interrupted with a short live-action scene about two-thirds through. It features the song &quot;How Do You Do?&quot;
* &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit&#x27;s Laughing Place&quot;: (~5 minutes) Based on &quot;The Laughing Place&quot;. The song &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Laughing Place&quot; is featured.

=== Music ===
Nine songs are heard in the film, with four reprises. Nearly all of the vocal performances are by the largely African-American cast, and the renowned all-Black Hall Johnson Choir sing four pieces: two versions of a blues number (&quot;Let the Rain Pour Down&quot;), one chain-reaction-style folk song (&quot;That&#x27;s What Uncle Remus Said&quot;) and one spiritual (&quot;All I Want&quot;).

The songs are, in film order, as follows:
* &quot;Song of the South&quot;: Written by Sam Coslow and Arthur Johnston; performed by the Disney Studio Choir
* &quot;Uncle Remus Said&quot;: Written by Eliot Daniel, Hy Heath, and Johnny Lange; performed by the Hall Johnson Choir
* &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;: Written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert; performed by James Baskett
* &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;: (reprise) Performed by Bobby Driscoll
* &quot;Who Wants to Live Like That?&quot;: Written by Ken Darby and Foster Carling; performed by James Baskett
* &quot;Let the Rain Pour Down&quot;: (uptempo) Written by Ken Darby and Foster Carling; performed by the Hall Johnson Choir
* &quot;How Do You Do?&quot;: Written by Robert MacGimsey; performed by Johnny Lee and James Baskett
* &quot;How Do You Do?&quot;: (reprise) Performed by Bobby Driscoll and Glenn Leedy
* &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;: Written by Charles Wolcott and Ray Gilbert; performed by Hattie McDaniel.
* &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Laughing Place&quot;: Written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert; performed by James Baskett and Nick Stewart
* &quot;Let the Rain Pour Down&quot;: (downtempo) Written by Ken Darby and Foster Carling; performed by the Hall Johnson Choir
* &quot;All I Want&quot;: Traditional, new arrangement and lyrics by Ken Darby; performed by the Hall Johnson Choir
* &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;: (reprise) Performed by Bobby Driscoll, Luana Patten, Glenn Leedy, Johnny Lee, and James Baskett
* &quot;Song of the South&quot;: (reprise) Performed by the Disney Studio Choir

&quot;Let the Rain Pour Down&quot; is set to the melody of &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, a traditional blues song popularized by Lead Belly (Huddie William Ledbetter). The song title &quot;Look at the Sun&quot; appeared in some early press books, though it is not in the film. Ken Emerson, author of the book &quot;Doo-dah!: Stephen Foster And The Rise Of American Popular Culture&quot;, believes that &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; is influenced by the chorus of the pre-Civil War folk song &quot;Zip Coon&quot;, which is today considered racist for its use of an African American stereotype.

== Release ==

The film premiered on November 12, 1946, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta. Walt Disney made introductory remarks, introduced the cast, then quietly left for his room at the Georgian Terrace Hotel across the street; he had previously stated that unexpected audience reactions upset him and he was better off not seeing the film with an audience. James Baskett was unable to attend the film&#x27;s premiere because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities, as Atlanta was then a racially segregated city.

&quot;Song of the South&quot; was re-released in theaters several times after its original premiere, each time through Buena Vista Pictures: in 1956 for the 10th anniversary; in 1972 for the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney Productions; in 1973 as the second half of a double bill with &quot;The Aristocats&quot;; in 1980 for the 100th anniversary of Harris&#x27;s classic stories; and in 1986 for the film&#x27;s own 40th anniversary and in promotion of the upcoming Splash Mountain attraction at Disneyland.

=== Spin-off comics and books ===
As had been done earlier with &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), Disney produced a Sunday comic strip titled &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; to give the film pre-release publicity. The strip was launched by King Features on October 14, 1945, more than a year before the film was released. The previous comic strip adaptations of Disney films lasted for four or five months, but the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; strip continued for almost thirty years, telling new stories of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and friends, until the strip was discontinued on December 31, 1972. Apart from the newspaper strips, Disney &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; comics were also produced for comic books; the first such stories appeared in late 1946. Produced both by Western Publishing and European publishers such as Egmont, they continue to appear.

In 1946, a Giant Golden Book entitled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Uncle Remus Stories&quot; was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. It featured 23 illustrated stories of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&#x27;s escapades, all told in a Southern dialect based on the original Joel Chandler Harris stories.

In 1986, Floyd Norman wrote &quot;A Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah Christmas!&quot; featuring Uncle Remus and Br&#x27;er Rabbit as that year&#x27;s annual &quot;Disney Christmas Story&quot; newspaper comic strip. When the &quot;Christmas Story&quot; strips were reprinted in the 2017 collection &quot;Disney&#x27;s Christmas Classics&quot;, this story was omitted—the only deletion in an otherwise complete run of the strip.

=== Home media ===
Disney has not released a complete version of the film in the United States on home video, given the film&#x27;s controversial reputation. Over the years, Disney has made a variety of statements about whether and when the film would be re-released. From 1984 to 2005, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner stated that the film would not receive a home video release in the United States, due to not wanting to have a disclaimer and fearing backlash and accusations of racism. At Eisner&#x27;s request, Uncle Remus was not featured in the Splash Mountain attraction, instead being replaced as the narrator by Br&#x27;er Frog in the Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions of the ride. In March 2010, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that there were no plans to release the film on DVD, calling the film &quot;antiquated&quot; and &quot;fairly offensive&quot;. In November 2010, Disney creative director Dave Bossert stated in an interview, &quot;I can say there&#x27;s been a lot of internal discussion about &quot;Song of the South&quot;. And at some point we&#x27;re going to do something about it. I don&#x27;t know when, but we will. We know we want people to see &quot;Song of the South&quot; because we realize it&#x27;s a big piece of company history, and we want to do it the right way.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert, who normally disdained any attempt to keep films from any audience, supported the non-release of the film, arguing that Disney films become a part of the consciousness of American children, who take films more literally than do adults.

Audio from the film—both the musical soundtrack and dialogue—was commonly used in home media tie-ins through the late 1970s. In particular, many book-and-record sets were released featuring the animated portions of the film or summaries of the film as a whole. The Walt Disney Company has also included key portions of the film in VHS and DVD compilations in the United States, as well as on the long-running Walt Disney anthology television series. &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; and some of the animated portions appear in an added feature on the 2004 &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; Special Edition DVD, as part of the 1950 Christmas special &quot;One Hour in Wonderland&quot;, which promoted the then-forthcoming film. From 1986 to 2001, most of the musical segments – notably &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, &quot;How Do You Do?&quot;, and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got A Laughing Place&quot; – were included on the VHS and LaserDisc releases of the &quot;Disney Sing-Along Songs&quot; series.

The full-length film has been released in its entirety on VHS and LaserDisc in various European and Asian countries. In the United Kingdom, it was released on PAL VHS between 1982 and 2000. In Japan, it appeared on NTSC VHS and LaserDisc in 1985, 1990 and 1992, with Japanese subtitles during songs. (Under Japanese copyright law, the film is now in the public domain.) Most of the foreign releases of the film are literal translations of the English title; the German title &quot;Onkel Remus&#x27; Wunderland&quot; translates to &quot;Uncle Remus&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, the Italian title &quot;I Racconti Dello Zio Tom&quot; translates to &quot;The Stories of Uncle Tom&quot;, and the Norwegian title &quot;Onkel Remus forteller&quot; translates to &quot;Storyteller Uncle Remus&quot;.

In 2017, after being inaugurated as a Disney Legend, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a desire for &quot;Song of the South&quot; to be re-released publicly to American audiences and stated, &quot;I&#x27;m trying to find a way to get people to start having conversations about bringing &quot;Song of the South&quot; back, so we can talk about what it was and where it came from and why it came out&quot;.

&quot;Song of the South&quot; has never been available on Disney&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+, which launched in the United States in 2019. In 2020, Iger affirmed during a shareholders meeting that the film would not be getting a release on the service, even with an &quot;outdated cultural depictions&quot; disclaimer, stating that the film is &quot;not appropriate in today&#x27;s world&quot;. It has been noted on an unofficial fansite, however, that the film would become available to the public in the United States again once it enters the American public domain in 2041 when its copyright expires.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Bosley Crowther wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;More and more, Walt Disney&#x27;s craftsmen have been loading their feature films with so-called &#x27;live action&#x27; in place of their animated whimsies of the past, and by just those proportions has the magic of these Disney films decreased&quot;, citing the ratio of live action to animation at two to one, concluding that is &quot;approximately the ratio of its mediocrity to its charm&quot;. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; felt the film overall was &quot;sometimes sentimental, slow and overlong&quot;. Nevertheless, the review felt the songs were &quot;above-average, with one &#x27;Zip-adee-do-da,&#x27; [&quot;sic&quot;] likely to be one of the season&#x27;s favorites&quot; and the animated sequences as &quot;great stuff&quot;. They also praised Driscoll and Patten as &quot;two of the most natural and appealing youngsters&quot; and Baskett&#x27;s performance was &quot;as warming a portrait as has been seen in a long time&quot;. A review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the animated sequences as &quot; Disney—and delightful&quot;, but cautioned that it was &quot;bound to land its maker in hot water&quot; because the character of Uncle Remus was &quot;bound to enrage all educated Negroes and a number of damyankees&quot;.

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised Driscoll and Baskett&#x27;s performances, particularly the latter writing &quot;his tender understanding of the child&#x27;s problems gives the picture many appealing moments.&quot; Overall, the review felt the film had &quot;a simple but sensitive and pathetic story, filled with deep human interest and fine, clean comedy situations, and it has an air of wholesomeness that comes as a pleasant relief from the general run of pictures nowadays.&quot; Dorothy Masters of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote: &quot;Although plot is practically ignored, Disney has worked a lot of magic with brilliant animation, effective and wonderful music, besides having made the very best possible choice for Uncle Remus. James Baskett, who portrays the sagacious dean of plantation workers, has both the benign appearance and mellifluous voice to make him the perfect spinner-of-tales. It&#x27;s largely through his philosophical whimsy that &quot;Song of the South&quot; is so delightfully charming.&quot; Columnist Hedda Hopper also praised Baskett&#x27;s performance, and advocated for him to receive an Academy Award.

Criticism in the black press, however, was more politically divided. Richard B. Dier in &quot;The Afro-American&quot; was &quot;thoroughly disgusted&quot; by the film for being &quot;as vicious a piece of propaganda for white supremacy as Hollywood ever produced.&quot; Herman Hill in &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; felt that &quot;Song of the South&quot; would &quot;prove of inestimable goodwill in the furthering of interracial relations&quot;, and considered criticisms of the film to be &quot;unadulterated hogwash symptomatic of the unfortunate racial neurosis that seems to be gripping so many of our humorless brethren these days.&quot;

Charles Solomon, reviewing the film in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; during its 1986 re-release, praised the film as &quot;essentially a nostalgic valentine to a past that never existed, and within those limits, it offers a pleasant, family diversion for holiday afternoons when the children get restless.&quot; The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes has a rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

=== Box office ===
By January 1948, the film had grossed $3.4 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada, netting the studio a profit of $226,000 ($2.83 million in 2017 dollars). According to RKO records, during its initial release, the film earned $3,515,000 domestically and $1,300,000 foreign, for a worldwide total of $4,815,000.

=== Accolades ===

The score by Daniele Amfitheatrof, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott was nominated in the &quot;Scoring of a Musical Picture&quot; category, and &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert, won the award for Best Original Song at the 20th Academy Awards on March 20, 1948. A special Academy Award was given to Baskett &quot;for his able and heart-warming characterization of Uncle Remus, friend and story teller to the children of the world in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot;&quot;. For their portrayals of the children Johnny and Ginny, Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were also discussed for Academy Juvenile Awards, but in 1947 it was decided not to present such awards at all.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; – #47
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

== Depiction of race ==
The film has sparked significant controversy for its handling of race. Cultural historian Jason Sperb describes the film as &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most resiliently offensive racist texts&quot;. Sperb, Neal Gabler, and other critics have noted the film&#x27;s release as being in the wake of the Double V campaign, a campaign in the United States during World War II to promote victory over racism in the United States and its armed forces, and victory over fascism abroad. Early in the film&#x27;s production, there was concern that the material would encounter controversy. Disney publicist Vern Caldwell wrote to producer Perce Pearce that &quot;the negro situation is a dangerous one. Between the negro haters and the negro lovers there are many chances to run afoul of situations that could run the gamut all the way from the nasty to the controversial.&quot;

The Disney Company has stated that, like Harris&#x27;s book, the film takes place after the American Civil War and that all the African American characters in the movie are no longer slaves. The Hays Office had asked Disney to &quot;be certain that the frontispiece of the book mentioned establishes the date in the 1870s&quot;; however, the final film carried no such statement.

Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a congressman from Harlem, branded the film an &quot;insult to American minorities [and] everything that America as a whole stands for.&quot; The National Negro Congress set up picket lines in theaters in the big cities where the film played, with its protesters holding signs that read &quot;&quot;Song of the South&quot; is an insult to the Negro people&quot; and, lampooning &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, chanted: &quot;Disney tells, Disney tells/lies about the South.&quot; On April 2, 1947, a group of protesters marched around Oakland, California&#x27;s Paramount Theatre with picket signs reading, &quot;We want films on Democracy not Slavery&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t prejudice children&#x27;s minds with films like this&quot;. &quot;The National Jewish Post&quot; scorned the fact that the film&#x27;s lead was not allowed to attend its premiere in Atlanta because of his race.

Criticisms in the Black press largely objected to the reinforcement of stereotypes, such as the subservient status of Black characters, costuming, the exaggerated dialect, and other archaic depictions of Black people.

=== Response of civil rights activists ===

According to Valarie Stewart, daughter of Nick Stewart (voice of Br&#x27;er Bear in the film), NAACP executive secretary Walter Francis White disliked actress Hattie McDaniel. White, a light-skinned black man with blonde hair and blue eyes, according to Valarie Stewart, launched campaigns against McDaniel&#x27;s films because McDaniel was dark-skinned, and she alleged that &quot;Song of the South&quot; was targeted because of White&#x27;s prejudice against McDaniel.

Disney historian Jim Korkis, in his 2012 book &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Song of the South&quot;, alleged that White and June Blythe, the director of the American Council on Race Relations, were denied requests to see a treatment for the film. When the film was first released, White telegraphed major newspapers around the country with the following statement, erroneously claiming that the film depicted an antebellum setting:

White had not seen the film; his statement was allegedly based on memos he received from two NAACP staff members, Norma Jensen and Hope Spingarn, who attended a press screening on November 20, 1946. Jensen had written the film was &quot;so artistically beautiful that it is difficult to be provoked over the clichés,&quot; but said it contained &quot;all the clichés in the book&quot;. Spingarn listed several things she found objectionable from the film, including the use of African-American English. Jim Hill Media stated that both Jensen and Spingarn were confused by the film&#x27;s Reconstruction setting, writing; &quot;it was something that also confused other reviewers who from the tone of the film and the type of similar recent Hollywood movies assumed it must also be set during the time of slavery.&quot; Based on the Jensen and Spingarn memos, White released the &quot;official position&quot; of the NAACP in a telegram that was widely quoted in newspapers. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; made a similar assumption, writing that the movie was a &quot;travesty on the &quot;antebellum&quot; South.&quot;

== Legacy ==

As early as October 1945, a newspaper strip called &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; appeared in the United States, and this production continued until 1972. There have also been episodes for the series produced for the Disney comic books worldwide, in the U.S., Denmark and the Netherlands, from the 1940s up to 2012. Br&#x27;er Fox and Br&#x27;er Bear also appeared frequently in Disney&#x27;s Big Bad Wolf stories, although here, Br&#x27;er Bear was usually cast as an honest farmer and family man, instead of an antagonist in his original appearances.

The Splash Mountain log flume ride, which opened at Disneyland in 1989, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom in 1992, is based on the animated portions of &quot;Song of the South&quot;. As with the film, the ride had drawn controversy over the years due to the racial issues associated with the work. Amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, Disney announced that they would retool the ride in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom to remove the &quot;Song of the South&quot; elements and replace them with a concept based on Disney&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. Disney stated that development of the project began in 2019. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Disney executives had privately discussed removing the attraction&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot; theme for at least five years, before putting into development the &quot;Princess and the Frog&quot; theme. In July 2022, Disney announced that the new ride would be called Tiana&#x27;s Bayou Adventure. The Magic Kingdom version of Splash Mountain closed in January 2023, while the Disneyland version closed in May 2023. Tiana&#x27;s Bayou Adventure opened in June 2024 at Magic Kingdom and in November 2024 at Disneyland.

Br&#x27;er Bear, the Tar-Baby, and the hummingbirds and moles from the &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; scene, have cameo appearances in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). Br&#x27;er Bear has a cameo appearance in the television series &quot;Bonkers&quot; (1993–1994) in the episode &quot;Casabonkers&quot; (1993). Br&#x27;er Rabbit, Br&#x27;er Fox, and Br&#x27;er Bear make recurring cameo appearances on the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), and appear in the show&#x27;s direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot; (2001), while the Blue Bird makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; episode &quot;Pete&#x27;s One-Man Show&quot; (2002). In addition, Bre&#x27;r Bear appears along with other Disney characters at the end of the direct-to-video film &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; (2004).

Br&#x27;er Rabbit, Br&#x27;er Fox, and Br&#x27;er Bear also appeared in the 2011 video game &quot;&quot; for the Xbox 360. The game is a virtual recreation of Disneyland and features a mini game based on the Splash Mountain attraction. Br&#x27;er Rabbit helps guide the player character through that game, while Br&#x27;er Fox and Br&#x27;er Bear serve as antagonists. The three Br&#x27;ers also appear as meet-and-greet characters in the game, outside Splash Mountain in Critter Country. In the game, Jess Harnell reprises his role from the attraction as Br&#x27;er Rabbit and also takes on the role of Br&#x27;er Fox, while Br&#x27;er Bear is voiced by James Avery, who previously voiced Br&#x27;er Bear and Br&#x27;er Frog in the Magic Kingdom version of Splash Mountain. This is the Br&#x27;ers&#x27; first major appearance in Disney media and their first appearance as computer-generated characters.

In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the 67th greatest animated film of all time.

<text>Sir Robert Tony Watson CMG FRS (born 21 March 1948) is a British chemist who has worked on atmospheric science issues including ozone depletion, global warming and paleoclimatology since the 1980s. Most recently, he is lead author of the February 2021 U.N. report &quot;Making Peace with Nature&quot;. 

== Education and awards ==

Watson received a PhD in gas phase chemical kinetics (atmospheric chemistry) from Queen Mary College, University of London in 1973. He has received awards for his contributions to science, including the NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences in 1992, the American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility in 1993, the insignia of Honorary Companion of St Michael and St George from the British Government in 2003, and the Champions of the Earth Award from the United Nations Environment Programme in 2014. In 2020 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

== Career ==
Watson was the Director of the Science Division and Chief Scientist for the Office of Mission to Planet Earth at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Watson then became Associate Director for Environment in the Office of the President of the United States in the White House.

In 1996, Watson joined the World Bank as the Senior Scientific adviser in the Environment Department, became Director of the Environment Department and Head of the Environment Sector Board in 1997 and is currently the Chief Scientist and Senior Adviser for Sustainable Development. He took up a position as Chair of Environmental Science and Science Director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, in August 2007 and joined the British Government&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as Chief Scientific Adviser in September 2007.

Watson had a role in the regulation efforts related to both ozone depletion and global warming. The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established. Until the 1980s EU, NASA, NAS, UNEP, WMO and the British government had dissenting scientific reports. Watson played a role in the process of unified assessments and did so as well for the IPCC.

He was Chairman of the Global Environment Facility&#x27;s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel from 1991 to 1994, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 1997 to 2002 and Board co-chair for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2000 to 2005. He was then Director of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development which ran from 2005 to 2007, and had previously been co-chair of the International Scientific Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone for their reports from 1994 to 2006. He has been Chair or co-chair of other international scientific assessments, including the IPCC Working Group II, the United Nations Environment Programme/World Meteorological Organization (UNEP/WMO), and the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment.

Watson was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for his government service.

He is currently Director of Strategic Development for the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia.

On 29 February 2016, Watson was elected Chair of IPBES at the Fourth Plenary of that organisation after having served as its vice-president before.

== Opinions ==

Andrew Revkin writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot; described Watson as an &quot;outspoken advocate of the idea that human actions—mainly burning coal and oil—are contributing to global warming and must be changed to avert environmental upheavals.&quot;

In April 2002 the United States pressed for and won his replacement by Rajendra Pachauri as IPCC chair. According to &quot;New Scientist&quot;, &quot;The oil industry seems to be behind the move.&quot; The industry campaign to oust Watson had begun days after George W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration in January 2001, with a memo to the White House from Randy Randol of oil giant ExxonMobil asking &quot;Can Watson be replaced now at the request of the US?&quot;

In 2000, Watson stated:
: The overwhelming majority of scientific experts, whilst recognising that scientific uncertainties exist, nonetheless believe that human-induced climate change is inevitable. Indeed, during the last few years, many parts of the world have suffered major heat waves, floods, droughts, fires and extreme weather events leading to significant economic losses and loss of life. While individual events cannot be directly linked to human-induced climate change, the frequency and magnitude of these types of events are predicted to increase in a warmer world.&quot;

: The question is not whether climate will change in response to human activities, but rather how much (magnitude), how fast (the rate of change) and where (regional patterns). It is also clear that climate change will, in many parts of the world, adversely affect socio-economic sectors, including water resources, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and human settlements, ecological systems (particularly forests and coral reefs), and human health (particularly diseases spread by insects), with developing countries being the most vulnerable. The good news is, however, that the majority of experts believe that significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically feasible due to an extensive array of technologies and policy measures in the energy supply, energy demand and agricultural and forestry sectors. In addition, the projected adverse effects of climate change on socio-economic and ecological systems can, to some degree, be reduced through proactive adaptation measures. These are the fundamental conclusions, taken from already approved/accepted IPCC assessments, of a careful and objective analysis of all relevant scientific, technical and economic information by thousands of experts from the appropriate fields of science from academia, governments, industry and environmental organisations from around the world.

<doc id="61145" wikidata="Q123213" url="?curid=61145" title="Polish złoty">
<text>The Polish złoty (alternative spelling: &quot;zloty&quot;; Polish: &quot;polski złoty&quot;, ; abbreviation: zł; code: PLN) is the official currency and legal tender of Poland. It is subdivided into 100 grosz (&quot;gr&quot;). It is the most-traded currency in Central and Eastern Europe and ranks 21st most-traded in the foreign exchange market.

The word złoty is a masculine form of the Polish adjective &#x27;golden&#x27;, which closely relates with its name to the guilder, whereas the grosz subunit is based on the groschen, cognate to the English word groat. It was officially introduced to replace its interim predecessor, the Polish marka, on 28 February 1919 and began circulation in 1924. The only bodies permitted to manufacture or mint złoty coins and banknotes are the Polska Wytwórnia Papierów Wartościowych (PWPW), founded in Warsaw on 25 January 1919, and Mennica Polska, founded in Warsaw on 10 February 1766.

As a result of inflation in the early 1990s, the currency underwent redenomination. Thus, on 1 January 1995, 10,000 old złoty (PLZ) became one new złoty (PLN). As a member of the European Union, Poland is obligated to adopt the euro when all specific conditions are met, however there is no time limit for fulfilling all of them.

Currently, Poland is not in ERM II.

==Name and plural forms==
The term &quot; is an adjective derived from the noun &quot;, which in the Polish language denotes gold. A literal translation of the currency&#x27;s name would be &quot;golden&quot; or &quot;the golden one&quot;. There are two plural forms – as well as , and their correct usage is as follows:

* 1 – or / 
* 2...4; 22...24; 32...34 (...), 102...104, 122...124, 132...134, (...) – or / 
* 0, 5...21; 25...31; 35...41 (...); 95...101; 105...121; 125...131; (...) – or / 

Fractions should be rendered with and , for example 0.1 ; 2.5 and so on.

Native English speakers or English-language sources tend to avoid the complexity of plural forms and in turn use &quot;złoty&quot; for all denominations, for instance 2 złoty and 100 złoty instead of 2 złote and 100 złotych.

==Symbol==

The official currency symbol is zł, composed of lowercase z and ł which are the two first letters of &quot;złoty&quot;. It has no representation in the Unicode Standard as a single sign, but previously had representation in Polish typewriters and computers. The symbol of the &quot;grosz&quot; subunit is represented by lowercase gr.

==History==
===First złoty===
The first form of tangible currency in Poland was the denarius (&quot;denar&quot;), which began circulating in the 10th century. During this period, Polish coinage had a single face value and was minted from bullion (primarily silver, but also compounded with copper and other precious metals). The standard unit of mass used at the time was the grzywna rather than the pound, with one grzywna being equivalent to 240 denars. From the 1300s to the mid-16th century, the Prague groschen (or groat) dominated the market and its high supply reduced the demand for a national currency across Central Europe. Certain cities and autonomous regions of the Polish Kingdom held the privilege of minting their own currency, for instance the shilling (&quot;szeląg&quot;) in the Duchy of Prussia, which Poland co-adopted in 1526.

Initially, the term &quot;złoty&quot; (lit. the golden one) was used in the 14th and 15th centuries for a number of foreign gold coins, most notably Venetian ducats, florins and guldens. In 1496, the Sejm parliament debated on the creation of a domestic currency and approved the złoty, which until then acted as a unit of account. An exchange rate of 30 grosz was imposed for one gold piece, which remained the traditional subdivision until the 19th century. In the years 1526–1535, as part of an extensive monetary reform proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus and Justus Decius, King Sigismund I defined the złoty as a legal tender in the minting ordinance on 16 February 1528.

The Polish monetary system remained complex and intricate from the 16th to 18th centuries until a monetary reform enacted by Stanisław II Augustus which removed all other monetary units except the złoty, which was divided into 30 groszy. Polish currency was then linked to that of the Holy Roman Empire by setting the Conventionsthaler = 8 złoty = 23.3856 g fine silver and the North German thaler = 6 złoty = 17.5392 g silver (hence 2.9232 g silver in a złoty).

Radical changes to the currency were made during the Kościuszko Uprising. The second partition of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth resulted in the loss of approximately 200,000 square kilometres of land and precipitated an economic collapse. The widespread shortage of funds to finance the defense of remaining territories forced the insurrectionist government to look for alternatives. In June 1794, Tadeusz Kościuszko began printing paper money and issuing first Polish banknotes as a substitute for coinage, which could not be minted in required quantities. These entered circulation on 13 August 1794.

The złoty remained in circulation after the Partitions of Poland and Napoleon&#x27;s Duchy of Warsaw issued coins denominated in grosz, złoty and talars, with the &quot;talar&quot; (thaler) of 6 złoty slightly reduced in value to the Prussian thaler of 16.704 g fine silver (hence 2.784 g silver in a złoty). Talar banknotes were also issued. In 1813, while Zamość was under siege, the town authorities issued 6 grosz and 2 złoty coins. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Austrian and Russian sectors of partitioned Poland continued to use the złoty for some time, while the German sector replaced the &quot;talar&quot; and &quot;złoty&quot; with the Prussian thaler and later, the German gold mark.

On 19 November O.S. (1 December N.S.) 1815, the law regarding the monetary system of Congress Poland (in Russia) was passed, which pegged the złoty at 15 kopecks (0.15 Imperial roubles, or almost 2.7 g fine silver) and the groszy at kopeck, and with silver 1, 2, 5 and 10 złotych coins issued from 1816 to 1855.

At the time of the 1830 November Uprising, the insurrectionists issued their own &quot;rebel money&quot; – golden ducats and silver coins in the denomination of 2 and 5 złoty, with the revolutionary coat of arms, and the copper 3 and 10 grosz. These coins continued to be traded long after the uprising was quelled. As a consequence of the uprising, the rubel became the sole legal tender of Congress Poland from 1842, although coins marked as złoty in parallel with ruble were minted in Warsaw until 1865 and remained legal until 1890. In 1892, the Austro-Hungarian krone was introduced in Austrian Galicia. Between 1835 and 1846, the Free City of Kraków also used its own independent currency, the Kraków złoty (minted in Vienna), which remained legal until 1857.

During World War I, the rouble and krone were replaced by the Polish marka, a currency initially equivalent to the German mark. The marka remained in use after Poland regained its independence in 1918, but was extremely unstable, disrupted the whole economy, and triggered galloping inflation.

===Second złoty===
The złoty was reintroduced by the Minister of Finance, Władysław Grabski, in April 1924. It replaced the marka at a rate of 1 złoty to 1,800,000 marks and was subdivided into 100 grosz rather than the traditional 30 grosz.

Following its inauguration, the second złoty was pegged to the United States dollar through a stabilization loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The budget deficit ballooned and out-of-control inflation ensued. The złoty began to stabilise in 1926 (chiefly due to significant exports of coal), and was re-set on the dollar-złoty rate 50% higher than in 1924. Up until 1933, the złoty was freely exchanged into gold and foreign currency. Based on these developments, the Polish government made the decision to adopt the gold standard and maintain it for a significant period to attract global investors.

Under the occupation during World War II, the Germans created an Emissary Bank (&quot;Bank Emisyjny&quot;) in Kraków, as Polish bank officials fled to Paris in France. It started operating on 8 April 1940, and in May, old banknotes from 1924 to 1939 were overstamped by the new entity. Money exchange was limited per individual; the limits varied according to the status of the person. The fixed exchange rate was 2 złoty per 1 Reichsmark. A new issue of notes appeared in the years 1940–1941.

On 15 January 1945, the National Bank of Poland was formed, and a new printing plant opened in Łódź. The series II and III notes were designed by Ryszard Kleczewski and Wacław Borowski. The first three series were taken out of circulation in line with legislation signed on 28 October 1950, covering the introduction of a new złoty with a revived coinage system.

===Third złoty (PLZ)===
In 1950, the third złoty () was introduced, replacing all notes issued up to 1948 at a rate of one hundred to one, while all bank assets were re-denominated in the ratio 100:3. The new banknotes were dated 1948, while the new coins were dated 1949. Initially, by law with effect from 1950, 1 złoty was worth 0.222168 grams of pure gold. The banknotes were issued in denominations ranging from 10 zlotych to 5 million zlotych.

===Fourth złoty (PLN)===
After the fall of communism in 1989 and successive hyperinflation in 1990, the złoty was again redenominated. On 11 May 1994, a redenomination project from the NBP was approved; the act allowing the project to come into force was ratified on 7 July 1994. Thus, on 1 January 1995, the PLN was introduced at a rate of 1 PLN to 10,000 PLZ. Redesigned coins and banknotes were released featuring Polish monarchs, which were printed by De La Rue in London (until 1997) and PWPW in Warsaw (from 1997).

Between 2013 and 2014, the banknotes received additional security features. The design does not differ greatly from the original 1994 series, but is distinguishable by the added white-coloured field with a watermark on the obverse. The updated notes also possess randomly arranged dotting, which are part of the EURion constellation.

On 10 February 2017, a 500zł banknote with the likeness of John III Sobieski began circulating. On 2 October 2019, the 19 złotych note was released. In 2021, Adam Glapiński, president of the National Bank of Poland, announced that a 1000zł note will be introduced in the near future.

===Future of the złoty===

One of the conditions of Poland joining the European Union in May 2004 obliges the country to eventually adopt the euro, though not at any specific date and only after Poland meets the necessary stability criteria; serious discussions regarding joining the Eurozone have ensued. An amendment to Article 227 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, which cedes the exclusive right to issue money to the Bank of Poland, will be required. While opinions of the euro have not always been favorable, 2022 opinion polling on behalf of the European Commission found 60% of respondents support adopting the euro.

==Banknotes==
The banknotes range from 12 to 15 centimetres in length and from 60 to 75 millimetres in width. The length increases by 6mm and the width by 3mm with every higher denomination. The obverse features the left profile of a Polish monarch clothed in armour or royal regalia; the sovereigns are arranged chronologically based on the period of reign. The reverse illustrates important landmarks, early coinage or important objects from Poland&#x27;s history. Architectural elements comprising portals, columns, windows or flower motifs are scattered throughout each banknote, both on the obverse and on the reverse. Predominant colours used include shades of brown, pink or purple, blue, green, and gold. Face value is given in numerals in the upper-left and upper-right corners on the obverse, and in the upper-right corner on the reverse. The written form of the nominal value is embedded vertically on the obverse and horizontally on the reverse.

The notes are adorned by the eagle charge from the Polish coat of arms, along with signatures of the President and General Treasurer of NBP – the National Bank of Poland.

<doc id="61146" wikidata="Q271837" url="?curid=61146" title="Chastity belt">
<text>A chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse or masturbation. Such belts were historically designed for women, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity, to protect women from rape, or to dissuade women and their potential sexual partners from sexual temptation. Modern versions of the chastity belt are predominantly, but not exclusively, used in the BDSM community, and chastity belts are now designed for male wearers in addition to female wearers.

According to modern myths, the chastity belt was used as an anti-temptation device during the Crusades. When the knight left for the Holy Lands on the Crusades, his Lady would wear a chastity belt to preserve her faithfulness to him. However, there is no credible evidence that chastity belts existed before the 15th century (over a century after the last Middle Eastern Crusade), and their main period of apparent use falls within the Renaissance rather than the Middle Ages. Research into the history of the chastity belt suggests that they were not used until the 16th century, and then only rather rarely; they first became widely available in the form of 19th-century anti-masturbation medical devices.

Renaissance chastity belts were said to have had padded linings (to prevent large areas of metal from coming into direct prolonged contact with the skin), and these had to be changed fairly frequently, so that such belts were not practical for uninterrupted long-term wear. Uninterrupted long-term wear could have caused genitourinary infection, abrasive wounds, sepsis, and eventual death.

==Historical usage==


Gregory the Great, Alcuin of York, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Nicholas Gorranus all made passing references to &quot;chastity belts&quot; within their exhortatory and public discourses, but meant this in a figurative or metaphorical sense within their historical context.

The first detailed actual mention of what could be interpreted as &quot;chastity belts&quot; in the West is in Konrad Kyeser von Eichstätt&#x27;s &quot;Bellifortis&quot; (1405), which describes the military technology of the era. The book includes a drawing that is accompanied by the Latin text: &quot;Est florentinarum hoc bracile dominarum ferreum et durum ab antea sic reseratum.&quot; (&quot;These are hard iron breeches of Florentine women which are closed at the front.&quot;) The belt in this drawing is described by Dingwall as &quot;both clumsy and heavy&quot;, having &quot;little in common with the later models which served the same use&quot;. The &quot;Bellifortis&quot; account is not supported by any additional concrete evidence or corroborating documents. Polidoro argues that Kyeser&#x27;s references are meant to be humorous or ironic, and that Dingwall&#x27;s accounts of the use of chastity belts by a few rich men in the 16th and 17th centuries to ensure the faithfulness of their often much younger wives should be treated critically, because of the absence of actual artifacts of this nature from the historical period in question, and his lack of access to more detailed contemporary historical records.

In 1889, a leather-and-iron belt was found by Anton Pachinger—a German collector of antiquities—in Linz, Austria, in a grave on a skeleton of a young woman. The woman was reportedly buried in the 16th century. Pachinger, however, could not find any record of the woman&#x27;s burial in the town archives. The belt itself, along with most of the rest of Pachinger&#x27;s collection, were lost during the chaotic aftermath of World War I.

Two belts have been exhibited at the Musée de Cluny in Paris. The first, a simple velvet-covered hoop and plate of iron, was supposedly worn by Catherine de&#x27; Medici. The other—said to have been worn by Anne of Austria—is a hinged pair of plates held about the waist by metal straps, featuring intricately etched figures of Adam and Eve. There are other such belts at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg and the British Museum in London. Most have been removed from public display to avoid any further embarrassment because the authenticity of these belts as medieval devices has since been called into question. Many contemporary historians accept that these alleged &quot;artifacts&quot; date from the 19th century, and are thus inauthentic.

From the 18th century until the 1930s, masturbation was widely regarded as harmful in Western medicine. Numerous mentions can be found in medical journals of the time of the use of chastity belt-like devices to prevent masturbation in female children and adolescents, as well as women. Many designs for anti-masturbation devices were filed in the US Patent Office until the early 1930s, when masturbation was no longer deemed to be the cause of mental health problems.

Furthermore, some 19th-century working women may have used chastity belts for protective reasons, as a &quot;rape shield&quot; to obstruct sexual assault from predatory bosses or male colleagues; the belts were not worn for a long time uninterruptedly, however, since sanitary and hygiene reasons prevented this before the modern invention of stainless-steel belts. The belt design was the most common but there were also concealed versions worn inside the vagina which were designed to injure the penis.

==Modern usage==

===BDSM===
Chastity belts are sometimes used in BDSM play in consensual relationships. They are a means for the wearer to surrender control over their sexual behavior either for sexual play, or as a long-term method of preventing infidelity or masturbation. They range from simple leather or plastic toys commonly sold by adult stores to expensive high-security stainless steel devices made by a handful of specialist firms. The internet has significantly increased the number of people using chastity devices, with internet advertisements and amateur erotic content sites often serving as the means of discovery of chastity devices and their use. Similarly, the internet has allowed consumers to acquire devices more easily, faster, anonymously, and from a wider range of manufacturers and retailers. Simultaneously, the internet has provided a private avenue for subcultures dedicated to their usage, fostering the culture and allowing individuals with interests in chastity to connect with one another, both on the internet and in-person. 

Although there exists a historical association of chastity belts with women, the male chastity devices market offers more options and diversity compared to what is available for female chastity devices. Among male chastity devices, &quot;cock-and-ball&quot; trap devices are the most popular, followed by typically more secure full belt (around-the-waist) style devices.

===Films and TV===
*In &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, Maid Marian (portrayed by Amy Yasbeck) has a silver-colored Everlast chastity belt revealed by the Sheriff.
*In the Korean film &quot;The Cage&quot; by Lior Shamriz, the protagonist Nick (Kim Wonmok) flees his boss (Won Tae-hee) and crosses the border wearing a pink chastity device.
*&quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; features a scene where Margo (portrayed by Carmen Electra) comes in a golden chastity belt concealed by her dress when she encounters Leonidas for the first time.
*&quot;The Love Guru&quot;: Maurice Pitka (portrayed by Mike Myers) is given a metallic chastity belt at 12 years old with a large metallic elephant head that makes a trumpeting noise when exposed. It clanks and makes a pinging noise when he gets an erection and does not protect his genitalia from pain.
*&quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot;, the second episode of the seventh series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, has Dave Lister (portrayed by Craig Charles) utilize cheat codes to remove the chastity belt of the Queen of Camelot in a medieval fantasy game.
*&quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;: The Five Wives are seen removing their chastity belts, once they have escaped from Immortan Joe and the Citadel.

===Other occurrences===
In 1981, while California State Senator John G. Schmitz was leading hearings on outlawing abortion, Gloria Allred presented him with a chastity belt. Schmitz retaliated in a press release, calling her a &quot;slick butch lawyeress.&quot; She sued him for libel, and eventually secured a settlement of $20,000 and an apology.

In 1998, racial riots against the ethnic Chinese in West Java prompted the production and sale of &quot;anti-rape corsets&quot;. These were Florentine-type belts of imitation leather-covered plastic, fastened with a combination lock. The belts had a solid crotch strap without holes, and were intended only for brief outings.

In April 2002, the Uwe Koetter Jewellers company of Cape Town, South Africa, completed and delivered a diamond and pearl-encrusted chastity belt made of gold to a British customer. The belt reportedly cost R160,000 and was a wedding gift from a husband-to-be for his bride to wear at their wedding.

On February 6, 2004, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that at Athens airport in Greece, a woman&#x27;s steel chastity belt had triggered a security alarm at the metal detector. The woman explained that her husband had forced her to wear the device to prevent an extramarital affair while she was on vacation in Greece. She was allowed to continue her flight to London on the pilot&#x27;s authority. The incident was said to have happened just before Christmas in 2003.

In November 2006, photographs of Lucio Valentini&#x27;s hand-wrought iron chastity belts were published in newspapers including the Seoul Times, and CRI Online. Although Valentini&#x27;s company, MedioEvo, claims that their chastity belts&#x27; designs are from the Middle Ages on their website, a company spokesperson acknowledged that there is no proof that devices such as these were actually used.

In 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission reported that women were being forced to wear chastity belts in the Indian state of Rajasthan.

In 2008, masseuses in Batu, Indonesia were required to wear belts with a lock and key during working hours, to prevent prostitution.

On February 8, 2010, AOL News reported that Dexter Blanch, a dog breeder from Louisiana, introduced a chastity belt for dogs, called PABS (Pet Anti-Breeding System). It is made of polypropylene and uses an eight-buckle locking system and a washable mesh pad to prevent intercourse in female dogs. Kathleen Makolinski, director of veterinary outreach at the ASPCA, commented that &quot;For the majority of animals, spaying and neutering remains the most beneficial option&quot;. While this may be true for dogs being helped by rescues and humane societies, the American Kennel Club subsequently changed its policy regarding pediatric spaying or neutering. Following the research published by UC Davis, the American Kennel Club (AKC) now says that the owner of large breed dogs will have a healthier, longer lived dog if the pet owner would wait until the dog is of appropriate age before spaying or neutering.

On September 19, 2012, &quot;China People&#x27;s Daily&quot; reported that a man in his 50s, naked except for a homemade chastity belt, appeared with a pair of banners in Changchun World Sculpture Park in Jilin province in China, seeking a wife. He stated that he wore the chastity belt to symbolize fidelity to his future wife.

<text>Baudouin (; 7 September 1930 – 31 July 1993) was King of the Belgians from 17 July 1951 until his death in 1993. He was the last Belgian king to be sovereign of the Congo, before it became independent in 1960 and became the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known from 1971 to 1997 as Zaire).

Baudouin was the elder son of King Leopold III (1901–1983) and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden (1905–1935). Because he and his wife, Queen Fabiola, had no children, at Baudouin&#x27;s death the crown passed to his younger brother, King Albert II.

In 2024, the Holy See opened the cause for his canonization, which would give him the posthumous title &quot;Servant of God&quot;.

==Biography==

=== Childhood ===

Prince Baudouin was born on 7 September 1930 at the Château of Stuyvenberg in Laeken, northern Brussels, the elder son and second child of Prince Leopold, then Duke of Brabant, and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. In 1934, Baudouin&#x27;s grandfather King Albert I of Belgium was killed in a rock climbing accident; Leopold became king and the three-year-old Baudouin became Duke of Brabant as heir apparent to the throne. When Baudouin was nearly five, his mother died in 1935 in Switzerland in the accident of an automobile that his father was driving. Later, in 1941, his father remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later became Princess of Réthy). This marriage produced three more children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine (who is also Baudouin&#x27;s goddaughter) and Princess Marie-Esméralda. Baudouin and his siblings had a close relationship with their stepmother and they called her &quot;Mother&quot;. His education began at the age of seven, his tutors taught him half his lessons in French and half in Dutch. He frequently accompanied his father to parades and ceremonies and became well known to the public.

Despite maintaining strict neutrality during the opening months of the Second World War, on 10 May 1940, Belgium was invaded by Nazi Germany. Baudouin, his elder sister Princess Josephine-Charlotte and his younger brother Prince Albert, were immediately sent to France for safety and then to Spain. The Belgian Army, assisted by the French and British, conducted a defensive campaign lasting 18 days, but Leopold, who had taken personal command, surrendered unconditionally on 28 May. Although the Belgian government escaped to form a Belgian government in exile, Leopold elected to remain in Belgium, and was placed under house arrest at the Palace of Laeken, from where he attempted to reach an understanding with the Germans, especially in respect of Belgian prisoners of war who were being held in Germany. The children returned to Laeken from Spain on 6 August.

Leopold had established a royal Scout group at the palace for his sons, whose members were drawn from the various Belgian Scout associations. In April 1943, the wearing of uniforms was banned by the occupation forces and although Leopold was told that the royal group was exempt, insisted that the ban should apply to them too. However, Baudouin was about to be invested as a Scout and persuaded his father to delay the ban for one day so that the ceremony could take place.

Immediately following the Normandy landings in June 1944, the king, his new wife Princess Lilian, and the royal children, were deported to Hirschstein in Germany and then to Strobl in Austria from where they were released in May 1945 by the United States 106th Cavalry Regiment. However, the royal family were prevented from returning to Belgium by the &quot;Royal Question&quot; over whether Leopold had collaborated with the Nazis; the surrender in 1940, his refusal to join the government-in-exile, his fruitless visit to Adolf Hitler at the Berghof in November 1940 and his unconstitutional marriage to Lilian whose father was believed to be pro-Nazi. Until a political solution could be found, the king&#x27;s brother, Prince Charles, became regent and the royal family lived at the Château du Reposoir in Pregny-Chambésy, Switzerland. Baudouin continued his education at a secondary school in Geneva and visited the United States in 1948. 

=== Reign ===

In a referendum in March 1950, the public narrowly voted for King Leopold III to return from Switzerland and he was recalled on 4 June 1950. However, parliamentary dissent and public protests forced Leopold to delegate his powers to Baudouin on 11 August 1950, and finally to abdicate in favour of Baudouin, who took the oath of office as King of the Belgians on 17 July 1951.In 1960, Baudouin declared the Belgian colony of Congo independent. During the parade following the last ceremonial inspection of the Force Publique, the royal sabre of the king was momentarily stolen by Ambroise Boimbo. The photograph, taken by Robert Lebeck, was widely published in world newspapers, with some seeing the act as a humiliation for the king. 

==== Death of Patrice Lumumba ====
During the Congolese declaration of independence, Baudouin delivered a highly contested speech in which he celebrated the acts of the first Belgian owner of the Congo, King Leopold II, whom he described as &quot;a genius&quot;. At the same event, the first democratically elected prime minister of Congo, Patrice Lumumba, gave a blistering response with a speech that was highly critical of the Belgian regime. Lumumba cited the killings of many Congolese, as well as the insults, humiliation and the slavery they experienced.

Lumumba&#x27;s speech infuriated Baudouin and generated significant conflict between the two men. After the independence of Congo, the natural resource-rich Katanga Province orchestrated a secession that received substantial military and financial support from the Belgian government, as well as from Belgian companies with business interests in Katanga. King Baudouin strengthened his relationships with the Katangese politician Moise Tshombé, whom he made a Knight in the Belgian Order of Leopold. In the meantime, Belgium&#x27;s government, as well as the CIA, supported or organized plots to assassinate Lumumba.

In early December 1960, Lumumba and two colleagues, Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, who had planned to assist him in setting up a new government, were imprisoned in military barracks located about from Leopoldville. They were underfed and mistreated, per Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s orders. Lumumba registered his objections, writing directly to Indian and U.N. diplomat Rajeshwar Dayal, &quot;in a word, we are living amid absolutely impossible conditions; moreover, they are against the law&quot;. Lumumba and his associates were released in mid-January 1961. Within hours, they were again captured, transported, beaten, then executed and buried in a shallow grave by Congolese soldiers under Belgian command. Belgian police officer Gerard Soete quickly exhumed, dismembered Lumumba&#x27;s body, and dissolved the corpse in acid.

In 2001, a parliamentary investigation set up by the Belgian government concluded that King Baudouin, amongst others, was informed of the assassination scheme developed by Sese Seko and Tshombé. Both men had conspired with a Belgian colonel, Guy Weber, to &quot;neutralize Lumumba, if possible physically.&quot; The king was informed of the plot, but did nothing to oppose the murder. His lack of intervention was described as &quot;incriminating&quot; by the parliamentary investigation, although there was no conclusive evidence found that the king ordered the specifics of the plans.

==== Western engagements and later reign ====
As the head of state of Belgium, Baudouin, along with French President Charles de Gaulle, were the two prominent world leaders at the state funerals of two American presidents, John F. Kennedy in November 1963 and his predecessor Dwight D. Eisenhower in March 1969. At Kennedy&#x27;s funeral, Baudouin was accompanied by Paul-Henri Spaak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and former three-time Prime Minister of Belgium. At Eisenhower&#x27;s funeral, his next visit to the United States, he was accompanied by Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens.

In 1976, on the occasion of his silver jubilee, the King Baudouin Foundation was formed, with the aim of improving the living conditions of the Belgian people.

== Death and funeral ==
Baudouin died from a heart attack on 31 July 1993, while on holiday at the Villa Astrida in the southern Spanish town of Motril, after a 42-year reign. Although in March 1992 the king had been operated on for a mitral valve prolapse in Paris, his death still came unexpectedly, and sent much of Belgium into a period of deep mourning. His death notably stopped the 1993 24 Hours of Spa sportscar race, which had reached the 15-hour mark when the news broke.

Within hours, the gates and enclosure of the royal palace were covered with flowers that people brought spontaneously. A viewing of the body was held at the Royal Palace in central Brussels; 500,000 people (5% of the population) came to pay their respects. Many waited in line up to 14 hours in sweltering heat to see their king one last time. The funeral service was attended by all other European monarchs – including Queen Elizabeth II (the only state funeral she attended in person as monarch) – alongside Emperor Akihito of Japan. Non-royal guests at the funeral included more than twenty presidents and leaders. Only two reigning heads of state of sovereign states at the time were not invited: Saddam Hussein, and Mobutu, the first due to the Gulf War, the latter due to him being declared persona non grata partly thanks to Mobutu exposing information about Baudouins brother and sister-in-law. The presidents and leaders who did attend the funeral inluded likes such as UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, European Commission President Jacques Delors, French President François Mitterrand, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, German President Richard von Weizsäcker, Polish President Lech Wałęsa, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Canadian Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn and former US President Gerald Ford.

King Baudouin was interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who became King Albert II.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriage ===

On 15 December 1960, Baudouin was married in Brussels to Doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón. Fabiola was a Spanish noblewoman who was working as a nurse. The couple announced their engagement on 16 September 1960 at the Palace of Laeken.

Fabiola began undertaking official engagements immediately, accompanying the king to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Brussels on 26 September 1960, and remained an active queen consort and queen dowager for the remainder of her life, involved in social causes particularly those related to mental health, children&#x27;s issues and women&#x27;s issues.

The king and queen had no children; all of the queen&#x27;s five pregnancies ended in miscarriage.

=== Religion ===
Baudouin was a devout Catholic. Through the influence of Cardinal Leo Suenens, Baudouin participated in the growing Catholic Charismatic Renewal and regularly went on pilgrimages to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paray-le-Monial.

In 1990, when a law submitted by Roger Lallemand and Lucienne Herman-Michielsens that liberalized Belgium&#x27;s abortion laws was approved by Parliament, he refused to give royal assent to the bill. This was unprecedented; although Baudouin was &quot;de jure&quot; Belgium&#x27;s chief executive, royal assent has long been a formality (as is the case in most constitutional and popular monarchies). However, due to his religious convictions—the Catholic Church opposes all forms of abortion—Baudouin asked the government to declare him temporarily unable to reign so that he could avoid signing the measure into law. The government under Wilfried Martens complied with his request on 4 April 1990. According to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution, in the event the king is temporarily unable to reign, the government as a whole assumes the role of head of state. All government members signed the bill, and the next day (5 April 1990) the government called the bicameral legislature in a special session to approve a proposition that Baudouin was capable of reigning again.

He was the 1,176th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain, which was bestowed upon him in 1960, the 927th Knight of the Order of the Garter, bestowed upon him in 1963, and also the last living knight of the Papal Supreme Order of Christ.

==Legacy==
On 29 September 2024, Pope Francis announced during Mass as part of an official visit to Belgium, after visiting the Royal Crypt where Baudouin and Fabiola are buried the day before, his intention to start the procedure towards beatification of the late King.

<doc id="61153" wikidata="Q23106" url="?curid=61153" title="Leicestershire">
<text>Leicestershire ( ) is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands of England. It is bordered by Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the north, Rutland to the east, Northamptonshire to the south-east, Warwickshire to the south-west, and Staffordshire to the west. The city of Leicester is the largest settlement and the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 712,300. Leicester occupies the centre of the county and is by far the largest settlement, with a built-up area population of 357,000. The remainder of the county is largely rural, and the next-largest settlements are Loughborough (65,000), Hinckley (50,000), Market Harborough (24,000) and Coalville (22,000). For local government purposes Leicestershire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with seven districts, and the unitary authority area of Leicester.

Leicestershire is generally a lowland county, characterised by small, rolling hills. It is bisected by the River Soar, which rises near the Warwickshire border south of Hinckley and flows north through Leicester and Loughborough before reaching the Trent at the county boundary. To the west of the river is Charnwood Forest, an upland area which contains Bardon Hill, which at is the county&#x27;s highest point.

There are prehistoric earthworks in the county, and Leicester was a Roman settlement. The region was settled by the Angles in the sixth century and became part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and the county existed at the time of the Domesday Survey in the 1080s. The county has had a relatively settled existence; however, it was the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, which established the Tudor dynasty&#x27;s position as monarchs of England. During the Industrial Revolution the Leicestershire coalfield in the north and west of the county was exploited. Leicester became known for shoemaking, and with Loughborough continues to be a manufacturing centre. In agriculture the county is known for Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies.

==History==

Leicestershire was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) in four wapentakes: Guthlaxton, Framland, Goscote and Gartree. These later became hundreds, with the division of Goscote into West Goscote and East Goscote, and the addition of Sparkenhoe hundred. In 1087, the first recorded use of the name was as &quot;Lægrecastrescir&quot;.

Leicestershire&#x27;s external boundaries have changed little since the Domesday Survey. The Measham-Donisthorpe exclave of Derbyshire has been exchanged for the Netherseal area, and the urban expansion of Market Harborough has caused Little Bowden, previously in Northamptonshire to be annexed. Until 1969, the county&#x27;s legal name was &quot;Leicester&quot; rather than &quot;Leicestershire&quot;, although the latter form was in common usage. In legal contexts the county was usually referred to as the &quot;County of Leicester&quot; where necessary to distinguish between the city and the county. In 1969 the government formally changed the county&#x27;s name to Leicestershire at the county council&#x27;s request.

In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the county borough status of Leicester city and the county status of neighbouring Rutland, converting both to administrative districts of Leicestershire. These actions were reversed on 1 April 1997, when Rutland and the City of Leicester became unitary authorities. Rutland became a distinct Ceremonial County once again, although it continues to be policed by Leicestershire Constabulary.

The symbol of the county council, Leicestershire County Cricket Club and Leicester City FC, is the fox. Leicestershire is considered to be the birthplace of fox hunting as it is known today. Hugo Meynell, who lived in Quorn, is known as the father of fox hunting. Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough have associations with fox hunting, as has neighbouring Rutland.
The flag of Leicestershire features a fox under a cinquefoil—both symbols often associated with Leicestershire. The design was officiated in July 2021 and was England&#x27;s last historic county to have a flag registered.

==Geography==

The River Soar together with its tributaries and canalisations constitutes the principal river basin of the county, although the River Avon and River Welland through Harborough and along the county&#x27;s southern boundaries are also significant. The Soar rises between Hinckley and Lutterworth, towards the south of the county near the Warwickshire border, and flows northwards, bisecting the county along its north–south axis, through &#x27;Greater&#x27; Leicester and then to the east of Loughborough where its course within the county comes to an end. It continues north marking the boundary with Nottinghamshire in the Borough of Rushcliffe for some before joining the River Trent at the point where Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire meet.

The geographical centre of England is in Leicestershire, near Fenny Drayton in the southwest of the county. In 2013, the Ordnance Survey calculated that the point was on land at Lindley Hall Farm. An alternative point at Meriden, around to the southwest, had been considered the traditional centre for more than 500 years.

A large part of the north-west of the county, around Coalville, forms part of the new National Forest area extending into Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The highest point of the county is Bardon Hill at , which is also a Marilyn; with other hilly/upland areas of around and above in nearby Charnwood Forest and also to the east of the county around Launde Abbey. The lowest point, at an altitude of about , is located at the county&#x27;s northernmost tip close to Bottesford where the River Devon flowing through the Vale of Belvoir leaves Leicestershire and enters Nottinghamshire.

==Demographics==

The population of Leicestershire (excluding Leicester Unitary Authority) is 609,578 people (2001 census). The county covers an area of . Its largest population centre is the city of Leicester, followed by the town of Loughborough. Other large towns include Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Coalville, Hinckley, Lutterworth, Market Harborough, Melton Mowbray, Oadby, Shepshed and Wigston.

Some of the larger of villages are: Burbage (population estimated around 16,500 in 2014), Birstall (population 11,400 in 2004), Broughton Astley, Castle Donington, Kibworth Beauchamp (along with Kibworth Harcourt), Great Glen, Ibstock, Countesthorpe and Kegworth. One of the most rapidly expanding villages is Anstey, which has recently seen many development schemes.

==Economy==
===Engineering===
Engineering has long been an important part of the economy of Leicestershire. John Taylor Bellfounders continues a history of bellfounding in Loughborough since the 14th century. In 1881 John Taylors cast the largest bell in Britain, &quot;Great Paul&quot;, for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Norman &amp; Underwood have been making sand cast sheet lead roofing and stained glass since 1825 working on many of England&#x27;s major cathedrals and historic buildings, including Salisbury Cathedral, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, Hampton Court Palace, and Chatsworth House. There were three coal mines that operated in Coalville from the 1820s until 1986. Abbey Pumping Station houses four enormous steam powered beam engines built in Leicester in the 1890s in the Vulcan factory owned by Josiah Gimson, whose son Ernest Gimson was an influential furniture designer and architect of the English Arts and Crafts movement.

Engineering companies today include sports car makers Noble Automotive Ltd in Barwell and Ultima Sports Ltd in Hinckley, Triumph Motorcycles in Hinckley, Jones &amp; Shipman (machine tools), Caterpillar Redford (Plant machinery), Plant manufacturers Metalfacture Ltd (sheet metal work), Richards Engineering (foundry equipment), Transmon Engineering (materials handling equipment), Trelleborg Industrial AVS in Beaumont Leys (industrial suspension components), Parker Plant (quarrying equipment), Aggregate Industries UK (construction materials), Infotec in Ashby-de-la-Zouch (electronic information display boards), Alstec in Whetstone, Leicestershire (airport baggage handling systems), and Brush Traction (railway locomotives) in Loughborough. There are also consultancies (including Pick Everard) in Leicestershire supporting engineering and the built environment. Local commitment to nurturing the upcoming cadre of British engineers includes apprenticeship schemes with local companies, and academic-industrial connections with the engineering departments at Leicester University, De Montfort University and Loughborough University.

The Engineering Innovation Centre and Centre for Excellence for low carbon and fuel cell technologies are both based at Loughborough University. Private sector research and development organisations include PERA—the technology based consultancy in Melton Mowbray, and MIRA—the automotive research and development centre based on the outskirts of Hinckley. Automotive and aerospace engineers use the test facilities at Mallory Park, and Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome and proving ground. On 18 October 2007, the last airworthy Avro Vulcan was flown from Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome after 10 years of restoration there by aerospace engineers of the Vulcan Operating Company.

===Farming===

Leicestershire has a long history of livestock farming which continues today. Robert Bakewell (1725–1795) of Dishley, near Loughborough, was a revolutionary in the field of selective breeding. Bakewell&#x27;s Leicester Longwool sheep was much prized by farmers across the British Empire and is today a heritage breed admired. Commercial and rare breeds associated with the descendants of Bakewell&#x27;s sheep include the English Leicester, Border Leicester, Bluefaced Leicester, Scotch mule and Welsh halfbred.

The Leicestershire County Show is held on the first Bank Holiday in May each year and includes animal showings, trade exhibitions and show jumping. Melton Mowbray Market is an important regional livestock market.

Field sports remain an important part of the rural economy of Leicestershire, with stables, kennels and gunsmiths based in the county.

===Food and drink===
Stilton and Red Leicester cheeses and the pork pie are the three most famous contributions to English cuisine from Leicestershire.

Leicestershire food producers include Claybrooke mill, one of the very few commercially working watermills left in Britain producing a range of over 40 flours; meat from rare and minority breeds from Brockleby&#x27;s; and Christmas turkey and goose from Seldom Seen Farm. Two dairies produce Red Leicester cheese in the county, Long Clawson and the Leicestershire Handmade Cheese Company.

All-natural non-alcoholic fruit cordials and pressed drinks are made by Belvoir Fruit Farms and sold in supermarkets across Britain. Swithland Spring Water is sourced from the Charnwood hills. Breweries in Leicestershire and Rutland are listed on the Leicester CAMRA website. The county&#x27;s largest beer brewer is Everards, and there are several microbreweries.

Various markets are held across the county. Leicester Market is the largest outdoor covered marketplace in Europe and among the products on sale are fruit and vegetables sold by market stallholders, and fresh fish and meat in the Indoor Market.

The annual East Midlands Food &amp; Drink Festival held in Melton Mowbray had over 200 exhibitors and 20,000 visitors attending in 2007 making it the largest British regional food festival.

Food processing in the city and county includes popular British fish and chip shop pie Pukka Pies who are based in Syston. Walkers Midshire Foods, part of the Samworth Brothers group, makes sausages and pies in its Beaumont Leys factories. Samworth Brothers has operations in Leicestershire and Cornwall (Ginsters), making a range of products from sandwiches to desserts for UK retailers under their brands as well the company&#x27;s own portfolio of brands including Dickinson &amp; Morris, producers of pork pies and Melton Hunt Cake. Walkers crisps are made in Beaumont Leys using Lincolnshire potatoes. United Biscuits have their distribution centre in Ashby-de-la-Zouch as well as a snacks factory and they also have a biscuit factory in Wigston. The Masterfoods UK factory at Melton Mowbray produces petfood. Hand made chocolates are produced by Chocolate Perfection in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

Some 15 major Indian food manufacturers are based in Leicester including Sara Foods, Mayur Foods, Cofresh Snack Foods Ltd, Farsan, Apni Roti and Spice n Tice. The &#x27;Mithai&#x27; Indian sweet market is catered for by award-winning Indian restaurants—for instance, the vegetable samosas approved by the Vegetarian Society sold at The Sharmilee on Belgrave Road in the Belgrave area of Leicester. The growing market for Indian food has afforded new opportunities to long-standing local companies, for example the Long Clawson dairy, a co-operative manufacturer of Stilton (cheese) now also makes Paneer cheese used in the Indian dish Mattar Paneer.

Leicestershire food exported abroad includes cheese from the Long Clawson dairy, which is sold in supermarkets in Canada and the United States via a network of distributors coordinated by Taunton-based company Somerdale. Belvoir Fruit Farms cordials and pressé drinks are sold on the United States east coast in Wegmans Food Markets, World Market, Harris Teeter, Dean &amp; DeLuca, and in specialised British food stores such as Myers of Keswick (New York City) and the British Pantry (near Washington, D.C.).

===Clothing===

Leicester and Leicestershire has had a traditional industry of knitwear, hosiery and footwear, and the sheep on the county&#x27;s coat of arms is recognition of this. The local manufacturing industry, which began with hand knitting in the Middle Ages, and was fully industrialised by the end of the 19th century, survived until the end of the 20th century through retailers buying UK-sourced products, and government measures such as the protection of the Multi Fibre Arrangement which ended in 2004. Cheaper global competition, coupled with the 1999 slump in the UK fashion retail sector, led to the end of much of the cheaper clothing manufacturing industry. Today Leicestershire companies focus on high quality clothing and speciality textiles.

Other local companies manufacture knitwear such as Commando Knitwear of Wigston, and others specialise in technical textiles for industrial or medical purposes. Clothing and fabric for the British Asian community is made here—for example the shop Saree Mandir sells silk sarees and salwar suits for women whose design patterns closely follow contemporary Indian trends. The Knitting Industries&#x27; Federation continues to be based in Leicestershire. On the creative side the design centre for next is headquartered in Enderby, and the design centre for George Clothing (Asda/Walmart) is in Lutterworth. De Montfort University has, in the form of its Fashion and Contour Design course a leading design department for female underwear. It also has the only UK University courses in Footwear Design providing future designers for local shoemakers Shoefayre, Stead and Simpson, and Shoe Zone, who all have their headquarters in the county.

Gola also originates from the county.

===Healthcare===

University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust employs around 11,000 at its three hospitals in the city and county, the Glenfield, the General and the Royal Infirmary. Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust employs over 5,500 staff providing mental health, learning disability and community health services in the city and county. These services are commissioned by the three Clinical Commissioning Groups, led by local GPs.
The British Psychological Society, the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) based in Wigston, and the National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health (NEBOSH) have their head offices in Leicestershire.

===Biomedical industries===
Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical instrument manufacturing companies include 3M, Bridgehead International in Melton, Fisher Scientific in Loughborough, and Ashfield Healthcare in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

===Freight and distribution===
Transportation links are good. East Midlands Airport is south of Castle Donington, next to the M1 in north-west Leicestershire, and is the second largest freight airport in the United Kingdom after London Heathrow. DHL Aviation have a large purpose-built facility at EMA, and courier companies UPS and TNT also use the airport as a base. Lufthansa Cargo is also a regular user of East Midlands, and the airport is a primary hub for Royal Mail. The M1 is Leicestershire&#x27;s other important transport hub. The start of the M6, and part of the A14 briefly intersect with the southern tip of Leicestershire. Many large retail companies have huge warehouses at the Magna Park complex near Lutterworth. The Widdowson Group make use of J21a of the M1 to provide warehousing, transportation, freight forwarding, garage services and LGV/HGV training. Pall-Ex of Ellistown provide automated palletised freight distribution services from their location off Junction 22 of the M1. The Midland Main Line provides important connections to Yorkshire and London, and the Birmingham–Stansted Line is essentially Leicestershire&#x27;s east–west connection from Hinckley to Melton.

==Governance==

For lieutenancy purposes, Leicestershire consists of the non-metropolitan county and the City of Leicester.

For administrative purposes, most of the county is run by the Leicestershire County Council, though the City of Leicester is run independently by the Leicester City Council. The non-metropolitan county is divided into seven districts ran by district councils: The seven district councils in Leicestershire are Blaby, Charnwood, Harborough, Hinckley &amp; Bosworth, Melton, North West Leicestershire and Oadby &amp; Wigston. It has been proposed by the Leicestershire County Council in 2018 to get rid of the district councils.

Leicestershire County Council consists of 55 elected members, from 52 wards. The most recent election was the May 2017 elections, where all seats were up for re-election. Following these elections the current political composition of the council is 42 Conservatives, 9 Liberal Democrats and 4 Labour councillors.

County Hall, in Glenfield, some north-west of central Leicester and a little over from Leicester railway station, is the seat of Leicestershire County Council and the headquarters of the county authority. Below the County Council, there are seven district councils, Blaby, Charnwood, Harborough, Hinckley and Bosworth, Melton, North West Leicestershire and Oadby and Wigston. The City of Leicester is a unitary authority which is separate from the county for local government, and provides all services in its area; the City Council meets at Leicester Town Hall.

=== Parliamentary constituencies ===
Following the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Leicestershire is represented by eleven members of parliament (MPs). Labour Party won three seats within the City of Leicester in 2019, but ended up losing two, Leicester East was won by Conservative and Leicester South was won by an Independent politician. Labour however gained two seats back in Leicestershire from the Conservatives in Loughborough and North West Leicestershire. The other six Leicestershire seats are represented by Conservative MPs.


== Education ==

Publicly funded secondary schools in Leicestershire are comprehensive. The schools are segregated by age in some areas to ages 10–14 (middle schools), and 14–16 (upper schools) or 14–18 (upper schools which also provide sixth-form education). The schools, compared with other LEAs, have large numbers on the roll with school enrolment often 2,000 and more. For Melton and Blaby districts, although there is division by middle and upper schools, there is only one upper school in either district, giving no choice of school. However, many students of Lutterworth College in Harborough District actually hail from Blaby district.

Charnwood has the largest school population—four times the size of the Melton district. In 2007, the best-performing state school at GCSE was Beauchamp College in Oadby. No comprehensives in Leicestershire LEA were rated as poor performers, unlike in some neighbouring counties. In 2007, 7,800 pupils took GCSE exams.

For A-levels, the best comprehensive school in the county was the De Lisle College in Loughborough. The best schools overall at A-level were the two private single-sex schools in Loughborough—Loughborough Grammar School and Loughborough High School.

<text>Étienne-Louis Boullée (; 12 February 17284 February 1799) was a visionary French neoclassical architect whose work greatly influenced contemporary architects.

== Life ==
Born in Paris, he studied under Jacques-François Blondel, Germain Boffrand and Jean-Laurent Le Geay, from whom he learned the mainstream French Classical architecture in the 17th and 18th century and the Neoclassicism that evolved after the mid century. He was elected to the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture in 1762 and became chief architect to Frederick II of Prussia, a largely honorary title. He designed a number of private houses from 1762 to 1778, though most of these no longer exist; notable survivors into the modern era include the Hôtel de Brunoy (demolished in 1930) and the Hôtel Alexandre, both in Paris. His work for François Racine de Monville has apparently also vanished but his probable influence on Monville&#x27;s own architectural works as seen at the Désert de Retz speaks for itself. Together with Claude Nicolas Ledoux, he was one of the most influential figures of French neoclassical architecture.

== Geometric style ==
It was as a teacher and theorist at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées between 1778 and 1788 that Boullée made his biggest impact, developing a distinctive abstract geometric style inspired by Classical forms. His work was characterised by the removal of all unnecessary ornamentation, inflating geometric forms to a huge scale and repeating elements such as columns in huge ranges.

For Boullée regularity, symmetry and variety were the golden rules of architecture.
==Cenotaph for Sir Isaac Newton==
Boullée promoted the idea of making architecture expressive of its purpose, a doctrine that his detractors termed &quot;architecture parlante&quot; (&quot;talking architecture&quot;), which was an essential element in Beaux-Arts architectural training in the later 19th century. His style was most notably exemplified in his proposal for a cenotaph (a funerary monument celebrating a figure interred elsewhere) for the English scientist Isaac Newton, who 50 years after his death became a symbol of Enlightenment ideas.

The building itself was a tall sphere, taller than the Great Pyramids of Giza, encompassed by two large barriers circled by hundreds of cypress trees. The massive, spherical shape of the building was inspired by Boullée&#x27;s own study called &quot;theory of bodies&quot; where he claims that the most beautiful and perfect natural body is the sphere, which is the most prominent element of the Newton Memorial. Though the structure was never built, Boullée had many ink and wash drawings engraved and circulated widely within professional circles in 1784.

The small sarcophagus for Newton would have been placed at the lower pole of the sphere. The design of the memorial was intended to create the effect of day and night. The night effect would have occurred when the sarcophagus is illuminated by the sunlight coming through the holes in the vaulting, giving the illusion of stars in the night sky. The day effect would have been provided via an armillary sphere hanging in the center that gives off a mysterious glow. Thus, the use of light in the building&#x27;s design would have caused the building&#x27;s interior to change its appearance.

==Salon for the Hôtel de Tourolles==
The boiseries, still often dated in the mid-1760s, were discussed in the issue of &quot;L&#x27;Avant-coureur&quot; for 21 January 1761, and so must have been carried out about 1758–59. The Hôtel in the Marais district remodelled for Claude-Charles-Dominique Tourolle survives (the rue d&#x27;Orléans is now the rue Charlot) but the salon&#x27;s &quot;boiseries&quot; and chimneypieces were removed in the mid-nineteenth century to a house in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré now in the possession of the Cercle Interallié. Round-arched mirrors over the chimneypieces and centering the long wall in a shallow recess are disposed in a system of stop-fluted Ionic pilasters. White marble draped caryatid therm figures support the chimneypiece&#x27;s &quot;tablette&quot;. There is a full architrave under a dentilled cornice. The white-and-gold ensemble would still have been fully in style in 1790.

==Hôtel Alexandre==

The Hôtel Alexandre or Hôtel Soult, rue de la Ville l&#x27;Évêque, Paris (1763–1766), is the sole survivor of Boullée&#x27;s residential work in Paris. It was built for the financier André-Claude-Nicolas Alexandre. In its &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; four Ionic columns embedded against a recess in the wall plane create an entry (now glazed). Flanking doors in the corners of the courtyard have isolated architraves embedded in the wall above their plain openings, while above oval bull&#x27;s-eye windows are draped with the swags of husks that became a common feature of the neoclassical manner. The garden front has a colossal order of pilasters raised on the high basement occupied by the full height of the ground floor.

== Legacy ==
Boullée&#x27;s ideas had a major influence on his contemporaries, not least because of his role in teaching other important architects such as Jean Chalgrin, Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart, and Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. Some of his work only saw the light of day in the 20th century; his book &quot;Architecture, essai sur l&#x27;art&quot; (&quot;Essay on the Art of Architecture), arguing for an emotionally committed Neoclassicism, was only published in 1953. The volume contained his work from 1778 to 1788, which mostly comprised designs for public buildings on a wholly impractical grand scale.

Boullée&#x27;s fondness for grandiose designs has caused him to be characterised as both a megalomaniac and a visionary. His focus on polarity (offsetting opposite design elements) and the use of light and shadow was highly innovative, and continues to influence architects to this day. He was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the 20th century and has influenced recent architects such as Aldo Rossi.

Peter Greenaway&#x27;s film &quot;The Belly of an Architect&quot; (1987) concerns a fictitious architect who is staging an exhibition devoted to Boullée&#x27;s work. The film contains many visual references to Boullée.

What Dreams May Come (1998) features a Library inspired by Boullée&#x27;s 1785 &quot;Deuxieme Projet pour la Bibliothèque du Roi&quot;

Ethel Cain&#x27;s song &quot;Etienne&quot;, from the studio record &quot;Perverts&quot; (2025), is named after Boullée. Cain has stated that the song &quot;was [her] ode to him&quot;, paying tribute to his life and work.

<text>The president of the Republic of China, also known as the president of Taiwan, is the head of state of the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces. Before 1949 the position had the authority of ruling over Mainland China, but after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the remaining jurisdictions of the ROC have been limited to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and smaller islands.

Originally elected by the National Assembly, the presidency was intended to be a ceremonial office with no real executive power because the ROC was originally envisioned as a parliamentary republic. Since the 1996 election however, the president has been directly elected by plurality voting to a four-year term, with incumbents limited to serving two terms. The current president is Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, preceded by Tsai Ing-wen from the same party.

==Qualifications==
*The &quot;Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act&quot; states that a candidate for president or vice president must be a citizen of the Republic of China, at least 40 years old, and a resident of the Taiwan Area for a period of no less than 15 years with a physical presence of no less than 6 consecutive months. 
* The following persons shall not be registered as candidates for the president:
** Military personnel
** Election officials
** People who hold foreign nationality or who do not reside in the Free Area of the Republic of China
** People who have restored their nationality or acquired their nationality by naturalization

==Powers==
The president is currently elected for a term of four years by a plurality voting direct election of areas administered by the Republic of China. Before 1991, the president was selected by the National Assembly of the Republic of China for a term of six years.

The Constitution of the Republic of China names the president as head of state and commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces (formerly the National Revolutionary Army). The president is responsible for conducting foreign relations, such as concluding treaties, declaring war, and making peace. The president must promulgate all laws and has no right to veto, but can approve or decline a veto proposed by the Executive Yuan (Cabinet). Other powers of the president include granting amnesty, pardon or clemency, declaring martial law, and conferring honors and decorations.

The president may, by resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, issue emergency decrees and take all necessary measures to avert imminent danger affecting the security of the state or of the people or to cope with any serious financial or economic crisis. However, such decrees shall, within ten days of issuance, be presented to the Legislative Yuan for ratification. Should the Legislative Yuan withhold ratification, said emergency decrees are rendered invalid.

The president may, within ten days following passage by the Legislative Yuan of a no-confidence vote against the premier, dissolve the Legislative Yuan after consulting with its president. However, the president may not dissolve the Legislative Yuan while martial law or an emergency decree is in effect. Following a dissolution of the Legislative Yuan, an election for legislators must be held within 60 days.

The president can also appoint senior advisors (), national policy advisors () and strategy advisors (), but they do not form a council.

The Constitution does not clearly define whether the president is more powerful than the premier, as it names the Executive Yuan (headed by the premier) as the &quot;highest administrative authority&quot; with oversight over domestic matters, while giving the president powers as commander-in-chief of the military and authority over foreign affairs. Prior to his election as president in 1948, Chiang Kai-shek had insisted that he be premier under the new Constitution, while allowing the presidency (to which he nominated Hu Shih) be reduced to a figurehead role. However, the National Assembly overwhelmingly supported Chiang as president and once in this position, Chiang continued to exercise vast prerogatives as leader, and the premiership served to execute policy, not make it. Thus, until the 1980s, power in the Republic of China was personalized rather than institutionalized, which meant presidential power depended largely on who occupied the office. For example, Yen Chia-kan was a mostly ceremonial president, with real power in the hands of Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo, who carried said power with him to the office of president. After President Lee Teng-hui succeeded Chiang as president in 1988, the power struggle within the KMT extended to constitutional debate over the relationship between the president and the premier. The first three premiers under Lee (Yu Kuo-hwa, Lee Huan, and Hau Pei-tsun) were mainlanders who had initially opposed Lee&#x27;s ascent to power. The appointments of Lee Huan and Hau were compromises by President Lee to placate KMT conservatives. The subsequent appointment of the first native Taiwanese premier, Lien Chan, was seen as Lee consolidating power. Moreover, during this time the power of the premier to approve the presidential appointments, and the power of the Legislative Yuan to confirm the president&#x27;s choice of premier, were removed. This established the president as the more powerful official.

After the 2000 election of Chen Shui-bian as president, the presidency and Legislative Yuan were controlled by different parties, which brought forth a number of latent constitutional issues, such as the role of the Legislative Yuan in appointing and dismissing a premier, the right of the president to call a special session of the Legislative Yuan, and exactly who has the power to call a referendum. Most of these issues have been resolved through inter-party negotiations.

==Succession==
The Constitution of the Republic of China gives a short list of persons who will succeed to the presidency if the office were to fall vacant. According to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, Article 2:

As no president of the Executive Yuan (also known as the premier) has ever succeeded to the presidency under these provisions (or their predecessors, under Article 49), it is untested whether, should the office of the premier be vacant as well, whether, pursuant to the Additional Articles, Article 3, the vice president of the Executive Yuan (vice premier), who would be acting premier, would act as president. There is currently no constitutional provision for a succession list beyond the possibility that the vice president of the Executive Yuan might succeed to the presidency.

Assuming that the vice president of the Executive Yuan would be third in line for the presidency, the current line of succession is:
# Hsiao Bi-khim, Vice President of the Republic of China.
# Cho Jung-tai, President of the Executive Yuan.
# Cheng Li-chun, Vice President of the Executive Yuan.

Presidential succession has occurred three times under the 1947 Constitution:
#President Chiang Kai-shek declared incapacity on 21 January 1949 amid several Communist victories in the Chinese Civil War and was replaced by Vice President Li Zongren as the acting president. However, Chiang continued to wield authority as the director-general of the Kuomintang and commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces. Li Zongren lost the ensuing power struggle and fled to the United States in November 1949. Chiang evacuated with the government to Taiwan on 10 December 1949 and resumed his duties as the president on 1 March 1950.
#President Chiang Kai-shek died on 5 April 1975 and was replaced by Vice President Yen Chia-kan, who served out the remainder of the term.
#President Chiang Ching-kuo died on 13 January 1988 and was replaced by Vice President Lee Teng-hui, who served out the remainder of the term and won two more terms on his own right.

==Diplomatic protocol==

The diplomatic protocol regarding the President of the ROC is rather complex because of the political status of Taiwan. In the nations that have diplomatic relations with the ROC, the president is accorded the standard treatment that is given to a head of state. In other nations, the president is formally a private citizen, although even in these cases, travel usually meets with strong objections from the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The president of ROC has traveled several times to the United States, formally in transit to and from Central America, where a number of countries do recognize the ROC. This system allows the president to visit the United States without the US State Department having to issue a visa. During these trips, the president is not formally treated as a head of state, does not meet US government officials in their official capacities, and does not visit Washington, D.C. However, in these visits, the ROC president invariably meets with staff members from the US government, although these visits are with lower-ranking officials in non-governmental surroundings.

In the area of Southeast Asia, the ROC president was able to arrange visits in the early 1990s which were formally private tourist visits. However, these have become increasingly infrequent as a result of PRC pressure.

At the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders&#x27; summit, the ROC president is forbidden from attending personally, and must send a special envoy to represent them at the event.

However, on 2 December 2016, US President-elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the ROC president, a clear break from prior protocol.
The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and its media uses the terms Leader of the Taiwan Area, Leader of the Taiwan Region () and Leader of the Taiwanese Authorities () to describe Taiwan&#x27;s head of state. These terms are used by the media in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to reflect the PRC&#x27;s official stance of not recognizing the legitimacy of Taiwan as a country, or of Two Chinas. If the official title cannot be avoided in a news article, quotation marks would be used around terms for all official ROC positions and organizations.

==Secretary-general to the president==
The secretary-general to the president is the highest-ranking official in the Office of the President and supervises the staff of the office. The current secretary-general is Pan Men-an.

==Symbols==

The president&#x27;s podium bears the symbol of a golden plum blossom surrounded by wreath laurel on front side. 

The , officially called the Commander-in-Chief Standard of the Republic of China, is the symbol of the President as head the Republic of China Armed Forces. The Standard is a rectangular, red field with a thin, yellow border. In the center of the red field is the national emblem of the Republic of China. The Standard is flown from the Presidential Office, as well as other buildings for the president’s use; facilities for presidential visits; transportation vehicles when used by the president; and in other ceremonial contexts. The Standard was designed by Chiang Kai-shek in 1928, based on the flag of Whampoa Military Academy, which was in turn designed by Ho Ying-chin in 1924, and revised in 1988.

The is square, and its inscription is written in seal script (). It is written vertically in two columns, with the right-hand line containing the characters (&quot;Zǒngtǒng&quot;), and the left-hand line containing the characters (&quot;Zhīyìn&quot;).

==Elections==

==History==
Taiwan was previously led by the emperor of Japan during colonial rule by Japan from 1895 to 1945, represented by the governor-general of Taiwan.

After the outbreak of the Wuchang Uprising against Qing rule in 1911, the revolutionaries elected Sun Yat-sen as the &quot;provisional president&quot; () of the transitional government, with the Republic of China officially established on 1 January 1912. But Sun soon resigned from the provisional presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai, who assumed the title &quot;Great President&quot; () in March 1912. Yuan induced the Last Emperor to abdicate, ending thousands of years of imperial rule in China. The 1913 Constitution called for a strong presidential system with notable checks on the president by the National Assembly. However, Yuan soon began to assert dictatorial power, ignoring the National Assembly and later abolishing it altogether. In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China in a largely unpopular move and was forced to retract his declaration shortly before his death in 1916.

With Yuan Shikai&#x27;s death the Warlord Era began. Vice President Li Yuanhong succeeded Yuan as president and attempted to reassert the constitutional government, but was soon forced to resign by military strongmen. The presidency, though leading an internationally recognized government, was thereafter to be headed by a series of prominent warlords. This presidency ended in 1928 when the Northern Expedition, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), succeeded in conquering North China.

Sun Yat-sen established a rival (military, not constitutional) government in Guangzhou in 1917 and took the title of &quot;Generalissimo of the Military Government&quot; (). He was ousted in 1918 but returned again to Guangzhou in 1921. Claiming to restore the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, he summoned the members of the original parliament to elect him as president, but since there lacked a quorum, he took the title of &quot;Extraordinary President&quot; (). Sun, again expelled from Guangzhou in 1922, returned in 1923 to take the title of &quot;Generalissimo of the Military Government.&quot; Sun died in 1925 with no clear successor and leadership of the government, now named the National Government, rested in a series of Leninist-style dual party and state committees, the most powerful of which was the policy-making Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The government was organized into five branches, with the Executive Yuan, headed by the premier, holding primary administrative authority. The &quot;Chairman of the National Government&quot;, though not given specific presidential powers, took on the functions of a &quot;de facto&quot; head of state and its official English translation was &quot;President of the National Government of the Republic of China&quot;. This form of government under the KMT lasted through the Northern Expedition, which moved the capital to Nanjing and gave the National Government domestic control and foreign recognition, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which the Japanese established a puppet &quot;Reorganized&quot; National Government with almost the identical organizational structure, until the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1947.

Following the Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the National Government under Chiang Kai-shek was restored in Nanjing and the KMT set out to enact a liberal democratic constitution in line with the last stage of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s three stages of national development. The new Constitution of the Republic of China, promulgated on 25 December 1947, established a five-branch government with the office of president () as head of state. On 20 May 1948, Chiang Kai-shek was formally elected by the National Assembly to be the first term president.

After the KMT lost mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, the government was evacuated to Taiwan, where the term limits for the president specified in the 1947 constitution were suspended after 1960. In 1954, as the term of the first National Assembly were about to expire, the Judicial Yuan ruled that the expired seats of the National Assembly would continue in power until the respective delegate region elections could be held. This largely froze the membership of the National Assembly mainland delegates and prevented local Taiwanese from widespread legislative and assembly participation in the expired mainland seats until the early 1970s. The members of the National Assembly continued in their office until 1991, and continued to elect Chiang Kai-shek as president until his death in 1975.

Presidents were elected by the National Assembly until the first direct presidential election in 1996, while the term length was shortened from six to four years.

<text>Chiang Ching-kuo (, 27 April 1910 – 13 January 1988) was a politician of the Republic of China. The eldest and only biological son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he held numerous posts in the government of the Republic of China and ended martial law in 1987. He served as the 3rd premier of the Republic of China between 1972 and 1978 and was president of the Republic of China from 1978 until his death in 1988.

Born in Zhejiang, Ching-kuo was sent as a teenager to study in the Soviet Union during the First United Front in 1925, when his father&#x27;s Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party were in alliance. Before his education in the USSR, he attended school in Shanghai and Beijing, where he became interested in socialism and communism. He attended university in the USSR and spoke Russian fluently, but when the Chinese Nationalists violently broke with the Communists, Joseph Stalin sent him to work in a steel factory in the Ural Mountains. There, Chiang met and married Faina Vakhreva. With war between China and Japan imminent in 1937, Stalin sent the couple to China. During the war, Ching-kuo&#x27;s father gradually came to trust him, and gave him more and more responsibilities, including administration.

After the Japanese surrender, Ching-kuo was tasked with and effectively reduced corruption in Shanghai. The victory of the Communists in 1949 drove the Chiang family and their ROC government to retreat to Taiwan. Ching-kuo was first given control of the secret police, a position he retained until 1965 and in which he used arbitrary arrests and torture to ensure tight control as part of the White Terror. He then became Minister of Defense (1965–1969), Vice-Premier (1969–1972) and Premier (1972–1978). After his father&#x27;s death in 1975, he took leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) as chairman, and was elected president in 1978 and again in 1984.

Under his tenure as president, the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan, while remaining authoritarian, became more open and tolerant of political dissent. Chiang courted Taiwanese voters, and reduced the preference for those who came from the mainland after the WWII. Toward the end of his life, Chiang decided to relax government controls on the media and speech, and allowed Han born in Taiwan into positions of power, including his eventual successor Lee Teng-hui. He was the last president of the Republic of China to be born during the rule of the Qing dynasty. Ching-kuo was credited for his Soviet-inspired city planning policies, economic development with Ten Major Construction Projects in Taiwan, efforts to clamp down on corruption, as well as the democratic transition of Taiwan and gradually shifting away from the authoritarian dictatorial rule of his own father Chiang Kai-shek.

==Biography==
===Early life===

The son of Chiang Kai-shek and his first wife, Mao Fumei, Chiang Ching-kuo was born in Fenghua, Zhejiang, with the courtesy name of Jiànfēng (). He had an adopted brother, Chiang Wei-kuo. &quot;Ching&quot; literally means &quot;longitude&quot;, while &quot;kuo&quot; means &quot;nation&quot;; in his brother&#x27;s name, &quot;wei&quot; literally means &quot;parallel (of latitude)&quot;. The names are inspired by the references in Chinese classics such as the &quot;Guoyu&quot;, in which &quot;to draw the longitudes and latitudes of the world&quot; is used as a metaphor for a person with great abilities, especially in managing a country.

While the young Chiang Ching-kuo had a good relationship with his mother and grandmother (who were deeply rooted to their Buddhist faith), his relationship with his father was strict, utilitarian and often rocky. Chiang Kai-shek appeared to his son as an authoritarian figure, sometimes indifferent to his problems. Even in personal letters between the two, Chiang Kai-shek would sternly order his son to improve his Chinese calligraphy. From 1916 until 1919 Chiang Ching-kuo attended the &quot;Grammar School&quot; in &quot;Wushan Temple&quot; an important temple in Xikou Town. Then, in 1920, his father hired tutors to teach him the Four Books, the central texts of Confucianism. On 4 June 1921, Ching-kuo&#x27;s grandmother died. What might have been an immense emotional loss was compensated for when Chiang Kai-shek moved the family to Shanghai. Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s stepmother, historically known as the Chiang family&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Mother&quot;, went with them. During this period Chiang Kai-shek concluded that Chiang Ching-kuo was a son to be taught, while Chiang Wei-kuo was a son to be loved.

During his time in Shanghai, Chiang Ching-kuo was supervised by his father and made to write a weekly letter of 200–300 Chinese characters. Chiang Kai-shek also underlined the importance of classical books and of learning English, two areas he was hardly proficient in himself. On 20 March 1924, Chiang Ching-kuo was able to present to his now-nationally famous father a proposal concerning the grass-roots organization of the rural population in Xikou. Chiang Ching-kuo planned to provide free education to allow people to read and to write at least 1000 characters. In his own words:
I have a suggestion to make about the Wushan School, although I do not know if you can agree to it. My suggestion is that the school establish a night school for common people who cannot afford to go to the regular school. My school established a night school with great success. I can tell you something about the night school:
Name: Wuschua School for the Common People
Tuition fee: Free of charge with stationery supplied
Class hours: 7 pm to 9 pm
Age limit: 14 or older
Schooling protocol: 16 or 20 weeks.
At the time of the graduation, the trainees will be able to write simple letters and keep simple accounts. They will be issued a diploma if they pass the examinations. The textbooks they used were published by the Commercial Press and were entitled &quot;One thousand characters for the common people.&quot; I do not know whether you will accept my suggestion. If a night school is established at Wushan, it will greatly benefit the local people.
In early 1925, Chiang entered Shanghai&#x27;s Pudong College, but Chiang Kai-shek decided to send him on to Beijing because of warlord action and spontaneous student protests in Shanghai. In Beijing, he attended the school organized by a friend of his father, Wu Zhihui, a renowned scholar and linguist. The school combined classical and modern approaches to education. While there, Ching-kuo started to identify himself as a &quot;progressive revolutionary&quot; and participated in the flourishing social scene inside the young Communist community. The idea of studying in Moscow now seized his imagination. Within the help program provided by the Soviet Union to the countries of East Asia there was a training school that later became the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. The participants to the university were selected by the CPSU and KMT members, with a participation of CPC Central Committee.

Chiang Ching-kuo asked Wu Zhihui to name him as a KMT candidate. Wu did not try to dissuade him, even though Wu was a key figure of the right-leaning and anti-Communist &quot;Western Hills Group&quot; of the KMT. In the summer of 1925, Chiang Ching-kuo traveled south to Whampoa Military Academy to discuss his plans for study in Moscow with his father. Chiang Kai-shek was not keen, but after a discussion with Chen Guofu he finally agreed. In a 1996 interview, Ch&#x27;en&#x27;s brother, Chen Li-fu, recalled that Chiang Kai-shek accepted the plan because of the need to have Soviet support at a time when his hold over the KMT was tenuous.

===Moscow===
With or without his father&#x27;s enthusiastic approval, Chiang Ching-kuo went on to Moscow in late 1925. He stayed in the Soviet Union for nearly twelve years. While there, Chiang was given the Russian name Nikolai Vladimirovich Elizarov (Николай Владимирович Елизаров) and put under the tutelage of Karl Radek at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. Noted for having an exceptional grasp of international politics, his classmates included other children of influential Chinese families, most notably the future Chinese Communist party leader, Deng Xiaoping. Chiang Ching-kuo joined the Communist Youth League under Deng. Soon Ching-kuo was an enthusiastic student of Communist ideology, particularly Trotskyism; though following the Great Purge, Joseph Stalin privately met with him and ordered him to publicly denounce Trotskyism. Chiang even applied to be a member of the All-Union Communist Party, although his request was denied.

In April 1927, however, Chiang Kai-shek purged KMT leftists, had Communists arrested or killed, and expelled his Soviet advisers. Chiang Ching-kuo responded from Moscow with an editorial that harshly criticized his father&#x27;s actions but was nonetheless detained as a &quot;guest&quot; of the Soviet Union, a practical hostage. The historiographic debate still continues as to whether he was forced to write the editorial, but he had seen Trotskyist friends arrested and killed by the Soviet secret police. The Soviet government sent him to work in the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, a steel factory in the Urals, Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk), where he met Faina Ipat&#x27;evna Vakhreva, a native Belarusian. They married on 15 March 1935, and she would later take the Chinese name Chiang Fang-liang. In December of that year, their son, Hsiao-wen was born.

Chiang Kai-shek refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for a Chinese Communist Party leader. He wrote in his diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.&quot; In 1937, he maintained that &quot;I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation&#x27;s interests&quot;, since he had no intention of stopping the war against the Communists.

===Return to China and WWII===
Stalin allowed Chiang Ching-kuo to return to China with his Belarusian wife and son in April 1937 after living in the USSR for 12 years.

By then, the NRA under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong had signed a ceasefire to create the Second United Front and fight the Japanese invasion of China, which began in July 1937. Stalin hoped the Chinese would keep Japan from invading the Soviet Pacific coast, and he hoped to form an anti-Japanese alliance with the senior Chiang.

On Ching-kuo&#x27;s return, his father assigned a tutor, Hsu Dau-lin, to assist with his readjustment to China. Chiang Ching-kuo was appointed as a specialist in remote districts of Jiangxi where he was credited with training of cadres and fighting corruption, opium consumption, and illiteracy. Chiang Ching-kuo was appointed as commissioner of Gannan Prefecture () between 1939 and 1945; there he banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the &quot;Gannan New Deal&quot; (). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a &quot;public information desk&quot; where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942.

In regard to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children&#x27;s Village () in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium. During the last years of the 1930s, he met Wang Sheng, with whom he would remain close for the next 50 years.

The paramilitary &quot;Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps&quot; was under Chiang&#x27;s control. Chiang used the term &quot;big bourgeoisie&quot;, in a disparaging manner to call H.H. Kung and T. V. Soong.

While in mainland China, Chiang and his wife had a daughter, Hsiao-chang, born in Nanchang (1938), and two more sons, Hsiao-wu, born in Chongqing (1945), and Hsiao-yung, born in Shanghai (1948).

===Relationship with Chang Ya-juo and her death===
Chiang met Chang Ya-juo when she was working at a training camp for enlistees and he was serving as the head of Gannan Prefecture during the war. The two had a relationship that brought twin sons: Chang Hsiao-tz&#x27;u and Chang Hsiao-yen, born in 1942. In August 1942, Chang felt sick at a dinner party, and died the next day in a Guilin hospital. The circumstances of her death raised speculation that it was murder. Over the years, many of her relatives, including her sons and highly ranked ex-security personnel, insisted that KMT&#x27;s security apparatus orchestrated her murder to keep a lid on CCK&#x27;s marital affair, and to protect CCK&#x27;s political career.

===Hostage claim===
Jung Chang and Jon Halliday claim Chiang Kai-shek allowed the Communists to escape on the 1934–1935 Long March because he wanted Stalin to return Chiang Ching-kuo. This is contradicted by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.&quot; He refused to negotiate for a prisoner swap of his son in exchange for the Chinese Communist Party leader (Zhou Enlai). Again in 1937 he stated about his son: &quot;I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation&#x27;s interests.&quot; Chiang had absolutely no intention of stopping the war against the Communists. 
Chang and Halliday likewise claim that Chiang Ching-kuo was &quot;kidnapped&quot; in spite of the evidence that he went to study in the Soviet Union with his father&#x27;s own approval.

===Economic policies in Shanghai===
After the Second Sino-Japanese War and during the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo briefly served as a liaison administrator in Shanghai, trying to eradicate the corruption and hyperinflation that plagued the city. He was determined to do this because of the fears arising from the Nationalists&#x27; increasing lack of popularity during the Civil War. Given the task of arresting dishonest businessmen who hoarded supplies for profit during the inflationary spiral, he attempted to assuage the business community by explaining that his team would only go after big war profiteers.

Chiang Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay in the Soviet Union, to start a social revolution by attacking middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the Proletariat.

Chiang Ching-kuo used his own agents to make arrests in Shanghai, rather than the Shanghai city police. Chiang Ching-kuo relied on two relatively new organizations which answered directly to him. He used the Sixth Battalion of the Bandit-Suppression National-Reconstruction Corps to search warehouses for hoarded goods and to place secret report boxes in the city where people could anonymously report violators. He also used the Shanghai Youth Service Corps for enforcement.

As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Chiang Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him.

Ching-kuo ordered KMT agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation&#x27;s warehouses, which was privately owned by H.H. Kung and his family, as the company was accused of hoarding supplies. H.H. Kung&#x27;s wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong Mei-ling who was Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s stepmother.

Chiang Ching-kuo had H.H. Kung&#x27;s son son David Kung and several employees of the Yangtze Development Corporation arrested on allegations of holding foreign exchange. Soong Mei-ling called Chiang Kai-shek to complain and also called Chiang Ching-Kuo directly. David Kung was eventually freed after negotiations, and Chiang Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.

The major impact of Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s campaign was to cause the flight of prominent capitalists from Shanghai to Hong Kong and elsewhere. The failure of the campaign also affected Ching-kuo&#x27;s political influence and reputation temporarily.

===Political career in Taiwan===

After the Nationalists lost control of mainland China to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo followed his father and the retreating Nationalist forces to Taiwan. On 8 December 1949, the Nationalist capital was moved from Chengdu to Taipei, and early on 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China. Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo directed the city&#x27;s defense from the Chengdu Central Military Academy, before the aircraft &quot;May-ling&quot; evacuated them to Taiwan; they would never return to mainland China.

In 1950, Chiang&#x27;s father appointed him director of the secret police, which he remained until 1965. An enemy of the Chiang family, Wu Kuo-chen, was kicked out of his position of governor of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo and fled to America in 1953. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Military, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and KMT party activities were propagated throughout the military. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute.

Chiang orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955, allegedly for plotting a coup d&#x27;état with the American CIA against his father. General Sun was a popular Chinese war hero from the Burma Campaign against the Japanese and remained under house arrest until Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s death in 1988. Ching-kuo also approved the arbitrary arrest and torture of prisoners.

From 1955 to 1960, Chiang administered the construction and completion of Taiwan&#x27;s highway system. Chiang&#x27;s father elevated him to high office when he was appointed as the ROC Defense Minister from 1965 until 1969. He was the nation&#x27;s Vice Premier between 1969 and 1972, during which he survived a 1970 assassination attempt while visiting the U.S. Afterwards he was appointed the nation&#x27;s Premier between 1972 and 1978.

In 1970, Chiang was the target of an assassination attempt in New York City by Peter Huang.

As Premier Chiang organized a people&#x27;s diplomacy campaign in the United States in an effort to mobilize American political sentiment in opposition to the PRC through mass demonstrations and petitions. Among these efforts, the KMT worked with the John Birch Society to launch a petition writing campaign through which Americans were urged to write their local government officials and ask them to &quot;Cut the Red China connection.&quot;

As Chiang Kai-shek entered his final years, he gradually gave more responsibilities to his son, and when he died in April 1975, Vice President Yen Chia-kan became president for the balance of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s term, while Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded to the leadership of the KMT (he opted for the title &quot;Chairman&quot; rather than the elder Chiang&#x27;s title of &quot;Director-General&quot;).

===Leadership===
Chiang Ching-kuo was elected president of the ROC in the 1978 Taiwanese presidential election by the Eternal Parliament on 20 May 1978. He was reelected to another term in the 1984 Taiwanese presidential election. At that time, the National Assembly consisted mostly of , men who had been elected in 1947–48 before the fall of mainland China and who would hold their seats indefinitely. Starting from the 1970s when his father grew sick, Chiang became the de facto leader of the regime and reformed many of his father&#x27;s autocratic policies and gradually phased out of the white terror by allowing the freedom of peaceful assemblies and political pluralism of the Tangwai movement, which later became the DPP. Chiang also turned down many of the suggestions of the conservatives in the KMT regime to violently suppress the protesters.

In a move he launched the &quot;Ten Major Construction Projects&quot; and the &quot;Twelve New Development Projects&quot; which contributed to the &quot;Taiwan Miracle&quot;. Among his accomplishments was accelerating the process of economic modernization to give Taiwan a 13% growth rate, $4,600 per capita income, and the world&#x27;s second largest foreign exchange reserves. On 16 December 1978, U.S. president Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would no longer recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States would continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, but the TRA was purposely vague in any promise of defending Taiwan in the event of an invasion.

Chiang Ching-kuo also enacted major labor rights reforms throughout the 1970s and the 1980s that addressed child labor, women&#x27;s employment, working time, pensions, paid leave, employment contract with several legislations such as the &quot;Labor Safety and Hygiene Law&quot; in 1974 and the &quot;Factory Law&quot; in 1975. The average salary of Taiwanese workers tripled under his rule. Chiang Ching-kuo also loosened the harsh anti-strike laws and union busting practice, thus giving the labor movement more opportunity to bargain for fairer wages as he lifted the martial law provisions.

In an effort to bring more Taiwan-born citizens into government services, Chiang Ching-kuo &quot;exiled&quot; his over-ambitious chief of General Political Warfare Department, General Wang Sheng, to Paraguay as an ambassador (November 1983), and hand-picked Lee Teng-hui as vice-president of the ROC (formally elected May 1984), first-in-the-line of succession to the presidency. Chiang emphatically declared that his successor would not be from the Chiang family in a Constitution Day speech on 25 December 1985:

Chiang Wei-kuo, Chiang&#x27;s younger brother, would later repudiate the declaration in 1990 after he was selected as a vice-presidential candidate.

On 15 July 1987, Chiang finally ended martial law and allowed his family to visit the mainland. The ban on tourism to Hong Kong and Macau was also lifted. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls and opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish political criticism papers.

Opposition political parties, though still formally illegal, were allowed to operate without harassment or arrest. When the Democratic Progressive Party was established on 28 September 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders, but its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement.

Chiang Ching-kuo also increased the political representation of Taiwanese people to certain degree under his rule, allowing them to have various positions, which paved the way for Lee Teng-hui to come to power and further democratize Taiwan.

===Death and legacy===

Chiang Ching-kuo died at Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 13 January 1988, aged 77, from a heart attack. He used a wheelchair during the last months of his life, and also had diabetes, alongside vision and heart problems.
He was interred temporarily in Daxi Township, Taoyuan County (now Daxi District, Taoyuan City), but in a separate mausoleum in Touliao, a mile down the road from his father&#x27;s burial place. The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua once mainland China was recovered. Composer Hwang Yau-tai wrote the Chiang Ching-kuo Memorial Song in 1988.

In January 2004, Chiang Fang-liang asked that both father and son be buried at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County (now New Taipei City). The state funeral ceremony was initially planned for Spring 2005, but was eventually delayed to winter 2005. It may be further delayed due to the recent death of Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s oldest daughter-in-law, who had served as the de facto head of the household since Chiang Fang-liang&#x27;s death in 2004. Chiang Fang-liang and Soong Mei-ling had agreed in 1997 that the former leaders be first buried, but still be moved to mainland China.

Murray A. Rubinstein called Chiang Ching-kuo more of a civilian leader than his father, whom Rubenstein refers to as a &quot;quasi-warlord.&quot;

Jay Taylor has described Chiang Ching-kuo as a figure who was ideologically inspired by a mix of Soviet communism, Chinese nationalism, Taiwanese localism, and American democracy, who became the helmsman of the democratization of Taiwan.

Unlike his highly controversial father, Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s reputation is overwhelmingly positive among the Taiwanese population as the people of Taiwan recognize his economic and social achievements, as well as his efforts of democratization. 38.7% of the population considers him the best president who contributed the most to Taiwan, and he was rated 84.8/100 by the Taiwanese population.

<text>Maurice Auguste Chevalier (; 12 September 1888 – 1 January 1972) was a French singer, actor, and entertainer. He is best known for his signature songs, including &quot;Livin&#x27; In The Sunlight&quot;, &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot;, &quot;Mimi&quot;, and &quot;Thank Heaven for Little Girls&quot;, and for his films, including &quot;The Love Parade&quot;, &quot;The Big Pond&quot;, &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;One Hour with You&quot;, and &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;. His trademark attire was a boater hat and tuxedo.

Chevalier was born in Paris. He made his name as a star of musical comedy, appearing in public as a singer and dancer at an early age before working in menial jobs as a teenager. In 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France at the time, Fréhel. Although their relationship was brief, she secured him his first major engagement, as a mimic and a singer in &quot;l&#x27;Alcazar&quot; in Marseille, for which he received critical acclaim by French theatre critics. In 1917, he discovered jazz and ragtime and went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre.

After this, he toured the United States, where he met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought the operetta &quot;Dédé&quot; to Broadway in 1922. He developed an interest in acting and had success in &quot;Dédé&quot;. When talkies arrived, he went to Hollywood in 1928, where he played his first American role in &quot;Innocents of Paris&quot;. In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Big Pond&quot; (1930), which secured his first big American hits, &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Sunlight, Lovin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot;.

In 1957, he appeared in &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot;, which was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years. In 1958, he starred with Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in &quot;Gigi&quot;. In the early 1960s, he made eight films, including &quot;&quot;Can-Can&quot;&quot; in 1960 and &quot;&quot;Fanny&quot;&quot; the following year. In 1970, he made his final contribution to the film industry where he sang the title song of the Disney film &quot;The Aristocats&quot;. He died in Paris, on 1 January 1972, from complications of a suicide attempt.

==Early life==
Chevalier was born on 12 September 1888 in Paris to Victor Charles Chevalier (1854–1916), a French house painter, and Joséphine (&quot;née&quot; Van Den Bossche, 1852–1929) a lace-maker of Belgian (Flemish) descent. He had two brothers, Charles (1877–1938) and Paul (1884–1969). Victor, an alcoholic, deserted the family in 1896, leaving Joséphine to feed and take care of the children on her own; forced to work much longer hours, she was hospitalized for overwork in 1898. Charles, the eldest, took over some responsibilities but was married in 1900, leaving his mother to take care of Maurice and Paul on her own.

Paul was forced to find work, and eventually secured a job at a metal-engraving factory; the brothers became very close with their mother during this time, nicknaming her &quot;La Louque&quot;, which Maurice would later name his Marnes-la-Coquette estate after. Determined to be an acrobat, Maurice left school aged ten but was convinced to abandon this after a severe injury. He tried a number of other jobs: a carpenter&#x27;s apprentice, an electrician, a printer, and even as a doll painter. Chevalier was eventually able to hold down a job at a mattress factory, and became interested in performing; while daydreaming his finger was crushed in a machine and he was forced to stop working.

While recovering, in 1900, he offered his services as a performer to the skeptical owner of a nearby cafe. Chevalier performed his first song there, &quot;V&#x27;la Les Croquants&quot;, although his performance was met with laughter as he had sung three octaves too high. Discouraged, Maurice returned home, where his mother and brother Paul encouraged him to continue practicing. He continued singing, unpaid, at the café until a member of the theatre saw him and suggested he try for a local musical. Chevalier got the part, and began to make a name as a mimic and a singer. His act in l&#x27;Alcazar in Marseille was so successful, on his return to Paris he was met by an admiring crowd.

In 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France, Fréhel. However, due to her alcoholism and drug addiction, their liaison ended in 1911. Chevalier later said that he became addicted to cocaine during this time, a habit he was able to quit because he had no access to the drug as a prisoner of war in World War I. After splitting with Fréhel, he then started a relationship with 36-year-old Mistinguett at the Folies Bergère, where he was her younger dance partner; they eventually played out a public romance.

==World War I==
When World War I broke out, Chevalier was in the middle of his national service, already in the front line, where he was wounded by shrapnel in the back in the first weeks of combat and was taken as a prisoner of war in Germany for two years, where he learned English. In 1916, he was released through the secret intervention of Mistinguett&#x27;s admirer, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the only king of a neutral country who was related to both the British and German royal families.

In 1917, Chevalier became a star in le Casino de Paris and played before British soldiers and Americans. He discovered jazz and ragtime and started thinking about touring the United States. In the prison camp, he had studied English and had an advantage over other French artists. He went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre, even though he still sang in French.

==Paris and Hollywood==

After the war, Chevalier went back to Paris and created several songs still known today, such as &quot;Valentine&quot; (1924). He played in a few pictures, including Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; (1923), a rare drama for Chaplin, in which his character of The Tramp does not appear, and made an impression in the operetta &quot;Dédé&quot;. He met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought &quot;Dédé&quot; to Broadway in 1922. The same year he met Yvonne Vallée, a young dancer, who became his wife in 1927.

When Douglas Fairbanks was on honeymoon in Paris in 1920, he offered him star billing with his new wife Mary Pickford, but Chevalier doubted his own talent for silent movies (his previous ones had largely failed). When sound arrived, he made his Hollywood debut in 1928. He signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and played his first American role in &quot;Innocents of Paris&quot;. In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Big Pond&quot; (1930). &quot;The Big Pond&quot; gave Chevalier his first big American hit songs: &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Sunlight, Lovin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot; with words and music by Al Lewis and Al Sherman, plus &quot;A New Kind of Love&quot; (or &quot;The Nightingales&quot;). He collaborated with film director Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in Paramount&#x27;s all-star revue film &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930).

While Chevalier was under contract with Paramount, his name was so recognized that his passport was featured in the Marx Brothers film &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1931). In this sequence, each brother uses Chevalier&#x27;s passport, and tries to sneak off the ocean liner where they were stowaways by claiming to be the singer—with unique renditions of &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot; with its line &quot;If the nightingales could sing like you&quot;. In 1931, Chevalier starred in a musical called &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; with Claudette Colbert and Miriam Hopkins. Despite the disdain audiences held for musicals in 1931, it proved a successful film.

In 1932, he starred with Jeanette MacDonald in Paramount&#x27;s film musical &quot;One Hour With You&quot;, which became a success and one of the films instrumental in making musicals popular again. Due to its popularity, Paramount starred Maurice Chevalier in another musical called &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; (also 1932), and again co-starring Jeanette MacDonald. It is about a tailor who falls in love with a princess when he goes to a castle to collect a debt and is mistaken for a baron. Featuring songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, it was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, who, with the help of the songwriters, was able to put into the score his ideas of the integrated musical (a musical which blends songs and dialogue so the songs advance the plot). It is considered one of the greatest film musicals of all time.
In 1934, he starred in the first sound film of the Franz Lehár operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, one of his best-known films, though he felt his role was too narrow and repetitive. He then signed with MGM for &quot;The Man from the Folies Bergère&quot;, his own favourite of his films. After a disagreement over his star-billing, he returned to France in 1935 to resume his music-hall career.

Even when he was the highest-paid star in Hollywood, Chevalier had a reputation as a penny-pincher. He later admitted that he was hesitant to spend money on things such as changing the blade of his razor as he had grown up in poverty, remarking that &quot;poverty is a disease that can never be cured.&quot; When not playing around with young chorus-girls, he actually felt quite lonely, and sought the company of Adolphe Menjou and Charles Boyer, also French, but both much better educated than Chevalier. Boyer in particular introduced him to art galleries and good literature, and Chevalier would try to copy him as the man of taste. But at other times, he would &#x27;revert to type&#x27; as the bitter and impoverished street-kid he was at heart. When performing in English, he always put on a heavy French accent, although his normal spoken English was quite fluent and sounded more American.

In 1937, Chevalier married the dancer Nita Raya. He had several successes, such as his revue &quot;Paris en Joie&quot; in the Casino de Paris. A year later, he performed in &quot;Amours de Paris&quot;. His songs remained big hits, such as &quot;Prosper&quot; (1935), &quot;Ma Pomme&quot; (1936) and &quot;Ça fait d&#x27;excellents français&quot; (1939).

==World War II==
Chevalier continued performing for as long as he could freely, retreating to the free zone in the south of France with his Jewish wife and her parents as well as some friends following the 1940 invasion by German troops. During this time, patriotic songs such as &quot;Ça sent si bon la France&quot; and &quot;Paris sera Toujours Paris&quot; became popular, and he held charity balls and performed to raise money for resistance efforts. Chevalier consistently refused to perform for the Vichy France collaborators, and feigned illness, but eventually, out of fear for the safety of his wife and her parents, he reluctantly agreed to a deal. He refused to perform on the collaborating station Radio Paris, but agreed to perform for prisoners of war at the very camp in which he had been incarcerated during World War I. The performance was given in exchange for the release of ten French prisoners.

In 1942, Chevalier was named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it. That year he moved to La Bocca, near Cannes, but returned to the capital city in September. In 1944 when Allied forces freed France, Chevalier was accused of collaboration. The August 28, 1944, issue of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, the daily newspaper of U.S. armed forces in the European Theater of Operations, reported in error that &quot;Maurice Chevalier Slain By Maquis, Patriots Say&quot;. Even though he was acquitted by a French convened court, the English-speaking press remained hostile and he was refused a visa for several years. In a review of the 1969 Oscar-nominated documentary film about French collaboration &quot;Le chagrin et la pitié&quot; (&quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;), Simon Heffer draws attention to &quot;a clip of Maurice Chevalier explaining, entirely dishonestly, to an anglophone audience how he had not collaborated.&quot;

In his own country, however, he was still popular. In 1946, he split from Nita Raya and, at the age of 58, began writing his memoirs, which took many years to complete.

He started to collect art and paint, and acted in &quot;Le silence est d&#x27;or (Man About Town)&quot; (1946) by René Clair. He toured throughout the United States and other parts of the world, then returned to France in 1948.

In 1944, he had participated in a Communist demonstration in Paris. He was therefore even less popular in the U.S. during the McCarthyism period; in 1951, he was refused re-entry into the U.S. because he had signed the Stockholm Appeal.

In 1949, he performed in Stockholm in a Communist benefit against nuclear arms. Also in 1949, Chevalier was the subject of the first official roast at the New York Friars&#x27; Club, although celebrities had been informally &quot;roasted&quot; at banquets since 1910.

In 1952, he bought a large property in Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, and named it La Louque, as a homage to his mother&#x27;s nickname. He started a relationship in 1952 with Janie Michels, a young divorcee with three children.

In 1954, after the McCarthy era abated, Chevalier was welcomed back in the United States. His first full American tour was in 1955, with Vic Schoen as arranger and musical director. The Billy Wilder film &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; (1957) with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years.

In 1957, Chevalier was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

Chevalier appeared in the movie musical &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958) with Leslie Caron and Hermione Gingold, with whom he shared the song &quot;I Remember It Well&quot;, and several Walt Disney films. The success of &quot;Gigi&quot; prompted Hollywood to give him an Academy Honorary Award that year for achievements in entertainment. In 1957, he appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; titled &quot;Jack in Paris&quot;. He also appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, titled &quot;Lucy Goes to Mexico&quot;.

==Final years==

In the early 1960s, he toured the United States and between 1960 and 1963 made eight films, including &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1960) with Frank Sinatra. In 1961, he starred in the drama &quot;Fanny&quot; with Leslie Caron and Charles Boyer, an updated version of Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s &quot;Marseilles Trilogy&quot;. In 1962, he filmed &quot;Panic Button&quot; (not released until 1964), playing opposite Jayne Mansfield. In 1965, at age 77, he made another world tour. In 1967 he toured in Latin America, again, the US, Europe and Canada, where he appeared as a special guest at Expo 67. The following year, on October 1, 1968, he announced his farewell tour.

Historical newsreel footage of Chevalier appeared in the 1969 Marcel Ophüls documentary &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;. In a wartime short film near the end of the film&#x27;s second part, he explained his disappearance during World War II, as rumors of his death lingered at that time, and he emphatically denied any collaboration with the Nazis. His theme song, &quot;Sweepin&#x27; the Clouds Away&quot;, from the film &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930), was one of the film&#x27;s theme songs and was played in the end credits of the second part.

In 1970, two years after his retirement, songwriters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman convinced him to sing the title song of the Disney film &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, which ended up being his final contribution to the film industry.

==Death and burial==
Chevalier suffered from bouts of depression throughout his adult life. On 7 March 1971, he attempted suicide by overdosing on barbiturates. Rushed to the hospital, Chevalier was saved but suffered liver and kidney damage as a result of the drug. In the following months, he suffered memory lapses, chronic tiredness, and spent much of his time alone. On 12 December, he fell ill and was taken to Paris&#x27;s Necker Hospital and placed on dialysis. By 30 December, doctors announced his kidneys were no longer responding to dialysis. Too frail for a transplant, he underwent surgery as a last-ditch effort to save his life. It was unsuccessful; Chevalier died from a cardiac arrest following kidney surgery on New Year&#x27;s Day 1972, aged 83.

He is interred in the cemetery of Marnes-la-Coquette in Hauts-de-Seine, outside Paris, France with his mother, &quot;La Louque&quot;.

Chevalier has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street.

Author Michael Freedland later claimed in his 1981 biography of Chevalier that the actor Felix Paquet, who became close to Chevalier during the 1960s, cut off contact with all of his friends and family in hopes of securing access to his fortune. Freedland alleges that Paquet, eighteen years Chevalier&#x27;s junior, intercepted mail and withheld information about Maurice&#x27;s health in the months before his death.

<doc id="61160" wikidata="Q1263583" url="?curid=61160" title="The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934 film)">
<text>The Barretts of Wimpole Street is a 1934 American romantic drama film directed by Sidney Franklin based on the 1930 play of the same title by Rudolf Besier. It depicts the real-life romance between poets Elizabeth Barrett (Norma Shearer) and Robert Browning (Fredric March), despite the opposition of her abusive father Edward Moulton-Barrett (Charles Laughton). The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Shearer was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. It was written by Ernest Vajda, Claudine West, and Donald Ogden Stewart, from the successful 1930 play &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; by Rudolf Besier, and starring Katharine Cornell.

In 1957, Franklin directed a color remake in CinemaScope and Metrocolor starring Jennifer Jones, John Gielgud, and Bill Travers.

==Plot==

In her bedroom where she has been sequestered for years, Elizabeth (&quot;Ba&quot;) (Norma Shearer), the eldest Barrett daughter, consults with her doctor. She is recovering from an illness and is weak, but the doctor advises that a full recovery is possible.

She has a vivacious and brilliant mind, her poetry is frequently published, and she loves fooling around with her siblings, especially her youngest sister, Henrietta (Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan). Her stern father Edward (Charles Laughton), however, wastes no opportunity to remind Elizabeth that she is near death. Henrietta is interested in marrying her brothers&#x27; friend Surtees (Ralph Forbes), but she cannot see any way around her insanely possessive father, who has forbidden his children to marry.

Robert Browning (Fredric March), who has been corresponding with Elizabeth for some time, arrives in person and sweeps her off her feet. Months pass, and with a new lease on life, Elizabeth is able to walk. Edward insists she is still very sick, and when the doctors prescribe a trip to Italy, Edward forbids it. Exasperated, Robert makes his feelings towards Edward plain to Elizabeth, and they declare their love for each other.

One day, the Barretts&#x27; cousin Bella (Marion Clayton) reveals that Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship with Robert is romantic. Edward arranges a scheme to get Elizabeth away from Robert by selling the house and moving the family to Surrey, six miles from the nearest railway station.
Unexpectedly, Edward returns from London and catches Henrietta and Surtees modeling his dress uniform for Elizabeth. He forces Henrietta to confess her secret affair. Denouncing her as a whore, he makes her swear never to see Surtees again and to lock herself in her room.

Ba conspires with her maid Wilson to let Robert know she will elope with him and Wilson is coming along. Edward opens up to Ba and confesses the motivation for his behavior. He apparently thinks of himself as having a sex addiction and now suppresses his desires, equating sex with sin, and he wants his children never to fall prey to carnal passion. As he goes into detail about how he wants Ba all to himself, he embraces her and comes close to making a sexual pass. Horrified, Ba repulses him. He apologizes and leaves, saying he&#x27;ll pray for her. Ba soon departs with her dog Flush. The film closes with a brief scene of Elizabeth&#x27;s and Robert&#x27;s marriage, with Wilson as a witness and Flush waiting patiently by the church door.

==Depiction of events==
The numerous love letters that Robert and Elizabeth exchanged before their marriage give readers a great deal of information about this famous courtship in their own words. The correspondence was well underway before they ever met in person, he having admired the collection &quot;Poems&quot; that she published in 1844. He opens his first letter to her, &quot;I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett&quot;, and a little later in that first letter he says &quot;I do, as I say, love these books with all my heart—and I love you too&quot; (January 10, 1845). Several editions of these letters have been published, the first being one compiled by their son in 1898. &quot;&quot;, the version by Virginia Woolf, from the perspective of Elizabeth&#x27;s dog, is also an imaginative reconstruction, though more closely based on reading the letters.

Both the play and film reflect popular concerns at the time, particularly Freudian analysis. Although Edward Barrett&#x27;s behavior in disinheriting any of the children who married seems bizarre, there appears to be no evidence of his being sexually aggressive toward any of the family members.

For the screenplay, all overt suggestions of incest were removed from Besier&#x27;s original play, but Charles Laughton, who played Edward, assured producer Irving Thalberg, &quot;They can&#x27;t censor the gleam in my eye.&quot;

==Reception==
Andre Sennwald of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a drama of beauty, dignity and nobility&quot;, praising Shearer&#x27;s performance as &quot;a brave and touching piece of acting&quot; and Laughton as &quot;superb.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;truly an actor&#x27;s picture&quot; with a &quot;final stretch that grips and holds&quot;, but that overall it was &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;talky&quot; and suggested its running time could have been shortened. &quot;Film Daily&quot; lauded it as &quot;Unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever filmed&quot;, with &quot;a superb performance&quot; by Shearer and one of Laughton&#x27;s &quot;most dominating performances.&quot; &quot;I found myself pleasantly surprised by the performances of Miss Shearer and Mr. March&quot;, wrote St. Clair McKelway for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Although McKelway found it &quot;hard to accept Miss Shearer in her role&quot;, he called it &quot;sensibly handled from beginning to end, and every now and then Mr. Laughton creates moments as effective, I think, as any you have seen on the screen.&quot; &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; topped the &quot;Film Daily&quot; year-end poll of 424 critics as the best film of 1934.

The film was considered a success at the box office. According to MGM records it earned theater rentals of $1,258,000 in the US and Canada and $1,085,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $668,000. Its unexpected success in rural U.S. markets, despite its upper-class themes, was mentioned in the 1935 &quot;Variety&quot; article famously headlined &quot;Sticks Nix Hick Pix&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1957, Sidney Franklin filmed a word-for-word, and nearly shot-for-shot Metrocolor remake, of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, in CinemaScope. This version starred Jennifer Jones as Elizabeth, John Gielgud as her father, Bill Travers as Robert Browning, and Keith Baxter in his film debut.

Both of the films were released by MGM.

It was also adapted in the Hindi language as the Indian film &quot;Aaj Aur Kal&quot; (1963).

<text>The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) is an organization founded on 29 May 1948&lt;ref name=&quot;s/res/73&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; for peacekeeping in the Middle East. Established amidst the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, its primary task was initially to provide the military command structure to the peacekeeping forces in the Middle East to enable the peacekeepers to observe and maintain the ceasefire, and in assisting the parties to the Armistice Agreements in the supervision of the application and observance of the terms of those Agreements. The organization&#x27;s structure and role has evolved over time as a result of the various conflicts in the region and at times UNTSO personnel have been used to rapidly deploy to other areas of the Middle East in support of other United Nations operations. The command structure of the UNTSO was maintained to cover the later peacekeeping organisations of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to which UNTSO continues to provide military observers.

==Background==
On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 on &quot;the future constitution and government of Palestine&quot; setting forth a &quot;Plan of Partition with Economic Union&quot;. The result of the vote was 33 in favour, 13 against and 10 abstentions. The report consisted of four parts: future constitution and government of Palestine; boundaries; city of Jerusalem; and capitulations. It called for the creation of Arab and Jewish states no later than 1 October 1948, with Jerusalem as &quot;corpus separatum&quot; under an international regime to be administered by the U.N. with the Trusteeship Council being the designated body in this regard. The plan also included steps to be taken prior to independence, including the issues of citizenship, transit, economic union between the two states, access to holy places and religious and minority rights. Resolution 181 (II) also established the United Nations Palestine Commission to carry out the plan. The Trusteeship Council was to administer Palestine for ten years.

As the civil war in Palestine began to escalate the Security Council voted on and adopted Resolution 42 (1948) of 5 March 1948, appealing to all governments and peoples, particularly in and around Palestine, to take all possible action to prevent or reduce such disorders as were occurring in Palestine. The Trusteeship Council decided on 10 March 1948 in resolution 32 (II) &quot;that the statute on Jerusalem was in satisfactory form and agrees that the question of its formal approval, together with the appointment of a governor of the city, shall be taken up at a subsequent meeting to be held not later than one week before 29 April 1948&quot;, the deadline given to the council by the assembly. On 21 April 1948, the Trusteeship Council transmitted the Resolution along with the draft statute to the General Assembly.

The situation in Palestine was becoming even more chaotic when the Security Council met on 1 April 1948 it adopted Resolution 43 (1948), calling for an &quot;immediate truce be effected in Palestine&quot; and for &quot;the Jewish Agency for Palestine and the Arab Higher Committee to make representatives available to the Security Council for the purpose of arranging a truce between the Arab and Jewish communities of Palestine; and emphasizes the heavy responsibility which would fall upon any party failing to observe such a truce&quot;. The Security Council adopted Resolution 44 (1948), invoking Article 20 of the U.N. Charter on 1 April 1948 where the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to convoke a special session of the General Assembly to consider further the future of the government of Palestine.

By 17 April 1948, the situation in Palestine had deteriorated further and the Security Council adopted Resolution 46 (1948), calling upon all persons and organizations in Palestine to immediately cease all military activities, as well as acts of violence, terrorism and sabotage; to refrain from any actions endangering the safety of the Holy Places in Palestine and refrain from importing or acquiring or assisting or encouraging the importation or acquisition of weapons and war materials (arms embargo). It also requested the government of the U.K., as the Mandatory Power, to supervise the execution of those measures and to keep the Security Council and the General Assembly informed on the situation in Palestine.

The General Assembly then convened for its second special session between 16 April to 14 May 1948, during which it considered a working paper submitted by the United States (U.S.) on the question of the &quot;Trusteeship of Palestine&quot;, which was opposed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) as well as the Jewish Agency. The assembly adopted resolution 185 (S-2) of 26 April 1948, asking the Trusteeship Council to study measures for the protection of Jerusalem, its inhabitants and to submit proposals to the General Assembly.

On 14 May 1948, the assembly adopted Resolution 186 (S-2), which affirmed its support for the efforts of the Security Council to secure a truce in Palestine. The assembly also decided to appoint a U.N. Mediator to Palestine and specified the functions of the mediator, relieving the Palestine Commission from further &quot;exercise of responsibilities&quot; under resolution 181 (II). Bernadotte was appointed Mediator. After receiving proposals from the Trusteeship Council, the assembly adopted Resolution 187 (S-2), recommending to the Mandatory Power the appointment of a Special Municipal Commissioner for Jerusalem.

The Jewish state of Israel was proclaimed on 14 May 1948, taking effect at midnight that day, as the British mandate expired the following day. The U.S. had proposed the establishment of a trusteeship for Palestine; nevertheless, the U.S. government recognized the Jewish state as did the U.S.S.R. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War broke out shortly afterwards when Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt invaded the newly proclaimed state.

==History==
According to the United Nations, &quot;following the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, [UNTSO&#x27;s] functions...[have evolved]... in the light of changing circumstances, but they [have] remained in the area, acting as go-betweens for the hostile parties and as the means by which isolated incidents could be contained and prevented from escalating into major conflicts.&quot;

===Establishment===
In response to a request from Count Folke Bernadotte, the Swedish United Nations Mediator for Palestine, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, sent 50 members of the United Nations guard force from Lake Success to assist the mediator in supervising the truce in the former British Mandate of Palestine in 1948. The first peacekeeping operation was established by the United Nations. All the members of the party were experienced international civil servants with a background of service with the United Nations Secretariat at Headquarters. While on duty in Palestine, they were to continue to wear United Nations guard uniforms. United Nations military observers (UNMOs) remain in the Middle East to monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements, prevent isolated incidents from escalating and assist other UN peacekeeping operations in the region. This resolution formed the basis for the establishment of the first UN peacekeeping operation which became known as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). 

Prior to this, in November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed a plan for the partition of the then British Mandate of Palestine, providing for the creation of an Arab State and a Jewish State, with Jerusalem to be placed in Trusteeship with international status. The plan was not accepted by the Palestinian Arabs and Arab States and only partially accepted by the Jewish Agency. On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate over Palestine and the State of Israel was proclaimed. The following day, the Arab States invaded.

The General Assembly adopted Resolution 186 (S-2) on 14 May 1948. This affirmed its support for the efforts of the Security Council to secure a truce in Palestine, and it decided to appoint a UN Mediator. Bernadotte was appointed was sent to Palestine. On 22 May 1948, the Security Council adopted Resolution 49 (1948), calling for an abstention from any hostile military action in Palestine. The resolution also called upon the parties to facilitate the task of the UN Mediator. On 22 May 1948, Thomas C. Wasson, the US Consul and a member of the UN Truce Commission, was assassinated in Jerusalem.

On 29 May 1948, UN Security Council Resolution 50 (1948), called for a cessation of hostilities in Palestine and decided that the truce should be supervised by the Bernadotte with the assistance of a group of military observers. The first group of military observers, which later became known as UNTSO, arrived in the region in June 1948, when the Security Council threatened Chapter VII intervention. To enforce the first of two truces, lasting four weeks, the United Nations then established an observer formation, with members drawn from Belgium, France, and the United States. On 6 July the UN observers had their first casualty with the death of the French Observer Commandant Rene de Labarriere, who was wounded near the Afoula area and later died in the Jewish Hospital at Afoula. He was wounded while investigating an alleged violation of the truce provisions by Jewish forces.

The mediator was instructed on 29 May 1948 to create a one-month truce in Palestine. The mediator concept was teamed with the Truce Commission for supervisory over-watch of the Truce Plan. The month-long truce went into effect on 11 June 1948. On the same day, the first group of 36 observers arrived via Cairo, Egypt, and continued to arrive for the next three days. The first truce did not last long due to widespread violence. As a result, the observers were withdrawn on 9 July 1948. The second truce, indefinite in length, was called by the United Nations Security Council on 15 July 1948. This declaration was to be put into effect on 18 July 1948. It was from Security Council Resolution 54 that the mediator was instructed to supervise the observance of the truce and to establish procedures for examining alleged breaches of the truce since 11 June 1948, and authorized the mediator to deal with breaches so far as it was within the capacity of the mediator to do so by appropriate local action. The Security Council Resolution 54 also requested the mediator to keep the Security Council informed concerning the operation of the truce and, where necessary, to take appropriate action. During the autumn of 1948, UNTSO was re-established with an increase in size to supervise the Second Truce. The first group of observers to serve in Palestine under the UN Mediator, Bernadotte, arrived in Rhodes on 20 July. It included 41 Americans and about 25 Belgians and were deployed on 21 July 1948. The initial group was quickly expanded to 93 in total because of the large area that had to be covered. As the number of personnel grew, the United Nations Secretariat (of Personnel) supported the creation of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), the same organization UN military observers are assigned to today. Initially, the command was headed by a Chief-of-Staff (a general officer from one of the participating countries) in accordance with the personal direction of the mediator (a civilian).

On 17 September 1948, UN Mediator Count Folke Bernadotte, and Colonel André Serot, while on an official tour of duty to Jerusalem, were murdered &quot;in cold blood... in the Katamon quarter of Jerusalem by Jewish assailants.&quot; After the assassination, the talks between the warring parties began under the supervision of Acting Mediator Ralph Bunche. Bunche, Chief of the UN Mission in Palestine, in his letter to the Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Shertok wrote that the incident was &quot;an outrage against the international community and an unspeakable violation of elementary morality. His [Bernadotte&#x27;s] safety, therefore, and that of his Lieutenants under the ordinary rules of law and order was a responsibility of the Provisional government of Israel whose armed forces and representatives control and administer the area. The act constitutes a breach of the truce of the utmost gravity for which the Provisional Government of Israel must assume full responsibility.&quot; The Provisional Government of Israel did not submit the report to the Security Council or to the Acting Mediator regarding the progress of the investigation into the assassination of Count Bernadotte.

The General Armistice Agreements (GAAs) came out of the mediator-chaired talks. On 11 August 1949, it was decided by the Security Council that the mediator&#x27;s function had been completed and that the role in observing the ceasefire should be passed to the Chief of Staff of the UNTSO. In 1949, UNTSO military observers remained to supervise the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours, which were for many years the main basis of the uneasy truce in the whole area. UNTSO&#x27;s activities have been and still are spread over territory within five States, and therefore it has relations with five host countries – Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syrian Arab Republic. Since then, UNTSO has also supervised the General Armistice Agreements of 1949 and the observation of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area following the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the Golan Heights following the Six-Day War of June 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973.

===1949 to 1956===
The period from August 1949 to June 1956 was initially chaotic but quickly settled into a routine of complaints on the Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian and Lebanese fronts. It was initially possible for the UN personnel to deal with complaints of violations of the &quot;truce&quot; at the local commander level. As time progressed there arose a culture of claim and counter claim by the participating parties and regardless of the work and intent of UNTSO the intensity of the violent incidents increased. The GAAs had been hastily prepared in anticipation of an early peace along the lines of the 1947 Partition Plan and the primary concern was an end to the bloodshed at the earliest opportunity. As a result, the armistice lines had laid out temporary boundaries without thought to existing village boundaries or water rights. The armistice agreements were of a purely military character, intended to provide a transitional stage between the truce and a final peace. They constituted, in effect, non-aggression agreements of unlimited duration, but they contained in themselves no provision for establishing normal relations between the neighbouring countries. The armistice lines did not follow the fighting lines in all cases especially the Syrian Armistice line. In the case of the Egyptian Armistice line Israel forces carried on with a push south arriving at Umm Rashrash (Eilat) in March after the Egyptian-Israel GAA of 24 February 1949. This caused friction on setting the &quot;truce lines&quot;. The contribution toward the foundation of a peaceful existence by the Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs) was limited by the sanctions that the MACs were able to apply (a formal condemnation by the Security Council). For approximately 18 years (from 1949 until after the 1967 war), lack of harmony within the MACs was typical of the relationship existing between the countries. With the exception of the Israeli-Lebanon MAC, strife and discord became common.

The MACs were very different from one another, bringing about four unique peacekeeping missions under the head of the UNTSO. Disputes on the Israel/Syria Mixed Armistice Commission (ISMAC) centred on the most precious Middle Eastern commodity: water and sovereignty of the DMZ. Contentious issues in the HKJIMAC principally concerned the divided city of Jerusalem, the Israeli Mount Scopus enclave, the Latrun salient (sovereignty of the DMZ), Arab infiltration across the armistice demarcation line and large scale Israeli military incursions into Jordanian territory. The troubles were followed by infiltration from displaced Arabs, followed by raids of reprisal and intimidation by the Israelis, which heightened tensions around the borders. The infiltration by Palestinians initially consisted of unarmed groups crossing to regain possessions, harvest their crops or visit relatives, but later infiltrations included armed individuals and then later developed into small retaliatory raids.

Israeli infiltration into Jordanian territory at this time included retaliatory raids by military units at Qibya and Nahhalin. Israel&#x27;s frustration with the UN and the other parties led to their withdrawal from ISMAC in 1951 and HKJIMAC in 1954. The functioning of the Israel-Lebanon MAC remained smooth due to the more relaxed attitude of the Israeli patrols towards returnees and infiltrators. Disputes with Egypt, who banned Israel-bound shipping from the Suez Canal and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, pertained to the al-Auja DMZ. By 1955, Egypt&#x27;s sponsorship of Palestinian fedayeen (self-sacrificer) raids caused Israel to cease attending the Egyptian MAC and to step up raids into the Gaza Strip and Sinai, which resulted in Egypt arming the fedayeen. From 21 September 1955, the Egypt/Israel demilitarized zone was occupied by Israel armed forces. In response, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and the Chief of Staff UNTSO attempted to secure the implementation of a plan for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and the removal of Egyptian forces from prohibited positions. Articles VII and VIII of the Egypt-Israel GAA established a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) centred on El-Auja and forbade the presence of armed forces. It also prohibited Egypt from maintaining positions in an adjoining area west of the demilitarized zone, and limited the arms and troops in the Defensive Areas on both sides of the Line. Both Egypt and Israel had indicated to the Secretary-General their willingness to comply fully with these two articles, within the framework of a return to full compliance with the Armistice Agreement. The Israeli Government gave assurances of its complete acceptance in principle of the plan. The agreed withdrawal, however, never took place. The 1956 invasion of Egypt by British, French and Israeli forces, followed Egypt&#x27;s decision on 26 July 1956 to nationalize the Suez Canal.

===Suez Crisis to Six Day War===
After the 1956 War (often referred to as the Suez Crisis), UNTSO greatly assisted the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF); in large measure the result of diplomatic efforts of the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and a proposal from Canadian minister of external affairs Lester Pearson, by providing a group of trained military personnel for peacekeeping and emergency operations to UNEF.

Israel, after the 1956 war, subsequently ceased all cooperation/participation in its Israeli-Egyptian MAC. On 8 November, the Israeli representative informed the Secretary-General that his Government would withdraw its forces from Egypt immediately after the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements with the United Nations in connection with the Emergency International Force. As a result, according to the United Nations, arrangements were made through which, &quot;without any change of the legal structure or status of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the functions of UNTSO in the Gaza area were placed under the operational control of UNEF&quot;. A close co-operation between UNTSO and UNEF was to be maintained.

The General Assembly, on 19 January 1957, noted &quot;with regret and concern the failure of Israel to withdraw from Egyptian territory&quot;. Later, on 2 February 1957, the council deplored the&quot; non-compliance of Israel with regard to completion of its withdrawal and called upon Israel to complete its withdrawal without delay&quot;. On 6 March 1957, General Burns was able to report to the Secretary-General of the UN that the &quot;United Nations Emergency Force troops are now in position in all camps and centres of population in Gaza Strip&quot;. The staged withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, with the exception of an Israel troop unit at Rafah camp, at 0400 GMT on 7 March 1957 was carried out according to plan and without incidents. By agreement, that last Israel element was withdrawn by 1600 GMT on 8 March and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Sharm al Shaikh area was effected at the same time. In the following years, the Israel-Egypt MAC remained inactive, with only Egyptians and UN personnel taking part. 

In this period, the Lebanese sector was relatively calm compared to subsequent events in that area. The Israel-Lebanon MAC met regularly and had developed a routine for handling incidents that occurred. In the Jordanian and Syrian sectors were the scene of frequent and often serious incidents and both the Israel-Jordan and the Israel-Syria MAC&#x27;s were quite active in pursuance of their mandate in responding to issues, with several incidents evolving regarding land use around Jerusalem and in the Hula area, and the movement of supply convoys to the Israeli enclave at Mount Scopus. During one of these incidents around Mount Scopus, a military observer, Canadian Lieutenant Colonel George Flint, was killed.

In response to Israeli activities in the DMZ between the armistice demarcation lines in the Government House area in Jerusalem, Jordan complained to UN. This resulted in the Security Council adopting Resolution 127 (1958) on 22 January 1958, noting that the status of the zone is affected by the provisions of the Israel-Jordan GAAs and that neither Israel nor Jordan enjoys sovereignty over any part of the zone and directing the Chief of Staff of UNTSO in Palestine to regulate activities in the zone. 

In June 1958, UNTSO personnel were used to quickly raise the United Nations Observation Group in Lebanon, a short lived mission that was sent to Lebanon over the period June – December 1958 during the 1958 Lebanon crisis.

On 17 March 1961, the Israelis undertook a dress rehearsal for a military parade in the Israeli-occupied part of the Jerusalem, in which heavy military armaments were displayed. In response, Jordan complained to the MAC. On 20 March 1961, the Mixed Armistice Commission decided that &quot;this act by Israel is a breach of the General Armistice Agreement&quot;. The MAC also condemned the parade and called upon the Israeli authorities to take the strongest measures to prevent a recurrence of such a breach of the GAA and to refrain in the future from bringing to Jerusalem any equipment that was in excess of that allowed for under the terms of the GAA. The Israeli authorities still contemplated holding the full dress military parade on 20 April 1961 in the Israeli-occupied part of Jerusalem. The Security Council, on 11 April 1961, adopted Resolution 162 (1961); this endorsed the 20 March 1961 decision of the MAC; relating to the military parade contemplated for 20 April 1961 in the Israel-occupied part of Jerusalem, and urged Israel to comply with the decision of the MAC made on 20 March 1961.

The Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement provided for a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the Hula Lake area at the foot of the Golan Heights, a zone which encompassed the area of Palestine as defined in the League of Nations Mandate occupied by Syrian forces at the time of the armistice. Civilian construction and land use in the DMZ caused numerous incidents around this time due to disputes over land ownership even though UNTSO was tasked with attempting to regulate activities leading to such disputes in the zone. After heavy fighting broke out between Israel and Syria in the DMZ, the Security Council in Resolutions 92 (1951) and 93 (1951) of 8 and 18 May 1951 called upon the parties to cease fighting and endorsed the request of the Chief of Staff of UNTSO that the Israeli company involved be instructed to cease all operations in the DMZ until such time as an agreement is arranged through the Chairman of the MAC for continuing its project. In Resolution 111 (1956) of 19 January 1956, the Security Council dealt with the confrontation which had escalated following interference by the Syrian authorities with legitimate Israeli activities on Lake Tiberias. It condemned as &quot;in no way justified&quot; the Israeli action taken in response to that interference in the form of an attack by Israeli regular army forces against Syrian regular army forces on Syrian territory. It also noted that in violation of the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement concerning the DMZ, the Zone had been crossed by the Israeli forces that entered Syria.

Following a prolonged military confrontation between the parties, the Security Council was again involved in the Israel – Syria situation in 1962 in the light of a report by the Chief of Staff of UNTSO on the military activities in the Lake Tiberias area and in the DMZ. The council in Resolution 171 (1962) of 9 April 1962 noted with satisfaction that a cease fire had been achieved. It deplored the hostile exchanges which had taken place and called upon the governments concerned to comply with the General Armistice Agreement. It determined that an Israeli attack on 16–17 March had been a flagrant violation of the previous resolution (111), and called on Israel scrupulously to refrain from such action in the future. It also called upon both parties to abide scrupulously by the cease fire arranged by the Chief of Staff of UNTSO, and called specifically for strict observance of the article of the GAA which provides for the exclusion of armed forces from the demilitarized zone, and of the annex to the GAA which sets limits on forces in the defensive area.

On 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War, Comdt Thomas Wickham of the Irish Defense Forces was shot dead in Syria.

===Six Day War to Yom Kippur War (1967 to 1973)===
The period between the Six-Day War of June 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, UNTSO performed a vital function of helping to establish and supervise ceasefire agreements which included new boundaries between the countries. Even though there was no change to UNTSO&#x27;s mission, the execution of its original mission became nearly impossible with the advent of the newly drawn ceasefire lines between Israel and Egypt-Jordan-Syria respectively.

Additionally, UNTSO did not have the MACs to supervise since Israel abrogated its initial agreement to the Armistice as conceived. Realizing the changing political situation, the UN Security Council added some new tasks to the UNTSO Charter on the first few months following the 1967 ceasefire. Specifically, in the Egypt-Israel and Israel-Syria fronts, UNTSO established observation posts (OPs): a total of 15 were established along the Suez, while 16 were established in the Golan Heights. These posts remained in effect until the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. The UN offices established in Amman and Gaza (before the 1967 War) were allowed to continue to function as Liaison Offices, even though the MAC concept had become defunct.

At the urging of the Lebanese government, UNTSO created an observation operation along the Lebanese border (1949 Armistice Demarcation line) in the spring of 1972. Due to the Palestinian activity in South Lebanon and the potential Israeli reprisal against their encampments, UNTSO felt the potential for further conflict warranted the additional OPs. At this time, posts were established at El Khiam, Maroun Er Ras, and at Naquora.

===Yom Kippur to the Israel–Lebanon War===
As a result of the Yom Kippur War, the positions occupied by the UN military observers in the Middle East were drastically affected. A total of eight OPs were abandoned at this time; however, most OPs are still located in the same place today. In the Egyptian-Israeli sector, UNTSO personnel were structured around the Observer &quot;Group&quot; concept and placed under the UN Peace-Keeping Forces that occupied the region. Observer Group Sinai was formed and attached to the Second United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). The Charter for UNEF II expired on 24 July 1979 which only left UNTSO&#x27;s presence. The observers were then restructured on new OPs which were located on vantage points throughout the Sinai peninsula. For the Sinai Group, their main office was located in Cairo (in 1993 it was moved to Ismailia, closer to the OPs). On the Israeli-Syria border, UNTSO&#x27;s ceasefire observation and supervision mission continued but with a readjusted ceasefire line. Observer Groups Damascus and Golan (Syrian sector) were established as a result of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).

Shortly after the 1973 war, U.S. participation in UNTSO expanded to twenty-five officers. The U.S. Marine Corps portion was six. Approximately the same period, the Soviets made a surprise move and announced their support of UNTSO and likewise wanted to provide observers. To keep a balanced presence between the east–west Superpowers—the Soviet participation was set at the same level as the United States (which was twenty-five each at that time). Subsequent to the 1973 agreement, the number of observers for all countries participating increased. As a result, the number of personnel to be provided by Soviet Union and the United States was re-established at thirty-six each. Since U.S. personnel were not allowed in Lebanon (a limitation set forth by U.S. Secretary of Defence Frank Carlucci, due to the threat to U.S. personnel), at this time there was a move to reduce U.S. participation to UNTSO. As a corollary, this also required a reduction in the numbers of Soviet observers. This reduction was delayed due to a lengthy diplomatic process.

===After the Lebanon War===
The Israeli-Lebanese conflict commenced in the late 1970s, ending the relative stability of the demarcation line along that front. It provided the latest major change to UNTSO&#x27;s structure. After the outbreak of the Civil War in Lebanon and the Israeli invasion of Southern Lebanon (March 1978), the United Nations established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). UNTSO&#x27;s observers were thus reorganized into Observer Group Lebanon (OGL) to assist UNIFIL. September 1982 saw a low point for UNTSO with the deaths of four of its unarmed officer observers—one Finn, one Irishman, and two Americans—in a landmine explosion just outside Beirut. As the Israelis advanced north, the position of Observer Group Lebanon was adjusted. In the early 1980s, the headquarters of the Israel-Lebanon Mixed Armistice Commission (ILMAC) which was already located in Beirut, was also tasked with being the United Nations Liaison Office Beirut (UNLOB). Under the close supervision of UNTSO&#x27;s Chief-of-Staff, UNLOB/ILMAC functioned as a dual purpose headquarters/ liaison office for both UNTSO and UNIFIL.

With the establishment of the non-UN Multinational Force and Observers mission in the Sinai in 1981, UNTSO&#x27;s Observer Group Sinai was retained to maintain a UN presence in the area.

Four unarmed UN peacekeepers from Austria, China, Finland and Canada were killed during an Israeli air strike on 25 July 2006, which struck a UN OP at Khiam.

==Headquarters==

Cairo was the initial headquarters of UNTSO. This was moved, shortly after its creation, to Haifa (a British enclave in this time), in late June 1948. The Haifa HQ was evacuated on 9 July due to renewed fighting. With the return of UN peacekeeping forces to Israel on 21 July 1948, UNTSO headquarters was moved again on 7 October 1948 for the third and final time to the former British High Commissioner&#x27;s headquarters in Jerusalem.

UNTSO also has offices in Beirut, Ismailia and Damascus.

==Contributing countries==
Military personnel allocated to UNTSO have come from many nations over the course of the mission&#x27;s history. The United States, Belgium and France provided the initial groups of observers until 1953, but as the Cold War developed the number of personnel committed by the US and France was reduced. From 1953, other nations began contributing observers. Notably, Sweden has provided the most number of chiefs of staff. The Soviet Union first deployed personnel after the 1973 Arab–Israeli war. In 2020, the following nations contributed personnel: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bhutan, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Fiji, Gambia, Ireland, India, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. Britain is the only permanent member of the Security Council that does not currently provide personnel to the mission.

==Today==
UNTSO personnel have also been available at short notice to form the nucleus of other peacekeeping operations. The availability of UNTSO&#x27;s military observers for almost immediate deployment after the Security Council had acted to create a new operation has been an enormous contributory factor to the success of those operations.

According to the United Nations, &quot;the military observers are unarmed and they carry out their jobs by observing and reporting violations of the agreements of ceasefire, disengagement etc. that are relevant to their area of operations. All military observers are seasoned officers of the rank of captain or major coming from all branches of service in their respective countries armed forces. The military observers work in multi-national teams, so that any observations will always be confirmed by at least two observers from different nations, as a measure to ensure impartiality&quot;.

UNTSO currently provides military observers to three different UN missions in the area: Observer Group Lebanon (OGL), supporting UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon; Observer Group Golan (OGG), supporting UNDOF in the Golan Heights; and Observer Group Egypt (OGE) in the Sinai Peninsula.

OGG, who has its headquarters co-located with UNDOF HQ in Camp Faouar in Syria, is split into two outstations; OGG-D (Observer Group Golan – Damascus) based in Damascus, Syria and OGG-T (Observer Group Golan – Tiberias) based in Tiberias, Israel. Each outstation maintains &quot;a number of observation posts on each side of the Area of Separation (AOS) that was put in place as part of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement between Syria and Israel following the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The military observers carry-out fortnightly inspections inside the Area of Limitations (AOL) to verify, that both sides adhere to the limitations on troop levels and military equipment within 10, 20 and 25 km zones from the AOS as prescribed by the 1974 Disengagement Agreement&quot;.

OGL HQ are co-located with UNIFIL HQ in Naqoura, Southern Lebanon. OGL occupies several patrol bases along the &quot;Blue Line&quot; – a demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon.

OGE is based in Ismalia by the Suez Canal in Egypt. OGE conducts short and long-range patrols in the Sinai Peninsula.

==International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers==
The United Nations has designated 29 May as the &quot;International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.&quot; On that day in 2008 the sixtieth anniversary of the first United Nations Peacekeeping Forces being deployed was celebrated. In a press release, the UN announced:

Sixty years ago on that date, the United Nations Security Council established the first peacekeeping operation, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), based in the Middle East. In 2001, the General Assembly proclaimed 29 May as the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers to pay tribute to the men and women who serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations and honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace.

<doc id="61162" wikidata="Q207051" url="?curid=61162" title="Taurine">
<text>Taurine (), or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is a non-proteinogenic naturally occurring amino sulfonic acid that is widely distributed in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine, and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight.

Taurine is named after Latin (cognate to Ancient Greek , ) meaning bull or ox, as it was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin. It was discovered in human bile in 1846 by Edmund Ronalds.

Although taurine is abundant in human organs with diverse putative roles, it is not an essential human dietary nutrient and is not included among nutrients with a recommended intake level. Taurine is synthesized naturally in the human liver from methionine and cysteine.

Taurine is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, but there is no good clinical evidence that taurine supplements provide any benefit to human health. Taurine is used as a food additive for cats (who require it as an essential nutrient), dogs, and poultry.

Taurine concentrations in land plants are low or undetectable, but up to wet weight have been found in algae.

==Chemical and biochemical features==
Taurine exists as a zwitterion , as verified by X-ray crystallography. The sulfonic acid has a low p&quot;K&quot;a ensuring that it is fully ionized to the sulfonate at the pHs found in the intestinal tract.

===Synthesis===
Synthetic taurine is obtained by the ammonolysis of isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous sodium bisulfite. A direct approach involves the reaction of aziridine with sulfurous acid.

In 1993, about of taurine were produced for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications. As of 2010, China alone has more than 40 manufacturers of taurine. Most of these enterprises employ the ethanolamine method to produce a total annual production of about .

In the laboratory, taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.

===Biosynthesis===
Taurine is naturally derived from cysteine. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the liver via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. In this pathway, cysteine is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase.

Taurine is also produced by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine into cystathionine. The cystathionine is then converted to hypotaurine by the sequential action of three enzymes: cystathionine gamma-lyase, cysteine dioxygenase, and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above.

A pathway for taurine biosynthesis from serine and sulfate is reported in microalgae, developing chicken embryos, and chick liver. Serine dehydratase converts serine to 2-aminoacrylate, which is converted to cysteic acid by 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate:2-aminoacrylate &quot;C&quot;-sulfotransferase. Cysteic acid is converted to taurine by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase.

==In food==
Taurine occurs naturally in fish and meat. The mean daily intake from omnivore diets was determined to be around (range ), and to be low or negligible from a vegan diet. Typical taurine consumption in the American diet is about per day.

Taurine is partially destroyed by heat in processes such as baking and boiling. This is a concern for cat food, as cats have a dietary requirement for taurine and can easily become deficient. Either raw feeding or supplementing taurine can satisfy this requirement.

Both lysine and taurine can mask the metallic flavor of potassium chloride, a salt substitute.

===Breast milk===
Prematurely born infants are believed to lack the enzymes needed to convert cystathionine to cysteine, and may, therefore, become deficient in taurine. Taurine is present in breast milk, and has been added to many infant formulas as a measure of prudence since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.

===Energy drinks and dietary supplements===
Taurine is an ingredient in some energy drinks in amounts of per serving. A 1999 assessment of European consumption of energy drinks found that taurine intake was per day.

==Research==
Taurine is not regarded as an essential human dietary nutrient and has not been assigned recommended intake levels. High-quality clinical studies to determine possible effects of taurine in the body or following dietary supplementation are absent from the literature. Preliminary human studies on the possible effects of taurine supplementation have been inadequate due to low subject numbers, inconsistent designs, and variable doses.

==Safety and toxicity==
According to the European Food Safety Authority, taurine is &quot;considered to be a skin and eye irritant and skin sensitiser, and to be hazardous if inhaled;&quot; it may be safe to consume up to 6 grams of taurine per day. Other sources indicate that taurine is safe for supplemental intake in normal healthy adults at up to 3 grams per day.

A 2008 review found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, concluding, &quot;The amounts of guarana, taurine, and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefits or adverse events&quot;.

==Animal dietary requirement==
=== Cats ===
Cats lack the enzyme sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to produce taurine and must therefore acquire it from their diet. A taurine deficiency in cats can lead to retinal degeneration and eventually blindness – a condition known as central retinal degeneration as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Other effects of a diet lacking in this essential amino acid are dilated cardiomyopathy, and reproductive failure in female cats.

Decreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation.

Taurine is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in dry food and 0.2% in wet food. Studies suggest the amino acid should be supplied at of bodyweight per day for domestic cats.

=== Other mammals ===
A number of other mammals also have a requirement for taurine. While the majority of dogs can synthesize taurine, case reports have described a singular American cocker spaniel, 19 Newfoundland dogs, and a family of golden retrievers suffering from taurine deficiency treatable with supplementation. Foxes on fur farms also appear to require dietary taurine. The rhesus, cebus and cynomolgus monkeys each require taurine at least in infancy. The giant anteater also requires taurine.

=== Birds ===
Taurine appears to be essential for the development of passerine birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich spiders to feed their young, particularly just after hatching. Researchers compared the behaviours and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found the juveniles fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks. Under natural conditions, each blue tit nestling receive of taurine per day from parents.

Taurine can be synthesized by chickens. Supplementation has no effect on chickens raised under adequate lab conditions, but seems to help with growth under stresses such as heat and dense housing.

=== Fish ===
Species of fish, mostly carnivorous ones, show reduced growth and survival when the fish-based feed in their food is replaced with soy meal or feather meal. Taurine has been identified as the factor responsible for this phenomenon; supplementation of taurine to plant-based fish feed reverses these effects. Future aquaculture is expected to use more of these more environmentally-friendly protein sources, so supplementation would become more important.

The need of taurine in fish is conditional, differing by species and growth stage. The olive flounder, for example, has lower capacity to synthesize taurine compared to the rainbow trout. Juvenile fish are less efficient at taurine biosyntheis due to reduced cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase levels.

<text>Jamshied Sharifi (born October 17, 1960) is a Tony Award-winning American composer, conductor, musician, and record producer. Born in Topeka, Kansas to an Iranian father and an American mother, Sharifi was exposed to music at an early age, learning Jazz and Middle Eastern music through his father and European classical and church music through his mother. He began to study classical piano at age five and quickly developed a thirst for musical instruction and a desire to improvise. At age nine he began studying guitar and drums, and at age ten added flute.

==Biography==
After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in humanities, Sharifi went on to further his musical education at Berklee College of Music in Boston. At Berklee, he studied Jazz Piano and Composition as well as Film Scoring, and in 1983, he received the Outstanding Jazz Pianist award at the Collegiate Jazz Festival held at the University of Notre Dame. He studied with noted trumpeter and Charlie Parker sideman Herb Pomeroy, and after graduation from Berklee, Pomeroy asked Sharifi to lead the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble, a post Pomeroy had held for twenty-two years. From 1985–1992, under Sharifi&#x27;s direction and leadership, the group recorded two CDs, performed twenty of his compositions, and won the prestigious Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival in 1991. During this time, Sharifi also taught in the Music Synthesis and Ensemble Departments at Berklee. In 1992, he left his teaching positions in Boston and moved to New York City in search of new musical endeavors and opportunities.

Sharifi began to focus his attention on film soundtracks. His foray into the world of film and television began as a keyboardist and orchestrator for Michael Gibbs. Together they scored three feature films and fifteen one-hour television shows. Sharifi went on to compose the soundtracks to many major studio and independent films including &quot;Muppets From Space&quot;, &quot;Down To Earth&quot;, Nickelodeon film &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; and the Paramount/Nickelodeon film &quot;Clockstoppers&quot;, and contributed to the scores of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&quot; and &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;
And while Sharifi&#x27;s initial focus in music can be credited to American jazz, it is his infusions of elements from the Middle East and Africa that make his music distinctive. He is an accomplished pianist and synthesizer player. Notably, Sharifi holds the synthesizer to an &#x27;acoustic&#x27; standard and aims to play it with the detail and richness of articulation that comes naturally to an acoustic instrumentalist. To achieve this sound he uses a controller which allows him to manipulate the synthesizer with his breath. He combines this technique with a ribbon controller that allows him to bend the pitch smoothly and continuously with his finger. According to Jamshied, using both these techniques makes the instrument a &quot;wind-driven, fretless synthesizer&quot;.

In addition to creating his own albums and scoring films, Sharifi has arranged and produced albums for many artists, including Tibetan vocalist Yungchen Lhamo, and Persian vocalist Mamak Khadem. He has also recorded four albums with world fusion band Mo Boma. His first solo album, &quot;A Prayer for the Soul of Layla&quot;, received critical acclaim including Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 1st Annual New Age Voice Music Awards. His next release &quot;One&quot; continues to explore his inimitable approach to music. &quot;For both One and A Prayer for the Soul of Layla, the inspiration has been to make music true to my heart and interests&quot; says Sharifi. &quot;I have had the opportunity to work on a number of different musical projects, very often helping another artist to realize his or her vision. These records reflect my ongoing love for and exploration of music outside of what we think of as Western music.”

For Dream Theater&#x27;s album &quot;Octavarium&quot;, he arranged and conducted for various orchestra instruments, including strings and horns. On April 1, 2006, he conducted the orchestra for the Dream Theater 20th Anniversary World Tour performance at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. This concert was released on the Dream Theater CD/DVD Score.

Jamshied Sharifi&#x27;s first record, &quot;A Prayer for the Soul of Layla&quot;, was inspired by his daughter, Layla Sakamoto Sharifi.

He won a Tony Award in 2018 for his orchestration of The Band&#x27;s Visit.

==Appearance in film==
Three of Sharifi&#x27;s songs – &quot;The Complicated Man&quot;, &quot;UFO Get-Go&quot; and &quot;Back Porch&quot; – appeared in the film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;.

At the request of MIT Wind Ensemble music director Frederick Harris, Sharifi composed music about the Arab Spring for a spring concert which PBS affiliate WGBH filmed and aired on May 31, 2013. The film won a New England Emmy Award.

For MIT&#x27;s 2020 virtual commencement ceremony, Sharifi&#x27;s &quot;To the Light, To the Flame&quot; was recorded by dozens of musicians from remote locations during quarantine.

For MIT&#x27;s 2021 virtual commencement ceremony, Sharifi&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Pandemic Year&quot; was recorded by dozens of musicians at several venues on MIT&#x27;s campus.

<text>In electronics and telecommunications, a radio transmitter or just transmitter (often abbreviated as XMTR or TX in technical documents) is an electronic device which produces radio waves with an antenna with the purpose of signal transmission up to a radio receiver. The transmitter itself generates a radio frequency alternating current, which is applied to the antenna. When excited by this alternating current, the antenna radiates radio waves.

Transmitters are necessary component parts of all electronic devices that communicate by radio, such as radio (audio) and television broadcasting stations, cell phones, walkie-talkies, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door openers, two-way radios in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, radar sets and navigational beacons. The term &quot;transmitter&quot; is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for communication purposes; or radiolocation, such as radar and navigational transmitters. Generators of radio waves for heating or industrial purposes, such as microwave ovens or diathermy equipment, are not usually called transmitters, even though they often have similar circuits.

The term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a broadcast transmitter, a transmitter used in broadcasting, as in &quot;FM radio transmitter&quot; or television transmitter. This usage typically includes both the transmitter proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.

==Description== 
A transmitter can be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electrical circuit within another electronic device. A transmitter and a receiver combined in one unit is called a transceiver. The purpose of most transmitters is radio communication of information over a distance. The information is provided to the transmitter in the form of an electronic signal called the modulation signal, such as an audio (sound) signal from a microphone, a video (TV) signal from a video camera, or in wireless networking devices, a digital signal from a computer. The transmitter generates a radio frequency signal which when applied to the antenna produces the radio waves, called the carrier signal. It combines the carrier with the modulation signal, a process called modulation. The information can be added to the carrier in several different ways, in different types of transmitters. In an amplitude modulation (AM) transmitter, the information is added to the radio signal by varying its amplitude. In a frequency modulation (FM) transmitter, it is added by varying the radio signal&#x27;s frequency slightly. Many other types of modulation are also used.

The radio signal from the transmitter is applied to the antenna, which radiates the energy as radio waves. The antenna may be enclosed inside the case or attached to the outside of the transmitter, as in portable devices such as cell phones, walkie-talkies, and garage door openers. In more powerful transmitters, the antenna may be located on top of a building or on a separate tower, and connected to the transmitter by a feed line, that is a transmission line.


==Operation==

Electromagnetic waves are radiated by electric charges when they are accelerated. Radio waves, electromagnetic waves of radio frequency, are generated by time-varying electric currents, consisting of electrons flowing through a metal conductor called an antenna which are changing their velocity and thus accelerating. An alternating current flowing back and forth in an antenna will create an oscillating magnetic field around the conductor. The alternating voltage will also charge the ends of the conductor alternately positive and negative, creating an oscillating electric field around the conductor. If the frequency of the oscillations is high enough, in the radio frequency range above about 20 kHz, the oscillating coupled electric and magnetic fields will radiate away from the antenna into space as an electromagnetic wave, a radio wave.

A radio transmitter is an electronic circuit which transforms electric power from a power source, a battery or mains power, into a radio frequency alternating current to apply to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the energy from this current as radio waves. The transmitter also encodes information such as an audio or video signal into the radio frequency current to be carried by the radio waves. When they strike the antenna of a radio receiver, the waves excite similar (but less powerful) radio frequency currents in it. The radio receiver extracts the information from the received waves.

===Components===
A practical radio transmitter mainly consists of the following parts:

*In high power transmitters, a power supply circuit to transform the input electrical power to the higher voltages needed to produce the required power output.
*An electronic oscillator circuit to generate the radio frequency signal. This usually generates a sine wave of constant amplitude, called the carrier wave because it produces the radio waves which &quot;carry&quot; the information through space. In most modern transmitters, this is a crystal oscillator in which the frequency is precisely controlled by the vibrations of a quartz crystal. The frequency of the carrier wave is considered the frequency of the transmitter.
*A modulator circuit to add the information to be transmitted to the carrier wave produced by the oscillator. This is done by varying some aspect of the carrier wave. The information is provided to the transmitter as an electronic signal called the modulation signal. The modulation signal may be an audio signal, which represents sound, a video signal which represents moving images, or for data in the form of a binary digital signal which represents a sequence of bits, a bitstream. Different types of transmitters use different modulation methods to transmit information: 
**In an AM (amplitude modulation) transmitter the amplitude (strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the modulation signal.
**In an FM (frequency modulation) transmitter the frequency of the carrier is varied by the modulation signal.
**In an FSK (frequency-shift keying) transmitter, which transmits digital data, the frequency of the carrier is shifted between two frequencies which represent the two binary digits, 0 and 1. 
**OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) is a family of complicated digital modulation methods very widely used in high bandwidth systems such as Wi-Fi networks, cellphones, digital television broadcasting, and digital audio broadcasting (DAB) to transmit digital data using a minimum of radio spectrum bandwidth. OFDM has higher spectral efficiency and more resistance to fading than AM or FM. In OFDM multiple radio carrier waves closely spaced in frequency are transmitted within the radio channel, with each carrier modulated with bits from the incoming bitstream so multiple bits are being sent simultaneously, in parallel. At the receiver the carriers are demodulated and the bits are combined in the proper order into one bitstream. 
:Many other types of modulation are also used. In large transmitters the oscillator and modulator together are often referred to as the &quot;exciter&quot;.
*A radio frequency (RF) amplifier to increase the power of the signal, to increase the range of the radio waves.
*An impedance matching (antenna tuner) circuit to transform the output impedance of the transmitter to match the impedance of the antenna (or the transmission line to the antenna), to transfer power efficiently to the antenna. If these impedances are not equal, it causes a condition called standing waves, in which the power is reflected back from the antenna toward the transmitter, wasting power and sometimes overheating the transmitter.
In higher frequency transmitters, in the UHF and microwave range, free running oscillators are unstable at the output frequency. Older designs used an oscillator at a lower frequency, which was multiplied by frequency multipliers to get a signal at the desired frequency. Modern designs more commonly use an oscillator at the operating frequency which is stabilized by phase locking to a very stable lower frequency reference, usually a crystal oscillator.

==Regulation==
Two radio transmitters in the same area that attempt to transmit on the same frequency will interfere with each other, causing garbled reception, so neither transmission may be received clearly. Interference with radio transmissions can not only have a large economic cost, it can be life-threatening (for example, in the case of interference with emergency communications or air traffic control).
For this reason, in most countries, use of transmitters is strictly controlled by law. Transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use such as broadcast, marine radio, Airband, Amateur and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels. A body called the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocates the frequency bands in the radio spectrum to various classes of users. In some classes, each transmitter is given a unique call sign consisting of a string of letters and numbers which must be used as an identifier in transmissions. The operator of the transmitter usually must hold a government license, such as a general radiotelephone operator license, which is obtained by passing a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.

Exceptions to the above regulations allow the unlicensed use of low-power short-range transmitters in consumer products such as cell phones, cordless telephones, wireless microphones, walkie-talkies, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, garage door openers, and baby monitors. In the US, these fall under Part 15 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Although they can be operated without a license, these devices still generally must be type-approved before sale.

==History==

The first primitive radio transmitters (called spark gap transmitters) were built by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887 during his pioneering investigations of radio waves. These generated radio waves by a high voltage spark between two conductors. Beginning in 1895, Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio communication systems using these transmitters, and radio began to be used commercially around 1900. Spark transmitters could not transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy: the operator tapped on a telegraph key which turned the transmitter on-and-off to produce radio wave pulses spelling out text messages in telegraphic code, usually Morse code. At the receiver, these pulses were sometimes directly recorded on paper tapes, but more common was audible reception. The pulses were audible as beeps in the receiver&#x27;s earphones, which were translated back to text by an operator who knew Morse code. These spark-gap transmitters were used during the first three decades of radio (1887–1917), called the wireless telegraphy or &quot;spark&quot; era. Because they generated damped waves, spark transmitters were electrically &quot;noisy&quot;. Their energy was spread over a broad band of frequencies, creating radio noise which interfered with other transmitters. Damped wave emissions were banned by international law in 1934.

Two short-lived competing transmitter technologies came into use after the turn of the century, which were the first continuous wave transmitters: the arc converter (Poulsen arc) in 1904 and the Alexanderson alternator around 1910, which were used into the 1920s.

All these early technologies were replaced by vacuum tube transmitters in the 1920s, which used the feedback oscillator invented by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner around 1912, based on the Audion (triode) vacuum tube invented by Lee De Forest in 1906. Vacuum tube transmitters were inexpensive and produced continuous waves, and could be easily modulated to transmit audio (sound) using amplitude modulation (AM). This made AM radio broadcasting possible, which began in about 1920. Practical frequency modulation (FM) transmission was invented by Edwin Armstrong in 1933, who showed that it was less vulnerable to noise and static than AM. The first FM radio station was licensed in 1937. Experimental television transmission had been conducted by radio stations since the late 1920s, but practical television broadcasting didn&#x27;t begin until the late 1930s. The development of radar during World War II motivated the evolution of high frequency transmitters in the UHF and microwave ranges, using new active devices such as the magnetron, klystron, and traveling wave tube.

The invention of the transistor allowed the development in the 1960s of small portable transmitters such as wireless microphones, garage door openers and walkie-talkies. The development of the integrated circuit (IC) in the 1970s made possible the current proliferation of wireless devices, such as cell phones and Wi-Fi networks, in which integrated digital transmitters and receivers (wireless modems) in portable devices operate automatically, in the background, to exchange data with wireless networks.

The need to conserve bandwidth in the increasingly congested radio spectrum is driving the development of new types of transmitters such as spread spectrum, trunked radio systems and cognitive radio. A related trend has been an ongoing transition from analog to digital radio transmission methods. Digital modulation can have greater spectral efficiency than analog modulation; that is it can often transmit more information (data rate) in a given bandwidth than analog, using data compression algorithms. Other advantages of digital transmission are increased noise immunity, and greater flexibility and processing power of digital signal processing integrated circuits.

<text>Daniel Louis Castellaneta ( ; born October 29, 1957) is an American actor and writer. He is best known for voicing Homer Simpson on the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (as well as other characters on the show such as Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, Itchy, and Barney Gumble). Castellaneta is also known for voicing Grandpa in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, and has had voice roles in several other programs, including &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Sibs&quot;, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Dynamo Duck&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, and &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;.

In 1999, he appeared in the Christmas special &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot; and won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman. Castellaneta released a comedy album &quot;I Am Not Homer&quot;, and wrote and starred in a one-person show titled &quot;Where Did Vincent van Gogh?&quot;

==Early life==
Daniel Louis Castellaneta was born on October 29, 1957, at Roseland Community Hospital on Chicago&#x27;s south side and was raised in River Forest and Oak Park, Illinois. He is of Italian descent, born to Elsie (; 1926–2008) and Louis Castellaneta (1915–2014), an amateur actor who worked for a printing company.

Castellaneta became adept at impressions at a young age and his mother enrolled him in an acting class when he was 16 years old. He would listen to his father&#x27;s comedy records and do impressions of the artists. He was a &quot;devotee&quot; of the works of many performers, including Alan Arkin and Barbara Harris and directors Mike Nichols and Elaine May. He attended Oak Park and River Forest High School and upon graduation, started attending Northern Illinois University (NIU) in the fall of 1975.

Castellaneta studied art education, with the goal of becoming an art teacher. He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions. Castellaneta was a regular participant in &quot;The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show&quot;, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled &quot;We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing a voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn&#x27;t care. It was that we got a chance to do it and write our own material.&quot; He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would &quot;fall on his face with improvisation&quot; but soon &quot;was churning out material faster than [they] could make it work.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career===
Castellaneta began his acting career after his graduation from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He decided that if his career went nowhere he would still have a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. He started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations.

He auditioned for a role in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Castellaneta is most famous for his roles on the longest-running American animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, most notably as Homer Simpson. &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson respectively, rather than hire more actors. Homer&#x27;s voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not &quot;get enough power behind that voice&quot; and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions.

He tried to find something easier, so he &quot;dropped the voice down&quot;, and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. To perform Homer&#x27;s voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to &quot;let his IQ go.&quot;

Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer&#x27;s fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, &quot;except, maybe, by a die-hard fan.&quot;
Castellaneta also provides the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, Arnie Pye, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty&#x27;s voice is based on Chicago television&#x27;s Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV&#x27;s Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. During early recording sessions, he recorded a new version of Barney&#x27;s loud trademark belch for every episode but discovered that it was not easy for him to belch each time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard.

Groundskeeper Willie&#x27;s first appearance was in the season two episode &quot;Principal Charming&quot;. The character was written as an angry janitor, and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a &quot;big dumb Swede&quot;, which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of a grumpy Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show &quot;Second City Television&quot;, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas.

Mayor Quimby, who first appeared in &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;, is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel&#x27;s voice is Castellaneta&#x27;s impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Hapless Gil Gunderson is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon&#x27;s portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. Showrunner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be &quot;a one-shot thing&quot; but &quot;Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in.&quot; The Blue-Haired Lawyer&#x27;s voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.

Castellaneta has won several awards for voicing Homer, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;Outstanding Voice-Over Performance&quot; in 1992 for &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot;, 1993 for &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, 2004 for voicing several characters in &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;, and 2009 for voicing Homer in &quot;Father Knows Worst&quot;.

In 1993, Castellaneta was given a special Annie Award, &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field of Animation&quot;, for his work as Homer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 2004, Castellaneta and Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge) won a Young Artist Award for &quot;Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series&quot;. Homer was placed second on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 2002 Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters, and in 2000, Homer and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

Until 1998, Castellaneta was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was soon resolved and Castellaneta began receiving $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the cast demanded to be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, with Castellaneta starting to earn $250,000 per episode. Following salary negotiations in 2008, the cast received approximately $400,000 per episode. In 2011, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast accepted a pay cut to around $300,000 per episode.

In the early 1990s, Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta wrote a script for an episode in which Barney becomes sober, and pitched it to showrunner Al Jean. He liked the story but turned it down because he felt that it was too similar to &quot;Duffless&quot;, an episode that the writers were already working on. The two waited for nearly a decade and offered an updated version of the script to later showrunner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the episode &quot;Days of Wine and D&#x27;oh&#x27;ses&quot;. Castellaneta and his wife have also written the episodes &quot;Gump Roast&quot;, &quot;The Ziff Who Came to Dinner&quot;, &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore&quot;, and &quot;The Fight Before Christmas&quot;. In 2007, they were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for the episode &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore&quot;. Castellaneta is also credited as a consulting producer.

===Further career===

Castellaneta has been a regular cast member in several other television series. In 1991, he played Warren Morris in the short-lived ABC live-action sitcom &quot;Sibs&quot;. Heide Perlman, creator of &quot;Sibs&quot;, wrote the part with Castellaneta in mind.

He provided the voice of the eponymous character in &quot;The Adventures of Dynamo Duck&quot;, Megavolt in &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;Doc&quot; Emmett Brown in &quot;Back to the Future: The Animated Series&quot;, the lead character in &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; and several characters, including Grandpa Phil and the Jolly Olly Man, the mentally unstable ice cream truck driver, on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. He guest starred as The Robot Devil in five episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, as well as the &quot;Futurama&quot; film &quot;The Beast with a Billion Backs&quot;.

Castellaneta has also made guest appearances in a number of television series episodes. In 1992, he guest-starred in an episode of the legal drama &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, as a Homer Simpson meetable character at a California amusement park who is dismissed for inappropriate behavior while in costume. 
In 1996, he made a guest appearance as a Zoo Keeper in Season 2, Episode 12 &quot;The One After the Superbowl&quot; in Friends.
In 2005, he appeared in the episode &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot; in &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as Dr. Stein, a deadpan incompetent doctor.

In 2005, Castellaneta guest-starred as Joe Spencer in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; season eight episode &quot;Citizen Joe&quot;. He also appeared in episodes of &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Campus Ladies&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

He appeared as the Genie in the &quot;Aladdin&quot; sequel &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and on the 1994 &quot;Aladdin&quot; television series. The Genie had been voiced by Robin Williams in &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and Castellaneta described replacing him as &quot;sort of like stepping into &quot;Hamlet&quot; after Laurence Olivier did it, how can you win?&quot; He also provided Genie&#x27;s voice in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series for both &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (with archived audio used for &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; and its remake as well as for the later HD collections &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix&quot;). Castellaneta portrayed Aaron Spelling in the 2004 NBC film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which followed the true story of how Spelling created the show. Other films in which Castellaneta has appeared include &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Client&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;My Giant&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;.

In 2000, he won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman in the animated Christmas television special &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in Jeff Garlin&#x27;s independent film &quot;I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With&quot; along with several other Second City alumni.

On February 22, 2000, his first music CD &quot;Two Lips&quot; was published. It was followed on April 23, 2002, by his first comedy CD, &quot;I Am Not Homer&quot;, in which he and his wife perform several comedy skits. The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would be a good idea to preserve them &quot;since [he and Lacusta] don&#x27;t perform them much anymore.&quot;

Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the &quot;two-minute bits&quot; that they were original, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica. Additionally, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, a sketch in which two people discuss the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that &quot;we already knew that these skits were funny, [but] some of them we polished and tightened.&quot; The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results, and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title &quot;I Am Not Homer&quot; as a parody of Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s famous first autobiography &quot;I Am Not Spock&quot;, as well as to show that most of the comedy featured &quot;is not the typical Homer comedy.&quot;

Alongside his television and film work, Castellaneta has appeared in a number of theatrical productions. In 1992, he starred in &quot;Deb &amp; Dan&#x27;s Show&quot; alongside his wife. In 1995, Castellaneta started writing &quot;Where Did Vincent van Gogh?&quot;, a one man play in which he portrays a dozen different characters, including artist Vincent van Gogh. He first officially performed the play at the ACME Comedy Theatre in Los Angeles in 1999. In 2007, he appeared in &quot;The Bicycle Men&quot; at King&#x27;s Head Theatre in London.

Castellaneta hosted the final of New York comedy show Thrills and Spills on December 31, 2015. The final was held in Montgomery, Alabama.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Castellaneta married writer and actress Deb Lacusta, whom he had met at an improv class in Chicago. They divide their time between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, California.

Castellaneta is a vegetarian and does not drink alcohol. He enjoys exercising regularly and practicing tai chi. He is Catholic.

<text>Flirtation Walk is a 1934 American romantic musical film written by Delmer Daves and Lou Edelman, and directed by Frank Borzage. It focuses on a soldier (Dick Powell) who falls in love with a general&#x27;s daughter (Ruby Keeler) during the general&#x27;s brief stop in Hawaii but is bereft when she leaves with her father for the Philippines before their relationship can blossom. They are re-united several years later when the soldier is about to graduate from West Point and the general becomes the Academy&#x27;s Commandant.

The film&#x27;s title refers to a path near Trophy Point named &quot;Flirtation Walk&quot;, where cadets often take dance dates for some time alone.

== Plot ==
Richard Palmer Grant Dorcy Jr., also known as &quot;the Canary&quot; and &quot;the singing bird of the tropics,&quot; is an enlisted man in the United States Army. Stationed in the Hawaiian Islands, he has a contentious but friendly relationship with his sergeant, Scrapper Thornhill. When General Fitts visits the post with his daughter Kit on their way to Manila, Dick is assigned to drive her to a reception that evening. Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead, and he sings Aloha ‘Oe. They are discovered in each other&#x27;s arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit&#x27;s reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to straighten things out with Biddle.

To prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and he means nothing to her. Stung by her words, and Biddle&#x27;s condescending statement that &quot;if you were an officer and a gentleman, you&#x27;d understand,&quot; Dick decides to compete with Biddle as an equal and applies for West Point. He is accepted and does very well, to Scrapper&#x27;s delight. In his First Class year, Dick becomes First Captain and General Fitts is appointed Academy superintendent, with Biddle present as his aide. While most of his classmates are infatuated with Kit, Dick is cold to her. Consequently, he is not very happy when the rest of the men insist that she participate in the traditional &quot;Hundredth Night&quot; theatrical performance that he is to direct.

Dick writes a comedy about a female general with a message directed at Kit. After the first rehearsal, Kit walks with Dick on Flirtation Walk and tries to explain why she told him she was not in love with him. Dick is too angry to listen to Kit, but during their on-stage love scene kisses her, and she admits she loves him. When, near graduation, General Fitts announces Kit&#x27;s engagement to Biddle, Dick naturally is confused, and visits her after lights out to talk her out of marrying Biddle. He is caught by Biddle and, at Biddle&#x27;s suggestion, agrees to resign from the Academy to protect Kit&#x27;s name. Scrapper arrives at the Academy to see Dick graduate and is disappointed to learn of his resignation. The day is saved when Biddle tells Dick that his resignation was not accepted and that Kit returned his ring, wishing him good luck. Dick graduates a happy man.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The review of the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that many scenes were actually shot at West Point, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Bobby Connolly began to film the Hawaiian number on July 3, 1934, and was scheduled to finish on July 10. The set was the largest one ever built at Warner Bros. Following completion of that number, Connolly started the military wedding number using over 400 dancers. The success of the film led Warner Brothers to combine Powell, Keeler, Alexander, and Arledge again with Borzage and Daves under similar circumstances of plot and character to make &quot;Shipmates Forever&quot;, a film about the United States Naval Academy, the following year.

== Box office ==
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,062,000 domestically and $471,000 internationally.

== Awards and honors ==
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson).

== Songs ==
Aloha &#x27;Oe (1878) by Princess Liliʻuokalani
