<text>A school shooting is an armed attack at an educational institution, such as a primary school, secondary school, high school or university, involving the use of a firearm. Many school shootings are also categorized as mass shootings due to multiple casualties. The phenomenon is most widespread in the United States, which has the highest number of school-related shootings, although school shootings take place elsewhere in the world. Especially in the United States, school shootings have sparked a political debate over gun violence, zero tolerance policies, gun rights and gun control.

According to studies, factors behind school shooting include easy access to firearms, family dysfunction, lack of family supervision, and mental illness among many other psychological issues. Among the topmost motives of attackers were: bullying/persecution/threatened (75%) and revenge (61%), while 54% reported having numerous reasons. The remaining motives included an attempt to solve a problem (34%), suicide or depression (27%), and seeking attention or recognition (24%).

==Profiling==
The United States Secret Service published the results from a study regarding 37 school shooting incidents, involving 41 individuals in the United States from December 1974 through May 2000. In a previous report of 18 school shootings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), they released a profile that described shooters as middle-class, lonely/alienated, awkward, Caucasian males who had access to guns. The most recent report cautioned against the assumption that a perpetrator can be identified by a certain &#x27;type&#x27; or profile. The results from the study indicated that perpetrators came from differing backgrounds, making a singular profile difficult when identifying a possible assailant. For example, some perpetrators were children of divorce, lived in foster homes, or came from intact nuclear families. The majority of individuals had rarely or never gotten into trouble at school and had a healthy social life. Some, such as Alan Lipman, have warned about the lack of empirical validity of profiling methods.

===Age===
According to Raine (2002), immaturity is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of violence and outbursts of aggression. This fact is supported by findings on brain development occurring as individuals age from birth.

According to the Australian-based Raising children network and Centre for Adolescent Health (and other sources): the main change occurring in the developing brain during adolescence is the (so-called) &quot;pruning&quot; of unused connections in thinking and processing. While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the nervous system in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, axons, neurons, and synapses, to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. &quot;pruning&quot; (or apoptosis, otherwise known as &quot;cell death&quot;). These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the pre-frontal cortex, the brain location where decision-making occurs, is the concluding area for development.

While the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the amygdala; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including aggression and impulsiveness. As a consequence each individual is more likely to want to make riskier choices, and to do so more frequently.

*Steinberg (2004) identified the fact of adolescents &quot;taking more risks&quot;, typically, than adults;
*Deakin et al. (2004), and Overman et al. (2004) indicate a decline in risk taking from adolescence to adulthood;
*Steinberg (2005), Figner et al. (2009), and Burnett et al. (2010) identified adolescent age individuals as more likely to take risks than young children and adults.

===Family dynamics===
One assumption into the catalytic causes of school shootings comes from the &quot;non-traditional&quot; household perspective, which focuses on how family structure and family stability are related to child outcomes. Broadly speaking, proponents of this hypothesis claim that family structures such as single mothers, same-sex parents, extended family, or cohabitation are more harmful to the development of a child&#x27;s mental well-being, than heterosexual, married parents (often equated with the idea of a nuclear family). This perspective is found to back federal efforts such as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 and US federal tax incentives.

However, these assumptions on the detrimental effects of &quot;non-traditional&quot; family structures have repeatedly been shown to be false, with the true issues lying within socio-economic realities. Longitudinal research has shown the robust, positive effects of higher incomes and higher education levels on child well-being and emotional development, which reflects on the family &quot;stability&quot;, and not family structure. Further, proponents of this hypothesis often cite family statistics for those who commit crimes, but leave out how these compare to other populations, including the general population.

For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by both of their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents. Those rates are revealed to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According to surveys commissioned by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, between 20 and 30% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single mother households.

Another example of poorly-cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30–50%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard&#x27;s Baker Foundation Professor Emerita Dr. Teresa M. Amabile states, &quot;Those kinds of events can crush a child, they can lead to a lot of problems; they can lead to substance abuse, they can lead to various forms of emotional illness. They can also lead to incredible resilience and almost superhuman behaviors, seemingly, if people can come through those experiences intact. I don&#x27;t know if we—we being the field in general—have discovered what the keys are, what makes the difference for kids.&quot;

Understanding that socio-economic factors have greater effects on child development and emotional stability have led many to argue that single-parent and other non-traditional households should be afforded equivalent incentives by the state, as are afforded married households, and that focusing on family structure rather than family stability derails efforts to understand the realities of mass-shooters.

===Parental supervision===
&quot;Studies have found that within offenders&#x27; families, there is frequently a lack of supervision, low emotional closeness, and intimacy&quot;. In a 2018 publication, Dr. George S. Everly Jr, of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health outlined an accumulation of seven, recurring themes that warrant consideration regarding school shooters. One factor is that school shooters tended to isolate themselves, and &quot;exhibited an obsessive quality that often led to detailed planning, but ironically they seemed to lack an understanding of the consequences of their behavior and thus may have a history of adverse encounters with law enforcement.&quot; A criticism in the media of past shooters was questioning how so much planning could commence without alerting the parents or guardians to their efforts. However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.

Data from the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative&#x27;s home. The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children&#x27;s gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children. Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.

The FBI offer a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, &quot;The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective&quot;.

Daniel Schechter, Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is &quot;every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas&quot;. Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from &quot;bad&quot; parents. No more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.

===School bullying===
Dorothy Espelage of the University of Florida observed that 8% of bullying victims become &quot;angry, and aggressively so.&quot; She added, &quot;They become very angry, they may act out aggressively online. They may not hit back, but they definitely ruminate.&quot;

&quot;Bullying is common in schools and seemed to play a role in the lives of many of the school shooters&quot;. A typical bullying interaction consists of three parts, the offender/bully, a victim, and one or more bystanders. This formula of three enables the bully to easily create public humiliation for their victim. Students who are bullied tend to develop behavioral problems, depression, less self-control and poorer social skills, and to do worse in school. Once humiliated, victims never want to be a victim again and try to regain their image by joining groups. Often, they are rejected by their peers and follow through by restoring justice in what they see as an unjust situation. Their plan for restoration many times results in violence as shown by the school shooters. 75% of school shooters had been bullied or left behind evidence of having been victims of bullying. Other academics however are critical of a bullying-school shootings connection.

The Uvalde shooter who killed 21 people was frequently bullied in 4th grade at Robb Elementary school.

===Mental illness===

The degree to which mental illness contributes to school shootings has been debated.

Although the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are non-violent, some evidence has suggested that mental illness or mental health symptoms are nearly universal among school shooters. A 2002 report by the US Secret Service and US Department of Education found evidence that a majority of school shooters displayed evidence of mental health symptoms, often undiagnosed or untreated. Criminologists Fox and DeLateur note that mental illness is only part of the issue, however, and mass shooters tend to externalize their problems, blaming others and are unlikely to seek psychiatric help, even if available. According to an article written on gun violence and mental illness, the existence of violence as an outlet for the mentally ill is quite prominent in some instances (Swanson et al., 2015). The article lists from a study that 12% of people with serious mental illness had committed minor or serious violence within the last year, compared to 2% of people without illness committing those same acts. Other scholars have concluded that mass murderers display a common constellation of chronic mental health symptoms, chronic anger or antisocial traits, and a tendency to blame others for problems. However, they note that attempting to &quot;profile&quot; school shooters with such a constellation of traits will likely result in many false positives as many individuals with such a profile do not engage in violent behaviors.

McGinty and colleagues conducted a study to find out if people tended to associate the violence of school shootings with mental illness, at the expense of other factors such as the availability of high-capacity magazines. Nearly 2,000 participants read a news piece on a shooting in which the shooter is diagnosed as having a mental illness and who used high capacity magazines. One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.

It is also mentionable that school size can play a role on the presence of shooter mental health concerns. In a presented study from researchers Baird, Roellke &amp; Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that school size and level of attention given to students can precede violent actions, as students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are likely to have transitioned from smaller schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by showing that the stress associated with losing the personal support given in a smaller community is a weight on students.

A 2016 opinion piece published by U.S. News &amp; World Report concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not. This study also concluded that many people with mental illnesses do not engage in violence against others and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness.

=== Injustice collectors ===
In a 2015 &quot;New Republic&quot; essay, &quot;Columbine&quot; author Dave Cullen describes a subset of school shooters (and other mass murderers) known as &quot;injustice collectors&quot;, or people who &quot;never forget, never forgive, [and] never let go&quot; before they strike out. The essay describes and expands on the work of retired FBI profiler Mary Ellen O&#x27;Toole, who has published a peer-reviewed journal article on the subject. It also quotes Gary Noesner, who helped create and lead the FBI&#x27;s hostage negotiation unit, and served as Chief Negotiator for ten years.

=== Violent media theory ===

==== Video games ====
It has long been debated whether there exists a correlation between school shooting perpetrators and the type of media they consume. A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.

The idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person&#x27;s aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.

A summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression. (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 &amp; Spencer, 2009) Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.

==== Literature ====
One of the infamous books, the 1977 novel &quot;Rage&quot; by Stephen King (written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), was linked to five school shootings and hostage situations that took place between 1988 and 1997; the most recent of these, the 1997 Heath High School shooting, was ultimately influential in King&#x27;s decision to pull the book out of print for good.

===Notoriety===
Shooting massacres in English-speaking countries often occur close together in time. In the summer of 1966, two major stories broke: Richard Speck murdered eight women on a single night in Chicago, and Charles Whitman shot and killed 15 people from a clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin. Neither was seeking fame, but with the new television news climate, they received it anyway. Seeing this, 18-year-old Robert Benjamin Smith bought a gun, and on November 12, 1966, he killed four women and a toddler inside the Rose-Mar College of Beauty in Mesa, Arizona. &quot;I wanted to get known, just wanted to get myself a name,&quot; explained Smith. He had hoped to kill nearly ten times as many people but had arrived at the beauty college campus too early. Upon his arrest, he was without remorse, saying simply, &quot;I wanted people to know who I was.&quot; Towers, et al. (2015), found a small, but significant temporary increase in the probability of a second school shooting within 2 weeks after a known school shooting, which was only slightly smaller than the probability of repeats after mass killings involving firearms. 

However, much more work is needed with greater scope on investigations, to understand whether this is a real phenomenon or not. Some attribute this to copycat behavior, which can be correlated with the level of media exposure. In these copycat shootings, oftentimes the perpetrators see a past school shooter as an idol, so they want to carry out an even more destructive, murderous shooting in hopes of gaining recognition or respect. Some mass murderers study media reports of previous killers.

Recent premeditative writings were presented according to court documents and showed Joshua O&#x27;Connor wrote that he wanted the &quot;death count to be as high as possible so that the shooting would be infamous&quot;. O&#x27;Connor was arrested before he was able to carry out his plan. Infamy and notoriety, &quot;a desire to be remembered&quot; has been reported as the leading reason for planned shootings by most perpetrators who were taken alive either pre or post shooting.

==By region==
===United States===

School shootings are an &quot;overwhelmingly American&quot; phenomenon due to the availability of firearms in the United States. Children at U.S. schools have active shooter drills. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, in 2019 &quot;about 95% of public schools now have students and teachers practice huddling in silence, hiding from an imaginary gunman.&quot;
Between the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, there were 31 school shootings in the United States and 14 in the rest of the world combined. Between 2000 and 2010, counting incidents from 37 countries in which someone was injured or killed on school grounds, with two or more victims, and not counting &quot;single homicides, off-campus homicides, killings caused by government actions, militaries, terrorists or militants&quot;, the number of such incidents in the United States was one less than in the other 36 countries combined; in the vast majority of the United States incidents, perpetrators used guns.

Tracking school shootings in the United States was made more difficult by the passage by United States Congress of the Dickey Amendment in 1996, which mandated that no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funds &quot;may be used to advocate or promote gun control&quot;, although this does not mean the CDC has stopped researching gun violence. Instead, Congress relies on independent research done by non-partisan organizations for getting data on gun violence in the United States.

Between the Columbine massacre and the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas, shooting of some form happened at 216 schools, and at least 141 children, educators and other people were killed and another 284 were injured. 38% of the students who experienced school shootings were African American although African American students were 16.6% of the school population. Schools in at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have experienced a shooting.

Many school shootings in the United States result in one non-fatal injury. The type of firearm most commonly used in school shootings in the United States is the handgun. Three school shootings (the Columbine massacre, the Sandy Hook massacre, and the 2018 Parkland High School shooting in Florida), accounted for 43% of the fatalities; the type of firearm used in the most lethal school shootings was the rifle. High-capacity magazines, which allow the perpetrator to fire dozens of rounds without having to reload, were used in the Columbine and Sandy Hook shootings.

70% of the perpetrators of school shootings were under the age of 18, with the median age of 16. More than 85% of the perpetrators of school shootings obtained their firearms from their own homes or from friends or relatives. Targeted school shootings, those occurring for example in the context of a feud, were about three times as common as those that appeared indiscriminate. Most perpetrators of school shootings exhibited no signs of debilitating mental disorder, such as psychosis or schizophrenia, although most mass killers typically have or exhibit signs of depression. On the other hand, Eric Harris was almost certainly a psychopath as noted by the FBI. Between the Columbine massacre and 2015, &quot;more than 40 people&quot; were &quot;charged with Columbine-style plots;&quot; almost all were white male teenagers and almost all had studied the Columbine attack or cited the Columbine perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold as inspiration.

At least 68 schools that experienced a school shooting employed a police officer or security guard; in all but a few, the shooting ended before any intercession. Security guards or resource officers were present during four of the five school shooting incidents with the highest number of dead or injured: Columbine, the 2001 Santana High School shooting in California, the 2018 Marshall County High School shooting in Kentucky, and Stoneman Douglas.

There were 11 firearm-related events that occurred at a school or campus in the first 23 days of 2018. As of May 2018, more people, including students and teachers, were killed in 2018 in schools in the United States than were killed in military service for the United States, including both combat and non-combat military service, according to an analysis by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In terms of the year-to-date number of individual deadly school shootings incidents in the United States, early 2018 was much higher than 2017, with 16 in 2018 and four in 2017, through May; the year-to-day through May number of incidents was the highest since 1999. As of May 2018, thirteen school shootings took place on K–12 school property in 2018 that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths, including 32 killed and 65 injured, according to &quot;Education Week&quot;. 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed occurred in the United States in the first 20 weeks of 2018, according to CNN.

====List of school shootings in the United States====
As of May 22, 2023, the ten deadliest school shootings in the United States since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in which 13 were killed were the:

* 2007 Virginia Tech shooting (33 dead)
* 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut (27 dead)
* 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas (22 dead)
* 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida (17 dead)
* 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas (10 dead)
* 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting near Roseburg, Oregon (10 dead)
* 2005 Red Lake shootings in Minnesota (10 dead)
* 2023 Nashville school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee (7 dead)
* 2012 Oikos University shooting in Oakland, California (7 dead)
* 2008 Northern Illinois University shooting (6 dead)

Other school shootings occurring in the United States include the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting in Austin in which 16 were killed; the 2001 Santana High School shooting in Santee, California, in which two were killed; the 2018 Marshall County High School shooting in Benton, Kentucky, in which two were killed; and the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Oxford Township, Michigan, in which four were killed.

====Studies of United States school shootings====
During 1996, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) together with the US Department of Education and the United States Department of Justice, published a review of deaths related to schools occurring as a result of violence, including explicitly &quot;unintentional firearm-related death&quot;, for the academic years 1992–1993 and 1993–1994. A second study (Anderson; Kaufman; Simon 2001), a continuation from the 1996 study, was published December 5, and covered the period 1994–1999.

A United States Secret Service study concluded that schools were placing false hope in physical security, when they should be paying more attention to the pre-attack behaviors of students. Zero-tolerance policies and metal detectors &quot;are unlikely to be helpful,&quot; the Secret Service researchers found. The researchers focused on questions concerning the reliance on SWAT teams when most attacks are over before police arrive, profiling of students who show warning signs in the absence of a definitive profile, expulsion of students for minor infractions when expulsion is the spark that push some to return to school with a gun, buying software not based on school shooting studies to evaluate threats although killers rarely make direct threats, and reliance on metal detectors and police officers in schools when shooters often make no effort to conceal their weapons.

In May 2002, the Secret Service published a report that examined 37 U.S. school shootings. They had the following findings:
* Incidents of targeted violence at school were rarely sudden, impulsive acts.
* Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attacker&#x27;s idea or plan to attack.
* Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.
* There is no accurate or useful profile of students who engaged in targeted school violence.
* Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that caused others concern or indicated a need for help.
* Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personal failures. Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.
* Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack.
* Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.
* In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.
* Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents were stopped by means other than law enforcement intervention.

==== Cultural references ====

==== Film ====
There have been many representations of American school shootings in films and TV shows produced by both United States and international production companies. While films &quot;Elephant&quot;, &quot;We Need to Talk about Kevin&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, and &quot;Mass&quot; are solely focused on the either the act or the aftermath, many of the shows such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Law and Order&quot;, and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; investigate the crime for an episode or use it as a plot point for about half a season.

==== Music ====
One of the more provocative songs to come out of the Parkland, Florida high school shooting was &quot;thoughts &amp; prayers&quot; from alternative artist/rapper grandson (born Jordan Benjamin). The song is a critique of politicians sending out their &quot;thoughts and prayers&quot; to the victims of the Parkland high school shooting and other mass shootings, accompanied by what he perceives as a consistent resistance to gun control laws.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; by Irish new wave band The Boomtown Rats was directly inspired by the 1979 Cleveland Elementary School shooting.

====Political impact====
School shootings and other mass killings have had a major political impact. Governments have discussed gun-control laws, to increase time for background checks. Also, bulletproof school supplies have been created, including backpacks, desks, bullet-resistant door panels, and classroom whiteboards (or bulletin boards) which reinforce walls or slide across doors to deflect bullets. The National Rifle Association of America has proposed allowing teachers to carry weapons on school grounds as a means of protecting themselves and others as a possible solution. In 2018, 14 states had at least one school district in which teachers were armed, with another 16 states permitting districts to arm teachers subject to local policy. Most states also require the gun carriers to receive advance permission from the districts&#x27; superintendents or trustees. &quot;In New York State, written permission from the school is required in order to carry a firearm on school grounds.&quot;

Due to the political impact, this has spurred some to press for more stringent gun control laws. In the United States, the National Rifle Association is opposed to such laws, and some groups have called for fewer gun control laws, citing cases of armed students ending shootings and halting further loss of life, and claiming that the prohibitions against carrying a gun in schools do not deter the gunmen. One such example is the Mercaz HaRav Massacre, where the attacker was stopped by a student, Yitzhak Dadon, who shot him with his personal firearm which he lawfully carried concealed. At a Virginia law school, there is a disputed claim that three students retrieved pistols from their cars and stopped the attacker without firing a shot. Also, at a Mississippi high school, the vice principal retrieved a firearm from his vehicle and then eventually stopped the attacker as he was driving away from the school. In other cases, such as shootings at Columbine and Red Lake High Schools, the presence of an armed police officer did little to nothing to prevent the killings.

The Gun-Free Schools Act was passed in 1994 in response to gun related violence in schools, so many school systems started adopting the Zero-Tolerance Law. The Gun-Free Schools Act required people to be expelled from the school for a year. By 1997, the Zero-Tolerance for any type of weapon was implemented by more than 90 percent of U.S. public schools.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, school shootings and similar attacks, usually involving melee weapons or improvised explosives, have been on the rise since 2022. Multiple potential explanations exist, including the glorification of American mass murderers leading to a copycat &quot;globalization&quot; of such incidents, with the perpetrators often seeking to replicate American attacks. For example, Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, the perpetrator of the Rio de Janeiro school shooting, cited Seung-Hui Cho as a &quot;brother&quot; and thanked him, along with fellow Brazilian Edmar Aparecido Freitas, perpetrator of the 2003 Taiúva school shooting, for their &quot;bravery&quot; and &quot;leading the way&quot;. Other theories include the spread of conspiracy theories, hate speech and extremist propaganda.

==Police response and countermeasures==
Analysis of the Columbine school shooting and other incidents where first responders waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what bystanders and first responders should do. An analysis of 84 mass shooting cases in the US from 2000 to 2010 found that the average response time by police was 3 minutes. In most instances that exceeds the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if people involved in the situation remain passive, or a police response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended by the US Department of Homeland Security that civilians involved in the incident take active steps to evacuate, hide, or counter the shooter and that individual law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter.

==School countermeasures==

=== Armed classrooms ===

There has been considerable policy discussion about how to help prevent school and other types of mass shootings. One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. &quot;Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer-reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate.&quot; So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed &quot;armed classrooms&quot; to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.

Many teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. &quot;One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.&quot; Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. &quot;They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.&quot;

To diminish school shootings there are many preventive measures that can be taken such as:
* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement.
* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them.
* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.
* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.
* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.

In a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the &quot;weapons effect&quot;, which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. &quot;In Berkowitz &amp; LaPage&#x27;s (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students&#x27; performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks. This finding points to possible negative outcomes for students exposed to guns in the classroom (Simons &amp; Turner, 1974; Turner &amp; Simons, 1976).&quot;

In 2008, Harrold Independent School District in Texas became the first public school district in the U.S. to allow teachers with state-issued firearm-carry permits to carry their arms in the classroom; special additional training and ricochet-resistant ammunition were required for participating teachers. Students at the University of Utah have been allowed to carry concealed pistols (so long as they possess the appropriate state license) since a State Supreme Court decision in 2006. In addition to Utah, Wisconsin and Mississippi each have legislation that allow students, faculty and employees with the proper permit, to carry concealed weapons on their public university&#x27;s campuses. Colorado and Oregon state courts have ruled in favor of Campus Carry laws by denying their universities&#x27; proposals to ban guns on campus, ruling that the UC Board of Regents and the Oregon University System did not have the authority to ban weapons on campus. A selective ban was then re-instated, wherein Oregon state universities enacted a ban on guns in school building and sporting events or by anyone contracted with the university in question.
A commentary in the conservative &quot;National Review Online&quot; argues that the armed school approach for preventing school attacks, while new in the US, has been used successfully for many years in Israel and Thailand. Teachers and school officials in Israel are allowed and encouraged to carry firearms if they have former military experience in the IDF, which almost all do. Statistics on what percentage of teachers are actually armed are unavailable and in Israel, for example, the intent is to counter politically motivated terrorist attacks on high value, soft targets, not personal defense against, or protection from, unbalanced individual students.

The National Rifle Association has explicitly called for placing armed guards in all American schools. However, Steven Strauss, a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, offered a preliminary calculation that placing armed guards in every American school might cost as much as $15 billion/year, and perhaps only save 10 lives per year (at a cost of $1.5 billion/life saved).

=== Preventive measures ===
Because of the increase in guns in the United States, many schools and local communities are taking it into their own hands by providing young students with early gun safety courses to make them aware of the dangers these objects actually are, also to prevent school shootings. According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.

A preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in Sparks, Nevada on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter&#x27;s home. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Red Lake High School in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.

A 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that &quot;from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place&quot;. 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents&#x27; firearms.

Most states have Child Access Prevention Laws—laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. An example of a weaker law is a law that enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.

In 2019, the United States Secret Service released an analysis of targeted school violence, concluding the best practice for prevention was forming a &quot;multidisciplinary threat assessment team, in conjunction with the appropriate policies, tools, and training&quot;. An earlier report published in 2018 concluded there was no single profile of a student attacker, and emphasized the importance of the threat assessment process instead. The threat assessment process described includes gathering information about student behaviors, negative or stressful events, and what resources are available for the student to overcome those challenges.

=== Countermeasures ===
In 2015, Southwestern High School in Shelbyville, Indiana, was portrayed as possibly the &quot;safest school in America&quot;. The school has been used as a &quot;Safe School Flagship&quot; of possible countermeasures to an active shooter.
* All teachers have lanyards with a panic button that alerts police.
* Classrooms have automatically locking &quot;hardened doors&quot;, and windows have &quot;hardened exterior glass&quot; to deflect bullets and physical attack.
* Cameras, described as &quot;military-grade&quot;, that feed video directly to Shelby County Sheriff&#x27;s Office are mounted throughout the school.
* Smoke canisters mounted in the roof of corridors can be remotely discharged to slow a shooter&#x27;s movement.

Other countermeasures include tools like doorjambs, rapidly-deployable tourniquets, and ballistic protection systems like the CoverMe-Seat.

In 2019, Fruitport High School in Michigan became the first school in the U.S. to be rebuilt with concrete barriers in hallways for students to hide from bullets. The BBC also reports the &quot;hallways are curved to prevent a shooter from having a clear line of sight during any potential attack.&quot; Classrooms have been redesigned so students can hide more easily. Costing $48 million to rebuild, Bob Szymoniak, Fruitport High School&#x27;s superintendent, believes these alterations will become part of the structure of all U.S. schools. &quot;These are design elements that are naturally part of buildings going into the future.&quot;

The STOP School Violence Act is pending legislation to provide funding grants to schools to be used for implementing security measures.

==Aftermath==
After experiencing the threat of a school shooting, as well as the changes in the school via countermeasures, students continue to experience trauma. Mass shootings can bring on the onset of PTSD and continued depression. In the cities that are home to these kind of events, the town can experience continued paranoia and a hightened sense of fear.

<text>The Dunblane massacre took place at Dunblane Primary School in Dunblane, near Stirling, Scotland, on 13 March 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton killed 16 pupils and one teacher and injured 15 others before killing himself. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in British history.

Following the killings, public debate centred on gun control laws, including public petitions for a ban on private ownership of handguns and an official inquiry, which produced the 1996 Cullen Report. 

The incident led to a public campaign, known as the Snowdrop Petition, which helped bring about legislation, specifically two new Firearms Acts, which prohibited the private ownership of most handguns in Great Britain. The UK Government instituted a buyback programme which provided compensation to licensed owners.

== Shooting ==

At about 8:15 a.m. on 13 March 1996, Thomas Hamilton, aged 43, was seen scraping ice off his van outside his home at Kent Road in Stirling. He left soon afterwards and drove about north to Dunblane. Hamilton arrived on the grounds of Dunblane Primary School at around 9:30 a.m. and parked his van near a telegraph pole in the car park of the school. He cut the telephone cables at the bottom of the telegraph pole which served nearby houses, before making his way across the car park towards the school buildings.

Hamilton headed towards the north-west side of the school to a door near the toilets and the school gymnasium. After entering, he made his way to the gymnasium armed with four legally-held handguns—two 9mm Browning HP pistols and two Smith &amp; Wesson M19 .357 Magnum revolvers. Hamilton was also carrying 743 ammunition cartridges, (501 9mm cartridges and 242 .357 Magnum cartridges). In the gym was a class of 28 Primary 1 pupils preparing for a P.E. lesson in the presence of three adult members of staff.

Before entering the gymnasium, it is believed Hamilton fired two shots into the stage of the assembly hall and the girls&#x27; toilet.

Hamilton started shooting rapidly and randomly. He shot P.E. teacher Eileen Harrild who was injured in her arms and chest as she attempted to protect herself and continued shooting into the gym. Harrild stumbled into the open-plan store cupboard at the side of the gym along with several injured children. Gwen Mayor, the teacher of the Primary 1 class, was shot and killed instantly. The other adult present, Mary Blake, a supervisory assistant, was shot in the head and both legs but also managed to make her way to the store cupboard with several of the children in front of her.

From entering the gymnasium and walking a few steps, Hamilton fired 29 shots with one of the pistols, killed one child, and injured several others. Four injured children had taken shelter in the store cupboard along with the injured Harrild and Blake. Hamilton then moved up the east side of the gym, firing six shots as he walked, and then fired eight shots towards the opposite end of the gym. He then went towards the centre of the gym, firing 16 shots at point-blank range at a group of children who had been incapacitated by his earlier shots.

A Primary 7 pupil who was walking along the west side of the gymnasium exterior at the time heard loud bangs and screams and looked inside. Hamilton shot in his direction and the pupil was injured by flying glass before running away. From this position, Hamilton fired 24 shots in various directions. He fired shots towards a window next to the fire exit at the southeast end of the gym, possibly at an adult who was walking across the playground, and then fired four more shots in the same direction after opening the fire exit door. Hamilton then exited the gym briefly through the fire exit, firing another four shots towards the cloakroom of the library, striking and injuring Grace Tweddle, another member of staff at the school.

In the mobile classroom closest to the fire exit where Hamilton was standing, Catherine Gordon saw him firing shots and instructed her Primary 7 class to get down onto the floor before Hamilton fired nine bullets into the classroom, striking books and equipment. One bullet passed through a chair where a child had been sitting seconds before. Hamilton then re-entered the gym, dropped the pistol he was using, and took out one of the two revolvers.

He put the barrel of the gun in his mouth, pointed it upwards, and pulled the trigger, killing himself. A total of 32 people sustained gunshot wounds inflicted by Hamilton over a 3–4 minute period, 16 of whom were fatally wounded in the gymnasium, including Gwen Mayor and 15 of her pupils. One other child died en route to hospital.

The first call to the police was made at 9:41 a.m. by the headmaster of the school Ronald Taylor, who had been alerted by assistant headmistress Agnes Awlson to the possibility of a gunman on the school premises. Awlson had told Taylor that she had heard screaming inside the gymnasium and had seen what she thought to be cartridges on the ground, and Taylor had been aware of loud noises which he assumed to have been from builders on site that he had not been informed of. As he was on his way to the gym, the shooting ended and when he saw what had happened he ran back to his office and told deputy headmistress Fiona Eadington to call for ambulances, a call which was made at 9:43 a.m.

The first ambulance arrived on the scene at 9:57 a.m. in response to the call made at 9:43 a.m. Another medical team from Dunblane Health Centre arrived at 10:04 a.m. which included doctors and a nurse, who were involved in the initial resuscitation of the injured. Medical teams from the health centres in Doune and Callander arrived shortly after. The accident and emergency department at Stirling Royal Infirmary had also been informed of a major incident involving multiple casualties at 9:48 a.m. and the first of several medical teams from the hospital arrived at 10:15 a.m. Another medical team from the Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary arrived at 10:35 a.m.

By about 11:10 a.m., all of the injured had been taken to Stirling Royal Infirmary for medical treatment. Upon examination, several of the patients were transferred to the District Royal Infirmary in Falkirk and some to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.

The shooter fired 106 shots in total during the massacre, including the suicide shot. 105 were fired by one of his Browning pistols, and the final shot was fired with one of his Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers.

== Perpetrator ==

Thomas Watt Hamilton was born as Thomas Watt Jr. on 10 May 1952 in Glasgow, the son of Thomas Watt Sr., a bus driver, and Agnes Graham Hamilton, a hotel chambermaid. When Hamilton was 18 months old, his father abandoned the family for another woman, after which his parents divorced and his father had no contact with him thereafter. Thomas&#x27; maternal grandparents, James and Catherine Hamilton raised Thomas as their son, legally adopting him and changing his name to Thomas Watt Hamilton. The family relocated to Stirling when Hamilton was a young boy. He was made to believe that his maternal grandparents were his actual parents, and that his mother was his older sister. Hamilton&#x27;s grandparents told Thomas the truth when he was around 22 years old, which reportedly had a lasting psychological impact on him. He began working in youth organizations. As the head of several youth clubs, Hamilton had been the subject of several complaints to police regarding inappropriate behaviour towards young boys, including claims that he had taken photographs of semi-naked boys without parental consent. He had briefly been a Scout leader – in July 1973 at age 21, he had been appointed assistant leader with the 4th/6th Stirling troop of the Scout Association. Later that year, he was seconded as leader to the 24th Stirlingshire troop, which was being revived. Several complaints were made about Hamilton&#x27;s leadership, including complaints about Scouts being forced to sleep in close proximity with him inside his van during hill-walking expeditions. Within months, on 13 May 1974, Hamilton&#x27;s Scout Warrant was withdrawn, with the County Commissioner stating that he was &quot;suspicious of his moral intentions towards boys&quot;. He was blacklisted by the Association and thwarted in a later attempt he made to become a Scout leader in Clackmannanshire.

Hamilton claimed in letters that local rumours regarding his behaviour towards young boys had led to the failure of his business in 1993, and that, in the last months of his life, he had complained that his attempts to organise a boys&#x27; club were subjected to persecution by local police and the scout movement. Among those he complained to were Queen Elizabeth II and his local Member of Parliament (MP), Michael Forsyth (Conservative). In the 1980s, another MP, George Robertson (Labour), who lived in Dunblane, had complained to Forsyth about Hamilton&#x27;s local boys&#x27; club, which his son had attended. On the day after the massacre, Robertson spoke of having previously argued with Hamilton &quot;in my own home&quot;.

On 19 March 1996, six days after the massacre, Hamilton&#x27;s body was cremated. According to a police spokesman, this service was conducted &quot;far away from Dunblane&quot;.

== Subsequent legislation ==

The Cullen Reports, the result of the inquiry into the Dunblane massacre, recommended that the Government of the United Kingdom introduce tighter controls on handgun ownership and consider whether an outright ban on private ownership would be in the public interest in the alternative (though club ownership would be maintained). The report also recommended changes in school security and vetting of people working with children under 18. The Home Affairs Select Committee agreed with the need for restrictions on gun ownership but stated that a handgun ban was not appropriate.

An advocacy group, the six-member Gun Control Network, was founded in the aftermath of the massacre and was supported by some parents of the victims of the Dunblane and Hungerford massacres shootings. Bereaved families and others also campaigned for a ban on private gun ownership.

In response to public debate, the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned all cartridge ammunition handguns with the exception of .22 calibre rimfire in England, Scotland, and Wales. Following the 1997 United Kingdom general election, the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, banning the remaining .22 cartridge handguns as well. This left only muzzle-loading and historic handguns legal as well as certain sporting handguns (e.g. &quot;Long-Arms&quot;) and long-barrelled handguns that fall outside the minimum barrel and overall length dimensions in the Firearms Act 1968, as amended.

This handgun ban did not apply to Northern Ireland, where it remains legal for citizens to own handguns for target shooting (if they hold a firearms licence) and, for self-defence, if the owner holds a personal protection weapon permit, almost 3000 of which were on issue as of 2012. 

Evidence of previous police interaction with Hamilton was presented to the Cullen Inquiry but was later sealed under a closure order to prevent publication for 100 years. The official reason for sealing the documents was to protect the identities of children, but this led to accusations of a coverup intended to protect the reputations of officials. Following a review of the closure order by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, edited versions of some of the documents were released to the public in October 2005. Four files containing post-mortems, medical records and profiles on the victims, as well as Hamilton&#x27;s post-mortem, remained sealed under the 100-year order to avoid distressing the relatives and survivors.

The released documents revealed that in 1991, complaints against Hamilton were made to the Central Scotland Police and were investigated by the Child Protection Unit. He was reported to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of ten charges, including assault, obstructing police and contravention of the Children and Young Persons Act 1937. Reports from serving police officers stated that he was unsuitable to own firearms; no action was taken.

== Media coverage ==
Two books – &quot;Dunblane: Our Year of Tears&quot; by Peter Samson and Alan Crow and &quot;Dunblane: Never Forget&quot; by Mick North – both give accounts of the massacre from the perspective of those most directly affected. In 2009, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; was criticised for an inappropriate article about the survivors of the massacre, thirteen years after the event.

On the Sunday following the shootings the morning service from Dunblane Cathedral, conducted by Colin MacIntosh, was broadcast live by the BBC. The BBC also transmitted the 9 October 1996 memorial service live from Dunblane Cathedral. A documentary series, &quot;Crimes That Shook Britain&quot;, discussed the massacre. The documentary &quot;Dunblane: Remembering our Children&quot;, which featured many of the parents of the children who had been killed, was broadcast by STV and ITV at the time of the first anniversary. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, a 1997 documentary exploring the psychology behind mass killings, examined the men behind the mass shootings in Dunblane, Aramoana, New Zealand and Port Arthur, Tasmania — and found common traits in the three murderers. At the time of the tenth anniversary in March 2006 two documentaries were broadcast: Channel 5 screened &quot;Dunblane — A Decade On&quot; and BBC Scotland showed &quot;Remembering Dunblane&quot;. On 9 March 2016 relatives of the victims spoke in a BBC Scotland documentary entitled &quot;Dunblane: Our Story&quot; to mark the twentieth anniversary. A 2018 Netflix documentary, &quot;Lessons from a School Shooting: Notes from Dunblane&quot;, directed by Kim A. Snyder, drew comparison with the Sandy Hook massacre in the US by exploring the grief and friendship between the two priests serving the affected communities at the times of the respective shootings. On 11 March 2021, ITV aired a special documentary to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary: &quot;Return to Dunblane with Lorraine Kelly&quot; in which the presenter revisited the town, speaking with the victims&#x27; families and emergency aid workers.

== Memorials and tributes ==
Two days after the shooting, a vigil and prayer session was held at Dunblane Cathedral which was attended by people of all faiths. On Mothering Sunday, on 17 March, Queen Elizabeth II and her daughter Anne, Princess Royal, attended a memorial service at Dunblane Cathedral.

Seven months after the massacre, in October 1996, the families of the victims organised their own memorial service at Dunblane Cathedral, which more than 600 people attended, including Prince Charles. The service was broadcast live on BBC1 and conducted by James Whyte, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Television presenter Lorraine Kelly, who had befriended some of the victims&#x27; families whilst reporting on the massacre for &quot;GMTV&quot;, was a guest speaker at the service.
In August 1997, two varieties of rose were unveiled and planted as the centrepiece for a roundabout in Dunblane. The two roses were developed by Cockers Roses of Aberdeen; the &#x27;Gwen Mayor&#x27; rose and &#x27;Innocence&#x27; rose, in memory of the children killed. A snowdrop cultivar, originally found in a Dunblane garden in the 1970s, was renamed &#x27;Sophie North&#x27; in memory of one of the victims of the massacre.

The gymnasium at the school was demolished on 11 April 1996 and replaced by a memorial garden. Two years after the massacre, on 14 March 1998, a memorial garden was opened at Dunblane Cemetery, where Mayor and twelve of the children who were killed are buried. The garden features a fountain with a plaque of the names of those killed. Stained glass windows in memory of the victims were placed in three local churches, St Blane&#x27;s and the Church of the Holy Family in Dunblane and the nearby Lecropt Kirk as well as at the Dunblane Youth and Community Centre.

Newton Primary School awards The Gwen Mayor Rosebowl to a pupil every year. A charity, the Gwen Mayor Trust, was set up by the Educational Institute of Scotland to provide funding for projects in Scottish primary schools.

The National Association of Primary Education commissioned a sculpture, &quot;Flame for Dunblane&quot;, created by Walter Bailey from a single yew tree, which was placed in the National Forest, near Moira, Leicestershire.

The nave of Dunblane Cathedral has a standing stone by the monumental sculptor Richard Kindersley. It was commissioned by the Kirk Session as the cathedral&#x27;s commemoration and dedicated at a service on 12 March 2001. It is a Clashach stone two metres high on a Caithness flagstone base. The quotations on the stone are by E. V. Rieu (&quot;He called a little child to him...&quot;), Richard Henry Stoddard (&quot;...the spirit of a little child&quot;), Bayard Taylor (&quot;But still I dream that somewhere there must be The spirit of a child that waits for me&quot;) and W. H. Auden (&quot;We are linked as children in a circle dancing&quot;).

With the consent of Bob Dylan, the musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; in memory of the Dunblane school children and their teacher. The recording of the revised version of the song, which included brothers and sisters of the victims singing the chorus and Mark Knopfler on guitar, was released on 9 December 1996 in the UK, and reached number 1. The proceeds went to charities for children.

Pipe Major Robert Mathieson of the Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band composed a pipe tune in tribute, &quot;The Bells of Dunblane&quot;.

Scottish composer James MacMillan created a choral work, &quot;A child&#x27;s prayer&quot;, as a tribute to the dead at Dunblane.

English punk rock band U.K. Subs released a song called &quot;Dunblane&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Quintessentials&quot;, with the chorus &quot;After Dunblane how can you hold a gun and say you&#x27;re innocent?&quot;

<text>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would explicitly prohibit sex discrimination. It is not currently a part of the Constitution, though its ratification status has long been debated. It was written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman and first introduced in Congress in December 1923. With the rise of the women&#x27;s movement in the United States during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by Representative Martha Griffiths in 1971, it was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives that year, and by the U.S. Senate in 1972, thus submitting the ERA to the state legislatures for ratification, as provided by Article Five of the United States Constitution. A seven-year, 1979, deadline was included with the legislation by Congress. A simple majority of Congress later extended the deadline to 1982. Both deadlines passed with the ERA three short of the necessary 38 states for ratification. Even so, there are ongoing efforts to ratify the amendment. 

The purpose of the ERA is to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. In the early history of the Equal Rights Amendment, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, arguing that women should hold more domestic responsibility than men and that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. Modern proponents assert it would end legal distinctions between men and women in matters including divorce, property, and employment. Opponents have argued that it would remove protections from women and open women to be drafted into the military.

== Resolution text ==
The resolution, &quot;Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women&quot;, reads, in part:
== History ==

=== Early history (1920s–1940s) ===

On September 25, 1921, the National Woman&#x27;s Party announced its plans to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to guarantee women equal rights with men. The text of the proposed amendment read:

Alice Paul, the head of the National Women&#x27;s Party, believed that the Nineteenth Amendment would not be enough to ensure that men and women were treated equally regardless of sex. In 1923, at Seneca Falls, New York, she revised the proposed amendment to read:

Paul named this version the Lucretia Mott Amendment, after a female abolitionist who fought for women&#x27;s rights and attended the First Women&#x27;s Rights Convention. The proposal was seconded by Dr. Frances Dickinson, a cousin of Susan B. Anthony.

Following its introduction in 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was reintroduced in each subsequent Congress, but made little progress.

In 1943, Alice Paul further revised the amendment to reflect the wording of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. This text would later become Section 1 of the version passed by Congress in 1972.

As a result of this revision, ERA opponents proposed an alternative in the 1940s. This alternative provided that &quot;no distinctions on the basis of sex shall be made except such as are reasonably justified by differences in physical structure, biological differences, or social function.&quot; It was quickly rejected by both pro- and anti-ERA coalitions.

When the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted in 1868, the Equal Protection Clause, which guarantees equal protection of the laws, did not apply to women. It was not until 1972 that the United States Supreme Court extended equal protection to sex-based discrimination. However, women have never been entitled to full equal protection as the Court subsequently ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to an intermediate standard of judicial review, a less stringent standard than that applied to other forms of discrimination.

==== Split among feminists ====
Since the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among feminists about the meaning of women&#x27;s equality. Alice Paul and her National Woman&#x27;s Party asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting. Opponents of the amendment, such as the Women&#x27;s Joint Congressional Committee, believed that the loss of these benefits to women would not be worth the supposed gain to them in equality. In 1924, &quot;The Forum&quot; hosted a debate between Doris Stevens and Alice Hamilton concerning the two perspectives on the proposed amendment. Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches toward gender equality. One approach emphasized the common humanity of women and men, while the other stressed women&#x27;s unique experiences and how they were different from men, seeking recognition for specific needs. The opposition to the ERA was led by Mary Anderson and the Women&#x27;s Bureau beginning in 1923. These feminists argued that legislation including mandated minimum wages, safety regulations, restricted daily and weekly hours, lunch breaks, and maternity provisions would be more beneficial to the majority of women who were forced to work out of economic necessity, not personal fulfillment. The debate also drew from struggles between working class and professional women. Alice Hamilton, in her speech &quot;Protection for Women Workers&quot;, said that the ERA would strip working women of the small protections they had achieved, leaving them powerless to further improve their condition in the future, or to attain necessary protections in the present.

The National Woman&#x27;s Party already had tested its approach in Wisconsin, where it won passage of the Wisconsin Equal Rights Law in 1921. The party then took the ERA to Congress, where U.S. senator Charles Curtis, a future vice president of the United States, introduced it for the first time in October 1921. Although the ERA was introduced in every congressional session between 1921 and 1972, it almost never reached the floor of either the Senate or the House for a vote. Instead, it was usually blocked in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35—not receiving the required two-thirds supermajority.

=== Post-World War II developments (1940s–1960s) ===
World War II was correlated with a rise supporters of the ERA. Due to the war, many women had to take on untraditional roles at home and in the workforce. Protectionists were against the ERA because they believed women need to be treated differently than men, because they are biologically different. Women entered the workforce and proved they could handle working the same jobs as men, including joining the U.S. Armed Forces. Women were supporting their country, despite not being compensated or respected fairly. With the increased patriotism in the country people began to see the value of women being involved in their country. As the war continued, more opportunities for women to work opened up due to fewer men being available. The support for equality grew with this as women continued to prove their ability and willingness to work. 

==== Initial support from the Republican Party and the Hayden rider ====
The Republican Party included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in 1940, renewing the plank every four years until 1980. The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women, while some Southern Democrats also supported it.

In 1950 and 1953, the ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as &quot;the Hayden rider&quot;, introduced by Arizona senator Carl Hayden. The Hayden rider added a sentence to the ERA to keep special protections for women: &quot;The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex.&quot; By allowing women to keep their existing and future special protections, it was expected that the ERA would be more appealing to its opponents. Though opponents were marginally more in favor of the ERA with the Hayden rider, supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment&#x27;s original purpose—causing the amendment not to be passed in the House.

ERA supporters were hopeful that the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower would advance their agenda. Eisenhower had publicly promised to &quot;assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights,&quot; and in 1958, Eisenhower asked a joint session of Congress to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first president to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, the National Woman&#x27;s Party found the amendment to be unacceptable and asked it to be withdrawn whenever the Hayden rider was added to the ERA.

==== Initial opposition from the New Deal Democrats ====
Eleanor Roosevelt and most New Dealers opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle-class women, but that working-class women needed government protection. They also feared that the ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the New Deal coalition. Most Northern Democrats, who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.

The ERA was also opposed by the American Federation of Labor and other labor unions, which feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. The League of Women Voters, formerly the National American Woman Suffrage Association, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.

At the 1944 Democratic National Convention, the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but this was a hotly contested change not reflected in later party platforms. At the Democratic National Convention in 1960, a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it was opposed by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the AFL-CIO, labor unions such as the American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the American Nurses Association, the Women&#x27;s Division of the Methodist Church, and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women. 

Between 1948 and 1970, chairman Emanuel Celler of the House Judiciary Committee, refused to consider the ERA in the House of Representatives.

==== Support from the Democratic Party under Kennedy ====
Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy announced his support of the ERA in an October 21, 1960, letter to the chairman of the National Woman&#x27;s Party. Ultimately however, as president, Kennedy&#x27;s ties to labor unions meant that he and his administration did not support the ERA.

Kennedy did appoint a blue-ribbon commission on women, the President&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women, to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The commission was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it publicly. In the early 1960s, Eleanor Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that, as far as she was concerned, they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However, she never went so far as to endorse the ERA. The commission that she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed, believing that the Supreme Court could give sex the same &quot;suspect&quot; test as race and national origin, through interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The Supreme Court did not provide the &quot;suspect&quot; class test for sex, however, resulting in a continuing lack of equal rights. The commission did, though, help win passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which banned sex discrimination in wages in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions that it initially excluded) and secured an executive order from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the civil service. The commission, composed largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed.

The national commission spurred the establishment of state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of Alice Paul and Coretta Scott King and the political influence of Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan.

==== Impact of second-wave feminism ====

A new women&#x27;s movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: Betty Friedan&#x27;s bestseller &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;; the network of women&#x27;s rights commissions formed by Kennedy&#x27;s national commission; the frustration over women&#x27;s social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in Washington, D.C., Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the National Organization for Women (NOW) to act as an &quot;NAACP for women&quot;, demanding full equality for American women and men. In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment. The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the Women&#x27;s Equity Action League (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership. By the late 1960s, NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly elected representative Shirley Chisholm of New York gave her famous speech &quot;Equal Rights for Women&quot; on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

== Views ==

=== In support ===
Supporters of the ERA point to the lack of a specific guarantee in the Constitution for equal rights protections on the basis of sex. In 1973, future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg summarized a supporting argument for the ERA in the &quot;American Bar Association Journal&quot;:The equal rights amendment, in sum, would dedicate the nation to a new view of the rights and responsibilities of men and women. It firmly rejects sharp legislative lines between the sexes as constitutionally tolerable. Instead, it looks toward a legal system in which each person will be judged on the basis of individual merit and not on the basis of an unalterable trait of birth that bears no necessary relationship to need or ability.

Later, Ginsburg voiced her opinion that the best course of action on the Equal Rights Amendment is to start over, due to being past its expiration date. While at a discussion at Georgetown University in February 2020, Ginsburg noted the challenge that &quot;if you count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard states that said &#x27;we&#x27;ve changed our minds?&#x27;&quot;

In the early 1940s, both the Democratic and Republican parties added support for the ERA to their platforms.

The National Organization for Women (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of almost 80 organizations, led the pro-ERA efforts. Between 1972 and 1982, ERA supporters held rallies, petitioned, picketed, went on hunger strikes, and performed acts of civil disobedience. On July 9, 1978, NOW and other organizations hosted a national march in Washington, D.C., which garnered over 100,000 supporters, and was followed by a Lobby Day on July 10. On June 6, 1982, NOW sponsored marches in states that had not passed the ERA including Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. Key feminists of the time, such as Gloria Steinem, spoke out in favor of the ERA, arguing that ERA opposition was based on gender myths that overemphasized difference and ignored evidence of unequal treatment between men and women. A more militant feminist group, Grassroots Group of Second Class Citizens, organized a series of non-violent direct action tactics in support of the ERA in Illinois in 1982.

It has been noted that many African-American women have supported the ERA. One prominent female supporter was New York representative Shirley Chisholm. On August 10, 1970, she gave a speech on the ERA called &quot;For the Equal Rights Amendment&quot; in Washington, D.C. In her address, she claimed that sex discrimination had become widespread and that the ERA would remedy it. She also claimed that laws to protect women in the workforce from unsafe working conditions would be needed by men, too, and thus the ERA would help all people. By 1976, 60% of African-American women and 63% of African-American men were in favor of the ERA, and the legislation was supported by organizations such as the NAACP, National Council of Negro Women, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, National Association of Negro Business, and the National Black Feminist Organization.

The ERA has been supported by several Republican women including Florence Dwyer, Jill Ruckelshaus, Mary Dent Crisp, Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, First Lady Betty Ford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith. Support from Republican men has included President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Richard Nixon, Senator Richard Lugar and Senator Strom Thurmond.

=== In opposition ===

Many opponents of the ERA focus on the importance of traditional gender roles. They argued that the amendment would guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to conscription and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional gender roles proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative Republican activist from Missouri, used traditional symbols of the American housewife. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, &quot;Preserve us from a Congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham&quot; and &quot;I am for Mom and apple pie.&quot; They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases. It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed. Women who supported traditional gender roles started to oppose the ERA. Schlafly said passage of the amendment would threaten Social Security benefits for housewives. Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that women&#x27;s colleges would have to admit men. Schlafly&#x27;s argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.
At the 1980 Republican National Convention, the Republican Party platform was amended to end its support for the ERA. The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Schlafly. Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often attempt to incite feminists by opening her speeches with lines such as, &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight—I always like to say that, because it makes the libs so mad.&quot; When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%. Public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as its opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.

Phyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat. Political scientist Jane Mansbridge in her history of the ERA argues that the draft issue was the single most powerful argument used by Schlafly and the other opponents to defeat ERA. Mansbridge concluded, &quot;Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed—rightly in my view—that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s early and effective effort to organize potential opponents.&quot; Legal scholar Joan C. Williams maintained, &quot;ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles.&quot; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo asserted:

As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA&#x27;s defeat seriously damaged the women&#x27;s movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change... Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.

The John Birch Society and its members organized opposition to the ERA in multiple states. According to Professor Edward H. Miller, the group played a key role in addition to Schlafly in preventing the amendment&#x27;s ratification.

Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on special interest forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting that they had funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority. Such supporters argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, labor feminists and (until 1973) the AFL–CIO. Steinem blamed the insurance industry and said Schlafly &quot;did not change one vote.&quot; Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry. Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong backing among Southern whites, Evangelical Christians, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, including both men and women.

The ERA has long been opposed by anti-abortion groups who believe it would be interpreted to allow legal abortion without limits and taxpayer funding for abortion.

== Congressional passage (1970–1972) ==

In February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality. Said Betty Friedan of the strike, &quot;All kinds of women&#x27;s groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women&#x27;s life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the Equal Rights Amendment.&quot; Despite being centered in New York City—which was regarded as one of the biggest strongholds for NOW and other groups sympathetic to the women&#x27;s liberation movement such as Redstockings—and having a small number of participants in contrast to the large-scale anti-war and civil rights protests that had occurred in the recent time prior to the event, the strike was credited as one of the biggest turning points in the rise of second-wave feminism.

In Washington, D.C., protesters presented a sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment at the U.S. Capitol. Influential news sources such as &quot;Time&quot; also supported the cause of the protestors. Soon after the strike took place, activists distributed literature across the country as well. In 1970, congressional hearings began on the ERA.

On August 10, 1970, Michigan Democrat Martha Griffiths successfully brought the Equal Rights Amendment to the House floor, after 15 years of the joint resolution having languished in the House Judiciary Committee. The joint resolution passed in the House and continued on to the Senate, which voted for the ERA with an added clause that women would be exempt from the military. The 91st Congress, however, ended before the joint resolution could progress any further.

Griffiths reintroduced the ERA, and achieved success on Capitol Hill with her , which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas (For), 24 nays (Against) and 51 not voting. Griffiths&#x27;s joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate—without change—on March 22, 1972, by a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting. The Senate version, drafted by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, passed after the defeat of an amendment proposed by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina that would have exempted women from the draft. President Richard Nixon immediately endorsed the ERA&#x27;s approval upon its passage by the 92nd Congress.

== Ratification in the state legislatures ==
=== Ratifications ===
On March 22, 1972, the ERA was placed before the state legislatures, with a seven-year deadline to acquire ratification by three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures. A majority of states ratified the proposed constitutional amendment within a year. Hawaii became the first state to ratify the ERA, which it did on the same day the amendment was approved by Congress: The U.S. Senate&#x27;s vote on took place in the mid-to-late afternoon in Washington, D.C., when it was still midday in Hawaii. The Hawaii Senate and House of Representatives voted their approval shortly after noon Hawaii Standard Time.

During 1972, a total of 22 state legislatures ratified the amendment and eight more joined in early 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the approaching March 22, 1979, deadline.

The ERA was ratified by the following states prior to the initial March 22, 1979, deadline:
# Hawaii: March 22, 1972
# New Hampshire: March 23, 1972
# Delaware: March 23, 1972
# Iowa: March 24, 1972

The ERA has been ratified by the following states since the March 22, 1979, deadline:

Ratification resolutions have also been defeated in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

==== Rescinding ratification ====

Six states legislatures (noted above) have rescinded their earlier ratification of the ERA. Article V of the Constitution is silent as to whether a state may rescind, or otherwise revoke, a previous ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment while it is pending before the states. The rescinding of a ratification of a constitutional amendment has occurred previously. In the 1860s, a few states voted to rescind their ratifications for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. On both occasions however, these actions were rejected and the original ratification was counted when the federal government tallied the total states that had ratified the amendment.

In February 2024, the American Bar Association (ABA) passed resolution 601, supporting implementation of the ERA. The ABA urges implementation stating that a deadline for ratification of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is not consistent with Article V of the Constitution and that under Article V, states are not permitted to rescind prior ratifications.

Researchers at Columbia Law School&#x27;s Center for Gender and Sexuality Law have written that &quot;[t]he Constitution says nothing about whether a state can rescind or revoke its ratification of a Constitutional Amendment, either before the ratification process has been completed or after.&quot; Advocates and scholars dispute whether ratification is a one-time event, once done it cannot be undone as the Constitution only provides for ratification, not unratification.

=== Sunsetting ratifications ===
==== South Dakota (pre-1979 deadline) ====
Among those rejecting Congress&#x27;s claim to even hold authority to extend a previously established ratification deadline, the South Dakota Legislature adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979. The joint resolution stipulated that South Dakota&#x27;s 1973 ERA ratification would be &quot;sunsetted&quot; as of the original deadline, March 22, 1979. South Dakota&#x27;s 1979 sunset joint resolution declared: &quot;the Ninety-fifth Congress ex post facto has sought unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions in such a way as to materially affect the congressionally established time period for ratification&quot; (designated as &quot;POM-93&quot; by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; of March 13, 1979, at pages 4861 and 4862).

The action on the part of South Dakota lawmakers—occurring 21 days prior to originally agreed-upon deadline of March 22, 1979—could be viewed as slightly different from a rescission. &quot;Constitution Annotated&quot; notes that &quot;[f]our states had rescinded their ratifications [of the ERA] and a fifth had declared that its ratification would be void unless the amendment was ratified within the original time limit&quot;, with a footnote identifying South Dakota as that &quot;fifth&quot; state.

==== North Dakota (post-1979 deadline) ====
On March 19, 2021, North Dakota state lawmakers adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4010 to retroactively clarify that North Dakota&#x27;s 1975 ratification of the ERA was valid only through &quot;11:59 p.m. on March 22, 1979&quot; and went on to proclaim that North Dakota &quot;should not be counted by Congress, the Archivist of the United States, lawmakers in any other state, any court of law, or any other person, as still having on record a live ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as was offered by House Joint Resolution No. 208 of the 92nd Congress on March 22, 1972&quot;. The resolution was formally received by the U.S. Senate on April 20, 2021, was designated as &quot;POM-10&quot;, was referred to the Senate&#x27;s Judiciary Committee, and its full and complete verbatim text was published at page S2066 of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

== Ratification deadline and extension ==

=== Congressional action ===
The original joint resolution (), by which the 92nd Congress proposed the amendment to the states, was prefaced by the following resolving clause:

As the joint resolution was passed on March 22, 1972, this effectively set March 22, 1979, as the deadline for the amendment to be ratified by the requisite number of states. However, the 92nd Congress did not incorporate any time limit into the body of the actual text of the proposed amendment, as had been done with a number of other proposed amendments.

In 1978, as the original 1979 deadline approached, the 95th Congress adopted , by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of New York (House: August; Senate: October 6; signing of the President: October 20), which purported to extend the ERA&#x27;s ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. H.J.Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a simple majority, not a supermajority) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H.J.Res. 638 be transmitted to then-President Jimmy Carter for signature as a safety precaution. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Virginia&quot; (1798) that the President of the United States has no formal role in the passing of constitutional amendments. Carter signed the joint resolution, although he noted, on strictly procedural grounds, the irregularity of his doing so given the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in 1798. During this disputed extension of slightly more than three years, no additional states ratified or rescinded.
The purported extension of ERA&#x27;s ratification deadline was vigorously contested in 1978 as scholars were divided as to whether Congress actually has authority to revise a previously agreed-to deadline for the states to act upon a constitutional amendment. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102–71 in favor, but Illinois&#x27; internal parliamentary rules required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters, known as the Grassroots Group of Second Class Citizens, went on a fast known as Women Hunger for Justice and seventeen chained themselves to the entrance of the Illinois Senate chamber. Sonia Johnson, Zoe Nicholson and Sister Maureen Feidler all participated in the fast. The closest that the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979, and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the Florida House of Representatives on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the Florida Senate by a vote of 16 to 22. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38. Many ERA supporters mourned the failure of the amendment. For example, a jazz funeral for the ERA was held in New Orleans in July 1982.

According to research by Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 of them explicitly referred to the original 1979 deadline.

=== Lawsuit regarding deadline extension ===
On December 23, 1981, a federal district court, in the case of &quot;Idaho v. Freeman&quot;, ruled that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline to June 30, 1982, was not valid, and that the ERA had actually expired from state legislative consideration more than two years earlier on the original expiration date of March 22, 1979. On January 25, 1982, however, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the lower court&#x27;s decision.

After the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of &quot;NOW v. Idaho&quot;, 459 U.S. 809 (1982), vacated the federal district court decision in &quot;Idaho v. Freeman&quot;, which, in addition to declaring March 22, 1979, as ERA&#x27;s expiration date, had upheld the validity of state rescissions. The Supreme Court declared these controversies moot based on the memorandum of the appellant Gerald P. Carmen, the then-Administrator of General Services, that the ERA had not received the required number of ratifications (38) and so &quot;the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here&quot;.

In the 1939 case of &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that if there was not a deadline by which the proposed amendment had to be acted upon by the requisite three-fourths of state legislatures or state ratifying conventions, then the proposed amendment remains. The court also ruled that it is in the discretion of Congress to arbitrate whether at least three-fourths of the states have ratified that amendment.

== Lawsuits regarding ratification ==
=== Alabama lawsuit opposing ratification ===
On December 16, 2019, the states of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota sued to prevent further ratifying of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall stated, &quot;The people had seven years to consider the ERA, and they rejected it. To sneak it into the Constitution through this illegal process would undermine the very basis for our constitutional order.&quot;

South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg stated in a press release:

On January 6, 2020, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel official Steven Engel issued an opinion in response to the lawsuit by Alabama, Louisiana, and South Dakota, stating that &quot;We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the States.&quot; The OLC argued in part that Congress had the authority to impose a deadline for the ERA and that it did not have the authority to retroactively extend the deadline once it had expired.

On February 27, 2020, the States of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota entered into a joint stipulation and voluntary dismissal with the Archivist of the United States. The joint stipulation incorporated the Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel&#x27;s opinion; stated that the Archivist would not certify the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment and stated that if the Department of Justice ever concludes that the 1972 ERA Resolution is still pending and that the Archivist therefore has authority to certify the ERA&#x27;s adoption ... the Archivist will make no certification concerning ratification of the ERA until at least 45 days following the announcement of the Department of Justice&#x27;s conclusion, absent a court order compelling him to do so sooner.&quot; On March 2, 2020, Federal District Court Judge L. Scott Coogler entered an order regarding the Joint Stipulation and Plaintiff&#x27;s Voluntary Dismissal, granting the dismissal without prejudice.

=== Massachusetts lawsuit supporting ratification ===
On January 7, 2020, a complaint was filed by Equal Means Equal, The Yellow Roses and Katherine Weitbrecht in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Archivist of the United States, seeking to have him count the three most recently ratifying states and certify the ERA as having become part of the United States Constitution. On August 6, 2020, Judge Denise Casper granted the Archivist&#x27;s motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue to compel the Archivist to certify and so she could not rule on the merits of the case. On August 21, 2020, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and on September 2, 2020, the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear this case. Subsequently, the Supreme Court denied the request to intervene before the First Circuit gives its decision. On June 29, 2021, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court&#x27;s decision that &quot;the plaintiffs have not met their burden at the pleading stage with respect to those federal constitutional requirements; we affirm the order dismissing their suit for lack of standing.&quot; An &quot;en banc&quot; rehearing request was denied on January 4, 2022.

=== 2020–2023 lawsuit in the District of Columbia supporting ratification ===
On January 30, 2020, the attorneys general of Virginia, Illinois and Nevada filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to require the Archivist of the United States to &quot;carry out his statutory duty of recognizing the complete and final adoption&quot; of the ERA as the Twenty-eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
On February 19, 2020, the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee moved to intervene in the case. On March 10, 2020, the Plaintiff States (Virginia, Illinois and Nevada) filed a memorandum in opposition to the five states seeking to intervene. On May 7, 2020, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the states do not have standing to bring the case to trial as they have to show any &quot;concrete injury&quot;, nor that the case was ripe for review.

On June 12, 2020, the District Court granted the Intervening states (Alabama, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee) motion to intervene in the case. On March 5, 2021, federal judge Rudolph Contreras of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the ratification period for the ERA &quot;expired long ago&quot; and that three states&#x27; recent ratifications had come too late to be counted in the amendment&#x27;s favor.

On May 3, 2021, the plaintiff states appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Virginia withdrew from the lawsuit in February 2022. Oral arguments were held on September 28, 2022, before a panel composed by judges Wilkins, Rao and Childs. On February 28, 2023, the panel ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the ERA deadline invalid.

=== 2023–2024 California lawsuit supporting ratification ===
On June 23, 2023, Vikram Valame filed a complaint against the Selective Service System for harms caused by the Military Selective Service Act. The plaintiff argued that he was &quot;subject to criminal prosecution, fines and imprisonment&quot; under &quot;unconstitutional registration and reporting requirements&quot; and denied &quot;valuable educational and job opportunities&quot; due to failure to register. Valame argued that the ERA had been validly ratified as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution, contending that Congress&#x27;s deadline for ratification was unconstitutional under Article V and that states had no ability to revoke their ratifications.

On January 20, 2024, Judge Nathanael M. Cousins granted the defendants&#x27; motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiff&#x27;s motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that &quot;no 28th Amendment appears in the Constitution&quot; and that the plaintiff &quot;cannot state a claim for relief under a constitutional amendment that does not exist.&quot; Valame filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day as the district court&#x27;s ruling. As of early 2024, the case was pending before the Ninth Circuit.

== Post-deadline history ==

=== Post-deadline ratifications and the &quot;three-state strategy&quot; ===
Beginning in the mid-1990s, ERA supporters began an effort to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982. These proponents state that Congress can remove the ERA&#x27;s ratification deadline despite the deadline having expired, allowing the states again to ratify it. They also state that the ratifications ERA previously received remain in force and that rescissions of prior ratifications are not valid. Those who espouse the &quot;three-state strategy&quot; (now complete if the Nevada, Illinois and Virginia belated ERA approvals are deemed legitimate) were spurred, at least in part, by the unconventional 202-year-long ratification of the Constitution&#x27;s Twenty-seventh Amendment (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Madison Amendment&quot;) which became part of the Constitution in 1992 after pending before the state legislatures since 1789. However, the &quot;Madison Amendment&quot; was not associated with a ratification deadline, whereas the proposing clause of the ERA did include a deadline.

On June 21, 2009, the National Organization for Women decided to support both efforts to obtain additional state ratifications for the 1972 ERA and any strategy to submit a fresh-start ERA to the states for ratification.

In 2013, the Library of Congress&#x27;s Congressional Research Service issued a report saying that ratification deadlines are a political question: The report goes on to say:

However, most recently, ERA Action has both led and brought renewed vigor to the movement by instituting what has become known as the &quot;three-state strategy&quot;. In 2013, ERA Action began to gain traction with this strategy through their coordination with U.S. Senators and Representatives not only to introduce legislation in both houses of Congress to remove the ratification deadline, but also in gaining legislative sponsors. The Congressional Research Service then issued a report on the &quot;three state strategy&quot; on April 8, 2013, entitled &quot;The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues&quot;, stating that the approach was viable.

In 2014, under the auspices of ERA Action and their coalition partners, both the Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify the ERA. That year, votes were blocked in both states&#x27; House chambers. In the meantime, the ERA ratification movement continued with the resolution being introduced in 10 state legislatures.

In the 2010s, due in part to fourth-wave feminism and the #MeToo movement, observers noted a renewed interest in adoption of the ERA.

On March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature became the first state in 40 years to ratify the ERA.

Illinois lawmakers and citizens took another look at the ERA, with hearings, testimony, and research including work by the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn to address common legal questions about the ERA.

Illinois state lawmakers ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018, with a 72–45 vote in the Illinois House following a 43–12 vote in the Illinois Senate in April 2018.

Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in January of 2020. Prior, an effort to ratify the ERA in the Virginia General Assembly in 2018 failed to reach the floor of either the House of Delegates or Senate. In 2019, a Senate committee voted to advance the ERA to the floor. On January 15, the Senate voted 26–14 to approve the amendment and forward it to the House of Delegates, but it was defeated there in a 50–50 tied vote; at the time, the Republican Party held one-seat majorities in both houses. After the 2019 elections in Virginia gave the Democratic Party majority control of both houses of the Virginia legislature, the incoming leaders expressed their intent to hold another vote on ratification early in the 2020 legislative session. They did so, with ERA ratification resolutions HJ1 and SJ1 being passed in their respective chambers on January 15, 2020, and being passed by each other on January 27. Experts and advocates have acknowledged the legal uncertainty of the Virginian ratification, due to the expired deadlines and five revocations.

On December 15, 2024, a group of over 120 Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Representatives Cori Bush (D-Missouri) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts), sent a letter to outgoing President Joe Biden, arguing that both the deadlines and the revocations were illegitimate, meaning the ERA had been successfully ratified by 38 states, and urging Biden to direct the Archivist of the United States to certify the amendment as part of the Constitution immediately.

=== Reintroduction of the amendment in Congress ===
The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) championed it in the Senate from the 99th Congress through the 110th Congress. Senator Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey) introduced the amendment at the end of the 111th Congress and supported it in the 112th Congress. In the House of Representatives, Carolyn Maloney (D-New York) has sponsored it since the 105th Congress, most recently in August 2013.

In 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor. That was the last time that the ERA received a floor vote in either house of Congress.

At the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with representatives Maloney, Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) and Gwen Moore (D-Wisconsin), held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment&#x27;s adoption. On March 5, 2013, the ERA was reintroduced by Senator Menendez as S.J. Res. 10.

The &quot;New ERA&quot; introduced in 2013, sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, adds an additional sentence to the original text: &quot;Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.&quot;

In 2023, the Congressional Caucus for the Equal Rights Amendment was founded by House Democrats.

=== Proposed removal of ratification deadline ===
On March 8, 2011, the 100th anniversary of International Women&#x27;s Day, Representative Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) introduced legislation (H.J. Res. 47) to remove the congressionally imposed deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The resolution had 56 cosponsors. The resolution was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution by the House Committee on the Judiciary. The Subcommittee failed to vote on the resolution, and as such, the resolution died in subcommittee when the 112th Congress ended in January 2013. On March 22, 2012, the 40th anniversary of the ERA&#x27;s congressional approval, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Maryland) introduced (S.J. Res. 39)—which is worded with slight differences from Representative Baldwin&#x27;s (H.J. Res. 47). Senator Cardin was joined by seventeen other senators who cosponsored the Senate Joint Resolution. The resolution was referred to Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where a vote on it was never brought. The resolution, therefore, died in committee when the 112th Congress ended in January 2013.

On February 24, 2013, the New Mexico House of Representatives adopted House Memorial No. 7 asking that the congressionally imposed deadline for ERA ratification be removed. House Memorial No. 7 was officially received by the U.S. Senate on January 6, 2014, was designated as &quot;POM-175&quot; and was referred to the Senate&#x27;s Committee on the Judiciary.

On January 30, 2019, Representative Jackie Speier (D-California) introduced legislation () in a renewed attempt to remove the deadline to ratify the amendment. As of April 30, 2019, the resolution had 188 co-sponsors, including Republicans Tom Reed of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. It was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties by the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day. The subcommittee heard testimony on the amendment and extension of the deadline on April 30, 2019.

On November 8, 2019, Representative Jackie Speier (D-California) re-introduced the bill as to attempt to remove the deadline to ratify the amendment with 214 co-sponsors (later 224). The House passed H.J. Res. 79 on February 13, 2020, by a vote of 232–183, which was mostly along party lines though five Republicans joined in support. The bill expired without Senate action.

At the beginning of the 117th Congress, a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 17) to remove the deadline for ratification was again introduced in both chambers, with bipartisan support. The House passed the resolution by a 222–204 vote on March 17, 2021. The companion bill, S.J.Res. 1, introduced by Senator Ben Cardin, was co-sponsored by all 50 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus and Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. The measure failed as the Senate took no action on it.

=== Minnesota legislature resolution ===

On May 19, 2023, the Minnesota Legislature adopted a resolution memorializing Congress to declare the ERA fully ratified by the states, and now the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Governor Tim Walz signed the legislation on May 26, and it was then sent to Congress and to President Joe Biden.

=== Biden declaration ===
On January 17, 2025, President Biden declared that, in his opinion, the Equal Rights Amendment was the law of the land, stating: &quot;It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people. In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.&quot; The declaration has no formal effect, however, and the National Archives has said they do not intend to certify the amendment as part of the Constitution, citing &quot;established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions&quot; supporting the integrity of the original ratification deadline in the absence of any subsequent extension or deadline removal by Congress or the court system. This controversial statement led to widespread criticism, with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s analysis concluding &quot;it&#x27;s also remarkable that a president would try to declare something that isn&#x27;t clearly the law to be not just the law, but part of the most significant legal document our country has. That at the very least skips over a whole lot of very valid legal issues that have never been settled.&quot;

== State equal rights amendments ==
Twenty-five states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The 1879 Constitution of California contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to &quot;entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment&quot;. Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to ensure political and civil equality between women and men. Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states, or afterward.

Some equal rights amendments and original constitutional equal rights provisions are:

* Alaska: No person is to be denied the enjoyment of any civil or political right because of race, color, creed, sex or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section. &quot;Alaska Constitution, Article I, § 3 (1972)&quot;

* Massachusetts: All people are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin. &quot;Massachusetts Constitution, Part 1, Article 1 as amended by Article CVI by vote of the People, (1976)&quot;
* Montana: Individual dignity. The dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas. &quot;Montana Constitution, Article II, § 4 (1973)&quot;

<text>Crocus (; plural: crocuses or croci) is a genus of seasonal flowering plants in the family Iridaceae (iris family) comprising about 100 species of perennials growing from corms. They are low growing plants, whose flower stems remain underground, that bear relatively large white, yellow, orange or purple flowers and then become dormant after flowering. Many are cultivated for their flowers, appearing in autumn, winter, or spring. The flowers close at night and in overcast weather conditions. The crocus has been known throughout recorded history, mainly as the source of saffron. Saffron is obtained from the dried stigma of &quot;Crocus sativus&quot;, an autumn-blooming species. It is valued as a spice and dyestuff, and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Iran is the center of saffron production. Crocuses are native to woodland, scrub, and meadows from sea level to alpine tundra from the Mediterranean, through North Africa, central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across Central Asia to Xinjiang in western China. Crocuses may be propagated from seed or from daughter cormels formed on the corm, that eventually produce mature plants. They arrived in Europe from Turkey in the 16th century and became valued as an ornamental flowering plant.
==Description==

=== General ===
&quot;Crocus&quot; display the general characteristics of family Iridaceae, which include basal cauline (arising from the aerial stem) leaves that sheath the stem base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, the perianth petaloid with two whorls of three tepals each and septal nectaries. The flowers have three stamens and a gynoecium of three united carpels and an inferior ovary, three locules and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule.

&quot;Crocus&quot; is an acaulescent (lacking a visible lower stem above ground) diminutive seasonal cormous (growing from corms) herbaceous perennial geophytic genus. The corms are symmetrical and globose or oblate (round in shape with flatted tops and bottoms), and are covered with tunic leaves that are fibrous, membranous or coriaceous (leathery). The corms produce fibrous roots, and contractile roots which adjust the corms depth in the soil, which may be pulled as deep as into the soil.The roots appear randomly from the lower part of the corm, but in a few species, from a basal ridge.

=== Leaves ===
Plants produce several basal linear bifacial green leaves that arise from the corms. These are adaxially (upper surface facing axis) flat or channelled with pale median stripes, while the opposite (abaxial) surface is strongly keeled, with two grooves on either side. The leaves have a distinctive shape in cross-section, being boat-shaped with two lateral arms with margins recurved inwardly towards the central ridged keel, forming the sides of the &quot;boat&quot;. The keel may be square or rectangular, but is lacking in &quot;C. carpetanus&quot;. The pale central stripe is caused by parenchymatous cells which lack chloroplasts and may contain air spaces. The leaves are from wide and long. The leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent. The leaf bases are surrounded by up to 5 membranous sheaths called cataphylls, a specialised leaf. The bases of the cataphylls form the corm tunic, and their number varies from 3 to 6, and enclose the true leaves (euphylls), bracts, bracteoles and flowering stalk.

=== Flowers ===
The number of peduncles (flower stems) vary from one to several and remain underground, emerging only at the fruiting stage, bearing flowers that are solitary or several, so that a true scape is absent. The flowers are pedicellate (attached to the peduncle by a short subterranean pedicel stalk). The pedicel is sometimes subtended (below pedicel) by a membranous, sheathing prophyll (leaf-like structure).

The showy, salver to cup-shaped, single or clustered actinomorphic flowers taper off into a narrow tube; the flowers emerge from the ground, and can be white, yellow, lilac to dark purple, or variegated in cultivars. The flower tube is long, cylindrical and slender, expanding apically. The floral tube is long and narrow with 6 lobes in 2 whorls. The perianth is 3+3 (3 sepals+3petals) and gamophyllous (with fused segments). The tepal whorls are similar, equal or subequal with a smaller inner whorl, and cupped to outspread. The bracts are membranous, but the inner ones are sometimes lacking.

The 3 stamens are erect and linear and inserted in the throat of the perianth tube, with anthers shorter than the filaments. Pollen grains are inaperturate (apertures absent) but sometimes spiraperturate (spiral shaped). Each flower has a single style which is exserted (projecting beyond the corolla tube) and slender distally with three to many branches. The branches are highly variable, being short or long, and simple, bifurcate (dividing in two) or multifid and sometimes distally flattened. The inferior ovary has 3 carpels with axile placentation. It remains underground, and as the seeds ripen, the pedicel (stem of the flower) grows longer - so the fruit is above the soil surface.

=== Fruit and seed ===
The fruit is a small membranous capsule, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid in shape and the many seeds are globose to ellipsoid. The seed surface is highly variable, including papillate (covered in small protuberances), digitiform (finger-like) and other epidermal cell types. In some species the seeds are arillate, with fleshy appendages. Crocus seeds have both inner and outer integuments and in some species the outer epidermis may display long papillae. Embryo-sac development is Polygonum type. Dehiscence (splitting of the capsule to release the seed) is of the loculicidal type in which it splits through the wall of the locules leaving the septa that separate them intact.

=== Karyology ===
&quot;Crocus&quot; has extensive aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), with some uncertainty as to the base number of chromosomes. The chromosome numbers shows extreme variability, ranging from 2n=6 to 2n=70 even within a single species.

=== Phytochemistry ===
The Iridaceae contain a wide range of phenolic compounds. However, 6-Hydroxyflavones are found only in &quot;Crocus&quot;, which is also characterised by the presence of crocins, water-soluble yellow carotenoids, in the floral tissues. Crocin is a diester of crocetin, responsible for the colour of the styles and stigma of &quot;C. sativus&quot;, and hence saffron. A few species contain mangiferin, a .

While the flowers may vary dramatically between species, there is little variation in the leaves, but sufficient variability in corm tunics that they may be used as an aid in differentiating taxa.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===

The crocus was well known to the ancients, being described at least as early as Theophrastus (c. 371c. 287 BC), and was introduced into Britain by the Romans, where the saffron crocus was used as a dyestuff. It was reintroduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders. The crocus is mentioned in mediaeval and later herbals, one of the earliest being the 14th century &quot;Tractatus de Herbis.&quot; William Turner (1548) states that the crocus is referred to as saffron in English, implying that only &quot;C. sativus&quot; was known at that time. However, by 1597 John Gerard writes of &quot;sundry sorts&quot; and uses the term saffron and crocus as interchangeable. He included both spring and autumn flowering crocus, but distinguished Wild Saffron (Crocus) from Meadow Saffron (Colchicum). He described eleven forms. Some of his specimens were obtained from Clusius. In the following century, John Parkinson in a more detailed account was more careful to include separate chapters for &quot;Colchicum&quot;, with the common name of meadow saffron, from &quot;Crocus&quot; or saffron. Parkinson (1656) states that there are &quot;divers sorts of saffrons&quot; describing 27 spring flowering plants and 4 autumn flowering ones, pointing out that only one of those was the true saffron crocus, which he called &quot;Crocus verus sativus autumnalis&quot;. Similar accounts are found in continental European herbals, including those of l&#x27;Obel in Flanders (1576) and Besler&#x27;s &quot;Hortus Eystettensis&quot; in Bavaria (1613).

The genus &quot;Crocus&quot; was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with three taxa, and two species, &quot;C. sativus&quot; (type species), var. &quot;officinalis&quot; (now treated as a synonym of &quot;C. sativus&quot;) and var. &quot;vernus&quot; (now &quot;C. vernus&quot;) and &quot;C. bulbocodium&quot; (now &quot;Romulea bulbocodium&quot;). Thus Linnaeus recognised two taxa that are accepted as separate species in modern classifications, one vernal and one autumnal crocus, but incorrectly assumed they were only varieties of a single species, while his second species was actually from a closely related genus that was only recognised later (1772). However, a subsequent re-examination of Linnaeus&#x27;s specimens suggested the presence of several different species that he did not recognise as being separate. Linnaeus&#x27; system, based on sexual characteristics, &quot;Crocus&quot; was classified as Triandra Monogynia (Three stamens, Single pistil). Linnaeus&#x27;s system was supplanted by the &quot;natural&quot; system which used a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks based on weighting of the importance of structural characteristics of the plant. Jussieu (1789) placed the genus Crocus in his &quot;Ordo&quot; (family) Irides or &quot;Les iris&quot;, as a member of the class &quot;Stamina epigyna&quot; (stamens inserted above the ovary) as part of the monocotyledons, the first level of the division of the flowering plants. 

One of the first monographs of the genus appeared in 1809, by Haworth, followed in 1829 by that of Sabine, and Herbert in 1847. In 1853, Lindley continued the placement of &quot;Crocus&quot; as one of 53 genera in Iridaceae, which he included in a higher order of monocotyledons, the Narcissales. Baker published a monograph on the genus in 1874, adopting a very different schema to that of Herbert. In 1883, Bentham and Hooker described the Irideae (Iridaceae) as having more than 700 species, and divided it into 3 tribes and further into subtribes. Tribe Sysyrinchieae as having 2 subtribes, including Ixieae. The latter was circumscribed with four genera, &quot;Crocus&quot;, &quot;Syringodea&quot;, &quot;Galaxia&quot; (&quot;Moraea&quot;) and &quot;Romulea&quot;. This circumscription has remained stable since, with the exception of &quot;Moraea&quot; which properly belongs in a separate tribe. The most influential monograph of the nineteenth century was that of Maw (1886), which forms the basis of modern understanding of the genus. Maw built on the work of Herbert, rejecting Baker&#x27;s classification. The availability of molecular phylogenetic methods in the late twentieth century has shown that the Iridaceae properly belong within the order Asparagales.

=== Botanical illustration ===

The scientific study of the genus in the late eighteenth century was accompanied by detailed descriptions with Botanical illustrations, such as those of William Curtis (1787) and Sims (1803), that appeared in Curtis&#x27; Botanical Magazine, with illustrations by Sydenham Edwards. Other illustrations are found in monographs such as those of Haworth (1809) and Sabine (1830), illustrated by Charles John Robertson. The largest collection is found in the most comprehensive monograph, that of Maw (1886). Other sources include the portfolios of plates, such as the survey of the plants of France by Masclef (1891). At that time only &quot;C. sativus&quot; and &quot;C. vernus&quot; were included in the Flora of France. 
=== Phylogeny ===

The genus &quot;Crocus&quot; belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae (iris family), specifically the large subfamily Crocoideae. Within that subfamily, crocus is placed on the tribe, Ixieae (synonym Croceae), one of five. The Ixieae are then subdivided into subtribes, with the genera &quot;Crocus&quot;, &quot;Romulea&quot; and &quot;Syringodea&quot; forming subtribe Romuleinae. The Romuleinae have been characterised within the Ixieae by progressively reduced aerial stems. solitary flowers on the stem branches and woody tunics on the corms. They also often have divided style branches. However, &quot;Crocus&quot; corm tunics are fibrous and membranous rather than woody as in &quot;Syringodea.&quot; Also, &quot;Crocus&quot; has a ridged and often keeled abaxial leaf surface, while that of &quot;Syringodea&quot; is rounded, and the midline adaxial translucency of &quot;Crocus&quot; is lacking in &quot;Syringodea&quot;. &quot;Romulea&quot; is principally distinguished from the other two genera by generally having aerial stems or at least an ovary at ground level, compared with the other acaulescent genera, other differences include unifacial rather than bifacial leaves and the pollen structure.

Within the Romuleinae, &quot;Crocus&quot; is a sister group to &quot;Syringodea&quot;, the two genera forming a sister group to &quot;Romulea&quot;.

=== Subdivision ===

The genus Crocus consists of about 200 accepted species, which continue to increase, and has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications. The genus has often been divided into sections, beginning with that of Haworth (1809) who described two sections based on the presence or absence of hairs in the throat of the flower, while Sabine was the first to realise the importance of the presence or absence of a basal spathe (prophyll) in dividing the genus into two sections, a practice followed by Herbert. However, Sabine&#x27;s practice of using trinomials for varieties such as &quot;C. sulphureus concolor&quot; is no longer accepted, although Herbert somewhat similarly used varieties and subvarieties, e.g. &quot;C. vernus&quot; var.1 &quot;Communis&quot; subvar. 1. &quot;Obovatus&quot;. Herbert also used geographical distribution as a basis of classification. By the late 19th century Maw (1886), following Herbert, subdivided the genus into two divisions, the &quot;Involucrati&quot; and the &quot;Nudiflori&quot;, and then further divided it into six sections and lastly by flowering times (spring or autumn). Although rejecting the concept of subvarieties, he placed even more emphasis on geography.

The most widely accepted system, that proposed by Brian Mathew in 1982 was based on Maw&#x27;s system, but with less emphasis on flowering times. This mainly depended on three character states: 
* the presence or absence of a prophyll (a basal spathe);
* the aspect of the style;
* the corm tunic. 
and included 81 species, however, one of these, &quot;Crocus medius&quot; was later recognized as a synonym of &quot;Crocus nudiflorus&quot;.

The genus, as described by Mathew, consisted of two subgenera, &quot;Crocirus&quot; (monotypic for &quot;Crocus banaticus&quot;) and &quot;Crocus&quot; including the remainder of the species, based on whether the anthers were introrse or extrorse (dehiscence directed towards or away from centre of flower) respectively. Subgenus &quot;Crocus&quot; was then divided into two sections, &quot;Crocus&quot; and &quot;Nudiscapus&quot;, based on the presence or absence of the prophyll. Each section was then further divided into six series of &quot;Crocus&quot; and nine of &quot;Nudiscapus&quot;. These series were defined by the division of the style, the corm tunic, flowering time, leaf structure, presence of a bracteole and anther colour. Mathew also introduced the concept of subspecies, including 50 in all, by giving similar but different forms subspecies status if geographically separated, resulting in about 140 distinct taxa. The seven species and ten subspecies discovered since then have been integrated into revisions of this classification, though new species continue to be described, leading to estimates of at least 200 species.

==== Speciation ====

Crocus populations have extremely high infra-specific variability with a very diverse spectrum of morphological and phenotypical varieties, while many individual specimens from different species may closely resemble each other. Based on such morphological differences between isolated populations many new species have been named, but without a definition of new species based on molecular and/or karyological information, species can not be confirmed, creating difficulties in determining speciation and hence the exact number of species. The situation is even more complex once hybridisation (combination of taxa) and introgression (transfer of genetic material) are considered.

==== Molecular phylogeny ====

The availability of molecular phylogeny methods revealed problems with the traditional systems based on morphology alone. The first analysis of the complete genus was carried out by Mathew and colleagues in 2008 using nucleotide sequences from plastid regions. In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating &quot;C. banaticus&quot; in its own subgenus &quot;Crociris&quot;, though it is a unique species in the genus. Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section &quot;Crocus&quot;, although its exact relationship to the rest of the subgenus remains unclear.

Of the 15 series in the Mathew scheme, only seven were monophyletic, and in particular the largest series, &quot;Biflori&quot; and &quot;Reticulati&quot;, which include a third of all species, were non-monophyletic. Another anomalous species, &quot;C. baytopiorum&quot;, should now be placed in a series of its own, series &quot;Baytopi&quot;. &quot;C. gargaricus&quot; subsp. &quot;herbertii&quot; has been raised to species status, as &quot;C. herbertii&quot;. The autumn-flowering &quot;C. longiflorus&quot;, the type species of series &quot;Longiflori&quot; (long regarded by Mathew as &quot;a disparate assemblage&quot;), appeared to lie within series &quot;Verni&quot;. In addition, the position of &quot;C. malyi&quot; was currently unclear.

DNA analysis and morphological studies suggest further that series &quot;Reticulati&quot;, &quot;Biflori&quot; and &quot;Speciosi&quot; are &quot;probably inseparable&quot;, &quot;C. adanensis&quot; and &quot;C. caspius&quot; should probably be removed from &quot;Biflori&quot;, &quot;C. adanensis&quot; falls in a clade with &quot;C. paschei&quot; as a sister group to the species of series &quot;Flavi&quot; and &quot;C. caspius&quot; appears to be sister to the species of series &quot;Orientales&quot;.

The study showed &quot;no support for a system of sections as currently defined&quot;, although, despite the many inconsistencies between Mathew&#x27;s 1982 classification and the current hypothesis, &quot;the main assignment of species to the sections and series of that system is actually supported&quot;. The authors state, &quot;further studies are required before any firm decisions about a hierarchical system of classification can be considered&quot; and conclude &quot;future re-classification is likely to involve all infrageneric levels, subgenera, sections and series&quot;. A further study, using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), together with a chloroplast marker, broadly confirmed these findings.

&quot;Crocus&quot; forms a monophyletic clade, with a basal polytomy of four subclades. The first clade (A) corresponding to section &quot;Crocus&quot;, but including &quot;C. sieberi&quot; and several closely related species (originally included in section &quot;Nudiscapus&quot; series &quot;Reticulati&quot;). The remaining three clades (B-D) include all the remaining species of section &quot;Nudiscapus&quot;. Of these, B and C are small, corresponding to series &quot;Orientales&quot; and &quot;Carpetani&quot; respectively, with all remaining series in the large D clade. The exception is &quot;C. caspius&quot;, originally in series &quot;Biflori&quot;, which segregates in clade B. Thus, although division of the genus into two sections is well supported, no single morphological character defines these two groups. The &quot;C. sieberi&quot; group are assumed to have lost their prophyll secondarily. Of the series, eight could be shown to be monophyletic; &quot;Crocus&quot;, &quot;Kotschyani&quot; and &quot;Scardici&quot; (section &quot;Crocus&quot;) and &quot;Aleppici&quot;, &quot;Carpetani&quot;, &quot;Laevigati&quot;, &quot;Orientalis&quot; and &quot;Speciosi&quot; (section &quot;Nudiscapus&quot;). Flowering season did not correspond to molecular groupings and nor did any of the previously used morphological characteristics, indicating a high degree of homoplasy, in which traits are gained or lost independently in different lineages. The remainder of the series could not be supported as natural groupings. Mathew&#x27;s concept of subspecies status within &quot;C. biflorus&quot; could not be supported, each being considered a separate species, resulting in the genus having at least 150 species.

A more detailed molecular and morphological study of series &quot;Verni&quot; (section &quot;Crocus&quot;) allowed it to be better characterised and circumscribed, as well as the closely related series &quot;Longiflori&quot;. Series &quot;Verni&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; Mathew was found to consist of two groups, the first being &quot;C. vernus&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; Mathew and the other consisting of &quot;C. etruscus&quot;, &quot;ilvensis&quot;, &quot;kosaninii&quot; and &quot;longiflorus&quot;. The taxonomic status of &quot;C. vernus&quot; had been uncertain for some time, given the observation that the name was more properly applied to &quot;C. albiflorus&quot;, requiring a new designation of &quot;C. neapolitanus&quot; for those previously known as &quot;C. vernus&quot;. Subsequently &quot;C. vernus&quot; was split into 5 separate species. The incorporation of &quot;C. longiflorus&quot; into series &quot;Verni&quot; resulted in making series &quot;Longiflori&quot; no longer a legitimate taxonomic unit.

In section &quot;Nudiscapus&quot;, series &quot;Reticulati&quot; was polyphyletic with species intermingled with series &quot;Biflori&quot; and &quot;Speciosi&quot;, requiring a recircumscription, confining &quot;Reticulati&quot; to 8 species, to obtain monophyly. Among the thereby displaced species, are a number of very closely related taxa, referred to as the &quot;Crocus sieberi&quot; aggregate, which has been proposed as a new series &quot;Sieberi&quot;. Other new series, such as &quot;Isauri&quot; and &quot;Lyciotauri&quot;, continue to be created out of the &quot;Biflori&quot; series.

Mathew&#x27;s circumscription of &quot;Crocus&quot; introduced the rank of subspecies, of which the largest number (14) were those of &quot;Crocus biflorus&quot; , the type species of series &quot;Biflori&quot;, a number which continued to grow. Molecular methods identified these as a polyphyletic assemblage rather than closely related subordinate infraspecific taxa. This necessitated a complete taxonomic revision of series &quot;Biflori&quot;, elevating each subspecies to species status. A similar issue occurs with &quot;C. reticulatus&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; Mathew, who created two subspecies, resulting in 9 newly defined species.

==== Sections and species ====

The classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009 divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series. The number of series, continues to evolve. 
* Section &quot;Crocus&quot; 
Species with a basal prophyll. Type species &quot;C. sativus&quot; 
: 6 series
* Section &quot;Nudiscapus&quot; 
Species without a basal prophyll. Type species &quot;C. reticulatus&quot; 
: 9 series

=== Similarly named species ===

Some crocus species, known as &quot;autumn crocus&quot;, flower in late summer and autumn, during (autumnal) rains, after summer&#x27;s heat and drought. The name autumn crocus is also often used as a common name for &quot;Colchicum&quot;, which is not a true crocus but in its own family (Colchicaceae) in the lily order Liliales. The plants are toxic, but have medicinal uses. &quot;Colchicum&quot; are also known as meadow saffron, though true saffron is not toxic. &quot;Crocus&quot; species have three stamens while &quot;Colchicum&quot; species have six; crocus have one style, while &quot;Colchicum&quot; have three.

Some Pulsatilla species are also called &quot;prairie crocus&quot; (previously &quot;Anemone patens)&quot; or &quot;wild crocus&quot;, but they belong to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). Pulsatilla species, which are commonly called pasqueflowers, unlike crocuses have rhizomes, the foliage is covered with long soft hairs, and the flowers are produced on above-ground stems.

=== Etymology ===

&quot;Crocus&quot;, the name of the genus, is Late Middle English (late 14th century) and also denotes saffron. It is derived via Latin &quot;crocus &quot;from the Greek κρόκος (&quot;krokos&quot;), which is itself probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew כרכום &quot;karkōm&quot;, Aramaic ܟܟܘܪܟܟܡܡܐ &quot;kurkama&quot;, and Arabic &quot;kurkum&quot;, meaning saffron (&quot;Crocus sativus&quot;), &quot;saffron yellow&quot; or turmeric (see &quot;Curcuma&quot;), another yellow dye. The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit &quot;kunkumam&quot; () for &quot;saffron&quot;. The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin &quot;safranum&quot;, but Old English already had &quot;croh&quot; for saffron, introduced by the Romans.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Crocuses are distributed from the Mediterranean, from the Iberian peninsula and North Africa, through central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across central and southwest Asia to Xinjiang in western China, but most species are restricted to Turkey and Asia Minor and the Balkans, with the Balkan Peninsula having the largest number of species (at least 31), forming the centre of diversity, however they are widely introduced. The distribution of species is described over five contiguous areas from west to east (&quot;see map&quot;). 

Habitats range from sea level to as high as subalpine altitudes, and in a wide range of habitats from woodlands to meadows and deserts, often on stony mountain slopes with good drainage. The majority of species are native to areas with cold winters and hot summers with little rain, and active growth is typically from fall to mid-spring. The natural habitats of crocus species are threatened by human activities, including urbanization, industrialization, and other land disturbances and recreational uses. They are negatively impacted by uncontrolled gathering and heavy grazing by livestock.

== Ecology ==

The life cycle of &quot;Crocus&quot; species begins with the seed, germinating to a seedling, and a mature plant in 3–5 years, however seeds may remain dormant in the soil for several years. The germination stages was first described and illustrated by Maw in his 1886 monograph. In its first year, the crocus produces only a single leaf and creates a corm covered by a thin tunic, about 5–8 mm in size, dependent on the species. In the northern hemisphere, the autumnal crocuses flower between September and November. The vernal (spring) crocuses flowering time depends both on climate and habitat, but is usually mid-winter to spring. Leaves may be synanthous (produced during flowering) or hysteranthous (when the flowers wither away). In the summer, with hot and dry conditions the plant becomes dormant, with all the above ground parts dying back. Colder temperatures in winter then activate the corms. Propagation occurs sexually by seed and asexually by small corms, called cormels or cormlets, produced in the axils of the corms (between tunic scales and body of corm). As the fruit capsule ripens, it emerges from the soil at the base of the flowering stem before dehiscing (splitting open) and releasing the seeds. Seed dispersal may be enhanced by ants, at least in species with arillate seeds.

At night and in overcast weather, the perianth closes. The ovary produces nectar which attracts bees (particularly female bumblebees) and Lepidoptera.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Cultivated plants may have their corms consumed by mice and other rodents, including voles, squirrels, and chipmunks. They are also attacked by mildew, gray mold, botrytis, and fusarium rot. Root rot may also occur, caused by &quot;Stromatinia gladioli&quot; and &quot;Pythium&quot; species - the nematode &quot;Pratylenchus penetrans&quot; may also cause root rot. Viruses that are known to infect &quot;Crocus&quot; spp include: Potyviruses, especially bean yellow mosaic virus and also tobacco rattle virus, tobaccos necrosis virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. The foliage may experience rot, rust, and scab diseases and be fed upon by aphids, mites, snails, and slugs. The foliage is eaten by hares, rabbits, and deer; the flowers are sometimes removed by birds, including crows, jackdaws, and magpies.
== Cultivation ==

=== Saffron ===
The economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single species, &quot;Crocus sativus&quot;, now known only in cultivation. &quot;C. sativus&quot; is grown for the production of saffron, an orange-red derivative of its dried stigma, and among the most expensive spices in the world. The estimated worldwide production of &quot;C. sativus&quot; plants is 205 tons. About 180,000 stigmas from 60,000 flowers are required to produce saffron, which sells for about US$10,000 (2018). Modern saffron production is widely cultivated in Kashmir, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor. An important center is the eponymous town of Krokos, in the Kozani region of Greece. The saffron product, Krokos Kozanis is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin). Production is largely indigenous and Iran accounts for 65% of global production, covering 72,162 ha.

Saffron is thought to have been used in embalming in Ancient Egypt. It is mentioned in the Old Testament, in the Song of Songs as a precious spice and has featured as a dye and fragrance throughout written history, with mention in the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Cultivation and harvesting of &quot;C. sativus&quot; for saffron was first documented in the Mediterranean, notably on the island of Crete. Frescos showing them are found there at the Bronze Age Minoan site of Knossos, as well as from the comparably aged Akrotiri site on the Aegean island of Santorini, and formed an important part of the Minoan economy and culture and had both a sacred role and use as a psychoactive drug and food additive. Women still gather crocuses in the Akrotiri region.

=== Horticulture and floriculture ===
Crocuses were described in Turkish gardens in the early sixteenth century, gathered from the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire, where they were seen by visiting European botanists and explorers, among the first of whom was Pierre Belon who arrived in Constantinople in 1547. The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species were not native, were from corms brought to Vienna in 1562 from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq. A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden. These were almost certainly cultivated varieties rather than wild species. European visitors to Turkey continued to bring back specimens for gardens in their own country. Prominent among the latter were the gardens at Middelburg in the Netherlands. Jehan Somer, a Middelburg merchant, brought back crocuses among his other specimens in 1592, where they attracted the attention not only of Clusius but of the early Dutch flower painters, notably Ambrosius Bosschaert. By 1620, new garden varieties had been developed, and featured in contemporary illustrations, such as that of Crispijn van de Passe in his &quot;Hortus floridus&quot; of 1614. There are accounts of crocus gardens in the seventeenth century, such as the Saffron Garth of Walter Stonehouse at Darfield, Yorkshire.

Crocuses are among the most important ornamental geophytes in the global flower industry, ranking sixth in terms of Dutch bulb production (2003–2008) with 463–668 ha under cultivation. The crocus is one of the most popular flowers found in the garden in the late winter and early spring. About 30 of the species are cultivated, among the most popular being &quot;C. chrysanthus, C. flavus, C. sieberi, C. tommasinianus and C. vernus&quot;, together with hundreds of cultivars derived from them. Both fall and spring blooming crocuses are cultivated for their flowers. Among the first flowers to bloom in spring, their flowering time can vary from fall to the late winter blooming &quot;C. tommasinianus&quot;; the earliest fall blooming species, &quot;C. scharojanii&quot;, may flower during the last weeks of July.

The varieties cultivated for decoration in gardens and pots mainly represent six species: &quot;C. vernus&quot;, &quot;C. chrysanthus&quot;, &quot;C. flavus&quot;, &quot;C. sieberi&quot;, &quot;C. speciosus&quot; and &quot;C. tommasinianus&quot;. During the horticulture production year 2009/2010, more than 70 cultivars were grown in Holland, covering an area of 366 hectares; the most common ones were &#x27;Flower Record&#x27; and &#x27;King of the Stripes&#x27; which accounted for 42 hectares, other species grown included &quot;C. chrysanthus&quot;, &quot;C. tommasinianus&quot;, and &quot;C. flavus&quot; - all are spring blooming plants. But the most commonly grown plants are the Dutch hybrids with large flowers in a rich palette of colors.

Both sexual and asexual means are used to increase the number of plants; seeds and multiplication of corms are the most common means of production, but tissue culture can be used, most commonly for saffron crocus. New corms are formed on top of the older corm which withers away, and cormels are produced from axillary buds. The production of new plants begins with harvested corms in late June to early July, after being graded by corm size the corms are stored around 22 Celsius until early October when they are moved to 17 Celsius until planted later in October and November; flowering occurs in March and the flowers are not removed. Crocuses are also forced to produce flowering plants out of season and the most common species used are &quot;C. vernus&quot; and &quot;C. flavus&quot;, and most of the corms used for forcing come from the Netherlands.

Spring flowering types are planted in fall, while fall-blooming types in late summer; typically, the corms are placed 3 to 4 inches deep in well-draining soil in areas with full sun exposure. They do not thrive in heavy clay soils or those that are damp, especially during their summer dormancy period. Commercial crops are produced on raised beds and slopes, to ensure adequate drainage, while horticulturalists often plant on sand beds for the same purpose. Spring flowering types also do well in areas with deciduous trees, where they flower and produce leaves before the trees completely leaf-out. Crocuses are grown in USDA winter zones 3–8. Not all species are hardy in the upper zones; &quot;C. sativus&quot; is winter hardy in USDA zones 6 through 8, and &quot;C. pulchellus&quot; is hardy in zones 5 through 8.

Some are suitable for naturalizing in grass, but mowing off the foliage before it turns yellow produces short lived plants. Some crocuses, especially &quot;C. tommasinianus&quot; and its selected forms and hybrids (such as &#x27;Whitewell Purple&#x27; and &#x27;Ruby Giant&#x27;), seed prolifically and are ideal for naturalizing. They can, however, become weeds in rock gardens, where they will often appear in the middle of choice, mat-forming alpine plants, and can be difficult to remove. Crocus flowers and leaves are protected from frost by a waxy cuticle; in areas where snow and frost occasionally occur in the early spring, it is not uncommon to see early flowering crocuses blooming through a light late snowfall.

===Autumn crocus===
Autumn-flowering species of crocus that are cultivated include:
&quot;C. laevigatus&quot; has a long flowering period which starts in late autumn or early winter and may continue into February.

&quot;Colchicum autumnale&quot; is commonly known as &quot;autumn crocus&quot;, but is a member of the plant family Colchicaceae, and not a true crocus (of the family Iridaceae).

== Uses ==

The corms of crocuses have been used as foodstuffs in Syria. The carotenoids found in the styles of &quot;Crocus&quot; species, particularly &quot;C. sativus&quot; have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and have led to interest in potential pharmaceutical applications.

== Culture ==

The crocus or krokos has been known since ancient times, and used in decorative arts, such as the Minoan wall paintings in Santorini from ca. 1,600 BC. Representations of the saffron crocus appear frequently in Minoan art and pervade Aegean art from the Early Bronze Age to the Mycenaean period. Theophrastos (4th century BC) described the saffron crocus as being valued as a spice and dye, while Homer compares a sunrise to the flower colour. Saffron coloured robes were much admired by women in antiquity and gave the garment Crocota its name. The oil was also valued as a cosmetic. According to Greek legend Crocus or Krokus (), was a mortal youth the gods turned into a plant bearing his name, the crocus, after his death caused by his great desire and unfulfilled love for the shepherdess Smilax. Other versions state that as he died three tears fell into the flower becoming its three stigmata.

Crocuses occur in many flower paintings, one of the earliest being that of Ambrosius Bosschaert&#x27;s &quot;Composed Bouquet of Spring Flowers&quot; (1620). In this painting the cream-colored crocus feathered with bronze at the base of the bouquet reflected varieties on the market at that time. Bosschaert, working from a preparatory drawing to paint his composed piece spanning the whole of spring, exaggerated the crocus so that it passes for a tulip, but its narrow, grass-like leaves give it away. 
The crocus is used in many contexts to symbolically denote spring and new beginnings. For instance, it was used as the emblem of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland to symbolise the emergence of new talent.

<text>Chivalry, or the chivalric language, is an informal and varying code of conduct developed in Europe between 1170 and 1220. It is associated with the medieval Christian institution of knighthood, with knights being members of various chivalric orders, and with knights&#x27; and gentlemen&#x27;s behaviours which were governed by chivalrous social codes. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, informed by Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s , written in the 1130s, which popularized the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table. 

The code of chivalry that developed in medieval Europe had its roots in earlier centuries. It arose in the Carolingian Empire from the idealisation of the cavalryman—involving military bravery, individual training, and service to others—especially in Francia, among horse soldiers in Charlemagne&#x27;s cavalry.

Over time, the meaning of chivalry in Europe has been refined to emphasize more general social and moral virtues. The code of chivalry, as it stood by the Late Middle Ages, was a moral system which combined a warrior ethos, knightly piety, and courtly manners, all combining to establish a notion of honour and nobility.

==Terminology and definitions==

The term &quot;chivalry&quot; derives from the Old French term , which can be translated as &quot;horse soldiery&quot;. Originally, the term referred only to horse-mounted men, from the French word for horse, , but later it became associated with knightly ideals. The French word originally meant &quot;a man of aristocratic standing, and probably of noble ancestry, who is capable, if called upon, of equipping himself with a war horse and the arms of heavy cavalryman and who has been through certain rituals that make him what he is.&quot; Therefore, during the Middle Ages, the plural (transformed in English into the word &quot;chivalry&quot;) originally denoted the body of heavy cavalry upon formation in the field. In English, the term appears from 1292 (note that &quot;cavalry&quot; is from the Italian form of the same word).

The meaning of the term evolved over time into a broader sense, because in the Middle Ages the meaning of changed from the original concrete military meaning &quot;status or fee associated with a military follower owning a war horse&quot; or &quot;a group of mounted knights&quot; to the ideal of the Christian warrior ethos propagated in the romance genre, which was becoming popular during the 12th century, and the ideal of courtly love propagated in the contemporary Minnesang and related genres.

The ideas of chivalry are summarized in three medieval works: the anonymous poem &quot;Ordene de chevalerie&quot;, which tells the story of how Hugh II of Tiberias was captured and released upon his agreement to show Saladin (1138–1193) the ritual of Christian knighthood; the &quot;Libre del ordre de cavayleria&quot;, written by Ramon Llull (1232–1315), from Majorca, whose subject is knighthood; and the Livre de Chevalerie of Geoffroi de Charny (1300–1356), which examines the qualities of knighthood, emphasizing &quot;prowess&quot;. None of the authors of these three texts knew the other two texts, and the three combine to depict a general concept of chivalry which is not precisely in harmony with any of them. To different degrees and with different details, they speak of chivalry as a way of life in which the military, the nobility, and religion combine.

The &quot;code of chivalry&quot; is thus a product of the Late Middle Ages, evolving after the end of the crusades partly from an idealization of the historical knights fighting in the Holy Land and from ideals of courtly love.

===Ten Commandments of Chivalry===
Pioneering French literary historian Léon Gautier compiled what he called the medieval Ten Commandments of chivalry in his book &quot;La Chevalerie&quot; (1884):

# Thou shalt believe all that the Church teaches and thou shalt observe all its directions.
# Thou shalt defend the Church.
# Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.
# Thou shalt love the country in which thou wast born.
# Thou shalt not before thine enemy.
# Thou shalt make war against the infidel without cessation and without mercy.
# Thou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.
# Thou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.
# Thou shalt be generous, and give to everyone.
# Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.

In fact, there is no such medieval list. Gautier&#x27;s effort was a series of moral bullet points he abstracted from his broad reading of 12th and 13th century romances.

==Literary chivalry and historical reality==
Supporters of chivalry have assumed since the late medieval period that there was a time in the past when chivalry was a living institution, when men acted chivalrously, the imitation of which period would much improve the present.

However, with the birth of modern historical and literary research, scholars have found that however far back in time &quot;The Age of Chivalry&quot; is searched for, it is always further in the past, even back to the Roman Empire. From Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi:
We must not confound chivalry with the feudal system. The feudal system may be called the real life of the period of which we are treating, possessing its advantages and inconveniences, its virtues and its vices. Chivalry, on the contrary, is the ideal world, such as it existed in the imaginations of the romance writers. Its essential character is devotion to woman and to honour.

Sismondi alludes to the fictitious Arthurian romances about the imaginary Court of King Arthur when taken as factual presentations of a historical age of chivalry. He continues:
The more closely we look into history, the more clearly shall we perceive that the system of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries in which it is said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day [about 1810], we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess that it is necessary to antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.
==History==
=== Europe before 1170: Courtliness and the noble &quot;habitus&quot; ===
Prior to codified chivalry, there was the uncodified code of noble conduct that focused on the , which can be translated as a wise, honest, and sensible man. This uncodified code—referred to as the noble —is a term for the environment of behavioural and material expectations generated by all societies and classes. As a modern idea, it was pioneered by the French philosopher/sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, even though a precedent exists for the concept as far back as the works of Aristotle. Crouch in 2019 argued that the on which &quot;the superstructure of chivalry&quot; was built and the was a part, were recognised by contemporaries as components of &quot;courtoisie&quot; (from Latin &quot;curialitas&quot;) which was defined as superior conduct appropriate to the aristocratic hall (&quot;court&quot; or &quot;curia&quot;). He saw it as being taught within the confines of the hall by its senior figures to youths confided to the lord and his household for their social upbringing. Crouch suggested courtliness had existed long before 1100 and preceded the codified medieval noble conduct we call chivalry, which he sees as beginning between 1170 and 1220.

The pre-chivalric noble as discovered by Mills and Gautier and elaborated by Stephen Jaeger and David Crouch are as follows:
# Loyalty: It is a practical utility in a warrior nobility. Richard Kaeuper associates loyalty with &quot;prowess&quot;. The importance of reputation for loyalty in noble conduct is demonstrated in .
# Forbearance: knights&#x27; self-control towards other warriors and at the courts of their lords was a part of the early noble as shown in the of Hugh de Lusignan in the 1020s. The nobility of mercy and forbearance was well established by the second half of the 12th century long before there was any code of chivalry.
# Hardiness: Historians and social anthropologists documented that in the early stages of &#x27;proto-chivalry,&#x27; physical resilience and prowess in warfare were almost prerequisites for chivalry-associated knighthood. For warriors, regardless of origin, displaying exceptional physical prowess on the battlefield often led to attaining noble-knightly status or immediate nobilitation. To deliver a powerful blow in Arthurian literature almost always certifies the warrior&#x27;s nobility. This view was supported by formal chivalric authorities and commentators: the anonymous author of &quot;La vraye noblesse&quot; states that a person of &#x27;low degree&#x27; with martial bearing should be elevated to nobility by the prince or civic authority, &quot;even though he be not rich or of noble lineage&quot;. Scholastic analyst Richard Kaeuper summarizes the matter: &quot;A knight&#x27;s nobility or worth is proved by his hearty strokes in battle&quot;. The virtue of hardiness, aligned with forbearance and loyalty, was a key military virtue of the . According to Philip de Navarra, a mature nobleman should possess hardiness as part of his moral virtues. Geoffrey de Charny also underscored the importance of hardiness as a masculine virtue tied to religious sentiments of .
# Largesse or Liberality: generosity was part of a noble quantity. According to Alan of Lille, largesse was not just a simple matter of giving away what he had, but &quot; in a man caused him to set no store on greed or gifts, and to have nothing but contempt for bribes.&quot;
# The Davidic ethic: encompasses the noble qualities of derived by clerics from Biblical tradition. This concept aligns with the classical Aristotelian notion of the &quot;magnanimous personality&quot; and the early Germanic and Norse tradition of the war-band leader as a heroic figure. The Christian-Davidic guardian-protector role of warrior-leadership emerged from the Frankish church to legitimize authority based on ethical commitment to safeguarding the vulnerable, ensuring justice for widows and orphans, and firmly opposing cruelty and injustice by those in power. This opposition extended to sub-princely magistrates and even monarchs who violated ethical principles of or . At the heart of the Davidic ethic lies the idea of the strong demonstrating benevolence towards the weak. John of Salisbury imbibed this lineage of philosophico-clerical, chivalric justifications of power, and describes the ideal enforcer of the Davidic ethic in this way: 
# Honour: honour was achieved by living up to the ideal of the and pursuing the qualities and behaviour listed above. Maurice Keen notes the most damning, irreversible mode of &quot;demoting&quot; one&#x27;s honorific status, again humanly through contemporary eyes, consisted in displaying pusillanimous conduct on the battlefield. The loss of honour is a humiliation to a man&#x27;s standing and is worse than death. Bertran de Born said: &quot;For myself I prefer to hold a little piece of land in &quot;onor&quot;, than to hold a great empire with dishonor&quot;.

From the 12th century onward, chivalry came to be understood as a moral, religious, and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars of the code varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life and manners of the knight at home in his castle and with his court. The code of chivalry, as it was known during the late medieval age, developed between 1170 and 1220.

===The Crisis of Courtliness and Rise of Chivalry===
Courtliness remained a recognised form of superior conduct in medieval European society throughout the middle ages. Courtly behaviour was expected of all aristocrats and its norms were integrated into chivalric literature. But as Crouch demonstrated courtliness (unlike chivalry) was not confined to noble society. There are examples of servants, merchants, clergy and free peasants being commended for their &#x27;courtly&#x27; behaviour in medieval literature. His explanation for the appearance of chivalry as a recognisable and prescriptive code of behaviour is tied into the more exclusive definition of nobility that appears in the late 12th century. This had a particular impact on the professional horse warrior, the knight. Retained knights were a prominent feature of the households of barons, counts and princes, and were thought to be proper associates of their lords. As such knights adopted the fashions and behaviours of their lords. In many cases knights were often drawn from the younger sons of noble families so they would regard themselves as being noble too, if less noble than their lords. Crouch locates the tipping point of the nobilising of the knight as in the households of the sons of King Henry II of England, and in particular his eldest son, the Henry the Young King (died 1183). Young Henry lived a lavish lifestyle of unprecedented expense focussed on the great northern French tourneying society of the 1170s and 1180s. Since Young Henry had no domains to rule, his father was willing to fund the itinerant playboy lifestyle of his son to distract him from meddling in his realms, and also to stake a claim to the cultural high ground over the other European princes of the day. Young Henry was nonetheless heavily criticised for his wasteful and hedonistic life, and Crouch finds it significant that the first known work which used the knight as a moral exemplar and as a definitive nobleman, the &quot;De Re Militari&quot; of Ralph Niger (c. 1187) was written by the young man&#x27;s former chaplain, in part as a moral defence of the knightly lifestyle.

Crouch suggests another reason why chivalry coalesced as a noble code in the late 12th century in his analysis of conduct literature. He suggests that the courtly habitus underwent a crisis as its moral failure became obvious to writers, particularly in the materialism that motivated courtly society. Crouch sees the &quot;Roman des Eles&quot; of the poet-knight Raoul de Houdenc, as a critique of courtliness and its failures. Raoul&#x27;s solution is to focus moral eminence on the figure of the knight, who is to be the avatar of a new moral nobility, set above all other males. A knight was to eschew materialism (&quot;envie&quot;) and to embrace noble generosity (&quot;largesce&quot;).

===Themes of chivalric literature===
In medieval literature, chivalry can be classified into three overlapping areas:
#Duties to countrymen and fellow Christians: this includes mercy, courage, valour, fairness, protection of the weak and the poor, and the servant-hood of the knight to his lord. This also includes being willing to give one&#x27;s life for another&#x27;s; whether for a poor man or his lord.
#Duties to God: this includes being faithful to God, protecting the innocent, being faithful to the church, being the champion of good against evil, being generous, and obeying God above the feudal lord.
#Duties to women: this is probably the most familiar aspect of chivalry. This includes what is often called courtly love—the idea that the knight is to serve a lady, and after her all other ladies—and a general gentleness and graciousness to all women.

Different weight given to different areas produced different strands of chivalry:
;warrior chivalry: in which a knight&#x27;s chief duty is to his lord, as exemplified by Sir Gawain in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;
;religious chivalry: in which a knight&#x27;s chief duty is to protect the innocent and serve God, as exemplified by Sir Galahad or Sir Percival in the Grail legends
;courtly love chivalry: in which a knight&#x27;s chief duty is to his own lady, and after her, all ladies, as exemplified by Sir Lancelot in his love for Queen Guinevere or Sir Tristan in his love for Iseult

===Origins in military ethos===

Emerging with the knight&#x27;s character and the chivalric ethos were novel elements: revised social status, innovative military tactics, and fresh literary themes. Chivalric codes encompassed regulations such as pledging loyalty to the overlord and upholding warfare rules. These rules dictated refraining from attacking a defenseless opponent and prioritizing the capture of fellow nobles for later ransom instead of immediate harm, akin to adhering to a perceived codified law. The chivalric ideals are based on those of the early medieval warrior class, and martial exercise and military virtue remain integral parts of chivalry until the end of the medieval period, as the reality on the battlefield changed with the development of Early Modern warfare, and increasingly restricted it to the tournament ground and duelling culture. The joust remained the primary example of knightly display of martial skill throughout the Renaissance (the last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in 1602).

The martial skills of the knight carried over to the practice of the hunt, and hunting expertise became an important aspect of courtly life in the later medieval period (see terms of venery). Related to chivalry was the practice of heraldry and its elaborate rules of displaying coats of arms as it emerged in the High Middle Ages.

===Chivalry and Christianity===
Christianity had a modifying influence on the classical concept of heroism and virtue, nowadays identified with the virtues of chivalry. The Peace and Truce of God in the 10th century was one such example, which placed limits on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and also help the church maintain peace. At the same time the church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the just war; and liturgies were introduced which blessed a knight&#x27;s sword, . In the Grail romances and &quot;Chevalier au Cygne&quot;, it was the ethos of the Christian knighthood that its way of life was to please God, and chivalry was an order of God. Chivalry as a Christian vocation combined Teutonic heroic values with the militant tradition of Old Testament.

The first noted support for chivalric vocation, or the establishment of a knightly class to ensure the sanctity and legitimacy of Christianity, was written in 930 by Odo, abbot of Cluny, in the &quot;Vita of St. Gerald of Aurillac&quot;, which argued that the sanctity of Christ and Christian doctrine can be demonstrated through the legitimate unsheathing of the &quot;sword against the enemy&quot;. In the 11th century the concept of a &quot;knight of Christ&quot; () gained currency in France, Spain, and Italy. These concepts of &quot;religious chivalry&quot; were further elaborated in the era of the Crusades, with the Crusades themselves often seen as a chivalrous enterprise. The military orders of the crusades which developed in this period came to be seen as the earliest flowering of chivalry, and some of their opponents like Saladin were likewise depicted as chivalrous adversaries. It remains unclear to what extent the notable military figures of this period—such as Saladin, Godfrey of Bouillon, William Marshal, or Bertrand du Guesclin—actually did set new standards of knightly behaviour, or to what extent they merely behaved according to existing models of conduct which came in retrospect to be interpreted along the lines of the &quot;chivalry&quot; ideal of the Late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, chivalry and crusades were not the same thing. While the crusading ideology had largely influenced the ethic of chivalry during its formative times, chivalry itself was related to a whole range of martial activities and aristocratic values which had no necessary linkage with crusading.

The Virgin Mary was venerated by multiple chivalric orders, including the Teutonic Knights, who honored her as their patroness. The medieval development of chivalry, with the concept of the honour of a lady and the ensuing knightly devotion to it, not only derived from the thinking about Mary, but also contributed to it. Although women were at times viewed as the source of evil, it was Mary who as mediator to God was a source of refuge for man. The development of medieval Mariology and the changing attitudes towards women paralleled each other.

===Influence of the Moors and Romans===
The works of Roman poets like Ovid and Cicero bore some similarities to the typical depiction of romance in chivalric literature during the Middle Ages. In Ovid&#x27;s works, lovers &quot;became sleepless, grew pale, and lost their appetite,&quot; while Cicero&#x27;s works celebrated the &quot;ennobling power of love&quot;. Some scholars also point to the romantic poetry of the Arabs as antecedents to the depiction of courtly love in medieval European literature. In the works of the Cordoban author Ibn Hazm, for example, &quot;lovers develop passions for slave boys as well as girls, interchangeably, and the slave is recognized as now the master of his beloved.&quot; Ibn Hazm&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of the Dove&quot; is a noteworthy depiction of a lover&#x27;s extreme submissiveness.

Medieval courtly literature glorifies the valour, tactics, and ideals of both Moors and ancient Romans. For example, the ancient handbook of warfare written by Vegetius called &quot;De re militari&quot; was translated into French in the 13th century as &quot;L&#x27;Art de chevalerie&quot; by Jean de Meun. Later writers also drew from Vegetius, such as Honoré Bonet, who wrote the 14th century &quot;L&#x27;Arbes des batailles&quot;, which discussed the morals and laws of war. In the 15th century Christine de Pizan combined themes from Vegetius, Bonet, and Frontinus in &quot;Livre des faits d&#x27;armes et de chevalerie&quot;.

===Late Middle Ages===
In the 14th century Jean Froissart wrote his &quot;Chronicles&quot; which captured much of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, including the Battle of Crécy and later the Battle of Poitiers both of which saw the defeat of the French nobility by armies made up largely of common men using longbows. The chivalric tactic employed by the French armoured nobility, namely bravely charging the opposition in the face of a hail of arrows, failed repeatedly. Froissart noted the subsequent attacks by common English and Welsh archers upon the fallen French knights.

&quot;Chronicles&quot; also captured a series of uprisings by common people against the nobility, such as the Jacquerie and The Peasant&#x27;s Revolt and the rise of the common man to leadership ranks within armies. Many of these men were promoted during the Hundred Years&#x27; War but were later left in France when the English nobles returned home, and became mercenaries in the Free Companies, for example John Hawkwood, the mercenary leader of The White Company. The rise of effective, paid soldiery replaced noble soldiery during this period, leading to a new class of military leader without any adherence to the chivalric code.

Chivalry underwent a revival and elaboration of chivalric ceremonial and rules of etiquette in the 14th century that was examined by Johan Huizinga in &quot;The Waning of the Middle Ages&quot;, which dedicates a chapter to &quot;The idea of chivalry&quot;. In contrasting the literary standards of chivalry with the actual warfare of the age, the historian finds the imitation of an ideal past illusory; in an aristocratic culture such as Burgundy and France at the close of the Middle Ages, &quot;to be representative of true culture means to produce by conduct, by customs, by manners, by costume, by deportment, the illusion of a heroic being, full of dignity and honour, of wisdom, and, at all events, of courtesy... The dream of past perfection ennobles life and its forms, fills them with beauty and fashions them anew as forms of art&quot;.

In the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes. The sons of the bourgeoisie were educated at aristocratic courts, where they were trained in the manners of the knightly class. This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the courtesy book, which were guides to the behaviour of &quot;gentlemen&quot;. Thus, the post-medieval gentlemanly code of the value of a man&#x27;s honour, respect for women, and a concern for those less fortunate, is directly derived from earlier ideals of chivalry and historical forces that created it.

Japan was the only country that banned the use of firearms completely to maintain ideals of chivalry and acceptable form of combat. In 1543 Japan established a government monopoly on firearms. The Japanese government destroyed firearms and enforced a preference for traditional Japanese weapons.

===Criticism===
Medieval historian Richard W. Kaeuper saw chivalry as a central focus in the study of the European Middle Ages that was too often presented as a civilizing and stabilizing influence in the turbulent Middle Ages. On the contrary, Kaueper argues &quot;that in the problem of public order the knights themselves played an ambivalent, problematic role and that the guides to their conduct that chivalry provided were in themselves complex and problematic.&quot; Many of the codes and ideals of chivalry were contradictory: when knights did live up to them, they did not lead to a more &quot;ordered and peaceful society&quot;. The tripartite conception of medieval European society (those who pray, those who fight, and those who work) along with other linked subcategories of monarchy and aristocracy, worked in congruence with knighthood to reform the institution in an effort &quot;to secure public order in a society just coming into its mature formation.&quot;

Kaeuper says that knighthood and the worldview of &quot;those who fight&quot; was pre-Christian in many ways and outside the purview of the church, at least initially. The church saw it as a duty to reform and guide knights in a way that weathered the disorderly, martial, and chauvinistic elements of chivalry. Royalty also clashed with knighthood over the conduct of warfare and personal disputes between knights and other knights (and even between knights and aristocracy). While the worldview of &quot;those who work&quot; (the burgeoning merchant class and bourgeoisie) was still in incubation, Kaeuper states that the social and economic class that would end up defining modernity was fundamentally at odds with knights, and those with chivalrous valor saw the values of commerce as beneath them. Those who engaged in commerce and derived their value system from it could be confronted with violence by knights.

According to British historian David Crouch, many early writers on medieval chivalry cannot be trusted as accurate sources, because they sometimes have &quot;polemical purpose which colours their prose&quot;. As for Kenelm Henry Digby and Léon Gautier, chivalry was a means to transform their corrupt and secular worlds. Gautier also emphasized that chivalry originated from the Teutonic forests and was brought up into civilization by the Catholic Church. Charles Mills used chivalry &quot;to demonstrate that the Regency gentleman was the ethical heir of a great moral estate, and to provide an inventory of its treasure&quot;. Mills also stated that chivalry was a social, not a military phenomenon, with its key features: generosity, fidelity, liberality, and courtesy.

==Modern times==

===End of chivalry===
Chivalry was dynamic; it adjusted in response to local situations, and this probably led to its demise. There were many chivalric groups in England as imagined by Sir Thomas Malory when he wrote &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; in the late 15th century; perhaps each group created its own chivalric ideology. Malory&#x27;s perspective reflects the condition of 15th-century chivalry. When &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was printed, William Caxton urged knights to read the romance with an expectation that reading about chivalry could unite a community of knights already divided by the Wars of the Roses.

During the early Tudor rule in England, some knights still fought according to that ethos. Fewer knights were engaged in active warfare because battlefields during this century were generally the arena of professional infantrymen, with less opportunity for knights to show chivalry. It was the beginning of the demise of the knight. The rank of knight never faded, but Queen Elizabeth I ended the tradition that any knight could create another, making this exclusively the preserve of the monarch. Christopher Wilkins contends that Sir Edward Woodville, who rode from battle to battle across Europe and died in 1488 in Brittany, was the last knight errant who witnessed the fall of the Age of Chivalry and the rise of modern European warfare. By the time the Middle Ages came to an end, the code of chivalry was gone.

===Modern manifestations and revivals===
Chivalry!—why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection—the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant—Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.—Walter Scott, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820)

The chivalric ideal persisted into the early modern and modern period. The custom of founding chivalric orders by Europe&#x27;s monarchs and high nobility peaked in the late medieval period, but it persisted during the Renaissance and well into the Baroque and early modern period, with e.g. the Tuscan Order of Saint Stephen (1561), the French Order of Saint Louis (1693) or the Anglo-Irish Order of St. Patrick (1783), and numerous dynastic orders of knighthood remain active in countries that retain a tradition of monarchy.

At the same time, with the change of courtly ideas during the Baroque period, the ideals of chivalry began to be seen as dated, or &quot;medieval&quot;. &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, published in 1605–15, burlesqued the medieval chivalric novel or &quot;romance&quot; by ridiculing the stubborn adherence to the chivalric code in the face of the modern world as anachronistic, giving rise to the term Quixotism. Conversely, elements of Romanticism sought to revive such &quot;medieval&quot; ideals or aesthetics in the late 18th and early 19th century.

The behavioural code of military officers down to the Napoleonic era, the American Civil War (especially as idealised in the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology), and to some extent even to World War I, was still strongly modelled on the historical ideals, resulting in a pronounced duelling culture, which in some parts of Europe also held sway over the civilian life of the upper classes. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, however, the military threat from the &quot;infidel&quot; disappeared. The European wars of religion spanned much of the early modern period and consisted of infighting between factions of various Christian denominations. This process of confessionalization ultimately gave rise to a new military ethos based on nationalism rather than &quot;defending the faith against the infidel&quot;.

Social commentators of the Victorian era advocated for a revival of chivalry in order to remedy the ill effects of the Industrial Revolution. Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Captains of Industry&quot; were to lead a &quot;Chivalry of Labour&quot;, a beneficent form of governance that is hierarchical yet fraternal in nature, rather than materialistic. John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Ideal Commonwealth&quot; took chivalry as one of its basic characteristics.

From the early modern period, the term &quot;gallantry&quot; (from &quot;galant&quot;, the Baroque ideal of refined elegance) rather than &quot;chivalry&quot; became used for the proper behaviour of upper-class men towards upper-class women. In the 19th century, there were attempts to revive chivalry for the purposes of the gentleman of that time. Kenelm Henry Digby wrote his &quot;The Broad-Stone of Honour&quot; for this purpose, offering the definition: &quot;Chivalry is only a name for that general spirit or state of mind which disposes men to heroic actions, and keeps them conversant with all that is beautiful and sublime in the intellectual and moral world.&quot;

The pronouncedly masculine virtues of chivalry came under attack on the parts of the masculist and upper-class suffragettes campaigning for gender equality in the early 20th century, and with the decline of the military ideals of duelling culture and of European aristocracies in general following the catastrophe of World War I, the ideals of chivalry became widely seen as outmoded by the mid-20th century. As a material reflection of this process, the dress sword lost its position as an indispensable part of a gentleman&#x27;s wardrobe, a development described as an &quot;archaeological terminus&quot; by Ewart Oakeshott, as it concluded the long period during which the sword had been a visible attribute of the free man, beginning as early as three millennia ago with the Bronze Age sword.

During the 20th century, the chivalrous ideal of protecting women came to be seen as a trope of melodrama (&quot;damsel in distress&quot;). The term &quot;chivalry&quot; retains a certain currency in sociology, in reference to the general tendency of men, and of society in general, to lend more attention offering protection from harm to women than to men, or in noting gender gaps in life expectancy, health, etc., also expressed in media bias giving significantly more attention to female than to male victims.

The promotion of chivalry played a part in the foundation of the Scouting movement. The Brownsea Island Scout camp, formed in 1907, began as a boys&#x27; camping event on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, southern England, organised by British Army Lieutenant-General Robert Baden-Powell to test his ideas for the book &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. Boy scouts from different social backgrounds in the U.K. participated from 1 to 8 August 1907 in activities around camping, observation, woodcraft, chivalry, lifesaving, and patriotism.

According to William Manchester, General Douglas MacArthur was a chivalric warrior who fought a war with the intention to conquer the enemy, eliminating their ability to strike back, then treated them with the understanding and kindness due their honour and courage. One prominent model of his chivalrous conduct was in World War II and his treatment of the Japanese at the end of the war. MacArthur&#x27;s model provides a way to win a war with as few casualties as possible and how to get the respect of the former enemy after the occupation of their homeland. On May 12, 1962, MacArthur gave a famous speech in front of the cadets of United States Military Academy at West Point by referring to a great moral code, the code of conduct and chivalry, when emphasizing duty, honour, and country.

== Masculism ==
With the rise of masculism, chivalry was criticized in terms of men&#x27;s rights. Ernest Bax described chivalry as &quot;the deprivation, the robbery from men of the most elementary personal rights in order to endow women with privileges at the expense of men&quot; in &quot;The fraud of feminism&quot; (1913), and criticized the Ladies First that took place in the Titanic sinking.

== Criticism of chivalry ==
Miguel de Cervantes, in Part I of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605), attacks chivalric literature as historically inaccurate and therefore harmful (see history of the novel), though 
he was quite in agreement with many so-called chivalric principles and guides to behavior. He toyed with but never intended to write a chivalric romance that was historically truthful.

Peter Wright criticizes the tendency to produce singular descriptions of chivalry, claiming there are many variations or &quot;chivalries&quot;. Among the different chivalries Wright includes &quot;military chivalry&quot; complete with its code of conduct and proper contexts, and woman-directed &quot;romantic chivalry&quot; complete with its code of conduct and proper contexts, among others.

<text>The unification of Italy ( ), also known as the Risorgimento (; ), was the 19th century political and social movement that in 1861 ended in the annexation of various states of the Italian peninsula and its outlying isles to the Kingdom of Sardinia, resulting in the creation of the Kingdom of Italy. Inspired by the rebellions in the 1820s and 1830s against the outcome of the Congress of Vienna, the unification process was precipitated by the Revolutions of 1848, and reached completion in 1870 after the capture of Rome and its designation as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy.

Individuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation from foreign domination included King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Giuseppe Mazzini. Borrowing from the old Latin title &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; (). Even after 1870, many ethnic Italian-speakers (Italians in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot Italians, Niçard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian Italians, and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy, planting the seeds of Italian irredentism.

Italy celebrates the anniversary of the unification on 17 March (the date of proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy). Some of the states that had been envisaged as part of the unification process (&quot;terre irredente&quot;) did not join the Kingdom until after Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in World War I, culminating in the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at Altare della Patria in Rome.

==Background==

===From ancient times to early modern era===
Italy was unified by the Roman Republic in the latter part of the third century BC. For 700 years, it was a &quot;de facto&quot; territorial extension of the capital of the Roman Republic and Empire, and for a long time experienced a privileged status but was not converted into a province. Under Augustus, the previous differences in municipal and political rights were abolished and Roman Italy was subdivided into administrative regions ruled directly by the Roman Senate.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy remained united under the Ostrogothic Kingdom and after 568 was disputed between the Kingdom of the Lombards and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, losing its unity for centuries. Following conquest by the Frankish Empire, the title of King of Italy merged with the office of Holy Roman Emperor; however, the emperor was an absentee German-speaking foreigner who had little interest in governing Italy and indeed never controlled the entire peninsula. As a result, Italy gradually developed into a system of city-states. Southern Italy was governed by the long-lasting Kingdom of Sicily or Kingdom of Naples, which had been established by the Normans. Central Italy was governed by the pope as a temporal kingdom known as the Papal States.

This situation persisted through the Renaissance but began to deteriorate with the rise of modern nation-states in the early modern period. Italy, including the Papal States, then became the site of proxy wars between the major powers, notably the Holy Roman Empire (including Austria), Spain, and France. Harbingers of national unity appeared in the treaty of the Italic League, in 1454, and the 15th century foreign policy of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Leading Renaissance Italian writers Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli and Guicciardini expressed opposition to foreign domination. Petrarch stated that the &quot;ancient valour in Italian hearts is not yet dead&quot; in &quot;Italia Mia&quot;. Machiavelli later quoted four verses from &quot;Italia Mia&quot; in &quot;The Prince&quot;, which looked forward to a political leader who would unite Italy &quot;to free her from the barbarians&quot;.

The Italian Wars saw 65 years of French attacks on some of the Italian states, starting with Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion of Naples in 1494. However, the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) saw parts of Italy fall under the direct or indirect control of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg, which ruled the Spanish Empire, continued to rule southern Italy and the Duchy of Milan until the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14). Following this war the Austrian Habsburgs struggled for dominance with the Spanish Bourbons until the end of the War of the Austrian Succession.

A sense of Italian national identity was reflected in Gian Rinaldo Carli&#x27;s &quot;Della Patria degli Italiani&quot;, written in 1764. It told how a stranger entered a café in Milan and puzzled its occupants by saying that he was neither a foreigner nor a Milanese. Then what are you?&#x27; they asked. &#x27;I am an Italian&#x27;, he explained.&quot;

===French Revolution and Napoleonic era===

The Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792–97 when a series of client republics were set up. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last Roman-German Emperor, Francis II, after its defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. French rule destroyed the old structures of feudalism in Italy and introduced modern ideas and efficient legal authority; it provided much of the intellectual force and social capital that fueled unification movements for decades after the First French Empire collapsed in 1814.

The French Republic spread republican principles, and the institutions of republican governments promoted citizenship over the rule of the Bourbons and Habsburgs and other dynasties. The reaction against any outside control challenged Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s choice of rulers. As Napoleon&#x27;s reign began to fail, the rulers he had installed tried to keep their thrones (among them Eugène de Beauharnais, Viceroy of Italy, and Joachim Murat, King of Naples) further feeding nationalistic sentiments. Beauharnais tried to get Austrian approval for his succession to Napoleon&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy, and on 30 March 1815, Murat issued the Rimini Proclamation, which called on Italians to revolt against their Austrian occupiers.

During the Napoleonic era, in 1797, the first official adoption of the Italian tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, took place, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789–1799) which, among its ideals, advocated the national self-determination. This event is celebrated by the Tricolour Day. The Italian national colours appeared for the first time on a tricolour cockade in 1789, anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military war flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion in 1796.

===Reaction (1815–1848)===

After Napoleon fell (1814), the Congress of Vienna (1814–15) restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments. Italy was again controlled largely by the Austrian Empire, as they directly controlled the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and indirectly the duchies of Parma, Modena and Tuscany.

With the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the absolutist monarchical regimes, the Italian tricolour went underground, becoming the symbol of the patriotic ferments that began to spread in Italy and the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence. The Italian tricolour waved for the first time in the history of the Risorgimento on 11 March 1821 in the Cittadella of Alessandria, during the revolutions of 1820s, after the oblivion caused by the restoration of the absolutist monarchical regimes.

An important figure of this period was Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril, serving as vice-president of the Napoleonic Italian Republic (1802–1805) and consistent supporter of the Italian unification ideals that would lead to the Italian Risorgimento shortly after his death.
Meanwhile, artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism; Vittorio Alfieri, Francesco Lomonaco and Niccolò Tommaseo are generally considered three great literary precursors of Italian nationalism, but the most famous proto-nationalist work was Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;I promessi sposi&quot; &quot;(The Betrothed)&quot;, widely read as thinly veiled allegorical criticism of Austrian rule. Published in 1827 and extensively revised in the following years, the 1840 version of &quot;I Promessi Sposi&quot; used a standardized version of the Tuscan dialect, a conscious effort by the author to provide a language and force people to learn it.

Three ideals of unification appeared. Vincenzo Gioberti, a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under the leadership of the pope in his 1842 book &quot;Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians&quot;. Pope Pius IX at first appeared interested but he turned reactionary and led the battle against liberalism and nationalism.

Giuseppe Mazzini and Carlo Cattaneo wanted the unification of Italy under a federal republic, which proved too extreme for most nationalists. The middle position was proposed by Cesare Balbo (1789–1853) as a confederation of separate Italian states led by Piedmont.

===Carbonari===

One of the most influential revolutionary groups was the Carbonari, a secret political discussion group formed in southern Italy early in the 19th century. After 1815, Freemasonry in Italy was repressed and discredited due to its French connections. A void was left that the Carbonari filled with a movement that closely resembled Freemasonry but with a commitment to Italian nationalism and no association with Napoleon and his government. The response came from middle-class professionals and businessmen and some intellectuals. The Carbonari disowned Napoleon but nevertheless were inspired by the principles of the French Revolution regarding liberty, equality and fraternity. They developed their own rituals and were strongly anticlerical. The Carbonari movement spread across Italy.

Conservative governments feared the Carbonari, imposing stiff penalties on men discovered to be members. Nevertheless, the movement survived and continued to be a source of political turmoil in Italy from 1820 until after unification. The Carbonari condemned Napoleon III (who, as a young man, had fought on their side) to death for failing to unite Italy, and the group almost succeeded in assassinating him in 1858, when Felice Orsini, Giovanni Andrea Pieri, Carlo Di Rudio and Andrea Gomez threw three bombs at him. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time or other members of this organization. The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and to establish constitutional government. Although contributing some service to the cause of Italian unity, historians such as Cornelia Shiver doubt that their achievements were proportional to their pretensions.

===Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi===

Many leading Carbonari revolutionaries wanted a republic, two of the most prominent being Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi. Mazzini&#x27;s activity in revolutionary movements caused him to be imprisoned soon after he joined. While in prison, he concluded that Italy could − and therefore should − be unified, and he formulated a program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with Rome as its capital. Following his release in 1831, he went to Marseille in France, where he organized a new political society called &quot;La Giovine Italia&quot; (Young Italy), whose mottos were &quot;&quot;Dio e Popolo&quot; (&#x27;God and People&#x27;) and &quot;Unione, Forza e Libertà&quot;&quot; (&#x27;Union, Strength and Freedom&quot;), which sought the unification of Italy.

Garibaldi, a native of Nice (then part of Piedmont), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834 and was sentenced to death. He escaped to South America, although, spending fourteen years in exile, taking part in several wars, and learning the art of guerrilla warfare before his return to Italy in 1848.

==Early revolutionary activity==

===Exiles and European and masculine ideals===
Many of the key intellectual and political leaders operated from exile; most Risorgimento patriots lived and published their work abroad after successive failed revolutions. Exile became a central theme of the foundational legacy of the Risorgimento as the narrative of the Italian nation fighting for independence. The exiles were deeply immersed in European ideas, and often hammered away at what Europeans saw as Italian vices, especially effeminacy and indolence. These negative stereotypes emerged from Enlightenment notions of national character that stressed the influence of the environment and history on a people&#x27;s moral predisposition. Italian exiles both challenged and embraced the stereotypes and typically presented gendered interpretations of Italy&#x27;s political &quot;degeneration&quot;. They called for a masculine response to feminine weaknesses as the basis of national regeneration and fashioned their image of the future Italian nation firmly in the standards of European nationalism.

===Two Sicilies insurrection===

In 1820, liberal Spaniards successfully revolted, demanding a Constitution, which influenced the development of a similar movement in Italy. Inspired by the Spaniards, a regiment in the army of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, commanded by Guglielmo Pepe, a Carbonaro (member of the secret republican organization), mutinied, conquering the peninsular part of Two Sicilies. The king, Ferdinand I, agreed to enact a new constitution. The revolutionaries, although, failed to court popular support and fell to Austrian troops of the Holy Alliance. Ferdinand abolished the constitution and began systematically persecuting known revolutionaries. Many supporters of revolution in Sicily, including the scholar Michele Amari, were forced into exile during the decades that followed.

===Piedmont insurrection===

The leader of the 1821 revolutionary movement in Piedmont was Santorre di Santarosa, who wanted to remove the Austrians and unify Italy under the House of Savoy. The Piedmont revolt started in Alessandria, where troops adopted the green, white, and red &quot;tricolore&quot; of the Cisalpine Republic. King Victor Emmanuel I abdicated in response, and the regent for the new king, Prince Charles Albert, approved a new constitution to appease the revolutionaries, but when King Charles Felix returned he disavowed the constitution and requested assistance from the Holy Alliance. Di Santarosa&#x27;s troops were defeated, and the would-be Piedmontese revolutionary fled to Paris.

In Milan, Silvio Pellico and Pietro Maroncelli organized several attempts to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. In October 1820, Pellico and Maroncelli were arrested on the charge of carbonarism and imprisoned.

===1830 insurrections===

Denis Mack Smith argues:

After 1830, revolutionary sentiment in favour of a unified Italy began to experience a resurgence, and a series of insurrections laid the groundwork for the creation of one nation along the Italian peninsula.

The Duke of Modena, Francis IV, was an ambitious man, and he hoped to become king of northern Italy by increasing his territory. In 1826, Francis made it clear that he would not act against those who subverted opposition toward the unification of Italy. Encouraged by the declaration, revolutionaries in the region began to organize.

During the July Revolution of 1830 in France, revolutionaries forced King Charles X to abdicate and created the July Monarchy with encouragement from the new French king, Louis-Philippe I. Louis-Philippe had promised revolutionaries such as Ciro Menotti that he would intervene if Austria tried to interfere in Italy with troops. Fearing he would lose his throne, Louis-Philippe did not, however, intervene in Menotti&#x27;s planned uprising. The Duke of Modena abandoned his Carbonari supporters, arrested Menotti and other conspirators in 1831, and once again conquered his duchy with help from the Austrian troops. Menotti was executed, and the idea of a revolution centred in Modena faded.

At the same time, other insurrections arose in the Papal Legations of Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Forlì, Ancona and Perugia. These successful revolutions, which adopted the &quot;tricolore&quot; in place of the Papal flag, quickly spread to cover all the Papal Legations, and their newly installed local governments proclaimed the creation of a united Italian nation. The revolts in Modena and the Papal Legations inspired similar activity in the Duchy of Parma, where the &quot;tricolore&quot; flag was adopted. The Parmese duchess Marie Louise left the city during the political upheaval.

Insurrection provinces planned to unite as the Italian United Provinces, which prompted Pope Gregory XVI to ask for Austrian help against the rebels. Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich warned Louis-Philippe that Austria had no intention of letting Italian matters be and that French intervention would not be tolerated. Louis-Philippe sent a naval expedition to Ancona, which restored Papal authority there and even arrested Italian patriots living in France. In early 1831, the Austrian army began its march across the Italian peninsula, slowly crushing resistance in each province that had revolted. This military action suppressed much of the fledgling revolutionary movement.

==Revolutions of 1848–1849 and First Italian War of Independence==

In 1844, two brothers from Venice, Attilio and Emilio Bandiera, members of Young Italy, planned to make a raid on the Calabrian coast against the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in support of Italian unification. They assembled a band of about twenty men ready to sacrifice their lives and set sail on their venture on 12 June 1844. Four days later they landed near Crotone, intending to go to Cosenza, liberate the political prisoners, and issue their proclamations. Tragically for the Bandiera brothers, they did not find the insurgent band they were told awaited them, so they moved towards La Sila. They were ultimately betrayed by one of their party, the Corsican Pietro Boccheciampe, and by some peasants who believed them to be Turkish pirates. A detachment of gendarmes and volunteers were sent against them, and after a short fight, the whole band was taken prisoner and escorted to Cosenza, where a number of Calabrians who had taken part in a previous rising were also under arrest. The Bandiera brothers and their nine companions were executed by firing squad; some accounts state they cried &quot;Viva l&#x27;Italia!&quot; (&#x27;Long live Italy!&#x27;) as they fell. The moral effect was enormous throughout Italy, the action of the authorities was universally condemned, and the martyrdom of the Bandiera brothers bore fruit in the subsequent revolutions.
In this context, in 1847, the first public performance of the song &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, the Italian national anthem since 1946, took place. &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, written by Goffredo Mameli set to music by Michele Novaro, is also known as the &quot;Inno di Mameli&quot;, after the author of the lyrics, or &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot;, from its opening line.

On 5 January 1848, the revolutionary disturbances began with a civil disobedience strike in Lombardy, as citizens stopped smoking cigars and playing the lottery, which denied Austria the associated tax revenue. Shortly after this, revolts began on the island of Sicily and in Naples. In Sicily the revolt resulted in the proclamation of the Kingdom of Sicily with Ruggero Settimo as chairman of the independent state until 1849, when the Bourbon army took back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force.
In February 1848, there were revolts in Tuscany that were relatively nonviolent, after which Grand Duke Leopold II granted the Tuscans a constitution. A breakaway republican provisional government formed in Tuscany during February shortly after this concession. On 21 February, Pope Pius IX granted a constitution to the Papal States, which was both unexpected and surprising considering the historical recalcitrance of the Papacy. On 23 February 1848, King Louis Philippe of France was forced to flee Paris, and the Second French Republic was proclaimed. By the time the revolution in Paris occurred, three states of Italy had constitutions—four if one considers Sicily to be a separate state.

Meanwhile, in Lombardy, tensions increased until the Milanese and Venetians rose in revolt on 18 March 1848. The insurrection in Milan succeeded in expelling the Austrian garrison after five days of street fights—18–22 March (Cinque giornate di Milano). An Austrian army under Marshal Josef Radetzky besieged Milan, but due to the defection of many of his troops and the support of the Milanese for the revolt, they were forced to retreat to the Quadrilatero fortresses.

Soon, Charles Albert, the King of Sardinia (who ruled Piedmont and Savoy), urged by the Venetians and Milanese to aid their cause, decided this was the moment to unify Italy and declared war on Austria (First Italian Independence War). After initial successes at Goito and Peschiera, he was decisively defeated by Radetzky at the Battle of Custoza on 24 July. An armistice was agreed to, and Radetzky regained control of all of Lombardy–Venetia save Venice itself, where the Republic of San Marco was proclaimed under Daniele Manin.
While Radetzky consolidated control of Lombardy–Venetia and Charles Albert licked his wounds, matters took a more serious turn in other parts of Italy. The monarchs who had reluctantly agreed to constitutions in March came into conflict with their constitutional ministers. At first, the republics had the upper hand, forcing the monarchs to flee their capitals, including Pope Pius IX.

Initially, Pius IX had been something of a reformer, but conflicts with the revolutionaries soured him on the idea of constitutional government. In November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister Pellegrino Rossi, Pius IX fled just before Giuseppe Garibaldi and other patriots arrived in Rome. In early 1849, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly, which proclaimed a Roman Republic on 9 February. On 2 February 1849, at a political rally held in the Apollo Theater, a young Roman priest, the Abbé Carlo Arduini, had made a speech in which he had declared that the Temporal power of the Holy See was a &quot;historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality&quot;. In early March 1849, Giuseppe Mazzini arrived in Rome and was appointed Chief Minister. In the Constitution of the Roman Republic, religious freedom was guaranteed by article 7, the independence of the pope as head of the Catholic Church was guaranteed by article 8 of the &quot;Principi fondamentali&quot;, while the death penalty was abolished by article 5, and free public education was provided by article 8 of the &quot;Titolo I&quot;.

Before the powers could respond to the founding of the Roman Republic, Charles Albert, whose army had been trained by the exiled Polish general Albert Chrzanowski, renewed the war with Austria. He was quickly defeated by Radetzky at Novara on 23 March 1849. Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel II, and Piedmontese ambitions to unite Italy or conquer Lombardy were, for the moment, brought to an end. The war ended with a treaty signed on 9 August. A popular revolt broke out in Brescia on the same day as the defeat at Novara, but was suppressed by the Austrians ten days later.

There remained the Roman and Venetian Republics. In April, a French force under Charles Oudinot was sent to Rome. Apparently, the French first wished to mediate between the pope and his subjects, but soon the French were determined to restore the pope. After a two-month siege, Rome capitulated on 29 June 1849 and the pope was restored. Garibaldi and Mazzini once again fled into exile—in 1850 Garibaldi went to New York City. Meanwhile, the Austrians besieged Venice, which was defended by a volunteer army led by Daniele Manin and Guglielmo Pepe, who were forced to surrender on 24 August. Pro-independence fighters were hanged en masse in Belfiore, while the Austrians moved to restore order in central Italy, restoring the princes who had been expelled and re-establishing Papal control over the Legations. The revolutions were thus completely crushed.

===Cavour and prospects for unification===

Morale was of course badly weakened, but the dream of Risorgimento did not die. Instead, the Italian patriots learned some lessons that made them much more effective at the next opportunity in 1860. Military weakness was glaring, as the small Italian states were completely outmatched by France and Austria.

France was a potential ally, and the patriots realized they had to focus all their attention on expelling Austria first, with a willingness to give the French whatever they wanted in return for essential military intervention. As a result of this France received Nice and Savoy in 1860. Secondly, the patriots realized that the pope was an enemy, and could never be the leader of a united Italy. Thirdly, they realized that republicanism was too weak a force. Unification had to be based on a strong monarchy, and in practice that meant reliance on Piedmont (the Kingdom of Sardinia) under King Victor Emmanuel II (1820–1878) of the House of Savoy.

Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour (1810–1861) provided critical leadership. He was a modernizer interested in agrarian improvements, banks, railways and free trade. He opened a newspaper as soon as censorship allowed it: &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot; called for the independence of Italy, a league of Italian princes, and moderate reforms. He had the ear of the king and in 1852 became prime minister. He ran an efficient active government, promoting rapid economic modernization while upgrading the administration of the army and the financial and legal systems. He sought out support from patriots across Italy.

In 1855, the kingdom became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War, which gave Cavour&#x27;s diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.
==Towards the Kingdom of Italy==
===Pisacane fiasco===
In 1857, Carlo Pisacane, an aristocrat from Naples who had embraced Mazzini&#x27;s ideas, decided to provoke a rising in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His small force landed on the island of Ponza. It overpowered guards and liberated hundreds of prisoners. In sharp contrast to his hypothetical expectations, there was no local uprising and the invaders were quickly overpowered. Pisacane was killed by angry locals who suspected he was leading a Romani band trying to steal their food.

===Second Italian Independence War of 1859 and aftermath===

The Second War of Italian Independence began in April 1859 when the Sardinian Prime Minister Count Cavour found an ally in Napoleon III. Napoleon III signed a secret alliance and Cavour provoked Austria with military maneuvers and eventually led to the war in April 1859. Cavour called for volunteers to enlist in the Italian liberation. The Austrians planned to use their army to beat the Sardinians before the French could come to their aid. Austria had an army of 140,000 men, while the Sardinians had a mere 70,000 men by comparison. However, the Austrians&#x27; numerical strength was outweighed by an ineffectual leadership appointed by the Emperor on the basis of noble lineage, rather than military competency. Their army was slow to enter Piedmont, taking almost ten days to travel the to Turin. By this time, the French had reinforced the Sardinians, so the Austrians retreated.
The Austrians were defeated at the Battle of Magenta on 4 June and pushed back to Lombardy. Napoleon III&#x27;s plans worked and at the Battle of Solferino, France and Sardinia defeated Austria and forced negotiations; at the same time, in the northern part of Lombardy, the Italian volunteers known as the Hunters of the Alps, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, defeated the Austrians at Varese and Como. On 12 July, the Armistice of Villafranca was signed. The settlement, by which Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia, left Austria in control of the Veneto and Mantua. The final arrangement was ironed out by &quot;back-room&quot; deals. This was because neither France, Austria, nor Sardinia wanted to risk another battle and could not handle further fighting. All of the sides were eventually unhappy with the outcome of the Second War of Italian Unification and expected another conflict in the future. In fact, Napoleon III and Cavour were mutually indebted: the first because he had withdrawn from the Second Italian War of Independence before the expected conquest of Venice, the second because he had allowed the uprisings to spread to the territories of central-northern Italy, thus going beyond what was agreed with the Plombières Agreement.
Sardinia annexed Lombardy from Austria; it later occupied and annexed the United Provinces of Central Italy, consisting of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Parma, the Duchy of Modena and Reggio and the Papal Legations on 22 March 1860. Sardinia handed Savoy and Nice over to France at the Treaty of Turin, a decision that was the consequence of the Plombières Agreement, on 24 March 1860, an event that caused the Niçard exodus, which was the emigration of a quarter of the Niçard Italians to Italy.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was elected in 1871 in Nice at the National Assembly where he tried to promote the annexation of his hometown to the newborn Italian unitary state, but he was prevented from speaking. Because of this denial, between 1871 and 1872 there were riots in Nice, promoted by the Garibaldini and called &quot;Niçard Vespers&quot;, which demanded the annexation of the city and its area to Italy. Fifteen Nice people who participated in the rebellion were tried and sentenced.

===Expedition of the Thousand===

Thus, by early 1860, only five states remained in Italy—the Austrians in Venetia, the Papal States (now minus the Legations), the new expanded Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and San Marino.

Francis II of the Two Sicilies, the son and successor of Ferdinand II (the infamous &quot;King Bomba&quot;), had a well-organized army of 150,000 men. But his father&#x27;s tyranny had inspired many secret societies, and the kingdom&#x27;s Swiss mercenaries were unexpectedly recalled home under the terms of a new Swiss law that forbade Swiss citizens to serve as mercenaries. This left Francis with only his mostly unreliable native troops. It was a critical opportunity for the unification movement. In April 1860, separate insurrections began in Messina and Palermo in Sicily, both of which had demonstrated a history of opposing Neapolitan rule. These rebellions were easily suppressed by loyal troops.

In the meantime, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a native of Nice, was deeply resentful of the French annexation of his home city. He hoped to use his supporters to regain the territory. Cavour, terrified of Garibaldi provoking a war with France, persuaded Garibaldi to instead use his forces in the Sicilian rebellions. On 6 May 1860, Garibaldi and his cadre of about a thousand Italian volunteers (called &quot;I Mille&quot;), steamed from Quarto near Genoa, and, after a stop in Talamone on 11 May, landed near Marsala on the west coast of Sicily.

Near Salemi, Garibaldi&#x27;s army attracted scattered bands of rebels, and the combined forces defeated the Army of the Two Sicilies at the Battle of Calatafimi on 13 May. Within three days, the invading force had swelled to 4,000 men. On 14 May Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily, in the name of Victor Emmanuel. After waging various successful but hard-fought battles, Garibaldi advanced upon the Sicilian capital of Palermo, announcing his arrival by beacon-fires kindled at night. On 27 May the force began the Siege of Palermo, while a mass uprising of street and barricade fighting broke out within the city.
With Palermo deemed insurgent, Neapolitan general Ferdinando Lanza, arriving in Sicily with some 25,000 troops, furiously bombarded Palermo nearly to ruins. With the intervention of a British admiral, an armistice was declared, leading to the Neapolitan troops&#x27; departure and surrender of the town to Garibaldi and his much smaller army.

This resounding success demonstrated the weakness of the Neapolitan government. Garibaldi&#x27;s fame spread and many Italians began to consider him a national hero. Doubt, confusion, and dismay overtook the Neapolitan court—the king hastily summoned his ministry and offered to restore an earlier constitution, but these efforts failed to rebuild the people&#x27;s trust in Bourbon governance.

Six weeks after the surrender of Palermo, Garibaldi attacked Messina. Within a week, its citadel surrendered. Having conquered Sicily, Garibaldi proceeded to the mainland, crossing the Strait of Messina with the Neapolitan fleet at hand. The garrison at Reggio Calabria promptly surrendered. As he marched northward, the populace everywhere hailed him, and military resistance faded: on 18 and 21 August, the people of Basilicata and Apulia, two regions of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, independently declared their annexation to the Kingdom of Italy. At the end of August, Garibaldi was at Cosenza, and, on 5 September, at Eboli, near Salerno. Meanwhile, Naples had declared a state of siege, and on 6 September the king gathered the 4,000 troops still faithful to him and retreated over the River Volturno. The next day, Garibaldi, with a few followers, entered by train into Naples, where the people openly welcomed him.

===Defeat of the Kingdom of Naples===

Although Garibaldi had easily taken the capital, the Neapolitan army had not joined the rebellion &quot;en masse&quot;, holding firm along the River Volturno. Garibaldi&#x27;s irregular bands of about 25,000 men could not drive away the king or take the fortresses of Capua and Gaeta without the help of the Royal Sardinian Army. The Sardinian army, however, could only arrive by traversing the Papal States, which extended across the entire center of the peninsula. Ignoring the political will of the Holy See, Garibaldi announced his intent to proclaim a &quot;Kingdom of Italy&quot; from Rome, the capital city of Pope Pius IX. Seeing this as a threat to the domain of the Catholic Church, Pius threatened excommunication for those who supported such an effort. Afraid that Garibaldi would attack Rome, Catholics worldwide sent money and volunteers for the Papal Army, which was commanded by General Louis Lamoricière, a French exile.

The settling of the peninsular standoff now rested with Napoleon III. If he let Garibaldi have his way, Garibaldi would probably end the temporal sovereignty of the pope and make Rome the capital of Italy. Napoleon, however, may have arranged with Cavour to let the King of Sardinia free to take possession of Naples, Umbria and the other provinces, provided that Rome and the &quot;Patrimony of Saint Peter&quot; were left intact.

It was in this situation that a Sardinian force of two army corps, under generals Manfredo Fanti and Enrico Cialdini, marched to the frontier of the Papal States, its objective being not Rome but Naples. The Papal troops under Lamoricière advanced against Cialdini, but were quickly defeated at the Battle of Castelfidardo and besieged in the fortress of Ancona, finally surrendering on 29 September. On 9 October, Victor Emmanuel arrived and took command. There was no longer a Papal army to oppose him, and the march southward proceeded unopposed.
Garibaldi distrusted the pragmatic Cavour since Cavour was the man ultimately responsible for orchestrating the French annexation of the city of Nice, which was his birthplace. Nevertheless, he accepted the command of Victor Emmanuel. When the king entered Sessa Aurunca at the head of his army, Garibaldi willingly handed over his dictatorial power. After greeting Victor Emmanuel in Teano with the title of King of Italy, Garibaldi entered Naples riding beside the king. Garibaldi then retired to the island of Caprera, while the remaining work of unifying the peninsula was left to Victor Emmanuel.

The progress of the Sardinian army compelled Francis II to give up his line along the river, and he eventually took refuge with his best troops in the fortress of Gaeta. His courage boosted by his resolute young wife, Queen Marie Sophie, Francis mounted a stubborn defence that lasted three months. But European allies refused to provide him with aid, food and munitions became scarce, and disease set in, so the garrison was forced to surrender. Nonetheless, ragtag groups of Neapolitans loyal to Francis fought on against the Italian government for years to come.
The fall of Gaeta brought the unification movement to the brink of fruition—only Lazio and Venetia remained to be added. On 18 February 1861, Victor Emmanuel assembled the deputies of the first Italian Parliament in Turin. On 17 March 1861, the Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel King of Italy, and on 27 March 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy, although it was not yet in the new kingdom.

Borrowing from the old Latin title &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; (). Three months later Cavour died, having seen his life&#x27;s work nearly completed. When he was given the last rites, Cavour purportedly said: &quot;Italy is made. All is safe.&quot;

===The repercussions on diplomatic relations===

The disapproval of the various European states culminated in the direct participation of the Sardinian army in the Expedition of the Thousand. In reaction, Spain and the Russian Empire interrupted diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Sardinia, while the Austrian Empire, which had not maintained relations with this country since 1859, after the Second Italian War of Independence, sent its troops to the Mincio border. France made no hostile statements, but recalled its ambassador. Queen Victoria and her prime minister John Russell convinced the Kingdom of Prussia not to hinder the ongoing process of Italian unification. On 26 October 1860, the same day as the meeting in Teano between the king and Garibaldi, Austria organized a congress in Warsaw to apply measures against the Kingdom of Sardinia, without success; held back by this crisis, Cavour was unable to be present at Teano.

After the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, the United Kingdom and the Swiss Confederation were the first to recognize the new state (30 March 1861), followed by the United States on 13 April. France negotiated the presence of French troops in Rome and recognized the Kingdom of Italy on 15 June, shortly after Cavour&#x27;s death. It will then be Portugal&#x27;s turn on 27 June, followed by Greece, the Ottoman Empire and the Scandinavian countries. The recognition of the Netherlands and Belgium occurred in two phases: they recognized the new title of Victor Emmanuel II in July, then the kingdom in November, after a long clash between conservatives and liberals in the Belgian parliament over the latter.

===Roman Question===

Mazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchical government and continued to agitate for a republic. With the motto &quot;Free from the Alps to the Adriatic&quot;, the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. There were obstacles, however. A challenge against the pope&#x27;s temporal dominion was viewed with profound distrust by Catholics around the world, and there were French troops stationed in Rome. Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Papal States, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions.

Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed that the government would support him if he attacked Rome. Frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, he came out of retirement to organize a new venture. In June 1862, he sailed from Genoa and landed again at Palermo, where he gathered volunteers for the campaign, under the slogan &quot;o Roma o Morte&quot; (&#x27;either Rome or Death&#x27;). The garrison of Messina, loyal to the king&#x27;s instructions, barred their passage to the mainland. Garibaldi&#x27;s force, now numbering two thousand, turned south and set sail from Catania. Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at Melito on 14 August and marched at once into the Calabrian mountains.
Far from supporting this endeavour, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General Cialdini dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Pallavicino, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August the two forces met at Aspromonte. One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, but Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the Kingdom of Italy. The volunteers suffered several casualties, and Garibaldi himself was wounded; many were taken prisoner. Garibaldi was taken by steamer to Varignano, where he was honorably imprisoned for a time, but finally released.

Meanwhile, Victor Emmanuel sought a safer means to the acquisition of the remaining Papal territory. He negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon for the removal of the French troops from Rome through a treaty. They agreed to the September Convention in September 1864, by which Napoleon agreed to withdraw the troops within two years. The pope was to expand his own army during that time so as to be self-sufficient. In December 1866, the last of the French troops departed from Rome, in spite of the efforts of the pope to retain them. By their withdrawal, Italy (excluding Venetia and Savoy) was freed from the presence of foreign soldiers.

The seat of government was moved in 1865 from Turin, the old Sardinian capital, to Florence. This arrangement created such disturbances in Turin that the king was forced to leave that city hastily for his new capital.

==Third War of Independence (1866)==


In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Austria contested with Prussia the position of leadership among the German states. The Kingdom of Italy seized the opportunity to capture Venetia from Austrian rule and allied itself with Prussia. Austria tried to persuade the Italian government to accept Venetia in exchange for non-intervention. However, on 8 April, Italy and Prussia signed an agreement that supported Italy&#x27;s acquisition of Venetia, and on 20 June Italy issued a declaration of war on Austria. Within the context of Italian unification, the Austro-Prussian war is called the &quot;Third Independence War&quot;, after the &quot;First&quot; (1848) and the &quot;Second&quot; (1859).

Victor Emmanuel hastened to lead an army across the Mincio to the invasion of Venetia, while Garibaldi was to invade the Tyrol with his Hunters of the Alps. The Italian army encountered the Austrians at Custoza on 24 June and suffered a defeat. On 20 July the Regia Marina was defeated in the Battle of Lissa. The following day, Garibaldi&#x27;s volunteers defeated an Austrian force in the Battle of Bezzecca, and moved toward Trento.

Meanwhile, Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck saw that his own ends in the war had been achieved, and signed an armistice with Austria on 27 July. Italy followed, officially laying down its arms on 12 August. Garibaldi was recalled from his successful march and resigned with a brief telegram reading only &quot;Obbedisco&quot; (&#x27;I obey&#x27;).
Prussia&#x27;s success on the northern front obliged Austria to cede Venetia (present-day Veneto and parts of Friuli) and the city of Mantua (the last remnant of the &quot;Quadrilatero&quot;). Under the terms of a peace treaty signed in Vienna on 12 October, Emperor Franz Joseph had already agreed to cede Venetia to Napoleon III in exchange for non-intervention in the Austro-Prussian War, and thus Napoleon ceded Venetia to Italy on 19 October, in exchange for the earlier Italian acquiescence to the French annexation of Savoy and Nice.

In the Treaty of Vienna, it was written that the annexation of Venetia would have become effective only after a referendum—taken on 21 and 22 October—to let the Venetian people express their will about being annexed or not to the Kingdom of Italy. Historians suggest that the referendum in Venetia was held under military pressure, as a mere 0.01% of voters (69 out of more than 642,000 ballots) voted against the annexation.

Austrian forces put up some opposition to the invading Italians, to little effect. Victor Emmanuel entered Venice and Venetian land, and performed an act of homage in the Piazza San Marco.

==Rome==

===Mentana and Villa Glori===

The national party, with Garibaldi at its head, still aimed at the possession of Rome, as the historic capital of the peninsula. In 1867 Garibaldi made a second attempt to capture Rome, but the Papal army, strengthened with a new French auxiliary force, defeated his poorly armed volunteers at Mentana. Subsequently, a French garrison remained in Civitavecchia until August 1870, when it was recalled following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.

Before the defeat at Mentana on 3 November 1867, Enrico Cairoli, his brother Giovanni, and 70 companions had made a daring attempt to take Rome. The group had embarked in Terni and floated down the Tiber. Their arrival in Rome was to coincide with an uprising inside the city. On 22 October 1867, the revolutionaries inside Rome seized control of the Capitoline Hill and of Piazza Colonna. Unfortunately for the Cairoli and their companions, by the time they arrived at Villa Glori, on the northern outskirts of Rome, the uprising had already been suppressed. During the night of 22 October 1867, the group was surrounded by Papal Zouaves, and Giovanni was severely wounded. Enrico was mortally wounded and bled to death in Giovanni&#x27;s arms.

With Cairoli dead, command was assumed by Giovanni Tabacchi who had retreated with the remaining volunteers into the villa, where they continued to fire at the papal soldiers. These also retreated in the evening to Rome. The survivors retreated to the positions of those led by Garibaldi on the Italian border.

===Memorial===
At the summit of Villa Glori, near the spot where Enrico died, there is a plain white column dedicated to the Cairoli brothers and their 70 companions. About 200 meters to the right from the Terrazza del Pincio, there is a bronze monument of Giovanni holding the dying Enrico in his arm. A plaque lists the names of their companions. Giovanni never recovered from his wounds and from the tragic events of 1867. According to an eyewitness, when Giovanni died on 11 September 1869:

===Capture of Rome===

In July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began. In early August, the French Emperor Napoleon III recalled his garrison from Rome, thus no longer providing protection to the Papal State. Widespread public demonstrations illustrated the demand that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of the Second French Empire at the Battle of Sedan. King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count Gustavo Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. The Papacy, however, exhibited something less than enthusiasm for the plan:

The Royal Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the Papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although now convinced of his unavoidable defeat, Pius IX remained intransigent to the bitter end and forced his troops to put up a token resistance. On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia, the Bersaglieri entered Rome and marched down &quot;Via Pia&quot;, which was subsequently renamed &quot;Via XX Settembre&quot;. Forty-nine Italian soldiers and four officers, and nineteen papal troops, died. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite held on 2 October. The results of this plebiscite were accepted by decree of 9 October.
Initially the Italian government had offered to let the pope keep the Leonine City under the Law of Guarantees, but the pope rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom&#x27;s rule over his former domain. Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican, although he was not actually restrained from coming and going. Rather, being deposed and stripped of much of his former power also removed a measure of personal protection—if he had walked the streets of Rome, he might have been in danger from political opponents who had formerly kept their views private. Officially, the capital was not moved from Florence to Rome until July 1871.

Historian Raffaele de Cesare made the following observations about Italian unification:


==Problems==
Unification was achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont&#x27;s interests. Martin Clark says, &quot;It was Piedmontization all around.&quot; Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title.

National and regional officials were all appointed by Piedmont. A few regional leaders succeeded to high positions in the new national government, but the top bureaucratic and military officials were mostly Piedmontese. The national capital was briefly moved to Florence and finally to Rome, one of the cases of Piedmont losing out.

However, Piedmontese tax rates and regulations, diplomats and officials were imposed on all of Italy. The constitution was Piedmont&#x27;s old constitution. The document was generally liberal and was welcomed by liberal elements. However, its anticlerical provisions were resented in the pro-clerical regions in places such as around Venice, Rome, and Naples—as well as the island of Sicily. Cavour had promised there would be regional and municipal, local governments, but all the promises were broken in 1861.

The first decade of the kingdom saw savage insurrections in Sicily and in the Naples region. Hearder claimed that failed efforts to protest unification involved &quot;a mixture of spontaneous peasant movement and a Bourbon-clerical reaction directed by the old authorities&quot;.

The pope lost Rome in 1870 and ordered the Catholic Church not to co-operate with the new government, a decision fully reversed only in 1929. Most people for Risorgimento had wanted strong provinces, but they got a strong central state instead. The inevitable long-run results were a severe weakness of national unity and a politicized system based on mutually hostile regional violence. Such factors remain in the 21st century.

===Ruling and representing southern Italy===
From the spring of 1860 to the summer of 1861, a major challenge that the Piedmontese parliament faced on national unification was how they should govern and control the southern regions of the country that were frequently represented and described by northern Italian correspondents as &quot;corrupt&quot;, &quot;barbaric&quot;, and &quot;uncivilized&quot;. In response to the depictions of southern Italy, the Piedmontese parliament had to decide whether it should investigate the southern regions to better understand the social and political situations there or it should establish jurisdiction and order by using mostly force.

The dominance of letters sent from the northern Italian correspondents that deemed southern Italy to be &quot;so far from the ideas of progress and civilization&quot; ultimately induced the Piedmontese parliament to choose the latter course of action, which effectively illustrated the intimate connection between representation and rule. In essence, the northern Italians&#x27; &quot;representation of the south as a land of barbarism (variously qualified as indecent, lacking in &#x27;public conscience&#x27;, ignorant, superstitious, etc.)&quot; provided the Piedmontese with the justification to rule the southern regions on the pretext of implementing a superior, more civilized, &quot;Piedmontese morality&quot;.

==Historiography==

Italian unification is still a topic of debate. According to Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio, centuries of foreign domination created remarkable differences in Italian society, and the role of the newly formed government was to face these differences and to create a unified Italian society. Still today the most famous quote of Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio is, &quot;L&#x27;Italia è fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani&quot; (&#x27;Italy has been made. Now it remains to make Italians&#x27;).

The economist and politician Francesco Saverio Nitti criticized the newly created state for not considering the substantial economic differences between northern Italy, a free-market economy, and southern Italy, a state protectionist economy, when integrating the two. When the Kingdom of Italy extended the free-market economy to the rest of the country, the south&#x27;s economy collapsed under the weight of the north&#x27;s. Nitti contended that this change should have been much more gradual in order to allow the birth of an adequate entrepreneurial class able to make strong investments and initiatives in the south. These mistakes, he felt, were the cause of the economic and social problems which came to be known as the southern question (&quot;Questione Meridionale&quot;).

The politician, historian, and writer Gaetano Salvemini commented that although Italian unification had been a strong opportunity for both a moral and economic rebirth of Italy&#x27;s &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; (southern Italy), because of a lack of understanding and action on the part of politicians, corruption and organized crime flourished in the south. The Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci criticized Italian unification for the limited presence of the masses in politics, as well as the lack of modern land reform in Italy.

Revisionism of Risorgimento produced a clear radicalization of Italy in the mid-20th century, following the fall of the Savoy monarchy and fascism during World War II. Reviews of the historical facts concerning Italian unification&#x27;s successes and failures continue to be undertaken by domestic and foreign academic authors, including Denis Mack Smith, Christopher Duggan, and Lucy Riall. Recent work emphasizes the central importance of nationalism.

==Risorgimento and Italian irredentism==
===Origins of Italian irredentism===

It can be argued that Italian unification was never truly completed in the 19th century. Even after the Capture of Rome (1871), the final event of the unification of Italy, many ethnic Italian speakers (Trentino-Alto Adigan Italians, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot Italians, Niçard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy and this situation created the Italian irredentism.

The Corsican revolutionary Pasquale Paoli was called &quot;the precursor of Italian irredentism&quot; by Niccolò Tommaseo because he was the first to promote the Italian language and socio-culture (the main characteristics of Italian irredentism) in his island; Paoli wanted the Italian language to be the official language of the newly founded Corsican Republic.

The term &quot;Risorgimento&quot; refers to the domestic reorganization of the stratified Italian identity into a unified, national front. The word literally means &#x27;rising again&#x27; and was an ideological movement which strove to spark national pride, leading to political oppositionalism to foreign rule and influence. There is contention on its actual impact in Italy, some Scholars arguing it was a liberalizing time for 19th century Italian culture, while others speculate that although it was a patriotic revolution, it only tangibly aided the upper-class and bourgeois publics without actively benefitting the lower classes.

&quot;Italia irredenta&quot; was an Italian nationalist opinion movement that emerged after Italian unification. It advocated irredentism among the Italian people as well as other nationalities who were willing to become Italian and as a movement; it is also known as &quot;Italian irredentism&quot;. Not a formal organization, it was just an opinion movement that claimed that Italy had to reach its &quot;natural borders&quot;, meaning that the country would need to incorporate all areas predominantly consisting of ethnic Italians within the near vicinity outside its borders. Similar patriotic and nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the 19th century.
At the beginning, Italian irredentism promoted the annexation to Italy of territories where Italians formed the absolute majority of the population, but retained by the Austrian Empire after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. During World War One the main &quot;irredent lands&quot; (&quot;terre irredente&quot;) were considered to be the provinces of Trento and Trieste and, in a narrow sense, irredentists referred to the Italian patriots living in these two areas.

The term was later expanded to also include multilingual and multiethnic areas, where Italians were a relative majority or a substantial minority, within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with German, Italian, Slovene, Croatian, Ladin and Istro-Romanian population, such as South Tyrol, Istria, Gorizia and Gradisca and part of Dalmatia. The claims were further extended also to the city of Fiume (see &quot;Impresa di Fiume&quot;), Corsica, the island of Malta, the County of Nice and Italian Switzerland.

Many Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians looked with sympathy towards the Risorgimento movement that fought for the unification of Italy. However, after the Third Italian War of Independence (1866), when the Veneto and Friuli regions were ceded by the Austrians to the newly formed Kingdom Italy, Istria and Dalmatia remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, together with other Italian-speaking areas on the eastern Adriatic. This triggered the gradual rise of Italian irredentism among many Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia, who demanded the unification of the Julian March, Kvarner and Dalmatia with Italy. The Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia supported the Italian Risorgimento: as a consequence, the Austrians saw the Italians as enemies and favored the Slav communities of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia. During the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 12 November 1866, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria outlined a wide-ranging project aimed at the Germanization or Slavization of the areas of the empire with an Italian presence:


Istrian Italians were more than 50% of the total population of Istria for centuries, while making up about a third of the population in 1900. Dalmatia, especially its maritime cities, once had a substantial local ethnic Italian population (Dalmatian Italians), making up 33% of the total population of Dalmatia in 1803, but this was reduced to 20% in 1816. In Dalmatia there was a constant decline in the Italian population, in a context of repression that also took on violent connotations. During this period, Austrians carried out an aggressive anti-Italian policy through a forced Slavization of Dalmatia. According to Austrian census, the Dalmatian Italians formed 12.5% of the population in 1865. In the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, Istria had a population of 57.8% Slavic-speakers (Croat and Slovene), and 38.1% Italian speakers. For the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia, (i.e. Dalmatia), the 1910 numbers were 96.2% Slavic speakers and 2.8% Italian speakers.

The Italian population in Dalmatia was concentrated in the major coastal cities. In the city of Split in 1890 there were Dalmatian Italians (12.5% of the population), in Zadar (64.6%), in Šibenik (14.5%), in Kotor (18.7%) and in Dubrovnik (4.6%). In other Dalmatian localities, according to Austrian censuses, Dalmatian Italians experienced a sudden decrease: in the twenty years 1890-1910, in Rab they went from 225 to 151, in Vis from 352 to 92, in Pag from 787 to 23, completely disappearing in almost all the inland locations. In 1909 the Italian language lost its status as the official language of Dalmatia in favor of Croatian only (previously both languages were recognized): thus Italian could no longer be used in the public and administrative sphere.

===Irredentism and the World Wars===

Italy entered into the First World War in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence, in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.

During the post-unification era, some Italians were dissatisfied with the current state of the Italian Kingdom since they wanted the kingdom to include Trieste, Istria, and other adjacent territories as well. This Italian irredentism succeeded in World War I with the annexation of Trieste and Trento, with the respective territories of Julian March and Trentino-Alto Adige.

The Kingdom of Italy had declared neutrality at the beginning of the war, officially because the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary was a defensive one, requiring its members to come under attack first. Many Italians were still hostile to Austria&#x27;s continuing occupation of ethnically Italian areas, and Italy chose not to enter. Austria-Hungary requested Italian neutrality, while the Triple Entente (which included Great Britain, France and Russia) requested its intervention. With the Treaty of London, signed in April 1915, Italy agreed to declare war against the Central Powers in exchange for the &quot;irredent&quot; territories of Friuli, Trentino, and Dalmatia (see &quot;Italia irredenta&quot;).
Italian irredentism obtained an important result after the First World War, when Italy gained Trieste, Gorizia, Istria, and the cities of Zara and Pola after the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at Altare della Patria in Rome. But Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, such Dalmatia, so this outcome was denounced as a &quot;mutilated victory&quot;. The rhetoric of &quot;mutilated victory&quot; was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian Fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard &quot;mutilated victory&quot; as a &quot;political myth&quot;, used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.

During the Second World War, after the Axis attack on Yugoslavia, Italy created the Governatorate of Dalmatia (from 1941 to September 1943), so the Kingdom of Italy annexed temporarily Split (Italian &quot;Spalato&quot;), Kotor (&quot;Cattaro&quot;), and most of coastal Dalmatia. From 1942 to 1943, Corsica and Nice (Italian &quot;Nizza&quot;) were temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, nearly fulfilling in those years the ambitions of Italian irredentism.

For its avowed purpose, the movement had the &quot;emancipation&quot; of all Italian lands still subject to foreign rule after Italian unification. The Irredentists took language as the test of the alleged Italian nationality of the countries they proposed to emancipate, which were Trentino, Trieste, Dalmatia, Istria, Gorizia, Ticino, Nice (Nizza), Corsica, and Malta. Austria-Hungary promoted Croatian interests in Dalmatia and Istria to weaken Italian claims in the western Balkans before the First World War.

===End of Italian irredentism===

Under the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara was annexed by Yugoslavia causing the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which led to the emigration of between 230,000 and 350,000 of local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic Istro-Romanians, choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.

The Istrian-Dalmatian exodus started in 1943 and ended completely only in 1960. According to the census organized in Croatia in 2001 and that organized in Slovenia in 2002, the Italians who remained in the former Yugoslavia amounted to 21,894 people (2,258 in Slovenia and 19,636 in Croatia).

After World War II, Italian irredentism disappeared along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the House of Savoy. After the Treaty of Paris (1947) and the Treaty of Osimo (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the Italian Republic (see Foreign relations of Italy). The Italian irredentist movement thus vanished from Italian politics. The 1947 Constitution of Italy established five autonomous regions (Sardinia, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sicily, Aosta Valley, and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol), in recognition of their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness.

==Anniversary of the unification of Italy==

Italy celebrates the anniversary of the unification every fifty years, on 17 March (the date of proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy). The anniversary occurred in 1911 (50th), 1961 (100th), 2011 (150th) and 2021 (160th) with several celebrations throughout the country. While remaining a working day, 17 March is considered a &quot;day promoting the values linked to national identity&quot;.

The National Unity and Armed Forces Day, celebrated on 4 November, commemorates the end of World War I with the Armistice of Villa Giusti, a war event considered to complete the process of unification of Italy.
==Culture and Risorgimento==
===Art===

In art, this period was characterised by the Neoclassicism that draws inspiration from the &quot;classical&quot; art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The main Italian sculptor was Antonio Canova who became famous for his marble sculptures that delicately rendered nude flesh. The mourning Italia turrita on the tomb to Vittorio Alfieri is one of the main works of Risorgimento by Canova. By this time, in sculpture, a veiled woman in the style of the Veiled Rebecca of Benzoni had become an allegory for Italian unification.

Francesco Hayez was another remarkable artist of this period whose works often contain allegories about Italian unification. His most known painting &quot;The Kiss&quot; aims to portray the spirit of the Risorgimento: the man wears red, white and green, representing the Italian patriots fighting for independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire while the girl&#x27;s pale blue dress signifies France, which in 1859 (the year of the painting&#x27;s creation) made an alliance with the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia enabling the latter to unify the many states of the Italian peninsula into the new kingdom of Italy. Hayez&#x27;s three paintings on the &quot;Sicilian Vespers&quot; are an implicit protest against the foreign domination of Italy.

Andrea Appiani, Domenico Induno, and Gerolamo Induno are also known for their patriotic canvases. The Risorgimento was also represented by works not necessarily linked to Neoclassicism—as in the case of Giovanni Fattori who was one of the leaders of the group known as the Macchiaioli and who soon became a leading Italian plein-airist, painting landscapes, rural scenes, and military life during the Italian unification.
===Literature===

The most well known writer of Risorgimento is Alessandro Manzoni, whose works are a symbol of the Italian unification, both for its patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language. He is famous for the novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (orig. Italian: &quot;I Promessi Sposi&quot;) (1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature.

Vittorio Alfieri, was the founder of a new school in the Italian drama, expressed in several occasions his suffering about the foreign domination&#x27;s tyranny.

Ugo Foscolo describes in his works the passion and love for the fatherland and the glorious history of the Italian people; these two concepts are respectively well expressed in two masterpieces, &quot;The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis&quot; and &quot;Dei Sepolcri&quot;.

Vincenzo Monti, known for the Italian translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, described in his works both enthusiasms and disappointments of Risorgimento until his death.

Giovanni Berchet wrote a poetry characterized by a high moral, popular and social content; he also contributed to &quot;Il Conciliatore&quot;, a progressive bi-weekly scientific and literary journal, influential in the early Risorgimento that was published in Milan from September 1818 until October 1819 when it was closed by the Austrian censors; its writers included also Ludovico di Breme, Giuseppe Nicolini, and Silvio Pellico.

Giacomo Leopardi was one of the most important poets of Risorgimento thanks to works such as &quot;Canzone all&#x27;Italia&quot; and &quot;Risorgimento&quot;.
Niccolò Tommaseo, the editor of the &quot;Italian Language Dictionary&quot; in eight volumes, was a precursor of the Italian irredentism and his works are a rare examples of a metropolitan culture above nationalism; he supported the liberal revolution headed by Daniele Manin against the Austrian Empire and he will always support the unification of Italy.

Francesco de Sanctis was one of the most important scholars of Italian language and literature in the 19th century; he supported the Revolution of 1848 in Naples and for this reason he was imprisoned for three years; his reputation as a lecturer on Dante in Turin brought him the appointment of professor at ETH Zürich in 1856; he returned to Naples as Minister of Public Education after the unification of Italy.

The writer and patriot Luigi Settembrini published anonymously the &quot;Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies&quot;, a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government and was imprisoned and exiled several times by the Bourbons because of his support to Risorgimento; after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, he was appointed professor of Italian literature at the University of Naples.

Ippolito Nievo is another main representative of Risorgimento with his novel &quot;Confessioni d&#x27;un italiano&quot;; he fought with Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s Expedition of the Thousand.

The Risorgimento was also depicted in famous novels: &quot;The Leopard&quot; written by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, &quot;Heart&quot; by Edmondo De Amicis, and &quot;The Little World of the Past&quot; by Antonio Fogazzaro.

===Music===

Risorgimento won the support of many leading Italian opera composers. Their librettos often saw a delicate balance between European romantic narratives and dramatic themes evoking nationalistic sentiments. Ideas expressed in operas stimulated the political mobilisation in Italy and among the cultured classes of Europe who appreciated Italian opera. Furthermore, Mazzini and many other nationalists found inspiration in musical discourses.

In his &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; (&#x27;The Italian Girl in Algiers&#x27;), Gioachino Rossini expressed his support to the unification of Italy; the patriotic line &quot;Pensa alla patria, e intrepido il tuo dover adempi: vedi per tutta Italia rinascere gli esempi d’ardir e di valor&quot; (&#x27;Think about the fatherland and intrepid do your duty: see for all Italy the birth of the examples of courage and value&#x27;) was censored in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.

Vincenzo Bellini was a secret member of the Carbonari and in his masterpiece &quot;I puritani (The Puritans)&quot;, the last part of Act 2 is an allegory to Italian unification. Another Bellini opera, &quot;Norma&quot;, was at the center of an unexpected standing ovation during its performance in Milan in 1859: while the chorus was performing &quot;Guerra, guerra! Le galliche selve&quot; (&#x27;War, war! The Gallic forests&#x27;) in Act 2, the Italians began to greet the chorus with loud applause and to yell the word &quot;War!&quot; several times towards the Austrian officers at the opera house.

The relationship between Gaetano Donizetti and the Risorgimento is still controversial. Although Giuseppe Mazzini tried to use some of Donizetti&#x27;s works for promoting the Italian cause, Donizetti had always preferred not to get involved in politics.
Historians vigorously debate how political were the operas of Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901). In particular, the chorus of the Hebrew slaves (known as &quot;Va, pensiero&quot;) from the third act of the opera &quot;Nabucco&quot; was intended to be an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus&#x27;s theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as &quot;O mia patria, si bella e perduta—&#x27;O my country, so lovely and so lost&#x27;—were thought to have resonated with many Italians). Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan &quot;Viva VERDI&quot; was used as an acronym for Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D&#x27;Italia (&#x27;Viva Victor Emmanuel King of Italy&#x27;), referring to Victor Emmanuel II.

Franco Della Peruta argues in favour of close links between the operas and the Risorgimento, emphasizing Verdi&#x27;s patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour&#x27;s suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi&#x27;s main works of 1842–49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including &quot;Nabucco&quot; (1842), &quot;I Lombardi alla prima crociata&quot; (1843), &quot;Ernani&quot; (1844), &quot;Attila&quot; (1846), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1847), and &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot; (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship of the absolutist regimes in power.

Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861. Likewise Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815 music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo says Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles. On the other side of the debate, Mary Ann Smart argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes. Likewise Roger Parker argues that the political dimension of Verdi&#x27;s operas was exaggerated by nationalistic historians looking for a hero in the late 19th century.

Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; and the Risorgimento are the subject of a 2011 opera, &quot;Risorgimento!&quot; by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero, written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Italian unification.

===Films===
&quot;The Leopard&quot; is a film from 1963, based on the novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, and directed by Luchino Visconti. It features Burt Lancaster as the eponymous character, the Prince of Salina. The film depicts his reaction to the Risorgimento, and his vain attempts to retain his social standing.

<text>A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature on a message gives a recipient confidence that the message came from a sender known to the recipient.

Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.

Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which include any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. Electronic signatures have legal significance in some countries, including Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Russia, the United States, Algeria, Turkey, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Chile and the countries of the European Union.

Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances, they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. They can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret. Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a timestamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid. Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.

==Definition==
A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms:
* A &quot;key generation&quot; algorithm that selects a &quot;private key&quot; uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding &quot;public key&quot;.
* A &quot;signing&quot; algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.
* A &quot;signature verifying&quot; algorithm that, given the message, public key and signature, either accepts or rejects the message&#x27;s claim to authenticity.

Two main properties are required:

First, the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key.

Secondly, it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party&#x27;s private key.
A digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that acts as a signature.
The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of many examples of a signing algorithm.

In the following discussion, 1&quot;n&quot; refers to a unary number.

Formally, a digital signature scheme is a triple of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms, (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;V&quot;), satisfying:
* &quot;G&quot; (key-generator) generates a public key (&quot;pk&quot;), and a corresponding private key (&quot;sk&quot;), on input 1&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the security parameter.
* &quot;S&quot; (signing) returns a tag, &quot;t&quot;, on the inputs: the private key (&quot;sk&quot;), and a string (&quot;x&quot;).
* &quot;V&quot; (verifying) outputs &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;rejected&quot; on the inputs: the public key (&quot;pk&quot;), a string (&quot;x&quot;), and a tag (&quot;t&quot;).
For correctness, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;V&quot; must satisfy

: Pr [ (&quot;pk&quot;, &quot;sk&quot;) ← &quot;G&quot;(1&quot;n&quot;), &quot;V&quot;( &quot;pk&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;sk&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) ) = &quot;accepted&quot; ] = 1.

A digital signature scheme is secure if for every non-uniform probabilistic polynomial time adversary, &quot;A&quot;

: Pr [ (&quot;pk&quot;, &quot;sk&quot;) ← &quot;G&quot;(1&quot;n&quot;), (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) ← &quot;A&quot;&quot;S&quot;(&quot;sk&quot;, · )(&quot;pk&quot;, 1&quot;n&quot;), &quot;x&quot; ∉ &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;pk&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) = &quot;accepted&quot;] &lt; negl(&quot;n&quot;),

where &quot;A&quot;&quot;S&quot;(&quot;sk&quot;, · ) denotes that &quot;A&quot; has access to the oracle, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;sk&quot;, · ), &quot;Q&quot; denotes the set of the queries on &quot;S&quot; made by &quot;A&quot;, which knows the public key, &quot;pk&quot;, and the security parameter, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;x&quot; ∉ &quot;Q&quot; denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string, &quot;x&quot;, on &quot;S&quot;.

==History==
In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first described the notion of a digital signature scheme, although they only conjectured that such schemes existed based on functions that are trapdoor one-way permutations. Soon afterwards, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman invented the RSA algorithm, which could be used to produce primitive digital signatures (although only as a proof-of-concept – &quot;plain&quot; RSA signatures are not secure). The first widely marketed software package to offer digital signature was Lotus Notes 1.0, released in 1989, which used the RSA algorithm.

Other digital signature schemes were soon developed after RSA, the earliest being Lamport signatures, Merkle signatures (also known as &quot;Merkle trees&quot; or simply &quot;Hash trees&quot;), and Rabin signatures.

In 1988, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Ronald Rivest became the first to rigorously define the security requirements of digital signature schemes. They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes, and also presented the GMR signature scheme, the first that could be proved to prevent even an existential forgery against a chosen message attack, which is the currently accepted security definition for signature schemes. The first such scheme which is not built on trapdoor functions but rather on a family of function with a much weaker required property of one-way permutation was presented by Moni Naor and Moti Yung.

==Method==

One digital signature scheme (of many) is based on RSA. To create signature keys, generate an RSA key pair containing a modulus, &quot;N&quot;, that is the product of two random secret distinct large primes, along with integers, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, such that &quot;e&quot; &quot;d&quot; ≡ 1 (mod &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;N&quot;)), where &quot;φ&quot; is Euler&#x27;s totient function. The signer&#x27;s public key consists of &quot;N&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, and the signer&#x27;s secret key contains &quot;d&quot;.

Used directly, this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to key-only existential forgery attack. To create a forgery, the attacker picks a random signature σ and uses the verification procedure to determine the message, &quot;m&quot;, corresponding to that signature. In practice, however, this type of signature is not used directly, but rather, the message to be signed is first hashed to produce a short digest, that is then padded to larger width comparable to &quot;N&quot;, then signed with the reverse trapdoor function. This forgery attack, then, only produces the padded hash function output that corresponds to σ, but not a message that leads to that value, which does not lead to an attack. In the random oracle model, hash-then-sign (an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to &quot;N&quot; possible outputs), this form of signature is existentially unforgeable, even against a chosen-plaintext attack.

There are several reasons to sign such a hash (or message digest) instead of the whole document.

;For efficiency: The signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice.
;For compatibility: Messages are typically bit strings, but some signature schemes operate on other domains (such as, in the case of RSA, numbers modulo a composite number &quot;N&quot;). A hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format.
;For integrity: Without the hash function, the text &quot;to be signed&quot; may have to be split (separated) in blocks small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly. However, the receiver of the signed blocks is not able to recognize if all the blocks are present and in the appropriate order.

==Applications==

As organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps, digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance, identity, and status of an electronic document as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory. The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) publishes electronic versions of the budget, public and private laws, and congressional bills with digital signatures. Universities including Penn State, University of Chicago, and Stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures.

Below are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:

===Authentication===
A message may have letterhead or a handwritten signature identifying its sender, but letterheads and handwritten signatures can be copied and pasted onto forged messages.
Even legitimate messages may be modified in transit.

If a bank&#x27;s central office receives a letter claiming to be from a branch office with instructions to change the balance of an account, the central bankers need to be sure, before acting on the instructions, that they were actually sent by a branch banker, and not forged—whether a forger fabricated the whole letter, or just modified an existing letter in transit by adding some digits.

With a digital signature scheme, the central office can arrange beforehand to have a public key on file whose private key is known only to the branch office.
The branch office can later sign a message and the central office can use the public key to verify the signed message was not a forgery before acting on it.
A forger who &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; know the sender&#x27;s private key can&#x27;t sign a different message, or even change a single digit in an existing message without making the recipient&#x27;s signature verification fail.

Encryption can hide the content of the message from an eavesdropper, but encryption on its own may not let recipient verify the message&#x27;s authenticity, or even detect selective modifications like changing a digit—if the bank&#x27;s offices simply encrypted the messages they exchange, they could still be vulnerable to forgery.
In other applications, such as software updates, the messages are not secret—when a software author publishes a patch for all existing installations of the software to apply, the patch itself is not secret, but computers running the software must verify the authenticity of the patch before applying it, lest they become victims to malware.

====Limitations====

Replays.
A digital signature scheme on its own does not prevent a valid signed message from being recorded and then maliciously reused in a replay attack.
For example, the branch office may legitimately request that bank transfer be issued once in a signed message.
If the bank doesn&#x27;t use a system of transaction IDs in their messages to detect which transfers have already happened, someone could illegitimately reuse the same signed message many times to drain an account.

Uniqueness and malleability of signatures.
A signature itself cannot be used to uniquely identify the message it signs—in some signature schemes, every message has a large number of possible valid signatures from the same signer, and it may be easy, even without knowledge of the private key, to transform one valid signature into another.
If signatures are misused as transaction IDs in an attempt by a bank-like system such as a Bitcoin exchange to detect replays, this can be exploited to replay transactions.

Authenticating a public key.
Prior knowledge of a &quot;public key&quot; can be used to verify authenticity of a &quot;signed message&quot;, but not the other way around—prior knowledge of a &quot;signed message&quot; cannot be used to verify authenticity of a &quot;public key&quot;.
In some signature schemes, given a signed message, it is easy to construct a public key under which the signed message will pass verification, even without knowledge of the private key that was used to make the signed message in the first place.

===Non-repudiation===
Non-repudiation, or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.

Note that these authentication, non-repudiation etc. properties rely on the secret key prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is a required ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an &quot;online&quot; check; e.g., checking a certificate revocation list or via the Online Certificate Status Protocol. Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first checking online with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen. Of course, with stolen key pairs, the theft is often discovered only after the secret key&#x27;s use, e.g., to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose.

==Notions of security==
In their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:

# In a &quot;key-only&quot; attack, the attacker is only given the public verification key.
# In a &quot;known message&quot; attack, the attacker is given valid signatures for a variety of messages known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker.
# In an &quot;adaptive chosen message&quot; attack, the attacker first learns signatures on arbitrary messages of the attacker&#x27;s choice.

They also describe a hierarchy of attack results:

# A &quot;total break&quot; results in the recovery of the signing key.
# A universal forgery attack results in the ability to forge signatures for any message.
# A selective forgery attack results in a signature on a message of the adversary&#x27;s choice.
# An existential forgery merely results in some valid message/signature pair not already known to the adversary.

The strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.

==Additional security precautions==

===Putting the private key on a smart card===
All public key / private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret. A private key can be stored on a user&#x27;s computer, and protected by a local password, but this has two disadvantages:
* the user can only sign documents on that particular computer
* the security of the private key depends entirely on the security of the computer

A more secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card. Many smart cards are designed to be tamper-resistant (although some designs have been broken, notably by Ross Anderson and his students). In a typical digital signature implementation, the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU signs the hash using the stored private key of the user, and then returns the signed hash. Typically, a user must activate their smart card by entering a personal identification number or PIN code (thus providing two-factor authentication). It can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card, although this is not always implemented. If the smart card is stolen, the thief will still need the PIN code to generate a digital signature. This reduces the security of the scheme to that of the PIN system, although it still requires an attacker to possess the card. A mitigating factor is that private keys, if generated and stored on smart cards, are usually regarded as difficult to copy, and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy. Thus, the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked. Private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy, and such compromises are far more difficult to detect.

===Using smart card readers with a separate keyboard===
Entering a PIN code to activate the smart card commonly requires a numeric keypad. Some card readers have their own numeric keypad. This is safer than using a card reader integrated into a PC, and then entering the PIN using that computer&#x27;s keyboard. Readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a keystroke logger, potentially compromising the PIN code. Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often EAL3 certified.

===Other smart card designs===
Smart card design is an active field, and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems, despite having few security proofs so far.

===Using digital signatures only with trusted applications===
One of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not &quot;see&quot; what they sign. The user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key. An attacker who gains control of the user&#x27;s PC can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute, in effect replacing the user&#x27;s own communications with those of the attacker. This could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user&#x27;s original on-screen, but presenting the attacker&#x27;s own documents to the signing application.

To protect against this scenario, an authentication system can be set up between the user&#x27;s application (word processor, email client, etc.) and the signing application. The general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each other&#x27;s integrity. For example, the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries.

===Using a network attached hardware security module===
One of the main differences between a cloud based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk. Many risk averse companies, including governments, financial and medical institutions, and payment processors require more secure standards, like FIPS 140-2 level 3 and FIPS 201 certification, to ensure the signature is validated and secure. 

===WYSIWYS===

Technically speaking, a digital signature applies to a string of bits, whereas humans and applications &quot;believe&quot; that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits. In order to be semantically interpreted, the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system. The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content. It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign) means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed. In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of, and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. WYSIWYS is a requirement for the validity of digital signatures, but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems. The term WYSIWYS was coined by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for Pan-European projects.

===Digital signatures versus ink on paper signatures===

An ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally, but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill, and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult.

Digital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document. Paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page, and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied. Digital signatures can be applied to an entire document, such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered, but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract.

==Some digital signature algorithms==
* RSA
* DSA
* ECDSA
* EdDSA
* RSA with SHA
* ECDSA with SHA
* ElGamal signature scheme as the predecessor to DSA, and variants Schnorr signature and Pointcheval–Stern signature algorithm
* Rabin signature algorithm
* Pairing-based schemes such as BLS
* CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a quantum-resistant scheme based on LWE in lattices
* Falcon, a quantum-resistant scheme based on CVP in lattices
* SPHINCS+, a quantum-resistant scheme based on hash functions
* Undeniable signatures
* – a signature scheme that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n messages from n users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of users. This single signature will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages. A scheme by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven may be used with Bitcoin.
* Signatures with efficient protocols – are signature schemes that facilitate efficient cryptographic protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs or secure computation.

==The current state of use – legal and practical==

Most digital signature schemes share the following goals regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision:

# Quality algorithms: Some public-key algorithms are known to be insecure, as practical attacks against them have been discovered.
# Quality implementations: An implementation of a good algorithm (or protocol) with mistake(s) will not work.
# Users (and their software) must carry out the signature protocol properly.
# The private key must remain private: If the private key becomes known to any other party, that party can produce &quot;perfect&quot; digital signatures of anything.
# The public key owner must be verifiable: A public key associated with Bob actually came from Bob. This is commonly done using a public key infrastructure (PKI) and the public key↔user association is attested by the operator of the PKI (called a certificate authority). For &#x27;open&#x27; PKIs in which anyone can request such an attestation (universally embodied in a cryptographically protected public key certificate), the possibility of mistaken attestation is non-trivial. Commercial PKI operators have suffered several publicly known problems. Such mistakes could lead to falsely signed, and thus wrongly attributed, documents. &#x27;Closed&#x27; PKI systems are more expensive, but less easily subverted in this way.

Only if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message, and therefore of their assent to its contents. Legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities, though some such have not reflected this actuality.

Legislatures, being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI, or by the technological avant-garde advocating new solutions to old problems, have enacted statutes and/or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing, endorsing, encouraging, or permitting digital signatures and providing for (or limiting) their legal effect. The first appears to have been in Utah in the United States, followed closely by the states Massachusetts and California. Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time. These enactments (or proposed enactments) vary from place to place, have typically embodied expectations at variance (optimistically or pessimistically) with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering, and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers, nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable.

Adoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation, delaying a more or less unified engineering position on interoperability, algorithm choice, key lengths, and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide.

==Industry standards==

Some industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between members of the industry and with regulators. These include the Automotive Network Exchange for the automobile industry and the SAFE-BioPharma Association for the healthcare industry.

===Using separate key pairs for signing and encryption===
In several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature, as in the
1999 EU digital signature directive and 2014 EU follow-on legislation. Generally, these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair, a person can engage in an encrypted conversation (e.g., regarding a real estate transaction), but the encryption does not legally sign every message he or she sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the encrypted link. If a signing key is lost or compromised, it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions. If an encryption key is lost, a backup or key escrow should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content. Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed unless the backup destination is securely encrypted.

<text>Waikīkī (; ) is a Honolulu neighborhood and the eponymous Waikīkī beach on its south shore, on the island of Oahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. (Despite situational use of the spelling &quot;Waikiki&quot;, typically in materials aimed at tourists, the spelling &quot;Waikīkī&quot; is official and common.)

Waikīkī Beach is one of six beaches in the district, along with Queen&#x27;s Beach, Kuhio Beach, Gray&#x27;s Beach, Fort DeRussy Beach, and Kahanamoku Beach. The sandy beach is almost entirely man-made.
Waikīkī (Hawaii) is home to public places including Kapiolani Park, Fort DeRussy, Kahanamoku Lagoon, Kūhiō Beach Park, and Ala Wai Harbor. Waikīkī was the first capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1795 to 1796.

==Etymology==
The Hawaiian language name means &quot;spouting fresh water&quot;, for springs and streams that fed wetlands that once separated Waikīkī from the interior.

==History==

After the founding of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Waikīkī was its first capital, 1795–1796.

In the 1800s, the area was a retreat for Hawaiian royalty, who enjoyed surfing there on early forms of longboards. 

A few small hotels opened in the 1880s. In 1893, Greek-American George Lycurgus leased the guest house of Allen Herbert and renamed it the &quot;Sans Souci&quot; (French for &quot;without worries&quot; or “carefree”) creating one of the first beach resorts. Later that year Robert Louis Stevenson stayed at the resort; subsequently it became a popular destination for mainland tourists. The area at coordinates is still called &quot;Sans Souci Beach&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 1900s, Waikīkī was home to many wetlands, which were claimed to harbor disease-carrying mosquitoes. To get rid of the mosquitoes, developers created the Ala Wai canal. The canal, originally known as the Waikīkī Drainage Canal, was created by a Hawaiian dredging company run by Walter F. Dillingham. The project took about seven years, 1921–1928.

Duke Kahanamoku became a well-known surfer in Waikīkī. Throughout his life and after competing in the Olympics, many people around the world wanted to learn to surf. Duke&#x27;s influence made Waikīkī beach a surfing hotspot. &quot;Dukes&quot;, a club in Waikīkī named for Kahanamoku, helped Don Ho produce music and hosted the longest-running show in Waikīkī.

The first high-rise hotels on Waikīkī were built in 1955, including the Waikiki Biltmore and Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel. Development boomed due to demand, and the area became filled with large resort hotels, such as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Halekulani, the Hyatt Regency Waikiki, Marriott Waikiki, Sheraton Waikiki. These complemented historic hotels dating back to the early 20th century such as the Moana Surfrider Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

==== Changes in the shoreline ====
Waikīkī developed erosion problems starting in the late 1800s, as hotels and homes were built too close to the natural shoreline, while seawalls and other structures blocked the natural ebb and flow of sand along the beach.

In the 1920s and 1930s, sand was imported from Manhattan Beach, California, via ship and barge.

Before 1950, Waikīkī beaches were continuous. Then seawalls and groins began to appear. These helped build sand at one beach, but typically appropriated sand from others. They became separated into sections, some with sandy beach and others without. By 1950, more than 80 structures, including seawalls, groins, piers, and storm drains, occupied the Waikīkī shoreline.

Following World War II, Waikīkī beach restoration efforts have occurred every few years. Sand was imported to this artificial beach from the 1920s to the 1970s, once by boat and barge from Southern California. of shoreline was replenished at a cost of $2.4 million following chronic erosion of more than a foot a year.

Importing stopped in the 1970s. In March 1971, the Corps of Engineers Pacific Ocean Division, created a Draft Environmental Statement for the Kuhio Beach Sector of Waikīkī, which aimed to improve the overall quality and size of the fading and narrowing shoreline.

=== 21st century ===

From October 29 through November 4, 2000, the first FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships were held in the waters off Waikīkī Beach.

A partial restoration was completed in the spring of 2012. The project imported sand from nearby shoals and widened the beach by about between the Royal Hawaiian Hotel concrete groin and the Kūhiō Beach crib wall. The project temporarily restored the beach to its 1985 shoreline. Two aging sandbag groin structures were also removed that year.

In 2017, beach erosion worsened with high-energy king tides and elevated sea levels. Honolulu&#x27;s mayor stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not a scientist, but I&#x27;ll get a jackhammer in there and remove all the concrete that&#x27;s there creating this backwash and sucking out more sand, plus it&#x27;s just downright dangerous.&quot;

The beach hosts many events, including surf competitions, outdoor performances, hula dancing, and outrigger canoe races. The many amenities, shops, and hotels enable Waikīkī to generate approximately 42 percent of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s visitor revenue.

== Geography ==
The neighborhood extends from the Ala Wai Canal (a channel dug to drain wetlands) on the west and north, to Diamond Head (&quot;Lēahi,&quot; tuna brow) on the east. Waikīkī Beach is noted for its views of the Diamond Head tuff cone, its usually warm and cloud-free climate, and its surf break. The Waikīkī skyline is filled with high-rises and resort hotels. 

=== Beaches ===

==== Waikīkī Beach ====
Before 1950, the beach in the Waikīkī neighborhood was continuous and known as Waikīkī Beach. Seawalls and other developments have since separated the coast into eight distinct beaches. Since 1951, nearly of sand have been added to restore the beach in the region, but it is believed that little of the added sand remains. As of 2020 the family of beaches in the region are still referred to as &quot;Waikīkī Beach&quot;, but most venues and addresses will use the name of a specific subsidiary beach.

From Waikīkī Beach the sunset in the sea is visible from mid-September to late March. Half of the beach is marked off for surfers. For some distance into the ocean the water is quite shallow, with numerous rocks on the bottom. The waves can have some force, particularly on windy days. The surf is known for its long rolling break, making it ideal for long boarding, tandem surfing, and beginners. 

==== Subsidiary beaches ====
Largely as a result of shoreline development, Waikīkī has eight beaches. They are Ft. DeRussy Beach, Duke Kahanamoku Beach, Halekulani Beach, Royal Hawaiian Beach, Kūhiō Beach, Kapiolani Beach, Queens Beach, and Kaimana Beach. 

=== Thoroughfares ===
Waikīkī&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Kalākaua Avenue, named after King Kalākaua, which houses most of the high-end hotels (Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton, Hyatt, Marriott, Moana Surfrider Hotel), most of the luxury designer brand stores (Apple Store, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Burberry, Dior, Tiffany &amp; Co., Fendi, Harry Winston, Saint Laurent, Gucci, and Hermès), department store (Macy&#x27;s), and popular surf clothing brand stores (Quiksilver, Billabong, Volcom). Waikīkī&#x27;s other main thoroughfare, Kūhiō Avenue, named after Prince Kūhiō, is better known for its restaurants, cafes and grocers, along with its clubs, nightlife and prostitution.

== Public art ==
In 1990, the bronze statue of Duke Kahanamoku by Gordon Fisher was installed at Waikīkī Beach, accompanied by a bronze replica of his surfboard, honorary spears, and commemorative bronze plaques. It serves as a culture and tourist locale with thousands of annual visitors and numerous cultural events. Seven years later, Billy Fields created The Stones of Life (in Hawaiian: &quot;Nā Pōhaku Ola O Kapaemahu A Me Kapuni&quot;), a sculpture incorporating ancient basaltic stones, was installed nearby and is considered a local monument. A bronze sculpture in Kapiolani Park of Mahatma Gandhi by Stephen Lowe entitled &quot;A Fistful of Salt&quot; was a gift in 1990 from the Gandhi Memorial International Foundation and the Jhamandas Watumull Fund.

At Kūhiō Beach and Queens Beach, three public artworks were installed in the early 2000s. The bronze statue of Prince Jonah Kuhio by Sean Browne and the children&#x27;s story sculpture &quot;Makua and Kila&quot; by Holly Young were installed in 2001. Robert Pashby&#x27;s &quot;Surfer on a Wave&quot; was installed at Queens Beach in 2003.

==Beach issues ==
===Erosion===
Waikīkī beach has had repeated problems with erosion, leading to the construction of groins and beach replenishment projects. Imported sand came from California, local beaches such as Pāpōhaku Beach on Moloka‘i, and a sandbar from Oʻahu&#x27;s Northern side near Kahuku. Officials look for ways to sustain the existing sand by eliminating loss due to tidal flow.

Erosion claims about of beach per year. Local sources are sought for sand to replenish the beach.

===Water quality===
Waikīkī Beach had repeated contamination problems due to sewage spills in 2017.

===Homelessness===
Many homeless people settle around the beach because of the public shower and sanitary facilities available there.
The Honolulu Police Department has increased patrolling in and around Waikīkī Beach with assistance from other city agencies and local businesses to prevent homeless people from making camp in this area.

==Education==
Hawaii state Department of Education operates conventional public schools throughout Hawaii. Thomas Jefferson Elementary School is located in Waikīkī proper, while Waikīkī Elementary School is located nearby, at the &quot;makai&quot; (seaward) edge of the Kapahulu neighborhood.

The Hawaii State Public Library System operates the Waikīkī Public Library.

<text>The Erfurt school massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on 26 April 2002 at the Gutenberg-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany. 19-year-old expelled student Robert Steinhäuser shot and killed 16 people, including a police officer before killing himself. One person was also wounded by a bullet fragment. According to students, he ignored them and aimed only for the teachers and administrators, although two students were unintentionally killed by shots fired through a locked door.

==Background==
Robert Steinhäuser, a 19-year-old man born on 22 January 1983, was the perpetrator of the massacre. He was a student of the Gutenberg-Gymnasium until early October 2001 and had previously threatened a teacher. His academic performance declined in 1999, leading him to drop out of the year shortly before the final exam. He was allowed to repeat the 11th year at the request of his parents, approved by the principal. He joined a gun club in October 2000 and acquired a gun license.

At the end of September 2001, he had spent a few days away from school, for which he presented a mandatory medical certificate which was quickly identified as a forgery. Because of this forgery, Steinhäuser was expelled by the principal. Due to the regulations used in Thuringia at the time, Steinhäuser, on expulsion, was without any qualifications and therefore had very limited job opportunities.

Steinhäuser did not tell his parents he had been expelled, and pretended he was still attending school. The day of the shooting he told his parents he was going to school to take a maths exam. The investigation revealed that Steinhäuser had been using the Internet to research the Columbine High School massacre, and had related files saved on his computer.

== Massacre ==
On the day of the shooting, before leaving his residence at his usual time, Steinhäuser armed himself with a 9mm Glock 17C semi-automatic pistol, a Mossberg 590 Mariner 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, which was unusable due to an earlier handling error, and a diving knife. Steinhäuser entered the school unmasked at approximately 10:45, carrying his weapons and ammunition concealed in either his sports bag or backpack. As Steinhäuser was in the hallway, he encountered the building&#x27;s caretaker, and briefly talked with him. He asked whether or not Ms. Alt, the principal of the school, was in the building. He went into the men&#x27;s lavatory on the ground floor and changed some of his clothes, including a black face mask. He left his coat, wallet and identification.

The shooting started shortly before 10:58 am. From the lavatory, Steinhäuser went to the school office. There he shot the deputy school principal and the secretary. In the next room was the headmistress, but Steinhäuser did not enter the room despite the door being unlocked. When the headmistress went to check the noise, Steinhäuser had already left the room. Upon discovering the bodies, she locked herself in her office and alerted the emergency services. Steinhäuser moved from classroom to classroom, pausing briefly each time in the doorway to shoot a teacher, then moving on to the next room. At 11:05 am, a janitor called the police. At 11:12 am, the first police car arrived at the school. Steinhäuser opened fire on the police, fatally shooting one of the policemen.

In front of the art material Room 111, Steinhäuser met the history and arts teacher Rainer Heise. In later interviews Heise gave conflicting versions of the event, claiming that either he himself or Steinhäuser had removed his mask, after which he told Steinhäuser to shoot him while looking him in the eyes. Steinhäuser is then said to have lowered his weapon and to have replied: &quot;Herr Heise, für heute reichts.&quot; [Mr Heise, that&#x27;s enough for today.] According to Heise, he used this opportunity to push Steinhäuser into the art material room to lock him up there together with his gun. Steinhäuser then shot himself, his body being found by police a few hours later.

From the first shot to Steinhäuser&#x27;s suicide the spree lasted no more than 20 minutes. One and a half hours later, Steinhäuser&#x27;s body was found by a special police detachment (SEK) in Room 111. The gunman had killed 16 people: the school&#x27;s assistant principal, secretary, ten teachers, one trainee-teacher, two students, and one police officer. In total one third of the school&#x27;s faculty were killed, and two students were shot by rounds fired through a locked door. He fired around 71 shots in total during the massacre.

== Reactions ==

Steinhäuser&#x27;s family issued a statement to news sources saying that they &quot;will forever be sorry that our son and brother has brought such horrifying suffering to the victims and their relatives, the people of Erfurt and Thuringia, and all over Germany.&quot;

In 2004, after repeated public criticisms of the police response to the shooting, the state government of Thuringia tasked a committee to release a final report on the shooting. The state government of Thuringia reprimanded the principal of the school for the expulsion of Steinhäuser, saying she had overstepped her legal powers and violated the rules of the procedure. There were no further legal consequences for the principal and she remains in charge of the school as of 2017.

Likewise, the Thuringian education law was caught in the crossfire of criticism. Since Steinhäuser was already an adult, the school administration was not required to inform his parents about their son&#x27;s expulsion from school. In contrast to most other German states at this time, the state of Thuringia did not automatically award the middle school certificate at the end of the 10th Grade. Students who did not pass the final exams therefore did not have a school certificate, which left them with limited job prospects. In response to the shooting, a law was enacted that would give high school students the option to take an exam at the end of the 10th Grade at their own request. Since 2004, this exam has been mandatory for all Thuringian high school students.

The shooting also led to public discussions on the effect of violence in media and its effect on the youth, especially in relation to computer games of the first-person shooter genre, so-called killer games and dealing with fictional violence in other media. According to the report of the Gutenberg Commission, Steinhäuser had some violent movies such as &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;, as well as the video games &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Steinhäuser was apparently not interested in the game &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, which was often mentioned in connection with the shooting by the media. The discussions contributed to a revision of the Protection of Young Persons Act and helped to strengthen the rules for these legal areas.

In addition to the reform of the Protection of Young Persons Act, gun laws were tightened. The legal minimum age for those who wanted to join a shooting club was raised from 18 to 21 years and anyone under 25 years wishing to handle firearms was now required to undergo a medical-psychological examination. Pump-action firearms were banned altogether. Furthermore, the retention requirements for firearms and ammunition were significantly tightened.

== Legacy ==

After the rampage, around 700 students were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, about one hundred of whom were still under treatment for one year after the shooting. 10 years after the killing spree, there were still six witnesses in psychological therapy, including four who had initially rejected a follow-up program. These adolescents had &quot;time-delayed disturbances such as memory gaps and extreme avoidance behavior&quot;. The Thuringian Accident Insurance Fund as payers has so far taken over childcare costs for the victims in the amount of about 5.6 million Euros, including about 2.2 million Euros as pension payments, for example, for survivors&#x27; pensions.

Steinhäuser&#x27;s last words – &quot;Für heute reicht&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;that&#x27;s enough for today&quot;) – was also the title of a controversial book about the massacre written by Ines Geipel, who alleged that there were several mistakes made by the police on the case. Geipel, and relatives of some of the victims, criticized police for the initial speed of their response. The police had initially believed there was a second gunman, leading them to retake the school one level at a time rather than storm the entire building. Police laws and police training were reformed in most federal states in response to the shooting. While police patrols were previously required to wait for a special task force, policemen all over Germany now get the necessary training and equipment to deal directly with mass shooters.

Heise was hailed as a national hero for locking Steinhäuser in a room, which ended the killing spree, but was later subject to backlash from some members of the public due to questions about his role. Erfurt Mayor Manfred Ruge said he fully believes Heise, but acknowledged the teacher&#x27;s rather direct and animated style combined with the vast media coverage had caused resentment in the town.

The massacre led to the development of a code word that could be broadcast over the public address system to warn teachers of a shooting. &quot;Mrs. Koma is coming&quot;, which is &quot;amok&quot; spelled backwards, was later used at the Winnenden school shooting to alert teachers to that attack.

Steinhäuser was mentioned in a video created by Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who killed eight people during the Jokela school shooting in Finland.

<doc id="59652" wikidata="Q1760368" url="?curid=59652" title="Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem">
<text>The Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem was one of the earliest public key cryptosystems. It was published by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978. A polynomial time attack was published by Adi Shamir in 1984. As a result, the cryptosystem is now considered insecure. 

==History==
The concept of public key cryptography was introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. At that time they proposed the general concept of a &quot;trap-door one-way function&quot;, a function whose inverse is computationally infeasible to calculate without some secret &quot;trap-door information&quot;; but they had not yet found a practical example of such a function. Several specific public-key cryptosystems were then proposed by other researchers over the next few years, such as RSA in 1977 and Merkle-Hellman in 1978.

==Description==
Merkle–Hellman is a public key cryptosystem, meaning that two keys are used, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the subset sum problem (a special case of the knapsack problem). The problem is as follows: given a set of integers formula_1 and an integer formula_2, find a subset of formula_1 which sums to formula_2. In general, this problem is known to be NP-complete. However, if formula_1 is superincreasing, meaning that each element of the set is greater than the sum of all the numbers in the set lesser than it, the problem is &quot;easy&quot; and solvable in polynomial time with a simple greedy algorithm.

In Merkle–Hellman, decrypting a message requires solving an apparently &quot;hard&quot; knapsack problem. The private key contains a superincreasing list of numbers formula_6, and the public key contains a non-superincreasing list of numbers formula_7, which is actually a &quot;disguised&quot; version of formula_6. The private key also contains some &quot;trapdoor&quot; information that can be used to transform a hard knapsack problem using formula_7 into an easy knapsack problem using formula_6.

Unlike some other public key cryptosystems such as RSA, the two keys in Merkle-Hellman are not interchangeable; the private key cannot be used for encryption. Thus Merkle-Hellman is not directly usable for authentication by cryptographic signing, although Shamir published a variant that can be used for signing.

===Key generation===
1. Choose a block size formula_11. Integers up to formula_11 bits in length can be encrypted with this key.

2. Choose a random superincreasing sequence of formula_11 positive integers
:formula_14
:The superincreasing requirement means that formula_15, for formula_16.

3. Choose a random integer formula_17 such that
: formula_18

4. Choose a random integer formula_19 such that formula_20 (that is, formula_19 and formula_17 are coprime).

5. Calculate the sequence
:formula_23
:where formula_24.

The public key is formula_7 and the private key is formula_26.

===Encryption===
Let formula_27 be an formula_11-bit message consisting of bits formula_29, with formula_30 the highest order bit. Select each formula_31 for which formula_32 is nonzero, and add them together. Equivalently, calculate
:formula_33.
The ciphertext is formula_2.

===Decryption===
To decrypt a ciphertext formula_2, we must find the subset of formula_7 which sums to formula_2. We do this by transforming the problem into one of finding a subset of formula_6. That problem can be solved in polynomial time since formula_6 is superincreasing.

1. Calculate the modular inverse of formula_19 modulo formula_17 using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. The inverse will exist since formula_19 is coprime to formula_17.
:formula_44
:The computation of formula_45 is independent of the message, and can be done just once when the private key is generated.

2. Calculate
:formula_46

3. Solve the subset sum problem for formula_47 using the superincreasing sequence formula_6, by the simple greedy algorithm described below. Let formula_49 be the resulting list of indexes of the elements of formula_6 which sum to formula_47. (That is, formula_52.)

4. Construct the message formula_27 with a 1 in each formula_54 bit position and a 0 in all other bit positions:
:formula_55

====Solving the subset sum problem====
This simple greedy algorithm finds the subset of a superincreasing sequence formula_6 which sums to formula_47, in polynomial time:

:1. Initialize formula_58 to an empty list.

:2. Find the largest element in formula_6 which is less than or equal to formula_47, say formula_61.

:3. Subtract: formula_62.

:4. Append formula_63 to the list formula_58.

:5. Remove formula_61 from the superincreasing sequence formula_6

:6. If formula_47 is greater than zero, return to step 2.

===Example===
====Key generation====
Create a key to encrypt 8-bit numbers by creating a random superincreasing sequence of 8 values:
:formula_68
The sum of these is 706, so select a larger value for formula_17:
:formula_70.
Choose formula_19 to be coprime to formula_17: 
:formula_73.

Construct the public key formula_7 by multiplying each element in formula_6 by formula_19 modulo formula_17:

:formula_78

Hence formula_79.

====Encryption====
Let the 8-bit message be formula_80. We multiply each bit by the corresponding number in formula_7 and add the results:
 0 * 295
 + 1 * 592
 + 1 * 301
 + 0 * 14
 + 0 * 28
 + 0 * 353
 + 0 * 120
 + 1 * 236
 = 1129
The ciphertext formula_2 is 1129.

====Decryption====
To decrypt 1129, first use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of formula_19 mod formula_17:
:formula_85. 

Compute formula_86. 

Use the greedy algorithm to decompose 372 into a sum of formula_87 values:
:formula_88
Thus formula_89, and the list of indexes is formula_90. The message can now be computed as
:formula_91.

==Cryptanalysis==

In 1984 Adi Shamir published an attack on the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem which can decrypt encrypted messages in polynomial time without using the private key. The attack analyzes the public key formula_92 and searches for a pair of numbers formula_93 and formula_27 such that formula_95 is a superincreasing sequence. The formula_96 pair found by the attack may not be equal to formula_97 in the private key, but like that pair it can be used to transform a hard knapsack problem using formula_7 into an easy problem using a superincreasing sequence. The attack operates solely on the public key; no access to encrypted messages is necessary.

Shamir&#x27;s attack on the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem works in polynomial time even if the numbers in the public key are randomly shuffled, a step which is usually not included in the description of the cryptosystem, but can be helpful against some more primitive attacks.

<text>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is the ministry of foreign affairs and a ministerial department of the government of the United Kingdom.

The office was created on 2 September 2020 through the merger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID). The FCO was itself created in 1968 by the merger of the Foreign Office (FO) and the Commonwealth Office. The department in its various forms is responsible for representing and promoting British interests worldwide.

The head of the FCDO is the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs, commonly abbreviated to &quot;foreign secretary&quot;. This is regarded as one of the four most prestigious positions in the Cabinet – the Great Offices of State – alongside those of Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary. David Lammy was appointed Foreign Secretary on 5 July 2024 following the 2024 general election.

The FCDO is managed day-to-day by a civil servant, the permanent under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, who also acts as the Head of His Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service. Sir Oliver Robbins took office as permanent under-secretary on 8 January 2025.

The expenditure, administration and policy of the FCDO are scrutinised by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

== Responsibilities ==
According to the FCDO website, the department&#x27;s key responsibilities (as of 2020) are as follows:

* Safeguarding the UK&#x27;s national security by countering terrorism and weapons proliferation, and working to reduce conflict.
* Building the UK&#x27;s prosperity by increasing exports and investment, opening markets, ensuring access to resources, and promoting sustainable global growth.
* Supporting British nationals around the world through modern and efficient consular services.
In addition to the above responsibilities, the FCDO is responsible for the British Overseas Territories, which had previously been administered from 1782 to 1801 by the Home Office, from 1801 to 1854 by the War and Colonial Office, from 1854 to 1966 by the Colonial Office, from 1966 to 1968 by the Commonwealth Office, from 1968 to 2020 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and since 2020 by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (this did not include &quot;protectorates&quot;, which fell under the purview of the Foreign Office, or to British India, which had been administered by the East India Company until 1858, and thereafter by the India Office). This arrangement has been subject to criticism in the UK and in the overseas territories. For example, the chief minister of Anguilla, Victor Banks, said: &quot;We are not foreign; neither are we members of the Commonwealth, so we should have a different interface with the UK that is based on mutual respect&quot;. There have been numerous suggestions on ways to improve the relationship between the overseas territories and the UK. Suggestions have included setting up a dedicated department to handle relations with the overseas territories, similarly to the French Ministry of the Overseas, or alternatively the absorption of the Overseas Territories Directorate (OTD) in the Cabinet Office, thus affording the overseas territories with better connections to the centre of government.

==Ministers==
The FCDO ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:

==History==
===Eighteenth century===
The Foreign Office was formed in March 1782 by combining the Southern and Northern Departments of the Secretary of State, each of which covered both foreign and domestic affairs in their parts of the Kingdom. The two departments&#x27; foreign affairs responsibilities became the Foreign Office, whilst their domestic affairs responsibilities were assigned to the Home Office. The Home Office is technically the senior.

===Nineteenth century===

During the 19th century, it was not infrequent for the Foreign Office to approach &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper and ask for continental intelligence, which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources. Examples of journalists who specialized in foreign affairs and were well connected to politicians included: Henry Southern, Valentine Chirol, Harold Nicolson, and Robert Bruce Lockhart.

===Twentieth century===
During the First World War, the Arab Bureau was set up within the British Foreign Office as a section of the &quot;Cairo Intelligence Department&quot;. During the early Cold War an important department was the Information Research Department (IRD) which was used to create propaganda against socialist and anti-colonial movements. The Foreign Office hired its first woman diplomat, Monica Milne, in 1946.

===The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1968–2020)===
The FCO was formed on 17 October 1968, from the merger of the short-lived Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office. The Commonwealth Office had been created only in 1966, by the merger of the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office having been formed by the merger of the Dominions Office and the India Office in 1947—with the Dominions Office having been split from the Colonial Office in 1925.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office held responsibility for international development issues between 1970 and 1974, and again between 1979 and 1997.

The National Archives website contains a government timeline to show the departments responsible for foreign affairs from 1945.

==== Under New Labour (1997–2010) ====
From 1997, international development became the responsibility of the separate Department for International Development.

When David Miliband took over as Foreign Secretary in June 2007, he set in hand a review of the FCO&#x27;s strategic priorities. One of the key messages of these discussions was the conclusion that the existing framework of ten international strategic priorities, dating from 2003, was no longer appropriate. Although the framework had been useful in helping the FCO plan its work and allocate its resources, there was agreement that it needed a new framework to drive its work forward.

The new strategic framework consists of three core elements:

* A flexible global network of staff and offices, serving the whole of the UK Government.
* Three essential services that support the British economy, British nationals abroad and managed migration for Britain. These services are delivered through UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), consular teams in Britain and overseas, and UK Visas and Immigration.
* Four policy goals:
** countering terrorism and weapons proliferation and their causes
** preventing and resolving conflict
** promoting a low-carbon, high-growth, global economy
** developing effective international institutions, in particular the United Nations and the European Union.

In August 2005, a report by management consultant group Collinson Grant was made public by Andrew Mackinlay. The report severely criticised the FCO&#x27;s management structure, noting:

* The Foreign Office could be &quot;slow to act&quot;.
* Delegation is lacking within the management structure.
* Accountability was poor.
* The FCO could feasibly cut 1200 jobs.
* At least £48 million could be saved annually.

The Foreign Office commissioned the report to highlight areas which would help it achieve its pledge to reduce spending by £87 million over three years. In response to the report being made public, the Foreign Office stated it had already implemented the report&#x27;s recommendations.

In 2009, Gordon Brown created the position of Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the FCO. The first science adviser was David Clary.

On 25 April 2010, the department apologised after &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; obtained a &quot;foolish&quot; document calling for the upcoming September visit of Pope Benedict XVI to be marked by the launch of &quot;Benedict-branded&quot; condoms, the opening of an abortion clinic and the blessing of a same-sex marriage.

==== Coalition and Conservatives (2010–2020) ====

In 2012, the Foreign Office was criticised by Gerald Steinberg of the Jerusalem-based research institute NGO Monitor, saying that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development provided more than £500,000 in funding to Palestinian NGOs which he said &quot;promote political attacks on Israel&quot;. In response, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said &quot;we are very careful about who and what we fund. The objective of our funding is to support efforts to achieve a two-state solution. Funding a particular project for a limited period of time does not mean that we endorse every single action or public comment made by an NGO or by its employees.&quot;

In September 2012, the FCO and the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs signed a Memorandum of Understanding on diplomatic cooperation, which promotes the co-location of embassies, the joint provision of consular services, and common crisis response. The project has been criticised for further diminishing the UK&#x27;s influence in Europe.

In 2011, the then Foreign Secretary, William Hague, announced the government&#x27;s intention to open a number of new diplomatic posts in order to enhance the UK&#x27;s overseas network. As such, eight new embassies and six new consulates were opened around the world.

=== Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (2020–2022) ===
On 16 June 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the merger of the FCO with the Department for International Development. This was following the decision in the February 2020 cabinet reshuffle to give cross-departmental briefs to all junior ministers in the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office. The merger, which created the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, took place in September 2020 with a stated aim of ensuring that aid is spent &quot;in line with the UK&#x27;s priorities overseas&quot;. The merger was criticised by three former prime ministers – Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and David Cameron – with Cameron saying that it would mean &quot;less respect for the UK overseas&quot;. The chief executive of Save the Children, Kevin Watkins, called it &quot;reckless, irresponsible and a dereliction of UK leadership&quot; that &quot;threatens to reverse hard-won gains in child survival, nutrition and poverty&quot;.

In November 2021, it was reported that an employment tribunal had ruled that the FCDO had racially discriminated against Sonia Warner, a black senior civil servant, by treating her unfairly in a disciplinary process.

On 21 February 2022, UK Minister for Africa announced a new £74 million financial package to support women entrepreneurs across Nigeria, who own businesses and small and medium enterprises (SME&#x27;s).

In 2022, Maria Bamieh settled an employment claim against the Foreign Office for more than £400,000 shortly before her claim was due to be heard by an employment tribunal. She said that the Foreign Office failed to support her when she attempted to expose corruption at the EU&#x27;s rule of law mission (EULEX). The Foreign Office said : &quot;We have agreed to settle this long-running case without any admission of liability and continue to strongly refute these allegations.&quot;

==Diplomatic Academy==

Following a prior announcement by the then Foreign Secretary William Hague, the FCO opened the Diplomatic Academy in February 2015. The new centre, opened by the Duke of Cambridge, was established in order to create a cross-government centre of excellence for all civil servants working on international issues. The Diplomatic Academy serves to broaden the FCO&#x27;s network and engaged in more collaborative work with academic and diplomatic partners.

==Programme Funds==
The FCDO, through its core departmental budget, funds projects which are in line with its policy priorities outlined in its Single Departmental Plan. This funding includes both Official Development Assistance (ODA), and non-ODA funds. The funds are used for a wide range of projects and serve to support traditional diplomatic activities.

The FCDO plays a key role in delivering two, major UK government funds which work to support the government&#x27;s National Security Strategy and Aid Strategy.

* The Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) – Used to support cross-governmental efforts at reducing conflict-related risks in countries which the UK has important interests.
* The Prosperity Fund – Supports economic development and reform in the UK&#x27;s partner countries.
* The Global Innovation Fund – Invests in evidence-based innovations with the potential to positively impact the lives of people living on less than $5 per day.

The FCDO also supports a number of academic funds:
* Chevening scholarships
* Marshall scholarships
* Domestic Programme Fund
* Overseas Territories Environment and Climate Fund (Darwin Plus)
* Science and Innovation Network

=== 2021 aid budget cuts ===
In 2021, the UK government cut its overseas aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of Gross National Income despite UK legislation against such a move. These cuts, amounting to GBP 4 billion, reduced funding for humanitarian intervention by 44% in places like Yemen and Syria. It also cut funding for the fight against polio, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Funding for girls education worldwide was also reduced by 25%.

===Investments===
The Global Innovation Fund (GIF) announced the first two investments made under its &#x27;Innovating for Climate Resilience fund&#x27;, which was launched at COP26 with support from the UK&#x27;s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and in partnership with the Adaptation Research Alliance and the Global Resilience Partnership.

=== UNRWA funding ===
According to the FCDO and Foreign Secretary, the UK committed over £100 million in aid to the OPTs (Occupied Palestinian territories) for the 2023/2024 period, of which £35 million was specifically provided to UNRWA before it was suspended in January 2024. The funding was suspended after allegations surfaced that members of staff at UNRWA had been involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel in 2023; however, in July 2024, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced that the UK would resume funding to UNRWA.

== FCDO Services ==
In April 2006, a new executive agency was established, FCO Services (now FCDO Services), to provide corporate service functions. It moved to Trading Fund status in April 2008, so that it had the ability to provide services similar to those it already offers to the FCDO to other government departments and even to outside businesses.

As of 2017 Sir Simon Gass is Non-Executive Director and Chair of the FCDO Services Board.

FCDO Services operates globally in 250 destinations across 168 countries; with office regions covering Asia &amp; Pacific, Europe &amp; Central Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa and The Americas.

The services FCDO Services offer are &quot;Digital and Cloud&quot;, &quot;Securing your Buildings and Spaces&quot;, &quot;Logistics&quot;, &quot;Translation and Interpreting&quot; and &quot;Technical Security from UK NACE&quot;.

It is accountable to the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs, and provides secure support services to the FCDO, other government departments and foreign governments and bodies with which the UK has close links.

Since 2011, FCDO Services has been developing the Government Secure Application Environment (GSAE) on a secure cloud computing platform to support UK government organisations. It also manages the UK National Authority for Counter Eavesdropping (UK NACE) which helps protect UK assets from physical, electronic and cyber attack.

FCDO Services is a public sector organisation, it is not funded by the public and has to rely on the income it produces to meet its costs, by providing services on a commercial basis to customers both in the UK and throughout the world. Its accounting officer and chief executive is accountable to the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs and to Parliament, for the organisation&#x27;s performance and conduct.

== Global Response Office ==
The FCDO Global Response Office is based in an undisclosed location. It operates 24/7, every day of the year. It takes calls from British Nationals overseas, usually in emergency situations such as lost passports, hospitalisations, deaths and arrests.

== Library of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Records Department ==

The historical records of the FCO was transferred to a permanent loan to King’s College London in 2007 likely from the review to reduce due to cost reduction of non core activities at the FCO. The collection consists of 90,000 artifacts from the early 16th Century (mainly of Tudor England) to present.

==Buildings==

As well as embassies abroad, the FCDO has premises within the UK:
* Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building, Whitehall, King Charles St, London (abbreviated to KCS by FCDO staff)
*Abercrombie House, East Kilbride (abbreviated to AH by FCDO staff)
*Hanslope Park, Hanslope, Milton Keynes (abbreviated to HSP by FCDO staff). Location of FCDO Services, HMGCC and Technical Security Department of the UK Secret Intelligence Service)
* Lancaster House, St James&#x27;s, London. A mansion in the St James&#x27;s district in the West End of London which the Foreign Office holds on lease from the Crown. It is used primarily for hospitality, entertaining foreign dignitaries and housing the Government Wine Cellar.

The FCO formerly also used the following building:
* Old Admiralty Building (abbreviated to OAB), Whitehall, London

===Main Building===

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office occupies a building which originally provided premises for four separate government departments: the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Colonial Office, and the Home Office. Construction on the building began in 1861 and finished in 1868, on the plot of land bounded by Whitehall, King Charles Street, Horse Guards Road and Downing Street. The building was designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott. Its architecture is in the Italianate style; Scott had initially envisaged a Gothic design, but Lord Palmerston, then prime minister, insisted on a classical style. The English sculptors Henry Hugh Armstead and John Birnie Philip produced a number of allegorical figures (&quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Law&quot;, &quot;Commerce&quot;, etc.) for the exterior.

In 1925 the Foreign Office played host to the signing of the Locarno Treaties, aimed at reducing tension in Europe. The ceremony took place in a suite of rooms that had been designed for banqueting, which subsequently became known as the Locarno Suite. During the Second World War, the Locarno Suite&#x27;s fine furnishings were removed or covered up, and it became home to a Foreign Office code-breaking department.

Due to increasing numbers of staff, the offices became increasingly cramped and much of the fine Victorian interior was covered over—especially after the Second World War. In the 1960s, demolition was proposed, as part of major redevelopment plan for the area drawn up by the architect Leslie Martin. A subsequent public outcry prevented these proposals from ever being implemented. Instead, the Foreign Office became a Grade I listed building in 1970. In 1978, the Home Office moved to a new building, easing overcrowding.

With a new sense of the building&#x27;s historical value, it underwent a 17-year, £100 million restoration process, completed in 1997. The Locarno Suite, used as offices and storage since the Second World War, was fully restored for use in international conferences. The building is now open to the public each year over Open House Weekend.

In 2014 refurbishment to accommodate all Foreign and Commonwealth Office employees into one building was started by Mace.

==Devolution==
International relations are handled centrally from Whitehall on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom and its dependencies. However, the devolved administrations also maintain an overseas presence in the European Union, the U.S. and China alongside British diplomatic missions. These offices aim to promote their own economies and ensure that devolved interests are taken into account in British foreign policy. Ministers from devolved administrations can attend international negotiations when agreed with the British Government, e.g. EU fisheries negotiations.

<text>Xaviera Hollander (born 15 June 1943) is a Dutch former call girl, madam and author. She is best known for her best-selling memoir &quot;The Happy Hooker: My Own Story&quot;.

==Early life==
Hollander was born Xaviera de Vries in Surabaya, Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, which later became part of present-day Indonesia, to a Dutch Jewish physician father and a mother of French and German descent. She spent the first years of her life in a Japanese-run internment camp. After the end of Japanese occupation the family returned to the Netherlands.

In her early twenties she left Amsterdam for Johannesburg, where her stepsister lived. There she met and became engaged to American economist John Weber. When the engagement was broken off, she left South Africa for New York City.

==Career==
In 1968, she resigned from her job as a secretary in the Dutch consulate in New York City to become a call girl, making up to a night (equivalent to $ in ). A year later, she opened her own brothel, the Vertical Whorehouse, and soon became New York City&#x27;s leading madam. In 1971, she was arrested for prostitution by New York Police and forced to leave the United States.

===Author===
In 1971, Hollander published a memoir, &quot;The Happy Hooker: My Own Story.&quot; Robin Moore, who took Hollander&#x27;s dictation of the book&#x27;s contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy ghostwrote it. Hollander later wrote a number of other books and produced plays in Amsterdam. Her second book, &quot;Child No More&quot;, is the story of losing her mother. For 35 years she wrote an advice column for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, entitled &quot;Call Me Madam.&quot;

===Other ventures===
In the early 1970s, she recorded a primarily spoken-word album titled &quot;Xaviera!&quot; for the Canadian GRT Records label (GRT 9230-1033), on which she discussed her philosophy regarding sex and prostitution, sang a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Michelle&quot;, and recorded several simulated sexual encounters, including an example of phone sex, a threesome, and a celebrity encounter with guest &quot;vocal&quot; by Ronnie Hawkins. &quot;Xaviera&#x27;s Game&quot;, an erotic board game, was released in 1974 by Reiss Games, Inc. In 1975, she starred in the semi-autobiographical film &quot;&quot;. Beginning in 2005, she operated Xaviera&#x27;s Happy House, a bed-and-breakfast, in her Amsterdam home.

==Personal life==
For several years in the 1970s, Hollander lived in Toronto, where she married Frank Applebaum, a Canadian antique dealer, and was a regular fixture on the downtown scene. She mentioned a lover named John Drummond, with whom she partnered for many years, co-authoring two books, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Moving&quot; (1988) about their life together: &quot;I went there with, who for years had been the love of my life, John Drummond, a wild Scottish intellectual who, at times, liked his whisky, beer, and wines too much. We had great sex, often up to three times a day — all that and he was about 17 years older than me.&quot; During a 2018 interview, she revealed a darker side of the relationship with the man she called &quot;the love of my life!&quot;: &quot;The love of my life, 25 years ago, John Drummond, a brilliant and boisterous Scotsman with a &#x27;Thatcheresque&#x27; accent had, especially under the influence of a few scotches, beers, or wine, become quite destructive towards me. He is the only one who managed to deprive me of my self-esteem or identity, temporarily. He used to say that a British man’s way of saying &#x27;I love you&#x27; is to put his woman down.&quot; Drummond is listed as one of her husbands. Hollander claimed to have &quot;turned gay&quot; around 1997, establishing a long-term relationship with a Dutch poet called Dia. In January 2007, she married a Dutch man, Philip de Haan, in Amsterdam.

==Other works==
Hollander has been depicted in film five times:
* &quot;The Life and Times of Xaviera Hollander&quot; (1974, rated X) – Samantha McLaren
* &quot;The Best Part of a Man&quot; (1975) – Artistae Stiftung
* &quot;The Happy Hooker&quot; (1975) – Lynn Redgrave
* &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington&quot; (1977) – Joey Heatherton
* &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood&quot; (1980) – Martine Beswick

She appears in at least two films:
* &quot;&quot; (1975, Al Waxman) as Gabrielle
* &quot;Xaviera Hollander, the Happy Hooker: Portrait of a Sexual Revolutionary&quot;, a 2008 documentary directed, jointly produced, photographed and edited by Robert Dunlap. Hollander made additional contributions to the script.

In 1989, Hollander made an extended appearance on British discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside Mary Stott, Malcolm Bennett and Hans Eysenck, among others.

A musical about her life was written and composed by Richard Hansom and Warren Wills.

<text>The secretary of state for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, also known as the foreign secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with responsibility for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The role is seen as one of the most senior ministers in the UK Government and is a Great Office of State. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and National Security Council, and reports directly to the prime minister. 

The officeholder works alongside the other Foreign Office ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the Shadow Foreign Secretary. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee also evaluates the secretary of state&#x27;s performance.

The current foreign secretary is David Lammy. He was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on 5 July 2024.

==Responsibilities==
In contrast to what is generally known as a foreign minister in many other countries, the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s remit includes:

* British relations with foreign countries and governments
* Promotion of British interests abroad 
* Matters pertaining to the Commonwealth of Nations and the Overseas Territories
* Oversight for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)

==Residence==
The official residence of the foreign secretary is 1 Carlton Gardens, in London. The foreign secretary also has the use of Chevening House, a country house in Kent, South East England, and works from the Foreign Office in Whitehall.

==History==

The title of secretary of state in the government of England dates back to the early 17th century. The position of secretary of state for foreign affairs was created in the British governmental reorganisation of 1782, in which the Northern Department and Southern Department became the Foreign Office and Home Office respectively. The India Office was closed down in 1947. It had been a constituent predecessor department of the Foreign Office, like the Colonial Office and the Dominions Office.

Eventually, the position of secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth affairs came into existence in 1968 with the merger of the functions of secretary of state for foreign affairs and the secretary of state for Commonwealth affairs into a single department of state. Margaret Beckett, appointed in 2006 by Tony Blair, was the first woman to hold the post.

The post of secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs was created in 2020 when position holder Dominic Raab absorbed the responsibilities of the secretary of state for international development.

<text>In fluid mechanics, the Rayleigh number (, after Lord Rayleigh) for a fluid is a dimensionless number associated with buoyancy-driven flow, also known as free (or natural) convection. It characterises the fluid&#x27;s flow regime: a value in a certain lower range denotes laminar flow; a value in a higher range, turbulent flow. Below a certain critical value, there is no fluid motion and heat transfer is by conduction rather than convection. For most engineering purposes, the Rayleigh number is large, somewhere around 106 to 108.

The Rayleigh number is defined as the product of the Grashof number (), which describes the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity within a fluid, and the Prandtl number (), which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity: . Hence it may also be viewed as the ratio of buoyancy and viscosity forces multiplied by the ratio of momentum and thermal diffusivities: . It is closely related to the Nusselt number ().

==Derivation==
The Rayleigh number describes the behaviour of fluids (such as water or air) when the mass density of the fluid is non-uniform. The mass density differences are usually caused by temperature differences. Typically a fluid expands and becomes less dense as it is heated. Gravity causes denser parts of the fluid to sink, which is called convection. Lord Rayleigh studied the case of Rayleigh-Bénard convection. When the Rayleigh number, Ra, is below a critical value for a fluid, there is no flow and heat transfer is purely by conduction; when it exceeds that value, heat is transferred by natural convection.

When the mass density difference is caused by temperature difference, Ra is, by definition, the ratio of the time scale for diffusive thermal transport to the time scale for convective thermal transport at speed formula_1:

formula_2

This means the Rayleigh number is a type of Péclet number. For a volume of fluid of size formula_3 in all three dimensions and mass density difference formula_4, the force due to gravity is of the order formula_5, where formula_6 is acceleration due to gravity. From the Stokes equation, when the volume of fluid is sinking, viscous drag is of the order formula_7, where formula_8 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. When these two forces are equated, the speed formula_9. Thus the time scale for transport via flow is formula_10. The time scale for thermal diffusion across a distance formula_3 is formula_12, where formula_13 is the thermal diffusivity. Thus the Rayleigh number Ra is

formula_14

where we approximated the density difference formula_15 for a fluid of average mass density formula_16, thermal expansion coefficient formula_17 and a temperature difference formula_18 across distance formula_3.

The Rayleigh number can be written as the product of the Grashof number and the Prandtl number:
formula_20

==Classical definition==
For free convection near a vertical wall, the Rayleigh number is defined as:

formula_21

where:
*&quot;x&quot; is the characteristic length
*Ra&quot;x&quot; is the Rayleigh number for characteristic length &quot;x&quot;
*&quot;g&quot; is acceleration due to gravity
*&quot;β&quot; is the thermal expansion coefficient (equals to 1/&quot;T&quot;, for ideal gases, where &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature).
*formula_22 is the kinematic viscosity
*&quot;α&quot; is the thermal diffusivity
*&quot;Ts&quot; is the surface temperature
*&quot;T&quot;∞ is the quiescent temperature (fluid temperature far from the surface of the object)
*Gr&quot;x&quot; is the Grashof number for characteristic length &quot;x&quot;
*Pr is the Prandtl number

In the above, the fluid properties Pr, &quot;ν&quot;, &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are evaluated at the film temperature, which is defined as:

formula_23

For a uniform wall heating flux, the modified Rayleigh number is defined as:

formula_24

where:
*&quot;q″o&quot; is the uniform surface heat flux
*&quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity.

==Other applications==
===Solidifying alloys===
The Rayleigh number can also be used as a criterion to predict convectional instabilities, such as A-segregates, in the mushy zone of a solidifying alloy. The mushy zone Rayleigh number is defined as:

formula_25

where:
*&quot;K&quot; is the mean permeability (of the initial portion of the mush)
*&quot;L&quot; is the characteristic length scale 
*&quot;α&quot; is the thermal diffusivity 
*&quot;ν&quot; is the kinematic viscosity 
*&quot;R&quot; is the solidification or isotherm speed.

A-segregates are predicted to form when the Rayleigh number exceeds a certain critical value. This critical value is independent of the composition of the alloy, and this is the main advantage of the Rayleigh number criterion over other criteria for prediction of convectional instabilities, such as Suzuki criterion.

Torabi Rad et al. showed that for steel alloys the critical Rayleigh number is 17. Pickering et al. explored Torabi Rad&#x27;s criterion, and further verified its effectiveness. Critical Rayleigh numbers for lead–tin and nickel-based super-alloys were also developed.

===Porous media===
The Rayleigh number above is for convection in a bulk fluid such as air or water, but convection can also occur when the fluid is inside and fills a porous medium, such as porous rock saturated with water. Then the Rayleigh number, sometimes called the Rayleigh-Darcy number, is different. In a bulk fluid, i.e., not in a porous medium, from the Stokes equation, the falling speed of a domain of size formula_3 of liquid formula_9. In porous medium, this expression is replaced by that from Darcy&#x27;s law formula_28, with formula_29 the permeability of the porous medium. The Rayleigh or Rayleigh-Darcy number is then

formula_30

This also applies to A-segregates, in the mushy zone of a solidifying alloy.

===Geophysical applications===
In geophysics, the Rayleigh number is of fundamental importance: it indicates the presence and strength of convection within a fluid body such as the Earth&#x27;s mantle. The mantle is a solid that behaves as a fluid over geological time scales. The Rayleigh number for the Earth&#x27;s mantle due to internal heating alone, Ra&quot;H&quot;, is given by:

formula_31

where:
*&quot;H&quot; is the rate of radiogenic heat production per unit mass
*&quot;η&quot; is the dynamic viscosity
*&quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity
*&quot;D&quot; is the depth of the mantle.

A Rayleigh number for bottom heating of the mantle from the core, Ra&quot;T&quot;, can also be defined as:

formula_32

where:
*Δ&quot;T&quot;sa is the superadiabatic temperature difference (the superadiabatic temperature difference is the actual temperature difference minus the temperature difference in a fluid whose entropy gradient is zero, but has the same profile of the other variables appearing in the equation of state) between the reference mantle temperature and the core–mantle boundary
*&quot;CP&quot; is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.

High values for the Earth&#x27;s mantle indicates that convection within the Earth is vigorous and time-varying, and that convection is responsible for almost all the heat transported from the deep interior to the surface.

<text>Paul Karl Feyerabend (; ; January 13, 1924 – February 11, 1994) was an Austrian philosopher best known for his work in the philosophy of science. He started his academic career as lecturer in the philosophy of science at the University of Bristol (1955–1958); afterwards, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught for three decades (1958–1989). At various points in his life, he held joint appointments at the University College London (1967–1970), the London School of Economics (1967), the FU Berlin (1968), Yale University (1969), the University of Auckland (1972, 1975), the University of Sussex (1974), and, finally, the ETH Zurich (1980–1990). He gave lectures and lecture series at the University of Minnesota (1958–1962), Stanford University (1967), the University of Kassel (1977) and the University of Trento (1992).

Feyerabend&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Against Method&quot; (1975), wherein he argued that there are no universally valid methodological rules for scientific inquiry. He also wrote on topics related to the politics of science in several essays and in his book &quot;Science in a Free Society&quot; (1978). Feyerabend&#x27;s later works include &quot;Wissenschaft als Kunst&quot; (Science as Art) (1984), &quot;Farewell to Reason&quot; (1987), &quot;Three Dialogues on Knowledge&quot; (1991), and &quot;Conquest of Abundance&quot; (released posthumously in 1999) which collect essays from the 1970s until Feyerabend&#x27;s death in 1994. The uncompleted draft of an earlier work was released posthumously, in 2009, as &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; (English translation of 2016 &quot;Philosophy of Nature&quot;). This work contains Feyerabend&#x27;s reconstruction of the history of natural philosophy from the Homeric Period until the mid-20th century. In these works and other publications, Feyerabend wrote about numerous issues at the interface between history and philosophy of science and ethics, ancient philosophy, philosophy of art, political philosophy, medicine, and physics. Feyerabend&#x27;s final work was his autobiography, entitled &quot;Killing Time&quot;, which he completed on his deathbed. Feyerabend&#x27;s extensive correspondence and other materials from his &quot;Nachlass&quot; continue to be published.

Paul Feyerabend is recognized as one of the most important philosophers of science of the 20th century. In a 2010 poll, he was ranked as the 8th most significant philosopher of science. He is often mentioned alongside Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and N.R. Hanson as a crucial figure in the historical turn in philosophy of science, and his work on scientific pluralism has been markedly influential on the Stanford School and on much contemporary philosophy of science. Feyerabend was also a significant figure in the sociology of scientific knowledge. His lectures were extremely well-attended, attracting international attention. His multifaceted personality is eloquently summarized in his obituary by Ian Hacking: &quot;Humanists, in my old-fashioned sense, need to be part of both arts and sciences. Paul Feyerabend was a humanist. He was also fun.&quot;

In line with this humanistic interpretation and the concerns apparent in his later work, the Paul K. Feyerabend Foundation was founded in 2006 in his honor. The Foundation &quot;...promotes the empowerment and wellbeing of disadvantaged human communities. By strengthening intra and inter-community solidarity, it strives to improve local capacities, promote the respect of human rights, and sustain cultural and biological diversity.&quot; In 1970, the Loyola University of Chicago assigned to Feyerabend its Doctor of Humane Letters Degree &quot;honoris caus&quot;a. Asteroid (22356) Feyerabend is named after him.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Feyerabend was born in 1924 in Vienna. His paternal grandfather was the illegitimate child of a housekeeper, Helena Feierabend, who introduced the &#x27;y&#x27; into &#x27;Feyerabend.&#x27; His father, originally from Carinthia, was an officer in the merchant marine in World War I in Istria and a civil servant in Vienna until he died due to complications from a stroke. His mother&#x27;s family came from Stockerau. She was a seamstress and died on July 29, 1943 by suicide. The family lived in a working-class neighborhood (Wolfganggasse) where gypsy musicians, over-the-top relatives, illusionists, sudden accidents, and heated quarrels were part of everyday life. In his autobiography Feyerabend remembers a childhood in which magic and mysterious events were separated by dreary &#x27;commonplace&#x27; only by a slight change of perspective — a theme later found in his work. 

Raised Catholic, Feyerabend attended the Realgymnasium, where he excelled as a (top student), especially in physics and mathematics. At 13 he built, with his father, his own telescope, which allowed him to become an observer for the Swiss Institute of Solar Research. He was inspired by his teacher Oswald Thomas and developed a reputation as knowing more than the teachers. A voracious reader, especially of mystery and adventure novels and plays, Feyerabend casually stumbled onto philosophy. Works by Plato, Descartes, and Büchner awoke his interest in the dramatic power of argument. He later encountered philosophy of science through the works of Mach, Eddington, and Dingler and was fascinated by Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and his depiction of the &quot;lonely man.&quot; During high school, Feyerabend also began his lifelong interest in singing. He sang in a choir under Leo Lehner and was later introduced to opera and inspired by performances from George Oeggl and Hans Hotter. He later trained formally under the tutelage of Adolf Vogel and others.

===Nazi Occupation of Austria and World War II===
Feyerabend&#x27;s parents were both welcoming of the Anschluss. His mother was entranced by Hitler&#x27;s voice and demeanor and his father was similarly impressed by Hitler&#x27;s charisma and later joined the Nazi Party. Feyerabend himself was unmoved by the Anschluss or World War II, which he saw as an inconvenience that got in the way of reading and astronomy. Feyerabend was in the Hitler Youth as a part of compulsory policies and sometimes rebelled, praising the British or claiming he had to leave a meeting to attend Mass, and sometimes conformed, bringing in members who missed meetings. After the war, Feyerabend recounts that he &quot;did not accept the aims of Nazism&quot; and that he &quot;hardly knew what they were.&quot; Later, he wondered why he did not see the occupation and war as moral problems. They were just &quot;inconveniences&quot; and his reactions—recalled with uncommon honesty—were suggested by accidental moods and circumstances rather than by a &quot;well defined outlook&quot;.

After graduating from high school, in April 1942 Feyerabend was drafted into the German Arbeitsdienst (working service), received basic training in Pirmasens, and was assigned to a unit in Quelerne en Bas, near Brest. He described the work he did during that period as monotonous: &quot;we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again.&quot; After a short leave he volunteered for officer school. In his autobiography he writes that he hoped the war would be over by the time he had finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the Eastern Front, was decorated with an Iron cross, and attained the rank of lieutenant. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing Red Army, Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One hit him in the spine which left him wheel-chaired for a year and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He later learned to walk with a crutch, but was left impotent and plagued by intermittent bouts of severe pain for the rest of his life.

===Post-WWII, PhD, and early career in England===

After getting wounded in action, Feyerabend was hospitalized in and around Weimar where he spent more than a year recovering and where he witnessed the end of the war and Soviet occupation. The mayor of Apolda gave him a job in the education sector and he, then still on two crutches, worked in public entertainment including writing speeches, dialogues, and plays. Later, at the music academy in Weimar, he was granted a scholarship and food stamps and took lessons in Italian, harmony, singing, enunciation, and piano. He also joined the Cultural Association for the Democratic Reform of Germany, the only association he ever joined.

As Feyerabend moved back to Vienna, he was permitted to pursue a PhD at the University of Vienna. He originally intended to study physics, astronomy, and mathematics (while continuing to practice singing) but decided to study history and sociology to understand his wartime experiences. He became dissatisfied, however, and soon transferred to physics and studied astronomy, especially observational astronomy and perturbation theory, as well as differential equations, nuclear physics, algebra, and tensor analysis. He took classes with Hans Thirring, Hans Leo Przibram, and Felix Ehrenhaft. He also had a small role in a film directed by G.W. Pabst and joined the Austrian College where he frequented their speaker series in Alpbach. Here, in 1948, Feyerabend met Karl Popper who made a positive impression on him. He was also influenced by the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht, who invited him to be his assistant at the East Berlin State Opera, but Feyerabend turned down the offer. A possible reason was Feyerabend&#x27;s instinctive aversion to group thinking, which, for instance, made him staunchly refuse joining any Marxist Leninist organizations despite having friends there and despite voting communist in the early Austrian election.

In Vienna, Feyerabend organized the Kraft Circle, where students and faculty discussed scientific theories (he recalled five meetings about non-Einsteinian interpretations of the Lorentz transformations) and often focused on the problem of the existence of the external world. There, he also met Elizabeth Anscombe who, in turn, led Feyerabend to meet Ludwig Wittgenstein. In the years between 1949 and 1952, Feyerabend traveled in Europe and exchanged with philosophers and scientists, including Niels Bohr. He also married his first wife (Jacqueline,‘to be able to travel together and share hotel rooms’), divorced, and became involved in various romantic affairs, despite his physical impotence. Cycles of amorous excitement, dependence, isolation, and renewed dependence characterized his relations with women for a good part of his life. He drew great pleasure from opera, which he could attend even five days a week, and from singing (he resumed his lessons even if his crutch excluded an operatic career). Attending opera and singing (he had an excellent tenor voice) remained constant passions throughout his life. In 1951, he earned his doctorate with a thesis on basic statements () under Victor Kraft&#x27;s supervision.

In 1952-53, thanks to a British Council scholarship, he continued his studies at the London School of Economics where he focused on Bohm&#x27;s and von Neumann&#x27;s work in quantum mechanics and on Wittgenstein&#x27;s later works, including &quot;Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. He also attended Popper&#x27;s lectures on logic and scientific method and became convinced that induction was irrational. During this time, he developed an early version of his theory of incommensurability, which he thought was a triviality, and was encouraged to develop it further by Popper, H.L.A. Hart, Peter Geach, and Georg Henrik von Wright. He met many others including J.O. Wisdom, A. I. Sabra, Joseph Agassi, and Martin Buber. After his return to Vienna, Feyerabend met often with Viktor Frankl and with Arthur Pap, who offered him a position as his research assistant at the University of Vienna. Thanks to Pap, he became acquainted with Herbert Feigl. During this time, Feyerabend worked on the German translation of Popper&#x27;s &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; and often met with Herbert Feigl and Philipp Frank. Franck argued that Aristotle was a better empiricist than Copernicus, an argument that became influential on Feyerabend&#x27;s primary case study in &quot;Against Method&quot;.

In 1955, Feyerabend successfully applied for a lectureship at the University of Bristol with letters of reference from Karl Popper and Erwin Schrödinger and started his academic career. In 1956, he met Mary O’Neill, who became his second wife – another passionate love affair that soon ended in separation. After presenting a paper on the measurement problem at the 1957 symposium of the Colston Research Society in Bristol, Feyerabend was invited to the University of Minnesota by Michael Scriven. There, he exchanged with Herbert Feigl, Ernst Nagel, Wilfred Sellars, Hilary Putnam, and Adolf Grünbaum. Soon afterwards, he met Gilbert Ryle who said of Feyerabend that he was &quot;clever and mischievous like a barrel of monkeys.&quot;

===Berkeley, Zurich and retirement===

Feyerabend&#x27;s primary academic appointment was at the University of California at Berkeley. While he was hired there in 1958, he spent part of his first years in the United States at the University of Minnesota, working closely with Herbert Feigl and Paul Meehl after rejecting a job offer from Cornell University. In California, he met and befriended Rudolf Carnap, whom he described as a &quot;wonderful person, gentle, understanding, not at all as dry as would appear from some (not all) of his writings&quot;, and Alfred Tarski, among others. He also married for a third time. At Berkeley, Feyerabend mostly lectured on general philosophy and philosophy of science. During the student revolution, he also lectured on revolutionaries (Lenin, Mao, Mill, and Cohn-Bendit). He often invited students and outsiders, including Lenny Bruce and Malcolm X, to guest lecture on a variety of issues including gay rights, racism, and witchcraft. He supported the students but did not support student strikes. John Searle attempted to get Feyerabend fired from his position for hosting lectures off-campus. 

As Feyerabend was highly marketable in academia and personally restless, he kept accepting and leaving university appointments while holding more &#x27;stable&#x27; positions in Berkeley and London. For instance, starting in 1968, he spent two terms at Yale, which he describes as boring, feeling that most there did not have &quot;ideas of their own.&quot; There, however, he did meet Jeffrey Bub, and the two became friends. He remembered attempting to give everyone in graduate seminars &#x27;As&#x27;, which was strongly resisted by the students at Yale. He also asked students in his undergraduate classes to build something useful, like furniture or short films, rather than term papers or exams. In the same years, he accepted a new chair in philosophy of science in Berlin and a professorship in Auckland (New Zealand). In Berlin, he faced a &#x27;problem&#x27; as he was assigned two secretaries, fourteen assistants and an impressive office with antique furniture and an anteroom, which &quot;gave him the willies&quot;: 

While teaching at the London School of Economics, Imre Lakatos often &#x27;jumped in&#x27; during Feyerabend&#x27;s lectures and started defending rationalist arguments. The two &quot;differed in outlook, character and ambitions&quot; but became very close friends. They often met at Lakatos&#x27; luxurious house in Turner Woods, which included an impressive library. Lakatos had bought the house for representation purposes and Feyerabend often made gentle fun of it, choosing to help Lakatos&#x27; wife to wash dishes after dinner rather than engaging in scholarly debates with &#x27;important guests&#x27; in the library. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry&quot; – Imre would say to his guests – &quot;Paul is an anarchist&quot;. Lakatos and Feyerabend planned to write a dialogue volume in which Lakatos would defend a rationalist view of science and Feyerabend would attack it. This planned joint publication was put to an end by Lakatos&#x27;s sudden death in 1974. Feyerabend was devastated by it. 

Feyerabend had become more and more aware of the limitation of theories – no matter how well conceived – compared with the detailed, idiosyncratic issues encountered in the course of scientific practice. The &quot;poverty of abstract philosophical reasoning&quot; became one of the &quot;feelings&quot; that motivated him to pull together the collage of observations and ideas that he had conceived for the project with Imre Lakatos, whose first edition was published in 1975 as Against Method. Feyerabend added to it some outrageous passages and terms, including about an &#x27;anarchistic theory of knowledge&#x27;, for the sake of provocation and in memory of Imre. He mostly wanted to encourage attention to scientific practice and common sense rather than to the empty &#x27;clarifications&#x27; of logicians, but his views were not appreciated by the intellectuals who were then directing traffic in the philosophical community, who tended to isolate him. Against Method also suggested that &quot;approaches not tied to scientific institutions&quot; may have value, and that scientists should work under the control of the larger public-- views not appreciated by all scientists either. Some gave him the dubious fame of &#x27;worst enemy of science&#x27;. Moreover, Feyerabend was aware that &quot;scientific jargon&quot; – read literally, world for word, could reveal not only &quot;nonsense&quot;, as found out by John Austin, &quot;but also inhumanity. With the Dadaists Feyerabend realized that &quot;the language of philosophers, politicians, theologians&quot; had similarities with &quot;brute in-articulations&quot;. He exposed that by &quot;avoiding scholarly ways of presenting a view&quot; and using &quot;common locutions and the language of show business and pulp instead&quot;. 

In his autobiography, Feyerabend describes how the community of &#x27;intellectuals&#x27; seemed to &quot;...take a slight interest in me, lift me up to his own eye level, took a brief look at me, and drop me again. After making me appear more important than I ever thought I was, it enumerated my shortcomings and put me back on my place.&quot; This treatment left him all but indifferent. During the years following the publication of Against Method and the critical reviews that followed – some of which as scathing as superficial – he suffered from bouts of ill health and depression. While medical doctors could not do anything for him, some help came from alternative therapies (e.g., Chinese herbal medicines, acupuncture, diet, massage). He also kept moving among academic appointments (Auckland, Brighton, Kassel). 

Towards the end of the 1970s, Feyerabend was assigned a position as Professor of Philosophy at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich. There, he ran well attended lectures, including on the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, &quot;Timeaus&quot;, and Aristotle&#x27;s physics as well as public debates and seminars for the non-academic public. Through the 1980s, he enjoyed alternating between posts at ETH Zurich and UC Berkeley. In 1983, he also met Grazia Borrini, who would become his fourth and final wife. She heard of Feyerabend from train passengers in Europe and attended his seminar in Berkeley. They were married in 1989, when they both decided to try to have children, for which they needed medical assistance due to Feyerabend&#x27;s war injury. Feyerabend claims that he finally understood the meaning of love because of Grazia. This had a dramatic impact on his worldview (&quot;Today it seems to me that love and friendship play a central role and that without them even the noblest achievements and the most fundamental principles remain pale, empty and dangerous&quot;). It is also in those years that he developed what he describes as &quot;...a trace of a moral character”. 

In 1989, Feyerabend voluntarily left Berkeley for good. After his mandatory retirement also from Zurich, in 1990, he continued to give lectures, including often in Italy, published papers and book reviews for &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, and worked on his posthumously released &quot;Conquest of Abundance&quot; and on his autobiography-- the volumes for which writing became for him &quot;a &#x27;pleasurable activity&#x27;, almost like composing a work of art&quot;. He remained based in Meilen, in Switzerland, but often spent time with his wife in Rome. After a short period of suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, he died in 1994 at the Genolier Clinic, overlooking Lake Geneva, Switzerland. He had just turned 70. He is buried in his family grave, in Vienna.

==Thought==
===Philosophy of science===
====Kraft Circle, hidden variables, and no-go proofs====
During Feyerabend&#x27;s PhD, he retrospectively describes himself as a &quot;raving positivist.&quot; He was the head organizer of the &#x27;Kraft circle&#x27; which discussed many issues in the foundations of physics and on the nature of basic statements, which was the topic of his dissertation. In 1948, Feyerabend wrote a short paper in response to Schrödinger&#x27;s paper &quot;On the Peculiarity of the Scientific Worldview.&quot; Here, Feyerabend argued that Schrödinger&#x27;s demand that scientific theories present are &quot;Anschaulich&quot; (i.e., intuitively visualizable) is too restrictive. Using the example of the development of Bohr&#x27;s atomic theory, he claims that theories that are originally unvisualizable develop new ways of making phenomena visualizable. His unpublished paper, &quot;Philosophers and the Physicists,&quot; argues for a naturalistic understanding of philosophy where philosophy is &quot;petrified&quot; without physics and physics is &quot;liable to become dogmatic&quot; without philosophy.

Feyerabend&#x27;s early career is also defined by a focus on technical issues within the philosophy of quantum mechanics. Feyerabend argues that von Neumann&#x27;s &#x27;no-go&#x27; proof only shows that the Copenhagen interpretation is consistent with the fundamental theorems of quantum mechanics but it does not logically follow from them. Therefore, causal theories of quantum mechanics (like Bohmian mechanics) are not logically ruled out by von Neumann&#x27;s proof. After meeting David Bohm in 1957, Feyerabend became an outspoken defender of Bohm&#x27;s interpretation and argued that hidden variable approaches to quantum mechanics should be pursued to increase the testability of the Copenhagen Interpretation.

Feyerabend also provided his own solution to the measurement problem in 1957, although he soon came to abandon this solution. He tries to show that von Neumann&#x27;s measurement scheme can be made consistent without the collapse postulate. His solution anticipates later developments of decoherence theory.

====Empiricism, pluralism, and incommensurability====
Much of Feyerabend&#x27;s work from the late 1950s until the late 1960s was devoted to methodological issues in science. Specifically, Feyerabend offers several criticisms of empiricism and offers his own brand of theoretical pluralism. One such criticism concerns the distinction between observational and theoretical terms. If an observational term is understood as one whose acceptance can be determined by immediate perception, then what counts as &#x27;observational&#x27; or &#x27;theoretical&#x27; changes throughout history as our patterns of habituation change and our ability to directly perceive entities evolve. On another definition, observation terms are those that can be known directly and with certainty whereas theoretical terms are hypothetical. Feyerabend argues that all statements are hypothetical, since the act of observation requires theories to justify its veridicality.

To replace empiricism, Feyerabend advances theoretical pluralism as a methodological rule for scientific progress. On this view, proliferating new theories increases the testability of previous theories that might be well-established by observations. This is because some tests cannot be unearthed without the invention of an alternative theory. One example Feyerabend uses repeatedly is Brownian motion which was not a test of the second law of classical thermodynamics. To become a test, it must be first explained by an alternative theory – namely, Einstein&#x27;s kinetic theory of gases – which formally contradicts the accepted theory. By proliferating new theories, we increase the number of indirect tests of our theories. This makes theoretical pluralism central to Feyerabend&#x27;s conception of scientific method.

Eventually, Feyerabend&#x27;s pluralism incorporates what he calls the &quot;principle of tenacity.&quot; The principle of tenacity allows scientists to pursue theories regardless of the problems it may possess. Examples of problems might include recalcitrant evidence, theoretical paradoxes, mathematical complexity, or inconsistency with neighboring theories. Feyerabend learned of this idea from Kuhn, who argued that without tenacity all theories would have been prematurely abandoned. This principle complements the &quot;principle of proliferation&quot;, which admonishes us to invent as many theories as possible, so that those invented theories can become plausible rivals.

In his &quot;Empiricism, Reduction, and Experience&quot; (1962), Feyerabend outlines his theory of incommensurability. His theory appears in the same year as Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s discussion of incommensurability in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, but the two were developed independently. According to Feyerabend, some instances of theory change in the history of science do not involve a successor theory that retains its predecessor as a limiting case. In other words, scientific progress does not always involve producing a theory that is a generalization of the previous theory. This is because the successor theory is formally inconsistent with the previous theory attempting to explain the same domain of phenomena. Moreover, the two theories do not share the same empirical content and, therefore, cannot be compared by the same set of observation statements. For example, Buridan&#x27;s impetus principle has no analogue in classical mechanics. The closest analogue would be momentum, but the two notions are qualitatively distinct (impetus causes motion whereas momentum is the result of motion). Furthermore, Feyerabend claims that there can be no &#x27;parallel notion&#x27; of impetus that is explicable within classical mechanics. Any parallel notion that gives non-zero values must assume that inertial movements happen in a resisting medium, which is inconsistent with the assumption in classical mechanics that inertial motion happens in empty space. Therefore, &quot;the concept of impetus, as fixed by the usage established in the impetus theory, cannot be defined in a reasonable way within Newton&#x27;s theory [since] the usage involves laws... which are inconsistent with Newtonian physics.&quot; In response to criticisms of Feyerabend&#x27;s position, he clarifies that there are other ways in which theories can be compared such as comparing the structures of infinite sets of elements to detect isomorphisms, comparing &quot;local grammars&quot; , or building a model of a theory within its alternative. Incommensurability, however, only arises if scientists make the choice to interpret theories realistically. Theories interpreted instrumentally cannot be incommensurable, on Feyerabend&#x27;s view.

Feyerabend&#x27;s pluralism is supported by what he calls the &#x27;pragmatic theory of meaning&#x27; which he developed in his dissertation. Here, he explicitly resuscitates Neurath and Carnap&#x27;s physicalism from the 1930s. According to the pragmatic theory of meaning, language consists of two parts. First, there is the characteristic of a language which is a series of noises produced under specific experimental situations. On Feyerabend&#x27;s views, human observation has no special epistemic status – it is just another kind of measuring apparatus. The characteristic of a language comes from placing observers in the presence of phenomena and instructing them to make specific noises when a phenomenon is sensed. These noises, to become statements (or parts of a language with meaning), must then be interpreted. Interpretation comes from a theory, whose meaning is given is learned though not necessarily through ostension. Once we have an interpreted characteristic, we have statements that can be used to test theories.

====Departure from Popper====
Beginning in at least the mid-to-late 1960s, Feyerabend distanced himself from Popper both professionally and intellectually. There is a great amount of controversy about the source and nature of Feyerabend&#x27;s distancing from Popper. Joseph Agassi claims that it was caused by the student revolutions at Berkeley, which somehow promoted Feyerabend&#x27;s move towards epistemological anarchism defended in the 1970s. Feyerabend&#x27;s friend Roy Edgley claims that Feyerabend became distanced from Popper as early as the mid-1950s, when he went to Bristol and then Berkeley and was more influenced by Thomas Kuhn and the Marxism of David Bohm.

Feyerabend&#x27;s first paper that explicitly repudiates Popper is his two-part paper on Niels Bohr&#x27;s conception of complementarity. According to Popper, Bohr and his followers accepted complementarity as a consequence of accepting positivism. Popper was the founder of the theory of falsification, which Feyerabend was very critical of. He meant that no science is perfect, and therefore cannot be proven false. Once one repudiates positivism as a philosophical doctrine, Popper claims, one undermines the principle of complementarity. Against this, Feyerabend claims that Bohr was a pluralist who attempting to pursue a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics (the Bohr-Kramer-Slater conjecture) but abandoned it due to its conflict with the Bothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon experiments. While Feyerabend concedes that many of Bohr&#x27;s followers (notably, Leon Rosenfeld) accept the principle of complementarity as a philosophical dogma, he contends that Bohr accepted complementarity because it was entangled with an empirically adequate physical theory of microphysics.

====Anarchist phase====

In the 1970s, Feyerabend outlines an anarchistic theory of knowledge captured by the slogan &#x27;anything goes&#x27;. The phrase &#x27;anything goes&#x27; first appears in Feyerabend&#x27;s paper &quot;Experts in a Free Society&quot; and is more famously proclaimed at the end of the first chapter of &quot;Against Method&quot;. Feyerabend&#x27;s epistemological anarchism has been the source of contention amongst scholars. Some claim that epistemological anarchism is not a positive view of scientific method, but the conclusion of a reductio ad absurdum of &#x27;rationalism&#x27; (the view that there are universal and unchanging rational rules for scientific reasoning). In Feyerabend&#x27;s words, anything goes&#x27; is not a &#x27;principle&#x27; I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history.&quot; On this interpretation, Feyerabend aims to show that no methodological view can be held as fixed and universal and therefore the only fixed and universal rule would be &quot;anything goes&quot; which would be useless.

On another interpretation, Feyerabend is claiming that scientists should be unscrupulous opportunists who choose methodological rules that make sense within a given situation. On this view, there are no &#x27;universal&#x27; methodological rules but there are local rules of scientific reasoning that should be followed. The use of the phrase &#x27;opportunism&#x27; comes from Einstein which denotes an inquirer who changes their beliefs and techniques to fit the situation at hand, rather than pre-judge individual events with well-defined methods or convictions. Feyerabend thinks that this is justified because &quot;no two individuals (no two scientists; no two pieces of apparatus; no two situations) are ever exactly alike and that procedures should therefore be able to vary also.&quot;

On a third interpretation, epistemological anarchism is a generalization of his pluralism that he had been developing throughout the 1950s and 1960s. On this view, Feyerabend did not have an anarchist &#x27;turn&#x27; but merely generalized his positive philosophy on a more general view. Epistemological anarchism is synonymous with a pluralism without limits, where one can proliferate any theory one wishes and one can tenaciously develop any theory for as long as one wishes. Relatedly, because methods depend on empirical theories for their utility, one can employ any method one wishes in attempt to make novel discoveries. This does not mean that we can believe anything we wish – our beliefs must still stand critical scrutiny – but that scientific inquiry has no intrinsic constraints. The only constraints on scientific practice are those that are materially forced upon scientists. Moreover, Feyerabend also thought that theoretical anarchism was desirable because it was more humanitarian than other systems of organization, by not imposing rigid rules on scientists.

For is it not possible that science as we know it today, or a &quot;search for the truth&quot; in the style of traditional philosophy, will create a monster? Is it not possible that an objective approach that frowns upon personal connections between the entities examined will harm people, turn them into miserable, unfriendly, self-righteous mechanisms without charm or humour? &quot;Is it not possible,&quot; asks Kierkegaard, &quot;that my activity as an objective [or critico-rational] observer of nature will weaken my strength as a human being?&quot; I suspect the answer to many of these questions is affirmative and I believe that a reform of the sciences that makes them more anarchic and more subjective (in Kierkegaard&#x27;s sense) is urgently needed. &quot;Against Method&quot; (3rd ed.). p. 154.

According to this &quot;existential criteria&quot;, methodological rules can be tested by the kinds of lives that they suggest. Feyerabend&#x27;s position was seen as radical, because it implies that philosophy can neither succeed in providing a general description of science, nor in devising a method for differentiating products of science from non-scientific entities like myths.

To support his position that methodological rules generally do not contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend analyzed counterexamples to the claim that (good) science operates according to the methodological standards invoked by philosophers during Feyerabend&#x27;s time (namely, inductivism and falsificationism). Starting from episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the Copernican Revolution), he argued that these episodes violated all common prescriptive rules of science. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution. His primary case study is Galileo&#x27;s hypothesis that the Earth rotates on its axis.

====Metaphysics of abundance====

In Feyerabend&#x27;s later work, especially in &quot;Conquest of Abundance&quot;, Feyerabend articulates a metaphysical theory in which the universe around us is &#x27;abundant&#x27; in the sense that it allows for many realities to be accepted simultaneously. According to Feyerabend, the world, or &#x27;Being&#x27; as he calls it, is pliable enough that it can change in accordance with the ways in which we causally engage with the world. In laboratories, for example, scientists do not simply passively observe phenomena but actively intervene to create phenomena with the help of various techniques. This makes entities like &#x27;electrons&#x27; or &#x27;genes&#x27; real because they can be stably used in a life that one may live. Since our choices about what lives we should live depend on our ethics and our desires, what is &#x27;real&#x27; depends on what plays a role in a life that we think is worth living. Feyerabend calls this &#x27;Aristotle&#x27;s principle&#x27; as he believes that Aristotle held the same view.

Being, therefore, is pliable enough to be manipulated and transformed to make many realities that conform to different ways of living in the world. However, not all realities are possible. Being resists our attempts to live with it in certain ways and so not any entity can be declared as &#x27;real&#x27; by mere stipulation. In Feyerabend&#x27;s words,

 &quot;I do not assert that any [form of life] will lead to a well-articulated and livable world. The material humans...face must be approached in the right way. It offers resistance; some constructions (some incipient cultures - cargo cults, for example) find no point of attack in it and simply collapse&quot; 

This leads Feyerabend to defend the disunity of the world thesis that was articulated by many members of the Stanford School. There are many realities that cannot be reduced to one common &#x27;Reality&#x27; because they contain different entities and processes. This makes it possible that some realities contain gods while others are purely materialistic, although Feyerabend thought that materialistic worldviews were deficient in many unspecified ways.

Feyerabend&#x27;s ideas about a &#x27;conquest of abundance&#x27; were first voiced in &quot;Farewell to Reason&quot;, and the writings of the late 1980s and early 1990s experiment with different ways of expressing the idea, including many of the articles and essays published as part two of &quot;Conquest of Abundance&quot;. A new theme of this later work is the ineffability of Being, which Feyerabend developed with reference to the work of the Christian mystic, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The remarks on ineffability in &quot;Conquest of Abundance&quot; are too unsystematic to definitively interpret.

===Philosophy of mind===
====Eliminative materialism====
Along with a number of mid-20th century philosophers (most notably, Wilfrid Sellars, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Richard Rorty), Feyerabend was influential in the development of eliminative materialism, a radical position in the philosophy of mind. On some definitions, eliminative materialism holds that all that exists are material processes and, therefore, our ordinary, common-sense understanding of the mind (&quot;folk psychology&quot;) is false. It is described by a modern proponent, Paul Churchland, as follows:
 &quot;Eliminative materialism is the thesis that our commonsense conception of psychological phenomena constitutes a radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that both the principles and the ontology of that theory will eventually be displaced, rather than smoothly reduced, by completed neuroscience.&quot; 

Feyerabend wrote on eliminative materialism in three short papers published in the early sixties. The most common interpretation of these papers is that he was an early forerunner of eliminative materialism. This was a major influence on Patricia and Paul Churchland. As Keeley observes, &quot;[Paul Churchland] has spent much of his career carrying the Feyerabend mantle forward.&quot; More recent scholarship claims that Feyerabend was never an eliminative materialist and merely aimed to show that common criticisms against eliminative materialism were methodologically faulty. Specifically, on this interpretation, while Feyerabend defended eliminative materialism from arguments from acquaintance and our intuitive understanding of the mind but did not explicitly claim that eliminative materialism was true. In doing so, Feyerabend leaves open the possibility that dualism is true but this would have to be shown through scientific arguments rather than philosophical stipulation. In any case, Feyerabend explicitly disavows materialism in his later philosophical writings.

====Cognitive plasticity====
Feyerabend briefly entertains and is sympathetic to the hypothesis that there are no innate, cognitive limitations imposed upon the human brain. By this he meant that there were no intrinsic limitations about what we can conceive or understand. Spread out through Feyerabend&#x27;s writings are passages that suggest that this is confirmed by evidence at the time in the mind-brain sciences. Specifically, he claims that &quot;until now only two or three per cent of the inbuilt circuits of the brain have been utilised. A large variety of [change] is therefore possible.&quot; The brain, therefore, is largely plastic and can be adapted in numerous unknown ways. Similarly, he cites Nietzsche&#x27;s philological findings about changes in perception from classical to Hellenistic Greece. He also criticizes E.O. Wilson&#x27;s claim that genes limit &quot;human ingenuity&quot; which he claims can only be discovered by acting as if there are no limits to the kinds of lives humans can live. While Feyerabend&#x27;s remarks on this subject are vague and merely suggestive, they have received uptake and confirmation in more recent research.

===Political philosophy===
====Expertise in a free society====
Starting from the argument that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought that science has no intrinsic claim to intellectual authority over other intellectual traditions like religion or myths.

Based on these arguments, Feyerabend defended the idea that science should be separated from the state in the same way that religion and state are separated in a modern secular society He envisioned a free society in which &quot;all traditions have equal rights and equal access to the centres of power.&quot; For example, parents should be able to determine the ideological context of their children&#x27;s education, instead of having limited options because of scientific standards. According to Feyerabend, science should also be subjected to democratic control: not only should the subjects that are investigated by scientists be determined by popular election, scientific assumptions and conclusions should also be supervised by committees of lay people. He thought that citizens should use their own principles when making decisions about these matters. He rejected the view that science is especially &quot;rational&quot; on the grounds that there is no single common &quot;rational&quot; ingredient that unites all the sciences but excludes other modes of thought.

Feyerabend thought that scientific expertise was partially exaggerated by needless uses of jargon and technical language and that many contributions towards science were made by laypeople. Rather than distinguish between &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;laypeople&quot; and privileged the former, Feyerabend distinguishes between &quot;cranks&quot; and &quot;respectable researchers&quot; which is defined by the virtues of inquirers rather than their credentials. In Feyerabend&#x27;s words,

 &quot;The distinction between the crank and the respectable thinker lies in the research that is done once a certain point of view is adopted. The crank usually is content with defending the point of view in its original, undeveloped, metaphysical form, and he is not prepared to test its usefulness in all those cases which seem to favor the opponent, or even admit that there exists a problem. It is this further investigation, the details of it, the knowledge of the difficulties, of the general state of knowledge, the recognition of objections, which distinguishes the &#x27;respectable thinker&#x27; from the crank. The original content of his theory does not&quot; 

According to this view, we cannot identify who counts as a crank based on the content of their beliefs. Someone who believes in flat earth theory, climate change denial, or astrology – for example – are not necessarily cranks, depending on how they defend those beliefs from criticism.

====Democracy and science funding====
Feyerabend thought that science funding agencies should be subject to democratic oversight. On this view, the allocation of funds for research should not be decided by practicing scientists exclusively, as is often the case with peer review. Rather, there should be supervision from taxpayers who determine research priorities. Because of this, Feyerabend defended the Baumann amendment which proposed that there should be Congressional veto power over the National Science Foundation&#x27;s budget proposals. According to Feyerabend, this follows both from the fact that outsider criticism is necessary for science to flourish and from a right to knowledge which he believed was central to a free society.

===Ancient philosophy===
====Aristotle====
Feyerabend greatly admired Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, largely due to its productivity. According to Feyerabend, Aristotle was an early epitome of naturalistic philosophy whose scientific research was part and parcel with his epistemology. He also claims that Aristotle was one of the most empiricist scientists in history and that his work in physics and mathematics continues to pay dividends after the scientific revolution.

====Xenophanes and the rise of rationalism====

In &quot;Farewell to Reason&quot;, Feyerabend criticizes Popper&#x27;s claim that Xenophanes, who Feyerabend calls a &quot;conceited bigmouth&quot; with &quot;considerable charm&quot;, was the first to engage in rational criticism in his arguments against anthropomorphic gods. According to Feyerabend, Xenophanes&#x27; theological writings can only constitute a criticism if the premises would be accepted by his opponents. Otherwise, Xenophanes is merely rejecting the Homeric gods. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and elsewhere, Feyerabend interprets Homer as accepting the view that the universe is subdivided into parts with different laws and qualitative features that do not aggregate into a unified whole. This informs Homer&#x27;s theology since there can be no coherent knowledge of the whole of the universe, only detailed understandings of isolated parts of the universe. Feyerabend further argues that some thinkers who came after Xenophanes, such as Aeschylus and Sophocles, also rejected Xenophanes&#x27; premise that the gods cannot be anthropomorphic. Additionally, Xenophanes represents the beginning of a tyrannical ideology which enforces &#x27;truth&#x27; and &#x27;morality&#x27; upon all as if there was a single universe that could be captured in a single worldview.

Feyerabend also criticizes Xenophanes&#x27; pretensions to have developed a conception of God that has no human features, arguing that Xenophanes&#x27; God still engages in human activities (such as thinking or hearing). Moreover, he argues that Xenophanes&#x27; God resembles a monster as it becomes more detached from human affairs and is therefore more morally problematic than the Homeric gods.

==Influence==
===In philosophy===
While the immediate academic reception of Feyerabend&#x27;s most read text, &quot;Against Method&quot;, was largely negative, Feyerabend is recognized today as one of the most influential philosophers of science of the 20th Century. Feyerabend&#x27;s arguments against a universal method have become largely accepted, and are often taken for granted by many philosophers of science in the 21st century. His arguments for pluralism moved the topic into the mainstream and his use of historical case studies were influential in the development of the History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) as an independent discipline. His arguments against reductionism were also influential on John Dupré, Cliff Hooker, and Alan Chalmers. He was also one of the intellectual forefathers of social constructivism and science and technology studies, although he participated little in either field during his lifetime.

===Outside philosophy===
Feyerabend&#x27;s analysis of the Galileo affair, where he claims the Church was &quot;on the right track&quot; for censuring Galileo on moral grounds and were empirically correct, was quoted with approval by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) in a speech in 1990. In its autobiography, Feyerabend recalls a conversation with Stephen Jay Gould, in 1991, when Gould stated that &quot;Against Method&quot;&#x27;s arguments for pluralism motivated him to pursue research on punctuated equilibrium. Feyerabend&#x27;s work was also influential for several physicists who felt empowered to experiment with approaches different from those of their supervisors as well on many social scientists who were under great pressure to conform to the &#x27;standards&#x27; of the natural sciences.

Feyerabend&#x27;s lectures were extremely popular and well-attended. They were often received positively as entertaining, provocative, and funny. The writer Daniele Bolelli, in his book &quot;On the Warrior&#x27;s Path&quot; quotes Feyerabend, highlighting the similarities between his epistemology and Bruce Lee&#x27;s worldview. Feyerabend&#x27;s concept of &quot;incommensurability&quot; was influential in the radical critical approach of Donald Ault in his extensive critical assessment of William Blake&#x27;s work, especially in &quot;Narrative Unbound: Re-Visioning William Blake&#x27;s&quot; The Four Zoas.

For the centennial of Feyerabend&#x27;s birth, in 2024, there was a series of conferences, workshops, publications, experimental art, song recitals, and theatre pieces planned in honor of his life and works.

<text>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (; ISO: &quot;Vallabhbhāī Jhāverbhāī Paṭel&quot;; 31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was an Indian independence activist and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and India&#x27;s political integration. In India and elsewhere, he was often called &quot;Sardar&quot;, meaning &quot;Chief&quot; in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. Under the chairmanship of Patel &quot;Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy&quot; resolution was passed by the Congress. Patel&#x27;s position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress&#x27;s main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. While promoting the Quit India Movement. Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that Patel&#x27;s speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel&#x27;s organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.

As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 30). Patel, together with Jawaharlal Nehru and Louis Mountbatten persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.

Patel&#x27;s commitment to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet &quot;Iron Man of India&quot;. He is also remembered as the &quot;patron saint of India&#x27;s civil servants&quot; for playing a pioneering role in establishing the modern All India Services system. The &quot;Statue of Unity&quot;, the world&#x27;s tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately in height.

== Early life and background ==
Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. Patel&#x27;s date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers. He belonged to the Patidars, specifically the Leva Patel community of Central Gujarat; although after his fame, both Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have claimed him as one of their own.

Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even as the barber charged with doing it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and become a barrister. Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from her parents&#x27; home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel – now an advocate – earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in 1903 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1905. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from the Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.

Patel practised law in Godhra, Borsad, and Anand while taking on the financial burdens of his homestead in Karamsad. Patel was the first chairman and founder of &quot;Edward Memorial High School&quot; Borsad, today known as Jhaverbhai Dajibhai Patel High School. When he had saved enough for his trip to England and applied for a pass and a ticket, they were addressed to &quot;V. J. Patel&quot;, at the home of his elder brother Vithalbhai, who had the same initials as Vallabhai. Having once nurtured a similar hope to study in England, Vithalbhai remonstrated his younger brother, saying that it would be disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother. In keeping with concerns for his family&#x27;s honour, Patel allowed Vithalbhai to go in his place.

In 1909 Patel&#x27;s wife Jhaverba was hospitalised in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to undergo major surgery for cancer. Her health suddenly worsened and, despite successful emergency surgery, she died in the hospital. Patel was given a note informing him of his wife&#x27;s demise as he was cross-examining a witness in court. According to witnesses, Patel read the note, pocketed it, and continued his cross-examination and won the case. He broke the news to others only after the proceedings had ended. Patel decided against marrying again. He raised his children with the help of his family and sent them to English-language schools in Bombay. At the age of 36, he journeyed to England and enrolled at the Middle Temple in London. Completing a 36-month course in 30 months, Patel finished at the top of his class despite having had no previous college background.

Returning to India, Patel settled in Ahmedabad and became one of the city&#x27;s most successful barristers. Wearing European-style clothes and sporting urbane mannerisms, he became a skilled bridge player. Patel nurtured ambitions to expand his practice and accumulate great wealth and to provide his children with modern education. He had made a pact with his brother Vithalbhai to support his entry into politics in the Bombay Presidency, while Patel remained in Ahmedabad to provide for the family.

== Fight for independence ==
In September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi&#x27;s petition demanding &quot;Swaraj&quot;self-rulefrom Britain. A month later, he met Gandhi for the first time at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra. On Gandhi&#x27;s encouragement, Patel became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress. Patel now energetically fought against &quot;veth&quot;the forced servitude of Indians to Europeansand organised relief efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda. The Kheda peasants&#x27; plea for exemption from taxation had been turned down by British authorities. Gandhi endorsed waging a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due to his activities in Champaran. When Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the assignment, Patel volunteered, much to Gandhi&#x27;s delight. Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel later said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he realised he would have to abandon his career and material ambitions.
=== Satyagraha in Gujarat ===

Supported by Congress volunteers Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel began a village-by-village tour in the Kheda district documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a statewide revolt by refusing to pay taxes. Patel emphasised the potential hardships and the need for complete unity and non-violence from every village in the face of provocation. When the revolt was launched and tax revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide valuables and protect themselves against raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians. The government agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of taxes for a year, even scaling back the rate. Patel emerged as a hero to Gujaratis. In 1920 he was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee; he would serve as its president until 1945.

Patel supported Gandhi&#x27;s Non-cooperation movement and toured the state to recruit more than 300,000 members and raise over Rs.1.5million in funds. Helping organise bonfires in Ahmedabad in which British goods were burned, Patel threw in all his English-style clothes. Along with his daughter Mani and son Dahya, he switched completely to wearing khadi, the locally produced cotton clothing. Patel also supported Gandhi&#x27;s controversial suspension of resistance in the wake of the Chauri Chaura incident. In Gujarat, he worked extensively in the following years against alcoholism, untouchability, and caste discrimination, as well as for the empowerment of women. In the Congress, he was a resolute supporter of Gandhi against his Swarajist critics. Patel was elected Ahmedabad&#x27;s municipal president in 1922, 1924, and 1927. During his terms, he oversaw improvements in infrastructure: the supply of electricity was increased, and drainage and sanitation systems were extended throughout the city. The school system underwent major reforms. He fought for the recognition and payment of teachers employed in schools established by nationalists (independent of British control) and even took on sensitive Hindu–Muslim issues. Patel personally led relief efforts in the aftermath of the torrential rainfall of 1927 that caused major floods in the city and in the Kheda district, and great destruction of life and property. He established refugee centres across the district, mobilised volunteers, and arranged for supplies of food, medicines, and clothing, as well as emergency funds from the government and the public.

When Gandhi was in prison, Patel was asked by Members of Congress to lead the &quot;satyagraha&quot; in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He organised thousands of volunteers from all over the country to take part in processions of people violating the law. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with a local &quot;dacoit&quot; (criminal) gang related to Devar Baba in the Borsad &quot;taluka&quot; even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the &quot;taluka&quot; resisted payment of the tax and prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel&#x27;s key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.

In April 1928, Patel returned to the independence struggle from his municipal duties in Ahmedabad when Bardoli suffered from a serious double predicament of a famine and a steep tax hike. The revenue hike was steeper than it had been in Kheda even though the famine covered a large portion of Gujarat. After cross-examining and talking to village representatives, emphasising the potential hardship and need for non-violence and cohesion, Patel initiated the struggle with a complete denial of taxes. Patel organised volunteers, camps, and an information network across affected areas. The revenue refusal was stronger than in Kheda, and many sympathy &quot;satyagrahas&quot; were undertaken across Gujarat. Despite arrests and seizures of property and land, the struggle intensified. The situation came to a head in August, when, through sympathetic intermediaries, he negotiated a settlement that included repealing the tax hike, reinstating village officials who had resigned in protest, and returning seized property and land. It was by the women of Bardoli, during the struggle and after the Indian National Congress victory in that area, that Patel first began to be referred to as &quot;Sardar&quot; (or chief).

==== Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy: 1931 ====
Under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel, the &quot;Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy&quot; resolution was passed by the Congress in 1931.
As Gandhi embarked on the Dandi Salt March, Patel was arrested in the village of Ras and was put on trial without witnesses, with no lawyer or journalists allowed to attend. Patel&#x27;s arrest and Gandhi&#x27;s subsequent arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujarat. Districts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released. Once released, Patel served as interim Congress president, but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Bombay. After the signing of the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi. Here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties. It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. In prison, the two discussed national and social issues, read Hindu epics, and cracked jokes. Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit. Gandhi&#x27;s secretary, Mahadev Desai, kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel. When Gandhi embarked on a fast-unto-death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables, Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food. Patel was later moved to a jail in Nasik, and refused a British offer for a brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in October 1933. He was finally released in July 1934.

Patel&#x27;s position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress&#x27;s main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. In addition to collecting funds and selecting candidates, he also determined the Congress&#x27;s stance on issues and opponents. Not contesting a seat for himself, Patel nevertheless guided Congressmen elected in the provinces and at the national level. In 1935 Patel underwent surgery for haemorrhoids, yet continued to direct efforts against the plague in Bardoli and again when a drought struck Gujarat in 1939. Patel guided the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party disciplinePatel feared that the British government would take advantage of opportunities to create conflict among elected Congressmen, and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence. Patel clashed with Nehru, opposing declarations of the adoption of socialism at the 1936 Congress session, which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence. In 1938 Patel organised rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president Subhas Chandra Bose to move away from Gandhi&#x27;s principles of non-violent resistance. Patel saw Bose as wanting more power over the party. He led senior Congress leaders in a protest that resulted in Bose&#x27;s resignation. But criticism arose from Bose&#x27;s supporters, socialists, and other Congressmen that Patel himself was acting in an authoritarian manner in his defence of Gandhi&#x27;s authority.

=== Legal Battle with Subhas Chandra Bose ===
Patel&#x27;s elder brother Vithalbhai Patel, died in Geneva on 22 October 1933.

Vithalbhai and Bose had been highly critical of Gandhi&#x27;s leadership during their travels in Europe. &quot;By the time Vithalbhai died in October 1933, Bose had become his primary caregiver. On his deathbed he left a will of sorts, bequeathing three-quarters of his money to Bose to use in promoting India&#x27;s cause in other countries. When Patel saw a copy of the letter in which his brother had left a majority of his estate to Bose, he asked a series of questions: Why was the letter not attested by a doctor? Had the original paper been preserved? Why were the witnesses to that letter all men from Bengal and none of the many other veteran freedom activists and supporters of the Congress who had been present at Geneva where Vithalbhai had died? Patel may even have doubted the veracity of the signature on the document. The case went to the court and after a legal battle that lasted more than a year, the courts judged that Vithalbhai&#x27;s estate could only be inherited by his legal heirs, that is, his family. Patel promptly handed the money over to the Vithalbhai Memorial Trust.&quot;

=== Quit India movement ===

On the outbreak of World War II, Patel supported Nehru&#x27;s decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi&#x27;s advice, as well as an initiative by senior leader Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari to offer Congress&#x27;s full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence at the end of the war and installed a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral opposition to war, while Subhash Chandra Bose was in militant opposition to the British. The British government rejected Rajagopalachari&#x27;s initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi&#x27;s leadership again. He participated in Gandhi&#x27;s call for individual disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps mission in 1942. Patel lost more than twenty pounds during his period in jail.

While Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and Maulana Azad initially criticised Gandhi&#x27;s proposal for an all-out campaign of civil disobedience to force the British to grant Indian independence, Patel was its most fervent supporter. Arguing that the British would retreat from India as they had from Singapore and Burma, Patel urged that the campaign start without any delay. Though feeling that the British would not leave immediately, Patel favoured an all-out rebellion that would galvanise the Indian people, who had been divided in their response to the war. In Patel&#x27;s view, such a rebellion would force the British to concede that continuation of colonial rule had no support in India, and thus speed the transfer of power to Indians. Believing strongly in the need for revolt, Patel stated his intention to resign from the Congress if the revolt were not approved. Gandhi strongly pressured the AICC to approve an all-out campaign of civil disobedience, and the AICC approved the campaign on 7 August 1942. Though Patel&#x27;s health had suffered during his stint in jail, he gave emotional speeches to large crowds across India, asking them to refuse to pay taxes and to participate in civil disobedience, mass protests, and a shutdown of all civil services. He raised funds and prepared a second tier of command as a precaution against the arrest of national leaders. Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August:

Historians believe that Patel&#x27;s speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel&#x27;s organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India. Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar. Here he spun cloth, played bridge, read a large number of books, took long walks, and practised gardening. He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside. Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year. But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing &quot;fullest peace&quot; for having done &quot;their duty&quot;. Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British colonial government had responded by imprisoning most of the leaders of Congress, the Quit India movement was &quot;by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857&quot;, as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill. More than 100,000 people were arrested and numerous protestors were killed in violent confrontations with the Indian Imperial Police. Strikes, protests, and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India. When Patel was released on 15 June 1945, he realised that the British government was preparing proposals to transfer power to India.

== Partition and independence ==
In the 1946 Indian provincial elections, the Congress won a large majority of the elected seats, dominating the Hindu electorate. However the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah won a large majority of Muslim electorate seats. The League had resolved in 1940 to demand Pakistanan independent state for Muslimsand was a fierce critic of the Congress. The Congress formed governments in all provinces save Sindh, Punjab, and Bengal, where it entered into coalitions with other parties.

=== Cabinet mission and partition ===

When the British mission proposed two plans for transfer of power, there was considerable opposition within the Congress to both. The plan of 16 May 1946 proposed a loose federation with extensive provincial autonomy, and the &quot;grouping&quot; of provinces based on religious-majority. The plan of 16 May 1946 proposed the partition of India on religious lines, with over 565 princely states free to choose between independence or accession to either dominion. The League approved both plans while the Congress flatly rejected the proposal of 16 May. Gandhi criticised the 16 May proposal as being inherently divisive, but Patel, realising that rejecting the proposal would mean that only the League would be invited to form a government, lobbied the Congress Working Committee hard to give its assent to the 16 May proposal. Patel engaged in discussions with the British envoys Sir Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence and obtained an assurance that the &quot;grouping&quot; clause would not be given practical force, Patel converted Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, and Rajagopalachari to accept the plan. When the League retracted its approval of the 16 May plan, the viceroy Lord Wavell invited the Congress to form the government. Under Nehru, who was styled the &quot;Vice President of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council&quot;, Patel took charge of the departments of home affairs and information and broadcasting. He moved into a government house on Aurangzeb Road in Delhi, which would be his home until his death in 1950.

Vallabhbhai Patel was one of the first Congress leaders to accept the partition of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He had been outraged by Jinnah&#x27;s Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India, and by the viceroy&#x27;s vetoes of his home department&#x27;s plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy&#x27;s induction of League ministers into the government, and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British government without Congress&#x27;s approval. Although further outraged at the League&#x27;s boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would, in Patel&#x27;s mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence. In December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant V. P. Menon on the latter&#x27;s suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah&#x27;s demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel&#x27;s decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League&#x27;s tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims, and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi&#x27;s deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress–League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:

After Gandhi rejected and Congress approved the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither Patel nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition. Patel took the lead in organising relief and emergency supplies, establishing refugee camps, and visiting the border areas with Pakistani leaders to encourage peace. Despite these efforts, the death toll is estimated at between 500,000 and 1 million people. The estimated number of refugees in both countries exceeds 15 million. Understanding that Delhi and Punjab policemen, accused of organising attacks on Muslims, were personally affected by the tragedies of partition, Patel called out the Indian Army with South Indian regiments to restore order, imposing strict curfews and shoot-on-sight orders. Visiting the Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah area in Delhi, where thousands of Delhi Muslims feared attacks, he prayed at the shrine, visited the people, and reinforced the presence of police. He suppressed from the press reports of atrocities in Pakistan against Hindus and Sikhs to prevent retaliatory violence. Establishing the Delhi Emergency Committee to restore order and organising relief efforts for refugees in the capital, Patel publicly warned officials against partiality and neglect. When reports reached Patel that large groups of Sikhs were preparing to attack Muslim convoys heading for Pakistan, Patel hurried to Amritsar and met Sikh and Hindu leaders. Arguing that attacking helpless people was cowardly and dishonourable, Patel emphasised that Sikh actions would result in further attacks against Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan. He assured the community leaders that if they worked to establish peace and order and guarantee the safety of Muslims, the Indian government would react forcefully to any failures of Pakistan to do the same. Additionally, Patel addressed a massive crowd of approximately 200,000 refugees who had surrounded his car after the meetings:

Following his dialogue with community leaders and his speech, no further attacks occurred against Muslim refugees, and a wider peace and order was soon re-established over the entire area. However, Patel was criticised by Nehru, secular Muslims, and Gandhi over his alleged wish to see Muslims from other parts of India depart. While Patel vehemently denied such allegations, the acrimony with Maulana Azad and other secular Muslim leaders increased when Patel refused to dismiss Delhi&#x27;s Sikh police commissioner, who was accused of discrimination. Hindu and Sikh leaders also accused Patel and other leaders of not taking Pakistan sufficiently to task over the attacks on their communities there, and Muslim leaders further criticised him for allegedly neglecting the needs of Muslims leaving for Pakistan, and concentrating resources for incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees. Patel clashed with Nehru and Azad over the allocation of houses in Delhi vacated by Muslims leaving for Pakistan; Nehru and Azad desired to allocate them for displaced Muslims, while Patel argued that no government professing secularism must make such exclusions. However, Patel was publicly defended by Gandhi and received widespread admiration and support for speaking frankly on communal issues and acting decisively and resourcefully to quell disorder and violence.

=== Political integration of independent India ===

As the first Home Minister, Patel played one of the major role in the integration of the princely states into the Indian federation. This achievement formed the cornerstone of Patel&#x27;s popularity in the post-independence era. He is, in this regard, compared to Otto von Bismarck who unified the many German states in 1871. Under the plan of 3 June, more than 565 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan, or choosing independence. Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede, most of the people and territory would be fragmented. The Congress, as well as senior British officials, considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving conquest of the princely states by the Indian dominion. Gandhi had said to Patel, &quot;The problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it.&quot; Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task. He asked V.P.Menon, a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India, to become his right-hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry. On 6 August 1947, Patel began lobbying the princes, attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts. Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs, inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi. At these meetings, Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order. Patel invoked the patriotism of India&#x27;s monarchs, asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. He proposed favourable terms for the merger, including the creation of &quot;privy purses&quot; for the rulers&#x27; descendants. While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism, Patel did not rule out force. Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith, he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document. All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union; only Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket.

Junagadh was especially important to Patel, since it was in his home state of Gujarat. It was also important because in this Kathiawar district was the ultra-rich Somnath temple (which in the 11th century had been plundered by Mahmud of Ghazni, who damaged the temple and its idols to rob it of its riches, including emeralds, diamonds, and gold). Under pressure from Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the Nawab had acceded to Pakistan. It was, however, quite far from Pakistan, and 80% of its population was Hindu. Patel combined diplomacy with force, demanding that Pakistan annul the accession, and that the Nawab accede to India. He sent the Army to occupy three principalities of Junagadh to show his resolve. Following widespread protests and the formation of a civil government, or &quot;Aarzi Hukumat&quot;, both Bhutto and the Nawab fled to Karachi, and under Patel&#x27;s orders the Indian Army and police units marched into the state. A plebiscite organised later produced a 99.5% vote for merger with India. In a speech at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh following the latter&#x27;s take-over, Patel emphasised his feeling of urgency on Hyderabad, which he felt was more vital to India than Kashmir:

Hyderabad was the largest of the princely states, and it included parts of present-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra states. Its ruler, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan, was a Muslim, although over 80% of its people were Hindu. The Nizam sought independence or accession with Pakistan. Muslim forces loyal to Nizam, called the Razakars, under Qasim Razvi, pressed the Nizam to hold out against India, while organising attacks on people on Indian soil. Even though a Standstill Agreement was signed due to the desperate efforts of Lord Mountbatten to avoid a war, the Nizam rejected deals and changed his positions. On 7 September, Jawaharlal Nehru gave ultimatum to Nizam, demanding ban on the Razakars and return of Indian troops to Secunderabad. Pakistan foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan warned India against this ultimatum. The invasion of Hyderabad was then launched on 13 September, after the death of Jinnah on 11 September. After the defeat of Razakars, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession, joining India.

== Leading India ==
The Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, along with Nehru and Patel, formed the &quot;triumvirate&quot; that ruled India from 1948 to 1950. Prime Minister Nehru was intensely popular with the masses, but Patel enjoyed the loyalty and the faith of rank and file Congressmen, state leaders, and India&#x27;s civil servants. Patel was a senior leader in the Constituent Assembly of India and was responsible in large measure for shaping India&#x27;s constitution.

Patel was the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribal and excluded areas, fundamental rights, and provincial constitutions. Patel piloted a model constitution for the provinces in the Assembly, which contained limited powers for the state governor, who would defer to the presidenthe clarified it was not the intention to let the governor exercise power that could impede an elected government. He worked closely with Muslim leaders to end separate electorates and the more potent demand for reservation of seats for minorities. His intervention was key to the passage of two articles that protected civil servants from political involvement and guaranteed their terms and privileges. He was also instrumental in the founding the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service, and for his defence of Indian civil servants from political attack; he is known as the &quot;patron saint&quot; of India&#x27;s services. When a delegation of Gujarati farmers came to him citing their inability to send their milk production to the markets without being fleeced by intermediaries, Patel exhorted them to organise the processing and sale of milk by themselves, and guided them to create the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers&#x27; Union Limited, which preceded the Amul milk products brand. Patel also pledged the reconstruction of the ancient but dilapidated Somnath Temple in Saurashtra. He oversaw the restoration work and the creation of a public trust, and pledged to dedicate the temple upon the completion of work (the work was completed after his death and the temple was inaugurated by the first President of India, Dr.Rajendra Prasad).

When the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir began in September 1947, Patel immediately wanted to send troops into Kashmir. But, agreeing with Nehru and Mountbatten, he waited until Kashmir&#x27;s monarch had acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India&#x27;s military operations to secure Srinagar and the Baramulla Pass, and the forces retrieved much territory from the invaders. Patel, along with Defence Minister Baldev Singh, administered the entire military effort, arranging for troops from different parts of India to be rushed to Kashmir and for a major military road connecting Srinagar to Pathankot to be built in six months. Patel strongly advised Nehru against going for arbitration to the United Nations, insisting that Pakistan had been wrong to support the invasion and the accession to India was valid. He did not want foreign interference in a bilateral affair. Patel opposed the release of Rs.550 million to the Government of Pakistan, convinced that the money would go to finance the war against India in Kashmir. The Cabinet had approved his point but it was reversed when Gandhi, who feared an intensifying rivalry and further communal violence, went on a fast-unto-death to obtain the release. Patel, though not estranged from Gandhi, was deeply hurt at the rejection of his counsel and a Cabinet decision.

In 1949 a crisis arose when the number of Hindu refugees entering West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura from East Pakistan climbed to over 800,000. The refugees in many cases were being forcibly evicted by Pakistani authorities, and were victims of intimidation and violence. Nehru invited Liaquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan, to find a peaceful solution. Despite his aversion, Patel reluctantly met Khan and discussed the matter. Patel strongly criticised Nehru&#x27;s plan to sign a pact that would create minority commissions in both countries and pledge both India and Pakistan to a commitment to protect each other&#x27;s minorities. Syama Prasad Mookerjee and K.C.Neogy, two Bengali ministers, resigned, and Nehru was intensely criticised in West Bengal for allegedly appeasing Pakistan. The pact was immediately in jeopardy. Patel, however, publicly came to Nehru&#x27;s aid. He gave emotional speeches to members of Parliament, and the people of West Bengal, and spoke with scores of delegations of Congressmen, Hindus, Muslims, and other public interest groups, persuading them to give peace a final effort.

In April 2015 the Government of India declassified surveillance reports suggesting that Patel, while Home Minister, and Nehru were among officials involved in alleged government-authorised spying on the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.

=== Father of All India Services ===
He was also instrumental in the creation of the All India Services which he described as the country&#x27;s &quot;Steel Frame&quot;. In his address to the probationers of these services, he asked them to be guided by the spirit of service in day-to-day administration. He reminded them that the ICS was no-longer neither Imperial, nor civil, nor imbued with any spirit of service after Independence. His exhortation to the probationers to maintain utmost impartiality and incorruptibility of administration is as relevant today as it was then. &quot;A civil servant cannot afford to, and must not, take part in politics. Nor must he involve himself in communal wrangles. To depart from the path of rectitude in either of these respects is to debase public service and to lower its dignity,&quot; he had cautioned them on 21 April 1947.

He, more than anyone else in post-independence India, realised the crucial role that civil services play in administering a country, in not merely maintaining law and order, but running the institutions that provide the binding cement to a society. He, more than any other contemporary of his, was aware of the needs of a sound, stable administrative structure as the lynchpin of a functioning polity. The present-day all-India administrative services owe their origin to the man&#x27;s sagacity and thus he is regarded as Father of modern All India Services.

== Relations with Gandhi and Nehru ==

Patel was intensely loyal to Gandhi, and both he and Nehru looked to him to arbitrate disputes. However, Nehru and Patel sparred over national issues. When Nehru asserted control over Kashmir policy, Patel objected to Nehru&#x27;s sidelining his home ministry&#x27;s officials. Nehru was offended by Patel&#x27;s decision-making regarding the states&#x27; integration, having consulted neither him nor the Cabinet. Patel asked Gandhi to relieve him of his obligation to serve, believing that an open political battle would hurt India. After much personal deliberation and contrary to Patel&#x27;s prediction, Gandhi on 30 January 1948 told Patel not to leave the government. A free India, according to Gandhi, needed both Patel and Nehru. Patel was the last man to privately talk with Gandhi, who was assassinated just minutes after Patel&#x27;s departure. At Gandhi&#x27;s wake, Nehru and Patel embraced each other and addressed the nation together. Patel gave solace to many associates and friends and immediately moved to forestall any possible violence. Within two months of Gandhi&#x27;s death, Patel suffered a major heart attack; the timely action of his daughter, his secretary, and a nurse saved Patel&#x27;s life. Speaking later, Patel attributed the attack to the grief bottled up due to Gandhi&#x27;s death.

Criticism arose from the media and other politicians that Patel&#x27;s home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering to leave the government. Patel&#x27;s secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it as fodder for Patel&#x27;s political enemies and political conflict in India. However, Nehru sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel&#x27;s ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and asserted that after Gandhi&#x27;s death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly endorsed Nehru&#x27;s leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any notion that he sought to be prime minister.

Nehru gave Patel a free hand in integrating the princely states into India. Though the two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs, they sometimes would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing on the issues of Hyderabad&#x27;s integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel&#x27;s counsel on sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and on ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force.

When Nehru pressured Rajendra Prasad to decline a nomination to become the first President of India in 1950 in favour of Rajagopalachari, he angered the party, which felt Nehru was attempting to impose his will. Nehru sought Patel&#x27;s help in winning the party over, but Patel declined, and Prasad was duly elected. Nehru opposed the 1950 Congress presidential candidate Purushottam Das Tandon, a conservative Hindu leader, endorsing Jivatram Kripalani instead and threatening to resign if Tandon was elected. Patel rejected Nehru&#x27;s views and endorsed Tandon in Gujarat, where Kripalani received not one vote despite hailing from that state himself. Patel believed Nehru had to understand that his will was not law with the Congress, but he personally discouraged Nehru from resigning after the latter felt that the party had no confidence in him.

=== Ban on RSS ===

In January 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Hindutva activist Nathuram Godse. Following the assassination, many prominent leaders of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were arrested, and the organisation was banned on 4 February 1948 by Patel. During the court proceedings in relation to the assassination Godse began claiming that he had left the organisation in 1946. Vallabhbhai Patel had remarked that the &quot;RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhi&#x27;s death&quot;.

The charged RSS leaders were acquitted of the conspiracy charge by the Supreme Court of India. Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the Constitution of India, accept the Tricolor as the National Flag of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.

Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel&#x27;s demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS&#x27;s constitution was amended according to Patel&#x27;s wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation&#x27;s internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a &#x27;dead letter&#x27;.

On 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar&#x27;s undertaking to make the group&#x27;s loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.

== Final years ==
In his twilight years, Patel was honoured by members of Parliament. He was awarded honorary doctorates of law by Nagpur University, the University of Allahabad and Banaras Hindu University in November 1948, subsequently receiving honorary doctorates from Osmania University in February 1949 and from Punjab University in March 1949. Previously, Patel had been featured on the cover page of the January 1947 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

On 29 March 1949 authorities lost radio contact with a Royal Indian Air Force de Havilland Dove carrying Patel, his daughter Maniben, and the Maharaja of Patiala from Delhi to Jaipur. The pilot had been ordered to fly at a low altitude due to turbulence. During the flight, loss of power in an engine caused the pilot to make an emergency landing in a desert area in Rajasthan. Owing to the aircraft&#x27;s flying at a low altitude, the pilot was unable to send a distress call with the aircraft&#x27;s VHF radio, nor could he use his HF equipment as the crew lacked a trained signaller. With all passengers safe, Patel and others tracked down a nearby village and local officials. A subsequent RIAF court of inquiry headed by Group Captain (later Air Chief Marshal and Chief of the Air Staff) Pratap Chandra Lal concluded the forced landing had been caused by fuel starvation. When Patel returned to Delhi, thousands of Congressmen gave him a resounding welcome. In Parliament, MPs gave a long standing ovation to Patel, stopping proceedings for half an hour.

== Death ==
Patel&#x27;s health declined rapidly through the summer of 1949. He later began coughing blood, whereupon Maniben began limiting his meetings and working hours and arranged for a personalised medical staff to begin attending to Patel. The then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy heard Patel make jokes about his impending end, and in a private meeting Patel admitted to his ministerial colleague N. V. Gadgil that he was not going to live much longer. Patel&#x27;s health worsened after 2 November, when he began losing consciousness frequently and was confined to his bed. He was flown to Bombay on 12 December on advice from DrRoy, to recuperate as his condition was deemed critical. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Menon all came to see him off at the airport in Delhi. Patel was extremely weak and had to be carried onto the aircraft in a chair. In Bombay, large crowds gathered at Santacruz Airport to greet him. To spare him from this stress, the aircraft landed at Juhu Aerodrome, where Chief Minister B. G. Kher and Morarji Desai were present to receive him with a car belonging to the Governor of Bombay that took Vallabhbhai to Birla House.

After suffering a massive heart attack (his second), Patel died on 15 December 1950 at Birla House in Bombay. In an unprecedented and unrepeated gesture, on the day after his death more than 1,500 officers of India&#x27;s civil and police services congregated to mourn at Patel&#x27;s residence in Delhi and pledged &quot;complete loyalty and unremitting zeal&quot; in India&#x27;s service. Numerous governments and world leaders sent messages of condolence upon Patel&#x27;s death, including Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, President Sukarno of Indonesia, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister Clement Attlee of the United Kingdom.

In homage to Patel, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared a week of national mourning. Patel&#x27;s cremation was planned at Girgaum Chowpatty, but this was changed to Sonapur (now Marine Lines) when his daughter conveyed that it was his wish to be cremated like a common man in the same place as his wife and brother were earlier cremated. His cremation in Sonapur in Bombay was attended by a crowd of one million including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajagopalachari and President Rajendra Prasad.

== Awards and honours ==
** Bharat Ratna (1991, posthumous)

== Legacy ==

Patel is a widely celebrated Indian freedom fighter in India, as well as a respected leader. In his eulogy, delivered the day after Patel&#x27;s death, Girija Shankar Bajpai, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of External Affairs, paid tribute to &quot;a great patriot, a great administrator and a great man. Patel was all three, a rare combination in any historic epoch and in any country.&quot; Bajpai lauded Patel for his achievements as a patriot and as an administrator, notably his vital role in securing India&#x27;s stability in the aftermath of Independence and Partition:

Among Patel&#x27;s surviving family, Maniben Patel lived in a flat in Bombay for the rest of her life following her father&#x27;s death; she often led the work of the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust, which organises the prestigious annual Sardar Patel Memorial Lectures, and other charitable organisations. Dahyabhai Patel was a businessman who was elected to serve in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) as an MP in the 1960s.

Patel was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, in 1991. It was announced in 2014 that his birthday, 31 October, would become an annual national celebration known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day). In 2012, Patel was ranked third in Outlook India&#x27;s poll of the Greatest Indian.

Patel&#x27;s family home in Karamsad is preserved in his memory. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Memorial in Ahmedabad was established in 1980 at the Moti Shahi Mahal. It comprises a museum, a gallery of portraits and historical pictures, and a library containing important documents and books associated with Patel and his life. Amongst the exhibits are many of Patel&#x27;s personal effects and relics from various periods of his personal and political life.

Patel is the namesake of many public institutions in India. A major initiative to build dams, canals, and hydroelectric power plants in the Narmada River valley to provide a tri-state area with drinking water and electricity and to increase agricultural production was named the &quot;Sardar Sarovar&quot;. Patel is also the namesake of the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology in Surat, Sardar Patel University, Sardar Patel High School, and the Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University Of Agriculture and Technology in Meerut [U.P.]. India&#x27;s national police training academy is also named after him.

The international airport of Ahmedabad is named after him. Also the international cricket stadium of Ahmedabad (also known as the Motera Stadium) is named after him. A national cricket stadium in Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, used for national matches and events, is also named after him. The chief outer ring road encircling Ahmedabad is named SP Ring Road. The Gujarat government&#x27;s institution for training government functionaries is named Sardar Patel Institute of Public Administration.

=== Rashtriya Ekta Diwas ===
Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day), celebrated annual on 31 October, was introduced by the Government of India and inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The official statement for Rashtriya Ekta Diwas by the Home Ministry of India cites that the National Unity Day &quot;will provide an opportunity to re-affirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity and security of our country.&quot;

National Unity Day celebrates the birthday of Patel because, during his term as Home Minister of India, he is credited for the integration of over 550 independent princely states into India from 1947 to 1949 by Independence Act (1947). He is known as the &quot;Bismarck of India&quot;.

=== &quot;Statue of Unity&quot; ===

The &quot;Statue of Unity&quot; is a monument dedicated to Patel, located in the Indian state of Gujarat, facing the Narmada Dam, 3.2 km away from Sadhu Bet near Vadodara. At the height of 182 metres (597 feet), it is the world&#x27;s tallest statue, exceeding the Spring Temple Buddha by 54 meters. This statue and related structures are spread over 20,000 square meters and are surrounded by an artificial lake spread across 12 km and cost an estimated 29.8 billion rupees ($425m). It was inaugurated by India&#x27;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel&#x27;s birth. The height of the statue in meters has been picked to match the total assembly constituencies in Gujarat.

<text>The integumentary system is the set of organs forming the outermost layer of an animal&#x27;s body. It comprises the skin and its appendages, which act as a physical barrier between the external environment and the internal environment that it serves to protect and maintain the body of the animal. Mainly it is the body&#x27;s outer skin.

The integumentary system includes skin, hair, scales, feathers, hooves, claws, and nails. It has a variety of additional functions: it may serve to maintain water balance, protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate body temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory receptors which detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature.

==Structure==
=== Skin ===

The skin is one of the largest organs of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5 to 2 m2 of surface area.
The skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina and reticular lamina). The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, blood vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.

Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.

====Epidermis====
The epidermis is the strong, superficial layer that serves as the first line of protection against the outer environment. The human epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum, called the stratum lucidum. The epidermis is regenerated from the stem cells found in the basal layer that develop into the corneum. The epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis.

Its main functions are protection, absorption of nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium; four types of cells: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Merkel cells, and Langerhans cells.

The predominant cell keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection, is responsible for the formation of the epidermal water barrier by making and secreting lipids. The majority of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to &quot;stay&quot; atop the structure.

The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from a thin area called the nail matrix at an average of 1 mm per week. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as it mixes with matrix cells. Only primates have nails. In other vertebrates, the keratinizing system at the terminus of each digit produces claws or hooves.

The epidermis of vertebrates is surrounded by two kinds of coverings, which are produced by the epidermis itself. In fish and aquatic amphibians, it is a thin mucus layer that is constantly being replaced. In terrestrial vertebrates, it is the stratum corneum (dead keratinized cells). The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis, where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands, transport their products.
====Dermis====

The dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and areolar connective tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern.

The dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The papillary layer is the superficial layer that forms finger-like projections into the epidermis (dermal papillae), and consists of highly vascularized, loose connective tissue. The reticular layer is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging. The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many chromatophores are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.

===Hypodermis===

The hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes, which are specialized in accumulating and storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.

The hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.

==Functions==
The integumentary system has multiple roles in maintaining the body&#x27;s equilibrium. All body systems work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body. The skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body&#x27;s first line of defense against infection, temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis.

Its main functions include:

*Protect the body&#x27;s internal living tissues and organs
*Protect against invasion by foreign organisms, including infectious organisms
*Protect the body from dehydration
*Protect the body against abrupt changes in temperature, maintain homeostasis
*Help excrete waste materials through perspiration
*Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see Somatosensory system)
*Protect the body against sunburns by secreting melanin
*Generate vitamin D through exposure to ultraviolet light
*Store water, fat, glucose, vitamin D
*Maintenance of the body form
*Formation of new cells from stratum germinativum to repair minor injuries
*Protect from UV rays.
*Regulates body temperature
*It distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings.

Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is called integumentary exchange.

==Clinical significance==
Possible diseases and injuries to the human integumentary system include:

* Rash
* Yeast
* Athlete&#x27;s foot
* Infection
* Sunburn
* Skin cancer
* Albinism
* Acne
* Herpes
* Herpes labialis, commonly called cold sores
* Impetigo
* Rubella
* Cancer
* Psoriasis
* Rabies
* Rosacea
* Atopic dermatitis
* Eczema

<doc id="59661" wikidata="Q7729" url="?curid=59661" title="Louis Bonaparte">
<text>Louis Bonaparte (born Luigi Buonaparte; 2 September 1778 – 25 July 1846) was a younger brother of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. He was a monarch in his own right from 1806 to 1810, ruling over the Kingdom of Holland (a French client state roughly corresponding to the modern-day Netherlands). In that capacity, he was known as Louis I (Dutch: Lodewijk I ).

Louis was the fifth surviving child and fourth surviving son of Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino, out of eight children who lived past infancy. He and his siblings were all born in Corsica, which had been conquered by France less than a decade before his birth. Louis followed his older brothers into the French Army, where he benefited from Napoleon&#x27;s patronage. In 1802, he married his step-niece Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Empress Joséphine (Napoleon&#x27;s wife).

In 1806, Napoleon I established the Kingdom of Holland in place of the Batavian Republic, appointing Louis as the new king. Napoleon had intended for Holland to be little more than a puppet state, but Louis was determined to be as independent as possible and became quite popular amongst his new people. Growing tired of his brother&#x27;s wilfulness, Napoleon annexed Holland into the French Empire in 1810, and Louis went into exile.

His youngest son, Louis-Napoléon, established the Second French Empire in 1852, proclaiming himself Napoleon III.

==Early life==
Louis was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. He was a younger brother of Joseph, Napoleon, Lucien, and Elisa Bonaparte, and the older brother of Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme Bonaparte. Louis&#x27; godparents were the island&#x27;s governor, Mr de Marbeuf, and the wife of the intendant, Bertrand de Boucheporn, whom Letizia and her husband, Carlo, had befriended.

Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s early career was spent in the Army, and he served with Napoleon in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Thanks to his older brother, Napoleon, Louis was given a commission in the French Military, and was promoted to Lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment, and from there he was made Aide de Camp on Napoleon&#x27;s staff. Napoleon, during his Italian Campaign, recommended Louis to Carnot, and Louis was consequently made a captain. He later became a General by the age of 25, although he felt that he had risen too high in too short a time.

Upon Louis&#x27;s return to France, he was involved in Napoleon&#x27;s plot to overthrow the Directory. After becoming the First Consul, Napoleon arranged for a marriage between Louis and Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Empress Josephine, and hence Napoleon&#x27;s stepdaughter. Hortense was opposed to the marriage at first. She was soon persuaded by her mother to marry Louis for the sake of the family.

==King of Holland (1806–1810)==


Feeling that the Batavian Republic was too independent for his liking, Napoleon I replaced it with the Kingdom of Holland on 5 June 1806 and placed Louis on the throne. Napoleon had intended for his younger brother to be little more than a French prefect of Holland. However, Louis had his mind and tried to be a responsible and independent ruler. To endear himself to his adopted country, he tried to learn the Dutch language; he called himself Lodewijk I (adopting the Dutch form of his name) and declared himself Dutch rather than French. Allegedly, his Dutch was initially so poor that he told the people he was the &quot;Konijn van &#x27;Olland&quot; (&quot;Rabbit of &#x27;Olland&quot;), rather than &quot;Koning van Holland&quot; (&quot;King of Holland&quot;). However, his sincere effort to learn Dutch earned him respect from his subjects.

Having declared himself Dutch, Louis tried to make his court Dutch as well. He forced his court and ministers (mostly provided by Napoleon) to speak only Dutch and to renounce their French citizenships. This latter was too much for his wife Hortense who, in France at the time of his demands, refused his request. Louis and Hortense had never gotten along, and this demand further strained their relationship. She only came to Holland reluctantly and deliberately tried to avoid Louis as much as possible.

Louis could never settle on the location of his capital city while he was in Holland. He changed capitals over a dozen times, trying Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and other places. On one occasion, after visiting the home of a wealthy Dutch merchant, he liked the place so much that he had the owner evicted so he could take up residence there. Then, Louis moved again after seven weeks. His constant moving kept the court in upheaval since they had to follow him everywhere. The European diplomatic corps went so far as to petition Bonaparte to remain in one place so they could keep up with him. 

Hortense bore Louis&#x27;s sons Napoléon-Charles Bonaparte and Napoléon Louis Bonaparte in Paris, while Louis was in Holland. In 1806, Louis called for his son to be sent to him in Holland, but he was again refused by Hortense, who believed that her son would never be returned to France. When Louis appealed to his brother Napoleon for help, Napoleon sided with Hortense. Napoleon kept the boy in his court, and he even had him named the heir to the French throne before the birth of his son.

Two major tragedies occurred during the reign of Louis Bonaparte: the explosion of a cargo ship loaded with gunpowder in the heart of the city of Leiden in 1807, and a major flood in Holland in 1809. In both instances, Louis personally and effectively oversaw local relief efforts, which helped earn him the title of &quot;Louis the Good&quot;. Napoleon appeared disappointed and commented: &quot;″Brother, when they say of some king or other that he is good, it means that he has failed in his rule.″&quot;

Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s reign was short-lived due to two factors. The first was that Napoleon wanted to reduce the value of French loans from Dutch investors by two-thirds, meaning a serious economic blow to the Netherlands. The second became the pretext for Napoleon&#x27;s demand of Louis&#x27;s abdication. As Napoleon was preparing an army for his invasion of Russia, he wanted troops from the entire region under his control, this included troops from the Netherlands. Louis, confronted by his brother&#x27;s demand, refused point-blank. Napoleon then accused Louis of putting Dutch interests above those of France, and removed most of the French forces in Holland for the coming war in the east, leaving only about 9,000 garrison soldiers in the country. Unfortunately for Louis, the English landed an army of 40,000 in 1809 in an attempt to capture Antwerp and Flushing. With Louis unable to defend his realm, France sent 80,000 militiamen, commanded by future King of Sweden Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, and successfully repelled the invasion. Napoleon then suggested that Louis should abdicate, citing Louis&#x27;s inability to protect Holland as a reason. Louis refused and declared the occupation of the Kingdom by a French army as unlawful. On 1 July 1810 Louis abdicated in favor of his second son, Napoleon Louis Bonaparte. He fled from Haarlem on 2/3 July and settled in Austria. Oudinot invaded Holland on 4 July. Napoleon annexed Holland to France by the Decree of Rambouillet on 9 July.

==Exile==
After his abdication, Louis Bonaparte assumed the title of Count of Saint-Leu (&quot;comte de Saint-Leu&quot;), which was a reference to his property at Saint-Leu-la-Forêt near Paris. He was appointed as the Constable of France in 1808, a strictly honorary title.

After his Dutch kingdom was taken away from him, the Austrian Emperor Francis I offered him asylum. Between 1811 and 1813, he found refuge in Graz, where he turned to writing and poetry. Louis wrote to Napoleon after the latter&#x27;s defeat in Russia to request that the Dutch throne be restored to him; however, Napoleon refused. His request to visit the Netherlands was denied several times by King William I of the Netherlands, but King William II allowed him a visit in 1840. Although traveling in the Netherlands under a false name, some people found out that it was their former king, which led to a cheering crowd gathering under the window of his hotel room. It is said that he was quite moved by this demonstration of affection from his former subjects.

After the death of his eldest brother Joseph in 1844, Louis was seen by the Bonapartists as the rightful Emperor of the French, although Louis took little action himself to advance the claim. Louis&#x27;s son and heir, the future Emperor Napoleon III, on the other hand, was at that time being imprisoned in France for having attempted a Bonapartist coup d&#x27;état.

Louis Bonaparte died on 25 July 1846 in Livorno, and his remains were buried at Saint-Leu-la-Forêt, Île-de-France.

==Marriage and children==
Louis was married on 4 January 1802 to Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of the deceased general Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais, and his wife Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie. Josephine was the first wife of Louis&#x27;s brother Napoleon. Thus Hortense was also Louis&#x27;s step-niece.

This marriage had been forced upon them and was rather loveless, though they supposedly consummated it and interacted often enough to produce three sons. As a rule, the Bonapartes, except Napoleon, loathed the Beauharnaises. Hortense also certainly had extra-marital lovers.

Hortense de Beauharnais gave birth to three sons who were officially claimed by Louis Bonaparte, despite his doubts about their paternity:
# Napoleon Charles Bonaparte, born 10 October 1802, Prince Royal of Holland. When he died on 5 May 1807 at 4½ years of age, his body lay in state at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. He is buried at Saint-Leu-La-Foret, Ile-de-France.
# Napoleon Louis Bonaparte, born 11 October 1804. Became Prince Royal of Holland on his brother&#x27;s death, and was King for eight days in 1810, between his father&#x27;s abdication (1 July) and the fall of Holland to Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s invading army (9 July). Sovereign of the Grand Duchy of Berg in 1809-1813 (under regency). Napoleon Louis Bonaparte died from measles on 17 March 1831, and his remains were buried at Saint-Leu-La-Foret, Île-de-France.
# Charles Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, (1808–73). Born in Paris, he was the third and last son, and became Sovereign of the Second French Empire (1852–1870) as Emperor Napoleon III.

<text>The  (FLQ) was a militant Quebec separatist group which aimed to establish an independent and socialist Quebec through violent means. It was a terrorist group, and was labeled as such by the Canadian government. Founded sometime in the early 1960s, the FLQ conducted a number of attacks between 1963 and 1970, which totaled over 160 violent incidents and killed eight people and injured many more. These attacks culminated with the Montreal Stock Exchange bombing in 1969 and the October Crisis in 1970, the latter beginning with the kidnapping of British Trade Commissioner James Cross. In the subsequent negotiations, Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and murdered by a cell of the FLQ. Public outcry and a federal crackdown subsequently ended the crisis and resulted in a drastic loss of support for the FLQ, with a small number of FLQ members being granted refuge in Cuba.

FLQ members practiced propaganda of the deed and issued declarations that called for a socialist insurrection against oppressors identified with Anglo-Saxon imperialism, the overthrow of the Quebec government, the independence of Quebec from Canada and the establishment of a French-speaking &quot;workers&#x27; society&quot; in Quebec. It gained the support of many left-leaning students, teachers and academics up to 1970, who engaged in public strikes in solidarity with FLQ during the October Crisis. After the kidnapping of Cross, nearly 1,000 students at signed a petition supporting the FLQ manifesto. This public support largely ended after the group announced they had executed Laporte, in a public communique that ended with an insult to the victim. The KGB, which had established contact with the FLQ before 1970, later forged documents to portray them as a CIA false flag operation, a story that gained limited traction among academic sources before declassified Soviet archives revealed the ruse. By the early 1980s, most of the imprisoned FLQ members had been paroled or released.

== History ==
Members and sympathizers of the group were called &quot;Felquistes&quot; (), a word coined from the French pronunciation of the letters FLQ. Some of the members were organized and trained by Georges Schoeters, a Belgian revolutionary. FLQ members Normand Roy and Michel Lambert received guerrilla training from the Palestine Liberation Organization in Jordan. The FLQ was a loose association operating as a clandestine cell system. Various cells emerged over time: the Viger Cell founded by Robert Comeau, history professor at the ; the Dieppe Cell; the Louis Riel Cell; the Nelson Cell; the Saint-Denis Cell; the Liberation Cell; and the Chénier Cell. The last two of these cells were involved in what became known as the October Crisis. From 1963 to 1970, the FLQ committed over 200 violent actions, including bombings, bank hold-ups, kidnappings, at least three killings by FLQ bombs and two killings by gunfire. In 1966, &quot;Revolutionary Strategy and the Role of the Avant-Garde&quot; was prepared by the FLQ, outlining their long-term strategy of successive waves of robberies, violence, bombings, and kidnappings, culminating in revolution. The history of the FLQ is sometimes described as a series of &quot;waves&quot;. The ideology was based on an extreme form of Quebec nationalism that denounced Anglo exploitation and control of Quebec, combined with Marxist–Leninist ideas and arguments.

== First wave ==
The first formation of the FLQ was composed of members of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;Indépendance Nationale, some of whom wished for faster action. This group formed the , or Resistance Network. This group eventually broke up, forming the FLQ. The group was recruited among various sources, eventually recruiting one Mario Bachand. The FLQ commenced their attacks on 7 March 1963. Some of their more notable crimes include bombing a railway (by which then–Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker had arranged to travel within the week).

=== 7 March 1963 ===
* Three Molotov cocktails planted at Victoria Rifles Armory, the Royal Montreal Regiment, and at the 4th Battalion Royal 22nd Regiment (in Châteauguay). Little to no damage done.
* Leaflets with the aims of the FLQ were distributed widely throughout the city of Montreal. On the documents can be found a crude crayon coloured drawing of the resistance flag along with the following inscription: &quot;Suicide-commandos of the Quebec Liberation Front have as their mission to completely destroy, by systematic sabotage:
# &quot;All the symbols and colonial institutions (federal), in particular the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] and the armed forces.
# &quot;All the information media of the colonial language (English) which holds us in contempt.
# &quot;All enterprises and commercial establishments which practice discrimination against Quebec people, which do not use French as their primary language, which have signs in the colonial language (English).
# &quot;All the factories that discriminate against French-speaking workers&quot;

=== 1 April 1963 ===
* A saboteur with a bomb caused minor damage to a section of rail between Montreal and Quebec City in the town of Lemieux. It appeared to go unnoticed as traffic continued on the rail line. An engineer eventually called in a &quot;rough spot&quot; that needed repair and a maintenance crew was immediately dispatched for repairs in time for Prime Minister Diefenbaker to travel through shortly after.
* A bomb is detonated in the ventilation system of the Department of National Revenue. No one is injured.
* The words and the letters &quot;FLQ&quot; are written on the official residence of the Quebec lieutenant governor, Paul Comtois.

=== 12 April 1963 ===
* In response to increased FLQ activities, 50 police officers conducted predawn raids on the homes of 15 suspected members of the FLQ.

=== 20 April 1963 ===
* Shortly before 1:00am, an individual claiming to be a member of the FLQ called the Canadian Press and announced &quot;Operation Jean Lesage has started.&quot; Soon thereafter a stick of dynamite exploded outside the RCMP headquarters. No one was injured.
* At approximately 11:45pm a bomb detonated at the Canadian Army Recruiting Centre in Montreal. A 65-year-old furnaceman, William Vincent O&#x27;Neill, was killed instantly.

=== 17 May 1963 ===
* In the early morning 11 mailboxes in Westmount were planted with time bombs. Five exploded at 3am. Nine of the remaining ten bombs were successfully dismantled. One bomb, planted by Jean-Denis Lamoureux, critically wounded a Canadian military bomb disposal expert, Walter Leja.

=== 20 May 1963 ===
* One car was completely destroyed and three others severely damaged when a car bomb detonated outside the Corps of Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) building in what was the largest explosion at the hands of the FLQ. No one was injured.
* Multiple harmless bomb threats are received throughout the province of Quebec. Only one threat resulted in finding sticks of dynamite.

By 1 June 1963, eight members of the FLQ were arrested in a surprise raid. In 1963, Gabriel Hudon and Raymond Villeneuve were sentenced to 12 years in prison after their bomb killed William V. O&#x27;Neill, a furnaceman at Montreal&#x27;s Canadian Army Recruiting Centre. Their targets also included English-owned businesses, banks, McGill University, Loyola College and the Black Watch Armoury.

== Second wave ==
A group of six individuals, two of whom were brothers of FLQ members arrested in 1963 (Robert Hudon and Jean Gagnon), commenced a series of crimes in Quebec over a period between 26 September 1963 and 9 April 1964. They called themselves the Quebec Liberation Army (), and stole approximately ( when adjusted for inflation as of 2023) in goods and money. Most of these individuals were also released by 1967.

== Third wave ==
A larger group of revolutionaries became known as the &quot;Revolutionary Army of Quebec&quot; (). This group attempted to focus on training, particularly in St. Boniface. A botched gun warehouse robbery on 29 August 1964 resulted in two deaths, the company&#x27;s vice-president Leslie McWilliams and gunsmith Alfred Pinisch. Other employees were lined up to be shot when Pinisch burst upon the scene. Cyr Delisle, Gilles Brunet, Marcel Tardif, (a French Foreign Legion veteran), and Edmond Guenette, the five members arrested in connection with the deaths of MacWilliams and Pinisch, workers at the store, were sentenced to life in prison. A number of other members of the FLQ were arrested as well.

== Fourth wave ==

Charles Gagnon and Pierre Vallières combined their &quot;Popular Liberation Movement&quot; with the FLQ in July 1965. This also combined several other pro-sovereignty groups. This may have led to a more socialist FLQ attitude. This new group robbed a New Democratic Party office and a radio station for supplies, many of which were used to write , the revolutionary paper published by the FLQ during the many years of activity. It translates to &quot;The Hit (Knock)&quot;. The 4th wave saw the increasing use of explosives, the production styles of which were sometimes detailed in . A 15-year-old FLQ member, Jean Corbo, was killed by his own explosive, and a 64-year-old female office worker died during the FLQ bombing of the shoe factory Lagrenade.

By August 1966, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had arrested many FLQ members. Gagnon and Vallières had fled to the United States, where they protested in front of the United Nations and were later arrested. It was during his incarceration that Vallières wrote his book &quot;White Niggers of America&quot;. In September 1967, the pair were extradited to Canada.

In 1968, after various riots within Quebec and in Europe, a new group of FLQ was formed. Within a year, this group of Felquistes had exploded 52 bombs. Rather than , they wrote , or &quot;Victory&quot;. The various members of the group were arrested by 2 May 1969.

== Attacks ==
On 13 February 1969, the FLQ set off a powerful bomb that ripped through the Montreal Stock Exchange causing massive destruction and seriously injuring 27 people. After another series of bombings, on 28 September 1969, they bombed the home of Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau. After the bombing, police concluded that the bomb was placed in the toilet so inspectors could not find it.

The year 1969 also saw many riots, including one against McGill University. The RCMP had intercepted intelligence relating to the planned riots, and prevented excessive damage. This failed riot led to Mario Bachand leaving Canada, and another group of FLQ forming, which would become responsible for the October Crisis. This group, formed of Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard, and Nigel Hamer became known as the &quot;South Shore Gang&quot;.

On 5 May 1969, FLQ members Jean-Pierre Charette and Alain Alard, who had previously fled from Canada to the U.S., hijacked a National Airlines Boeing 727 in New York, and diverted it to Cuba.

During the police strike of 1969, the &quot;Taxi Liberation Front&quot;, a creation of the &quot;Popular Liberation Front&quot;, which was itself the creation of Jacques Lanctôt and Marc Carbonneau, killed a police officer. Jacques Lanctôt is credited by Michael McLoughlin, author of &quot;Last Stop, Paris: The Assassination of Mario Bachand and the Death of the FLQ&quot;, with writing the FLQ Manifesto during the prelude to the October Crisis.

The South Shore Gang bought a house, which they named &quot;The Little Free Quebec&quot;, and it quickly became a den of the FLQ. Jacques Lanctôt was charged in connection with a failed FLQ kidnapping attempt of an Israeli diplomat, and in 1970, while a member of the FLQ, likely took refuge at &quot;The Little Free Quebec&quot;. These new FLQ members bought two other houses, prepared their plans, and stocked sufficient equipment for their upcoming actions.

The group was divided over what plans should be taken, but were reunited during the crisis itself.

== October Crisis ==
On 5 October 1970, members of the FLQ&#x27;s Liberation Cell kidnapped James Richard Cross, the British Trade Commissioner, as he was leaving his home for work. Shortly afterwards, on 10 October, the Chénier Cell kidnapped the Minister of Labour and Vice-Premier of Quebec, Pierre Laporte. Laporte was coming from a meeting with others where they had discussed the demands of the FLQ.

In the following days, FLQ leaders held meetings to increase public support for the cause. Consequently, a general strike involving students, teachers and professors resulted in the closure of most French-language secondary and post-secondary academic institutions. On 15 October 1970, more than 3,000 students attended a protest rally in favour of the FLQ. Demonstrations of public support influenced subsequent government actions.

After having held Laporte for a week, FLQ killed Laporte. On 17 October, callers to a radio station announced that Laporte had been murdered and divulged the location of a map which led to the discovery of his body.

The FLQ released a list of demands for Cross&#x27;s release:
# The release of 23 &quot;political prisoners&quot; (including: Cyriaque Delisle, Edmond Guenette and François Schirm, Serge Demers, Marcel Faulkner, Gérard Laquerre, Robert Lévesque, Réal Mathieu, and Claude Simard; Pierre-Paul Geoffroy, Michel Loriot, Pierre Demers, Gabriel Hudon, Robert Hudon, Marc-André Gagné, François Lanctôt, Claude Morency, and André Roy; Pierre Boucher and André Ouellette)
# The FLQ members André Lessard, Pierre Marcil, and Réjean Tremblay, who were out on bail at the time of the kidnappings, should be allowed to leave Quebec if they wanted.
# All family members of the &quot;political prisoners&quot; and those out on bail should be able to join them outside of Quebec.
# $500,000 in gold
# The broadcast and publication of the FLQ Manifesto
# The publication of the name of a police informant
# A helicopter to take the kidnappers to Cuba or Algeria and while doing so they would be accompanied by their lawyers
# The rehiring of about 450 Lapalme postal workers who had been laid off because of their support of the FLQ
# The cessation of all police search activities

The FLQ also stipulated how the above demands would be carried out:
# The prisoners were to be taken to the Montreal airport and supplied a copy of the FLQ Manifesto. They were to be allowed to communicate with each other and become familiar with the Manifesto.
# They were not to be dealt with in a harsh or brutal manner.
# They must be able to communicate with their lawyers to discuss the best course of action, whether to leave Quebec or not. As well, these lawyers must receive passage back to Quebec.

As part of its Manifesto, the FLQ stated: &quot;In the coming year Bourassa (Quebec premier Robert Bourassa) will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized.&quot;

Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, in his statement to the press during the October Crisis, admitted that the radicalism occurring in Quebec at this time had bred out of social unease due to imperfect legislation. &quot;The government has pledged that it will introduce legislation which deals not only with the symptoms but with the social causes which often underlie or serve as an excuse for crime and disorder.&quot; (Pierre Trudeau, CBC interview). However, despite this admission, Trudeau declared in his statement to the press that in order to deal with the unruly radicals or &quot;revolutionaries,&quot; the federal government would invoke the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, the first time the country used these powers during peacetime.

Invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was a politically risky move for Trudeau because the Act overrode fundamental rights and privileges enumerated in the common law and in the Canadian Bill of Rights; therefore, there was a strong possibility that Trudeau might have lost popular support among Quebec voters. However, this did not occur.

In an impromptu interview with Tim Ralfe and Peter Reilly on the steps of Parliament, Pierre Trudeau, responding to a question of how extreme his implementation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; would be, Trudeau answered, &quot;Well, just watch me.&quot; This line has become a part of Trudeau&#x27;s legacy.

Early in December 1970, police discovered the location of the kidnappers holding James Cross. His release was negotiated and on 3 December 1970, five of the FLQ members were granted their request for safe passage to Cuba by the Government of Canada after approval by Fidel Castro.

As a result of the invocation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, civil liberties were suspended. By 29 December 1970, police had arrested 453 people with suspected ties to the FLQ. Some detainees were released within hours, while others were held for up to 21 days. Several persons who were detained were initially denied access to legal counsel. Of the 453 people who were arrested, 435 were eventually released without being charged.

On 13 December 1970, Pierre Vallières announced in that he had terminated his association with the FLQ. As well, Vallières renounced the use of terrorism as a means of political reform and instead advocated the use of standard political action.

In late December, four weeks after the kidnappers of James Cross were found, Paul Rose and the kidnappers and murderers of Pierre Laporte were found hiding in a country farmhouse. They were tried and convicted for kidnapping and murder.

The events of October 1970 contributed to the loss of support for violent means to attain Quebec independence, and increased support for a political party, the Parti Québécois, which took power in 1976.

In July 1980, police arrested and charged a sixth person in connection with the Cross kidnapping. Nigel Hamer, a British radical socialist and FLQ sympathizer, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months in jail.

== Decline ==
Police deterrence and flagging public support contributed to the decline of the FLQ. By 1971, the Montreal Police anti-terrorist unit had highly placed informants within the FLQ organization, a cell of seven members were arrested on 5 October, the one year anniversary of the Cross kidnapping, and in December 1971 four FLQ members were arrested by a police force.

The support and political capacity of the FLQ changed drastically during the 1970s. The FLQ immediately lost public support after the October crisis and the murder of Laporte. The general public overwhelmingly supported the emergency powers and the presence of the military in Quebec. Laporte&#x27;s murder marked a crossroads in the political history of the FLQ. It helped sway public opinion towards more conventional forms of political participation and drove up popular support for the Parti Québécois (PQ).

The rise of the PQ attracted both active and would-be participants away from the FLQ. In December 1971, Pierre Vallières emerged after three years in hiding to announce that he was joining the PQ. In justifying his decision he described the FLQ as a &quot;shock group&quot; whose continued activities would only play into the hands of the forces of repression against which they were no match. Those members of the FLQ who had fled began returning to Canada from late 1971 until 1982, and most received light sentences for their offences.

== KGB involvement ==

According to Christopher Andrew&#x27;s and Vasili Mitrokhin&#x27;s book based on the Mitrokhin archive, the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB likely established contact with the FLQ.

The KGB was concerned that the FLQ&#x27;s attacks could be linked to the Soviet Union. It designed a disinformation campaign and forged documents to portray the FLQ as a CIA false flag operation. A photocopy of the forged &quot;CIA document&quot; was &quot;leaked&quot; to the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; in September 1971. The operation was so successful that Canada&#x27;s prime minister believed that the CIA had conducted operations in Canada. The story was still quoted in the 1990s, even among academic authors.

Gosling initially allowed Gosling Emacs to be redistributed with no formal restrictions, as required by the &quot;Emacs commune&quot; since the 1970s, only asking for a letter acknowledging his authorship. Later, wishing to move on and after a failed search for people who would maintain it under the same rights, he finally sold his version of Emacs to UniPress because they agreed to sell it under reasonable terms. The dispute between Richard Stallman and UniPress inspired the creation of the first formal license for Emacs, which later became the GPL, as Congress had introduced copyright for software in 1980.

==Features==

Gosling Emacs was especially noteworthy because of the effective redisplay code, which used a dynamic programming technique to solve the classical string-to-string correction problem. The algorithm was quite sophisticated; that section of the source was headed by a skull-and-crossbones in ASCII art, warning any would-be improver that even if they thought they understood how the display code worked, they probably did not.

==Distribution==

Since Gosling had permitted its unrestricted redistribution, Richard Stallman used some Gosling Emacs code in the initial version of GNU Emacs. Among other things, he rewrote part of the Gosling code headed by the skull-and-crossbones comment and made it &quot;...shorter, faster, clearer and more extensible.&quot;

In 1983 UniPress began selling Gosling Emacs on Unix for $395 and on VMS for $2,500, marketing it as &quot;EMACS–multi-window text editor (Gosling version)&quot;.

Controversially, Unipress asked Stallman to stop distributing his version of Emacs for Unix.
UniPress never took legal action against Stallman or his nascent Free Software Foundation, believing &quot;hobbyists and academics could never produce an Emacs that could compete&quot; with their product. All Gosling Emacs code was removed from GNU Emacs by version 16.56 (July 1985), with the possible exception of a few particularly involved sections of the display code. The latest versions of GNU Emacs (since August 2004) do not feature the skull-and-crossbones warning.

==Extension language==
Its extension language, Mocklisp, has a syntax that appears similar to Lisp, but Mocklisp does not have lists, only strings and arrays. The Mocklisp interpreter, built by Gosling and a collaborator, was replaced by a full Lisp interpreter in GNU Emacs.

<text>Hannelore (Hanni) Wenzel (born 14 December 1956) is a retired Liechtensteiner alpine ski racer. Wenzel is a former Olympic, World Cup, and world champion. She won Liechtenstein&#x27;s first-ever Olympic medal at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, and its first two Olympic gold medals four years later in Lake Placid, New York.

==Biography==
Born in West Germany at Straubing, Bavaria, Wenzel moved to Liechtenstein at an early age. After she and her younger brother Andreas had success in ski racing – Hanni won the gold medal in slalom and silver in the combined at the 1974 World Championships – the family was granted Liechtenstein citizenship. Winning the slalom title on 8 February 1974, she did become the youngest female Alpine Skiing World Champion in the slalom discipline (17 years, 1 month, 25 days) - ousting Esme Mackinnon who was the first female Alpine Skiing Champion in 1931; the British racer was 17 years, 2 month and 17 days young when she was victorious in the slalom race on 19 February 1931. 
At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, she won the country&#x27;s first Olympic medal, a bronze in the slalom at Axamer Lizum, and also picked up another world championship medal in the combined.

After winning the World Cup overall title in 1978, Wenzel&#x27;s best year came in 1980. At the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, she won gold medals in the slalom and giant slalom, and just missed out on a sweep by taking the silver in the downhill at Whiteface Mountain. She also easily won the world championship gold medal in the combined event, its final edition as a &quot;paper race&quot; and her fourth world championship medal in that event. At the same Olympics, her brother also won a silver medal, placing Liechtenstein high in the medal ranking of the games. In addition to her Olympic success, she won nine World Cup races in 1980 and captured the overall, giant slalom, and combined season titles, and brother Andreas won the men&#x27;s overall for a Wenzel family sweep of the overall titles. Her daughter Tina Weirather won a bronze medal in Super-G for Liechtenstein at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.

Wenzel was banned from the 1984 Winter Olympics by the International Ski Federation (FIS) for accepting promotional payments directly, rather than through the national ski federation. Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden was also banned; both were double gold medalists in 1980.

Wenzel retired following the 1984 season with two Olympic titles, four World titles, two overall World Cups, three discipline World Cups plus three combined titles, and 33 World Cup victories. (Through 1980, the Olympics were also the World Championships.)

Through the 2018 Winter Olympics, Liechtenstein has won a total of ten medals at the Winter Olympics, with eight won by two sets of siblings – the Wenzels earned six, while brothers Willi and Paul Frommelt are responsible for two more.

==World cup results==
===Season titles===
7 titles – (2 overall, 2 giant slalom, 1 slalom, 2 combined)
===Season standings===
===Race victories===
* 33 wins – (11 SL, 12 GS, 2 DH, 8 K)

==Family==
Wenzel is a sister of World Cup ski racers Petra Wenzel and Andreas Wenzel, and the wife of Austrian ski racer Harti Weirather, the world champion in downhill in 1982. Wenzel and Weirather run their own sports marketing agency, and their daughter Tina Weirather is also a World Cup ski racer.

==Honours==
* Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Principality of Liechtenstein (06/09/2017).

<doc id="59673" wikidata="Q1707" url="?curid=59673" title="Kiel">
<text>Kiel ( , ) is the capital and most populous city in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. With a population of around 250,000, it is Germany&#x27;s largest city on the Baltic Sea. It is located on the Kieler Förde inlet of the Bay of Kiel and lies in the southeast of the Jutland Peninsula, on the mouth of the Schwentine River, approximately northeast of Hamburg. The world&#x27;s busiest artificial waterway, the Kiel Canal, has a terminus in Kiel&#x27;s Holtenau district. This canal connects the Baltic to the North Sea, with its other end in Brunsbüttel. Most of Kiel is part of Holstein. The boroughs north of the Schwentine also belong to Wagria, while those north of the Kiel Canal are historically part of Southern Schleswig.

Kiel is one of Germany&#x27;s major maritime centres, known for a variety of international sailing events, including the annual Kiel Week, which is the biggest sailing event in the world. Kiel is also known for the Kiel Mutiny, when sailors refused orders to prepare to engage the British Navy in the last weeks of World War I, sparking the German Revolution, which led to the abdication of the Kaiser and the formation of the Weimar Republic. The Olympic sailing competitions of the 1936 and the 1972 Summer Olympics were held in the Bay of Kiel.

Kiel has also been one of the traditional homes of the German Navy&#x27;s Baltic fleet, and continues to be a major high-tech shipbuilding centre. The University of Kiel, founded in 1665, is home to the GEOMAR – Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. Kiel is an important sea transport hub, with passenger ferries to Sweden, Norway, Lithuania and other countries. Moreover, today the Port of Kiel is a popular destination for cruise ships touring the Baltic Sea.

Kiel&#x27;s recorded history began in the 13th century. Before then, in the eighth century, it was a Danish village. Until 1864 it was administered by Denmark in personal union. In 1866 the city was annexed by Prussia and in 1871 it became part of Germany.

Kiel was one of the founding cities of the original European Green Capital Award in 2006. In 2005 Kiel&#x27;s GDP per capita was €35,618, which is well above Germany&#x27;s national average, and 159% of the European Union&#x27;s average.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
The city of Kiel was founded in 1233 as &quot;Holstenstadt tom Kyle&quot; by Count Adolf IV of Holstein, and granted Lübeck city rights in 1242 by Adolf&#x27;s eldest son, John I of Schauenburg. As a part of Holstein, Kiel belonged to the Holy Roman Empire and was situated only a few kilometres south of the Danish border.
The capital of the county (later duchy) of Holstein, Kiel was a member of the Hanseatic League from 1284 until it was expelled in 1518 for harbouring pirates. The &quot;Kieler Umschlag&quot; (trade fair), first held in 1431, became the central market for goods and money in the Duchy of Holstein. It began to decline and ceased in 1900.

=== Modern times ===
The University of Kiel was founded on 29 September 1665 by Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. A number of important scholars, including Theodor Mommsen, Felix Jacoby, Hans Geiger and Max Planck, studied or taught there.
From 1773 to 1864, the town belonged to the king of Denmark. However, because the king ruled Holstein as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire only through a personal union, the town was not incorporated as part of Denmark proper. Even though the empire was abolished in 1806, the Danish king continued to rule Kiel only through his position as Duke of Holstein, which became a member of the German Confederation in 1815. When Schleswig and Holstein rebelled against Denmark in 1848 (the First Schleswig War), Kiel became the capital of Schleswig-Holstein until the Danish victory in 1850.

During the Second Schleswig War in 1864, Kiel and the rest of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were conquered by a German Confederation alliance of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. After the war, Kiel was briefly administered by both the Austrians and the Prussians, but the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 led to the formation of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein and the annexation of Kiel by Prussia in 1867. On 24 March 1865 King William I based Prussia&#x27;s Baltic Sea fleet in Kiel instead of Danzig (Gdańsk). The Imperial shipyard Kiel was established in 1867 in the town.

When William I of Prussia became Emperor William I of the German Empire in 1871, he designated Kiel and Wilhelmshaven as &quot;Reichskriegshäfen&quot; (&quot;Imperial War Harbours&quot;). The Kiel Yacht Club was established in 1887 with Prince Henry of Prussia as its patron. Emperor Wilhelm II became its commodore in 1891.

Because of its new role as Germany&#x27;s main naval base, Kiel very quickly increased in size in the following years, from 18,770 in 1864 to about 200,000 in 1910. Much of the old town centre and other surroundings were levelled and redeveloped to provide for the growing city. The Kiel tramway network, opened in 1881, had been enlarged to 10 lines, with a total route length of , before the end of the First World War.

Kiel was the site of the sailors&#x27; mutiny which led to the German Revolution in late 1918. Just before the end of the First World War, the German fleet stationed at Kiel was ordered to sail out for a last great battle with the Royal Navy. The sailors, who thought of it as a suicide mission which would have no effect on the outcome of the war, decided they had nothing to lose and refused to obey orders. They took over Kiel and then spread out to other north German ports, sparking the revolution which led to the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the Weimar Republic.

During the Second World War, Kiel remained one of the major naval bases and shipbuilding centres of the German Reich. There was also a slave labour camp for the local industry. Owing to its status as a naval port and production site for submarines, Kiel was heavily bombed by the Allies during this period. The bombing destroyed more than 80% of the remaining old town, 72% of the central residential areas, and 83% of the industrial areas. During the RAF bombing of 23/24 July 1944, Luftwaffe fighters tried to intercept the spoof (i.e. decoy) force instead of the main force attacking Kiel, and there was no water for three days; trains and buses did not run for eight days and there was no gas available for cooking for three weeks. 

There were several bombing raids of the port area during the period 20 February – 20 April 1945 which successfully eliminated many U-boats, and the few large warships (cruisers Hipper, Scheer, and Köln) still afloat at that time. It and its port, and the canal were seized by a British T-Force led by Major Tony Hibbert on 5 May 1945. 

Like other heavily bombed German cities, the city was rebuilt after the war. In 1946, Kiel was named the seat of government for Schleswig-Holstein, and it officially became the state&#x27;s capital in 1952.
Today, Kiel is once again an important maritime centre of Germany, with high-tech shipbuilding, submarine construction and one of the world&#x27;s largest ocean research centers, the GEOMAR. Regular ferries to Scandinavia and Lithuania, as well as the largest sailing event in the world called the Kiel Week (Kieler Woche) in German and The Kiel Regatta in English. The &quot;Kieler Umschlag&quot; is another festival, which has been taking place again since 1975. Kiel is also home to a large service sector and a number of research institutions including the University of Kiel, which is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious university in the state.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Kiel has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dolk&quot;). Located on the Baltic Sea coast, the temperature fluctuates less than inland, with warm winters and cool summers throughout the year. The average temperature ranges from in winter to in summer. Days with a temperature above are rare, with an average of only 2.8 days per year.

The Kiel weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Highest Temperature on 20 July 2022.
* Warmest Minimum on 1 August 1994.
* Coldest Maximum on 12 February 1940.
* Lowest Temperature on 13 February 1940.
* Highest Daily Precipitation on 27 August 1989.
* Wettest Month in August 2011.
* Wettest Year in 2002.
* Driest Year in 1959.
* Longest annual sunshine: 2,115.3 hours in 1959.
* Shortest annual sunshine: 1,299.4 hours in 1987.

===Note===
=== Districts ===
Kiel has about 40 districts, but there is no standard division. The districts are traditionally grouped into 30 boroughs (Stadtteile). Another, more recent structure summarizes the districts in 18 political districts (Ortsteile). The city has 25 electoral districts.

The biggest districts, by population, are Wik (20,100), Gaarden-Ost (19,200) and Mettenhof (19,900). Gaarden, located at the southern end of the fjord, is a traditional working-class district that used to be home to mainly shipyard workers. Mettenhof is a large housing estate (satellite town) that was built in the 1960s and 1970s on the western outskirts of the city.
The city districts of Düsternbrook, Schreventeich, Ravensberg and Blücherplatz, north of the city centre, are popular places to live with many 19th century buildings, villas and tree-lined streets. The government offices, ministries and parliament of the state of Schleswig-Holstein are also mainly based in these neighbourhoods, particularly Düsternbrook. In contrast to the heavy bomb damage inflicted on the central parts of the city during the Second World War, most of the residential areas were not severely damaged. Hence, Kiel&#x27;s more modern-style inner city and Kiel&#x27;s more historic/elaborate residential areas stand in architectural contrast to one another.
There are plans for large-scale improvement and building efforts for the inner city, providing better pavements, better access to and view of the waterfront, and a generally more attractive feel to the place. These plans, most notably the &quot;Kleiner Kiel Kanal&quot;, a restoration of a historic canal that was filled in to make place for road infrastructure, are to be implemented in the next few years.

===Main sights===

The oldest building in the city is the 13th century &quot;Church of St. Nicholas&quot;, which has a sculpture by Ernst Barlach in front of it called &quot;Geistkämpfer&quot;.

Kiel is Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s largest city, and therefore Kiel&#x27;s shopping district is a major attraction, and will see further improvement and renovation efforts in the upcoming years. Kiel&#x27;s Holstenstraße (Holsten Street) is one of the longest shopping streets in Germany. The Rathaus (Town Hall), which was built in 1911, has an operating paternoster lift and the design of its tower was based on one in Venice. The square in front of it is bordered by a lake and the Opernhaus Kiel (Kiel Opera House). There are also a number of lakes and parks in the city centre, such as Schrevenpark. There are two botanical gardens, the Old Botanical Garden and the Botanischer Garten der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (or New Botanical Garden).

As Kiel is situated near the sea, the beaches to the north of Kiel, such as Strande, Kiel-Schilksee, Möltenort and Laboe, are also popular places to visit in spring and summer.

Kiel Week, also known in English as the Kiel Regatta, is the largest sailing event in the world and takes place every year in the last full week in June. Many thousands of boats and ships of all kinds and eras take part in the parade. Kiel Week is also a festival, &quot;Volksfest&quot; and fair as well as a maritime event. There are a number of yachting and sailing clubs in picturesque settings.

Kiel also features a number of museums, including zoological, geological, historical, fine art, industrial and military museums. Notable is the Stadt- und Schifffahrtsmuseum Warleberger Hof (City and Maritime Museum), which belongs to the association &quot;Museen am Meer&quot;. In addition to preserving architecture from the 16th century and historic rooms with painted stucco ceilings, it displays urban and cultural exhibits of the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly intriguing is the history of the carnival in Kiel. 

The Schifffahrtsmuseum is in the former fish market building in the harbour.

Laboe is home to the Laboe Naval Memorial and the Second World War submarine , which are both popular tourist sites.

== Population ==
Kiel has a population of 247,000. In 1946, when Kiel became the capital of Schleswig-Holstein, its population was about 214,000. Kiel is Germany&#x27;s largest coastal city and its only state capital located on the sea. In the 1950s Kiel, with its marine port, attracted members of the navy. Kiel had its highest peak of population in 1973 at 273,000. The population declined since then. Many people moved away from this city and Kiel became very poor and had a big problems with unemployed people at that time. Kiel is now a city with universities and active marine stations which attracts many young students and marines to Kiel.

<text>The Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized , that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yes–no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer that floats up into a window.

==Origin==
The functional component of the Magic 8 Ball was invented by Albert C. Carter, who was inspired by a spirit writing device used by his mother, a Cincinnati clairvoyant. When Carter approached store owner Max Levinson about stocking the device, Levinson called in Abe Bookman, Levinson&#x27;s brother-in-law, and graduate of Ohio Mechanics Institute. In 1944, Carter filed for a patent for the cylindrical device, assigning it in 1946 to Bookman, Levinson and another partner in what came to be Alabe Crafts, Inc., combining the founder&#x27;s names, Albert and Abe. Alabe marketed and sold the cylinder as The Syco-Slate. Carter died sometime before the patent was granted in 1948.

Bookman made improvements to The Syco-Slate, and in 1948 it was encased in an iridescent crystal ball. Though not successful, the revamped product caught the attention of Chicago&#x27;s Brunswick Billiards, which in 1950 commissioned Alabe Crafts to make a version in the form of a traditional black-and-white 8 ball, which was possibly inspired by a gag in the 1940 Three Stooges short film, &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot;.

==Cultural impact==

Although originally sold as a paperweight, the Magic 8 Ball remained popular for several decades as both an office toy and a children&#x27;s toy.

In 1971, Bookman sold Alabe Crafts, Inc., to Ideal Toys, which marketed the ball firmly at children. In 1987, the rights were again sold to Tyco Toys, spurring on another marketing campaign and resurgence in interest. Tyco Toys was acquired by Mattel, the current manufacturer, in 1997. Despite its numerous owners, the Magic 8 Ball has changed little in design and implementation.

==Design and usage==

The Magic 8 Ball is a hollow plastic sphere resembling a black-and-white 8 ball. Its standard size is larger than an ordinary pool ball, but it has been made in different sizes. Inside the ball, a cylindrical reservoir contains a white plastic 20-sided regular icosahedron die floating in approximately of alcohol dyed dark blue. Each of the die&#x27;s 20 faces has an affirmative, negative, or non-committal statement printed in raised letters. These messages are read through a window on the ball&#x27;s bottom.

To use the ball, it must be held with the window initially facing down to allow the die to float within the cylinder. After asking the ball a yes–no question, the user then turns the ball so that the window faces up. The die floats to the top, and one face presses against the window; the raised letters displace the blue liquid to reveal the message as white letters on a blue background. Although most users shake the ball before turning it upright, the instructions warn against doing so to avoid white bubbles.

While the Magic 8 Ball has undergone very few changes, an addition in 1975 by new owners, Ideal Toy Company, fixed the bubble problem. Its patented &quot;Bubble Free Die Agitator&quot;, an inverted funnel, reroutes the air trapped inside. The solution has been used ever since.

===Possible answers===
The 20 possible Magic 8 Ball answers were designed by Dr. Lucien Cohen, a psychology professor at the University of Cincinnati. The possible answers consist of 10 affirmative answers, five neutral and five negative.

<doc id="59682" wikidata="Q323888" url="?curid=59682" title="Heysel Stadium disaster">
<text>The Heysel Stadium disaster ( ; ; ; ) was a crowd disaster that occurred on 29 May 1985 when Juventus fans were escaping from an attack by Liverpool fans while they were pressed against a wall in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium, before the start of the 1985 European Cup final. The stadium was in need of maintenance and had not been adequately updated. It had failed inspections prior to the disaster, and the wall collapsed under the force. Thirty-nine mostly Italians and Juventus were killed and 600 were injured in the confrontation.

Approximately an hour before the Juventus–Liverpool final was due to kick off, incidents of aggression between the two sets of supporters were taking place across the flimsy divide between the Liverpool section and what was intended to have been the &quot;neutral&quot; section, populated by those who had purchased tickets in Belgium. The throwing of objects back and forth led to larger scale physical the chicken wire fence was ripped down, and after initial fighting, the fans in the neutral section began to run away from the Liverpool fans who had become involved and in the direction of the wall. They charged at Juventus supporters and breached a fence that was separating them from a &quot;neutral area&quot;. Fans already standing near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed, providing an escape route for some while contributing to the fatalities. Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the pre-match incidents by authorities and organizers&#x27; joint decision for public policy doctrine reasons after a state of siege was declared in the city, with Juventus winning 1–0.

The tragedy resulted in all English football clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990–91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional three years, later reduced to one, and 14 Liverpool fans were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment. The disaster was later described as &quot;the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions&quot;.

== Background ==
In May 1985, Liverpool were the defending European Champions&#x27; Cup winners, having won the competition after defeating Roma on penalties in the previous season&#x27;s final. Again, they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, which had won unbeaten the 1983–84 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Juventus had a team of many of Italy&#x27;s 1982 World Cup winning team, which played for Juventus for many years, and its playmaker, Michel Platini, was considered the best footballer in Europe and was named Footballer of The Year by the magazine &quot;France Football&quot; for the second year in a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the previous season and were regarded by the specialist press as the two best teams on the continent. Both teams had contested the 1984 European Super Cup four months earlier, with a 2–0 victory for the Italian team.

Despite its status as Belgium&#x27;s national stadium, Heysel Stadium was in a poor state of repair by the 1985 European Cup final. The 55-year-old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years, and large parts of the facility were literally crumbling. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and Liverpool fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in the wall to get in. In some areas of the stadium, there was only one turnstile, and some fans attending the game claimed that they were never searched or asked for their tickets.

Liverpool players and fans reportedly expressed surprise at the stadium&#x27;s condition, despite reports from Arsenal fans that the ground was a &quot;dump&quot; when Arsenal had played there a few years earlier. They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition, especially since Barcelona&#x27;s Camp Nou and Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu were both available. Juventus President Giampiero Boniperti and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to choose another venue and claimed that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Cup final, especially one involving two prominent European clubs. However, UEFA refused to consider a move. It was later discovered that UEFA&#x27;s inspection of the stadium had lasted just thirty minutes.

The stadium was crammed with 58,000 to 60,000 supporters, with more than 25,000 for each team. The two ends behind the goals comprised all-standing terraces, each end split into three zones. The Juventus end was O, N, and M, and the Liverpool end was X, Y, and Z, as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster. However, the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium. The idea of the large neutral area was opposed by both Liverpool and Juventus, as it would provide an opportunity for fans of both clubs to obtain tickets from agencies or from ticket touts outside the ground and thereby create a dangerous mix of fans.

At the time, Belgium already had a large Italian community; many expatriate Juventus fans from Brussels, Liège and Charleroi bought Section Z tickets. Also, many tickets were bought up and sold by travel agents, mainly to Juventus fans. That meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section, which was nominally reserved for neutrals. Reportedly, Liverpool fans were still smarting from being attacked by Roma ultras at the 1984 European Cup final and placed next to what amounted to another Juventus section heightened tensions before the match. A small percentage of the tickets ended up in the hands of Liverpool fans.

== Confrontation ==

At approximately 7:00p.m. local time, an hour before kickoff, the initial disturbance started. The Liverpool and Juventus supporters in Sections X and Z stood merely metres apart. The boundary between the two was marked by temporary chain link fencing and a central thinly-policed no man&#x27;s land. Hooligans began to throw flares, bottles and stones across the divide and picked up stones from the crumbling terraces beneath them.

As kickoff approached, the exchange of objects increased. Eventually angry Liverpool fans charged towards the Juventus fans, the boundary between Section X and Z broke down, and the few police persons stationed at the divide were overpowered. As the Juventus fans started fleeing, they ran towards the concrete wall at the perimeter of Section Z. Fans standing near the wall were crushed, and as the pressure mounted the entire lower portion of the wall collapsed, burying fans underneath it as it fell. Some fans managed to climb over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured.

In retaliation for the events in Section Z, many Juventus fans advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters, but police intervention stopped the advance. A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks, bottles and stones for two hours. One Juventus fan was also seen firing a starting gun at Belgian police.

== Match ==
It was decided that the match should eventually start for public policy doctrine reasons because abandoning the match would have risked inciting further disturbances. This decision was jointly made by UEFA officials, the Italian, English and Belgian national associations, the country&#x27;s Ministry of Interior led by local Premier Wilfried Martens, Brussels Mayor Hervé Brouhon, and the city&#x27;s police force, despite the scale of the disaster, the state of siege in the City of Brussels consequently declared by the Belgian government and Juventus expressed concerns about the match proceeding. After the captains of both sides spoke to the crowd and appealed for calm, the players took the field knowing that people had died. Years later, Liverpool captain Phil Neal said that in hindsight, it would have been &quot;a better decision&quot; to call off the game.

Juventus won the match 1–0 thanks to a penalty scored by Platini, which was awarded by the Swiss referee, Daina, for a foul against Zbigniew Boniek.

At the end of the game, the trophy was given in front of the stadium&#x27;s Honor Stand by UEFA President Jacques Georges to Juventus Captain Gaetano Scirea. The chants of fans of both teams in the stands and the massive invasion of the pitch by journalists and fans at the end of the match generated the collective hysteria. Some of the Italian club players celebrated the title in the middle of the pitch in front of their fans in the M section, and some of the Liverpool players applauded their fans between the X and Z sections.

Liverpool players only realised the extent of the tragedy when they boarded their bus at a Brussels hotel to go to the airport, when a crowd of Juventus supporters surrounded the bus. Police had to escort the bus out of the lot. The police allowed Liverpool&#x27;s bus to drive directly onto the tarmac at Brussels Airport to prevent potential disturbances at the terminal.

== Victims ==
Of the 39 people killed, 32 were Italian (including two minors), four Belgian, two French, and one from Northern Ireland.

== Investigation ==
The investigation focused on the actions of Liverpool fans. On 30 May, official UEFA observer Gunter Schneider said, &quot;Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt.&quot; UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an eighteen-month investigation, the dossier of leading Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. The investigation concluded that Liverpool fans bore responsibility.

=== Effect on stadiums ===
After Heysel, English clubs began to impose stricter rules intended to make it easier to prevent troublemakers from attending domestic games, with legal provision to exclude troublemakers for three months introduced in 1986, and the Football (Disorder) Act 2000 introduced in 1991.

Serious progress on legal banning orders preventing foreign travel to matches was arguably not made until the violence involving England fans (allegedly mainly involving neo-Nazi groups, such as Combat 18) at a match against Ireland on 15 February 1995 and violent scenes at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Rioting at UEFA Euro 2000 saw the introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers—by 2004, 2,000 banning orders were in place, compared to fewer than 100 before Euro 2000.

The main reforms to English stadiums came after the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989, which ultimately resulted in the death of 97 Liverpool fans. All-seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitch-side fencing was removed and closed-circuit cameras became widespread. Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium.

The Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for some matches of the Belgium national team until 1990, when UEFA banned Belgium from hosting a European final for a minimum of 10 years. In 1994, the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the King Baudouin Stadium. On 28 August 1995 the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany. It then hosted a major European final again on 8 May 1996 when Paris Saint-Germain defeated Rapid Vienna 1–0 to win the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

==Litigation==
British police undertook a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice. Some seventeen minutes of film and many still photographs were examined. &quot;TV Eye&quot; produced an hour-long programme featuring the footage while British newspapers published the photographs.

A total of 34 people were arrested and questioned with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter—the only extraditable offence applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February–March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison, but, over the subsequent months, judges permitted their release as the start of the trial was further delayed.

The trial eventually began in October 1988, with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster: Albert Roosens, the head of the Belgian Football Association, for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans; and two police chiefs—Michel Kensier and Johan Mahieu—who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night. Two of the 26 Liverpool fans were in custody in Britain at the time and stood trial later. In April 1989, fourteen fans were convicted and given three-year sentences, half of which were suspended for five years, allowing them to return to the UK. One man who was acquitted was Ronnie Jepson, who would go on to make 414 appearances over a thirteen-year career in the English Football League.

== Aftermath ==
===English club ban===

Pressure mounted to ban English clubs from European competition. On 31 May 1985, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked The Football Association (the FA) to withdraw English clubs from European competition before they were banned, but two days later, UEFA banned English clubs for &quot;an indeterminate period of time&quot;. On 6 June, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) extended this ban to all worldwide matches, but this was modified a week later to allow friendly matches outside of Europe to take place. In December 1985, FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe, though the Belgian government banned any English clubs from playing in their country.

Though the England national team was not subjected to any bans, English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions, with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years&#x27; suspension as well. In April 1989, following years of campaigning from the English football authorities, UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs (with the exception of Liverpool) into its competitions from the 1990–91 season onward effective from 11 July 1990. In April 1991 UEFA&#x27;s executive committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the 1991–92 season onward, a year later than their compatriots, but two years earlier than initially foreseen. In the end, all English clubs served a five-year-ban, while Liverpool were excluded for six years.

According to former Liverpool striker Ian Rush, who signed with Juventus a year later, he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy.

====England&#x27;s UEFA coefficient====
Prior to the introduction of the ban, England were ranked first in the UEFA coefficient ranking due to the performance of English clubs in European competition in the previous five seasons. Throughout the ban, England&#x27;s points were kept in the ranking until they would have naturally been replaced.

The places vacated by English clubs in the UEFA Cup were reallocated to the best countries who would usually only have two spots in the competition—countries ranked between ninth and twenty-first. For the 1985–86 UEFA Cup, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands were granted an additional spot each, while in 1986–87, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, France, and East Germany were the recipients. The 1987–88 season saw Portugal, Austria, and Sweden gain an additional place, with Sweden and Yugoslavia gaining the places for the 1988–89 competition. The final year of the English ban, 1989–90 saw Austria receive a spot, while a play-off round was played between a French and a Yugoslav side for the final space—due to the two countries having the same number of points in the ranking.

England was removed from the rankings in 1990 due to having no points. England did not return to the top of the coefficient rankings until 2008.

====Banned clubs====
The following clubs were denied entry to European competitions during this period:
The number of places available to English clubs in the UEFA Cup would however have been reduced had English teams been eliminated early in the competition. By the time of the re-admittance of all English clubs except Liverpool in 1990–91, England was only granted one UEFA Cup entrant (awarded to the league runners-up); prior to the ban, they had four entry slots, a number not awarded to England again under regular means.

Welsh clubs playing in the English league system, who could qualify for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup via the Welsh Cup, were unaffected by the ban. Bangor City (1985–86), Wrexham (1986–87), Merthyr Tydfil (1987–88), Cardiff City (1988–89), and Swansea City (1989–90) all competed in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup during the ban on English clubs, despite playing in the English league system.

In the meantime, many other clubs missed out on a place in the UEFA Cup due to the return of English clubs to European competitions only being gradual—in 1990, the league had no UEFA coefficient points used to calculate the number of teams, and even though Manchester United won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the first season of returning in 1990–91, it took several more years for England to win back the points to the previous level, due to the coefficient being calculated over a five-year period and there being a one-year delay between the publication of the rankings and their impact on club allocation.

Liverpool&#x27;s additional year of exclusion from Europe meant that there was no English representation in the 1990–91 European Cup, as they were 1989–90 Football League First Division champions.

====Repercussions on UEFA Cup qualification====
Due to the weak coefficient, Football League Cup winners Nottingham Forest also missed out on UEFA Cup places in 1990–91, along with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The teams who missed out on the 1991–92 UEFA Cup, for the same reason were Sheffield Wednesday, Crystal Palace, and Leeds United. Arsenal and Manchester City were unable to take part for the 1992–93 competition. For 1993–94, Blackburn Rovers and Queens Park Rangers would have qualified.

Leeds United missed out in 1994–95 and initially 1995–96, though they qualified for the latter via the new UEFA Fair Play ranking, which at the time gave their three top-ranking associations&#x27; highest-placed team who&#x27;ve not already qualified for Europe a UEFA Cup spot. Remaining outside the top three of the coefficient rankings, England retained its three UEFA Cup berths instead of four. Sixth-placed Everton lost a Fair Play berth for 1996–97 by UEFA, as punishment for the FA due to Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon fielding weakened teams in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

By this point, while England&#x27;s coefficient was no longer directly affected by the ban due to it being outside of the five-year window, their coefficient continued to be affected by years of under-representation in the competition. As a result, Aston Villa missed out via their league position for 1997–98 and 1998–99 but qualified for both through Fair Play. Restructuring of UEFA competitions for 1999–2000 gave the top six associations of the coefficient ranking three UEFA Cup berths (the top three gained four Champions League berths, whilst 4–6 got three), which England now reached, whilst associations ranked seventh and eighth were given four berths for the competition.

== Commemorations ==

In 1985, a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea, Turin. The monument includes an epitaph written by Torinese journalist Giovanni Arpino. Since 2001 to 2017 it has been situated in front of the club&#x27;s headquarters in Corso Galileo Ferraris and since then in Juventus Headquarter.In 1991, another memorial monument for the 39 victims of the disaster, was inaugurated in Reggio Emilia, the hometown of the victim Claudio Zavaroni, in front of Stadio Mirabello: every year the committee &quot;Per non dimenticare Heysel&quot; (In order not to forget Heysel) holds a ceremony on 29 May with relatives of the victims, representatives of Juventus, survivors and various supporters clubs from various football clubs, including Inter Milan, Milan AC, Reggiana and Torino. During Euro 2000, members of the Italian team left flowers on the site in honour of the victims.

On 29 May 2005, a £140,000 sculpture was unveiled at the new Heysel stadium, to commemorate the disaster. The monument is a sundial designed by French artist Patrick Rimoux and includes Italian and Belgian stone and the poem &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; by Englishman W. H. Auden to symbolise the sorrow of the three countries. Thirty-nine lights shine, one for each who died that night.

On Wednesday 26 May 2010, a permanent plaque was unveiled on the Centenary Stand at Anfield to honour the Juventus fans who died 25 years earlier. This plaque is one of two permanent memorials to be found at Anfield, along with one for the 97 fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. In May 2012, a Heysel Memorial was unveiled in the J-Museum at Turin. There is also a tribute to the disaster&#x27;s victims in the club&#x27;s &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; in front of the Juventus Stadium. Two years later Juventus&#x27; officials announced a memorial in the Continassa headquarter. In February 2014, an exhibition in Turin was dedicated both to the Heysel tragedy and Superga air disaster. The name of the exhibition was &quot;Settanta angeli in un unico cielo – Superga e Heysel tragedie sorelle&quot; (70 angels in the one same heaven – Superga and Heysel sister tragedies) and gathered material from 4 May 1949 and 29 May 1985.

On 12 November 2015, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), Juventus&#x27; representatives led by Mariella Scirea and J-Museum president Paolo Garimberti and members of the Italian victims association held a ceremony in front of the Heysel monument in King Baudouin Stadium for the 30th anniversary of the event. The following day, FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio announced the retirement of &quot;Squadra Azzurra&quot;&#x27;s number 39 shirt prior to the friendly match between Italy and Belgium.

=== At games ===
A memorial service for those killed in the disaster was held before Liverpool&#x27;s match with Arsenal at Anfield on 18 August 1985, their first fixture after the disaster. However, according to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, it was &quot;drowned out&quot; by chanting.Juventus and Liverpool were drawn together in the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 Champions League, their first meeting since Heysel. Before the first leg at Anfield, Liverpool fans held up placards to form a banner saying &quot;amicizia&quot; (&quot;friendship&quot; in Italian). Most Juventus fans chose to turn their backs on it. In the return leg in Turin, Juventus fans displayed banners reading &quot;&quot;Easy to speak, difficult to pardon: Murders&quot; and &quot;15-4-89. Sheffield&quot;. &quot;God exists&quot;, the latter a reference to the Hillsborough disaster, in which 97 Liverpool fans were killed in a crush. A number of Liverpool fans were attacked in the city by Juventus ultras.

In May 2015, during a Serie A match between Juventus and Napoli at Turin, Juventus fans held up placards to form a banner saying &quot;+39 Rispetto&quot;&quot; (&quot;respect +39&quot; in Italian) including the names of the victims of the disaster.

In an interview with &quot;Planet Football&quot;, Liverpool footballer Mark Lawrenson spoke about his experience in the immediate aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster, describing it as a &quot;surreal, ugly night&quot; and &quot;a horrific chain of events.&quot;

<doc id="59684" wikidata="Q36167" url="?curid=59684" title="Huế (provincial city)">
<text>Huế () is a former provincial city of Vietnam. The city was the capital of Thừa Thiên Huế province in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam, located near the center of Vietnam. The original site was a Cham city known as Kandarpapura and later as Amarendrapura and was the capital of the Champa Kingdom from 192 to 605. On January 1, 2025, Thừa Thiên Huế province was upgraded to become Vietnam&#x27;s sixth centrally-governed municipality, named Huế. The former provincial city was dissolved to establish two new urban districts: Phú Xuân district and Thuận Hóa district. 

Following the conquest of the city in 1307 by Vietnam, it was renamed to Huế. Huế (Thuận Hóa) was the capital of Đàng Trong from 1738 to 1775 and of Vietnam during the Nguyễn dynasty from 1802 to 1945. The city served as the old Imperial City and administrative capital for the Nguyễn dynasty and later functioned as the administrative capital of the protectorate of Annam during the French Indochina period. It contains a UNESCO-designated site, the Complex of Huế Monuments, which is a popular tourist attraction. Alongside its moat and thick stone walls the complex encompasses the Imperial City of Huế, with palaces and shrines; the Forbidden Purple City, once the emperor&#x27;s home; and a replica of the Royal Theater.

Nearly 4.2 million visitors had visited the city in 2019 and many of its historic landmarks are still undergoing restoration.

==History==
The oldest ruins in Huế belong to the Kingdom of Lâm Ấp, dating back to the 4th century AD. The ruins of its capital, the ancient city of Kandarpapura (lit. &#x27;the city where Śiva burnt Kama&#x27;), is now located in Long Tho Hill, three kilometers to the west of the city. Kandarpapura might have only been established during the reign of Kandarpadharma (r. 629–640) and it was named after the king, certainly it may be not the name of the capital of former Lâm Ấp kingdom. Another Champa ruin in the vicinity, the ancient city of Hoa Chau is dated back to the 9th century.

In 1306, the King of Champa, Chế Mân offered Vietnam two Cham prefectures, Ô and Lý, in exchange for marriage with a Vietnamese (Trần dynasty) princess named Huyền Trân. The Vietnamese King Trần Anh Tông accepted this offer. He took and renamed Ô and Lý prefectures to Thuan prefecture and Hóa prefecture, respectively, the two being often referred collectively to as Thuận Hóa region.

In 1592, the Mạc dynasty was forced to flee to Cao Bằng province and the Lê emperors were enthroned as &quot;de jure&quot; Vietnamese rulers under the leadership of Nguyễn Kim, the leader of Lê dynasty loyalists. Later, Kim was poisoned by a Mạc dynasty general which paved the way for his son-in-law, Trịnh Kiểm, to take over the leadership. Kim&#x27;s eldest son, Nguyen Uông, was also assassinated in order to secure Trịnh Kiểm&#x27;s authority. Nguyễn Hoàng, another son of Nguyễn Kim, feared a fate like Nguyễn Uông&#x27;s so he pretended to have a mental illness. He asked his sister Ngoc Bao, who was a wife of Trịnh Kiểm, to entreat Trịnh Kiểm to let Nguyễn Hoàng govern Thuận Hóa, the furthest south region of Vietnam at that time.

Because Mạc dynasty loyalists were revolting in Thuận Hóa, and Trịnh Kiểm was busy fighting the Mạc dynasty&#x27;s forces in northern Vietnam during this time, Ngoc Bao&#x27;s request was approved, and Nguyễn Hoàng went south. After Hoàng pacified Thuận Hóa, he and his heir Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên secretly made this region loyal to the Nguyễn family; then they rose against the Trịnh lords. Vietnam erupted into a new civil war between two &quot;de facto&quot; ruling families: the clan of the Nguyễn lords and the clan of the Trịnh lords.

The Nguyễn lords chose Thừa Thiên, a northern territory of Thuận Hóa, as their family seat. In 1687 during the reign of Nguyễn lord Nguyễn Phúc Trăn, the construction of a citadel was started in Phú Xuân (later renamed as Huế) a village in Thừa Thiên province. The citadel was a powerful symbol of Nguyễn family rather than a defensive building because the Trịnh lords&#x27; army could not breach Nguyễn lords&#x27; defense in the northern regions of Phú Xuân. In 1744, Phú Xuân officially became the capital of central and southern Vietnam after Nguyễn lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát proclaimed himself Vo Vương (&quot;Vo King&quot; or &quot;Martial King&quot; in Vietnamese). Among westerners living in the capital at this period was the Portuguese Jesuit João de Loureiro from 1752 onwards.
However, Tây Sơn rebellions broke out in 1771 and quickly occupied a large area from Quy Nhon to Bình Thuận province, thereby weakening the authority and power of the Nguyễn lords. While the war between Tây Sơn rebellion and Nguyễn lord was being fought, the Trịnh lords sent south a massive army and easily captured Phú Xuân in 1775. After the capture of Phú Xuân, the Trịnh lords&#x27; general Hoàng Ngũ Phúc made a tactical alliance with Tây Sơn and withdrew almost all troops to Tonkin and left some troops in Phú Xuân. In 1786, Tây Sơn rebellion defeated the Trịnh garrison and occupied Phú Xuân. Under the reign of the emperor Quang Trung, Phú Xuân became the Tây Sơn dynasty capital. In 1802, Nguyen Ánh, a successor of the Nguyễn lords, recaptured Phú Xuân and unified the country. Nguyễn Ánh rebuilt the citadel entirely and made it the Imperial City capital of all of Vietnam.

In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (later Emperor Gia Long) succeeded in establishing his control over the whole of Vietnam, thereby making Hue the national capital.

The second emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty to rule from Huế, reigning from his birthday on 14 February 1820 until his death, on 20 January 1841 was Minh Mạng. He was a younger son of Emperor Gia Long, whose eldest son, Crown Prince Cảnh, had died in 1801. Minh Mạng was well known for his opposition to French involvement in Vietnam, and for his rigid Confucian orthodoxy.

During the French colonial period, Hue was in the protectorate of Annam. It remained the seat of the Imperial Palace until 1945, when Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) government was established with its capital at Ha Noi (Hanoi), in the north.

While Bảo Đại was proclaimed &quot;Head of the State of Vietnam&quot; with the help of the returning French colonialists in 1949 (although not with recognition from the communists or the full acceptance of the Vietnamese people), his new capital was Sai Gon (Saigon), in the south.

The city was also the battleground for the Battle of Huế, which was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. During the Republic of Vietnam, Hue, being very near the border between the North and South, was vulnerable in the Vietnam War. In the Tet Offensive of 1968, during the Battle of Huế, the city suffered considerable damage not only to its physical features but also to its reputation from combination of American military bombing of historic buildings held by the North Vietnamese and from the massacre at Huế.

After the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1975, many of the historic features of Huế were neglected because they were seen by the victorious communist regime and some other Vietnamese as &quot;relics from the feudal regime&quot;; the Communist Party of Vietnam (then Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam) doctrine described the Nguyễn dynasty as &quot;feudal&quot; and &quot;reactionary&quot;. With the adoption of liberalizing reforms, however, these hostile policies have been abandoned. Many historic areas of the city are being restored, and the city is quickly developing into a tourism and transportation hub for central Vietnam.

In recognition of Huế&#x27;s rapid development, the city became Vietnam&#x27;s sixth centrally-governed municipality in 2025. As part of this process, Huế annexed the rest of Thừa Thiên Huế province to streamline administration.

== Geography ==
The city is located in central Vietnam on the banks of the Hương River, just a few miles inland from the South China Sea. It is about south of Hanoi and about north of Ho Chi Minh City. Huế is bordered by Quảng Điền district and South China Sea to the north, Hương Thủy town to the south and east, Phú Vang district to the east and Hương Trà town to the west. Located on the two banks of the Hương River, north of Hải Vân Pass, from Da Nang, from Thuận An Seaport and Phu Bai International Airport and from Chân Mây Port.

Located near Trường Sơn mountain range, Huế city is a plain area in the lower reaches of the Perfume River and Bo River, with an average altitude of 3–4 m above sea level and often flooded when the river&#x27;s headwaters Hương has medium and large rainfall. This plain area is relatively flat, although there are alternating hills and low mountains such as Ngự Bình mountain and Vong Canh Hill.

== Climate ==
Huế features a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, falling short of a tropical rainforest climate because there is less than of rain in March and April. The dry season is from February to August, with high temperatures of . The rainy season is from August to January, with a flood season from October onwards. The average rainy season temperature is , although it has fallen as low as . The highest temperature recorded was 42.2 °C on 27 April 2024, while the lowest was 8.8 °C in January 1934.

== Culture ==

=== Name-giving ===
Historically, the qualities valued by the royal family were reflected in its name-giving customs, which came to be adopted by society at large. As a rule, royal family members were named after a poem written by Minh Mạng, the second emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty. The poem, &quot;Đế hệ thi&quot;, has been set as a standard frame to name every generation of the royal family, through which people can know the family order as well as the relationship between royal members. More importantly, the names reflect the essential personality traits that the royal regime would like their offspring to uphold. This name-giving tradition is proudly kept alive and nowadays people from Huế&#x27;s royal family branches (normally considered &#x27;pure&#x27; Huế) still have their names taken from the words in the poem.

=== Clothing ===

The design of the modern-day &quot;áo dài&quot;, a Vietnamese national costume, developed from the costumes worn by civilians in Đàng Trong in the 18th century after the costume reform of lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát. A court historian of the time described the rules of dress as follows:

This outfit evolved into the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot;, a type of five-part costume popular in Vietnam in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by Paris fashions, Nguyễn Cát Tường and other artists associated with Hanoi University redesigned the &quot;ngũ thân&quot; to create the modern &quot;áo dài&quot; in the 1920s and 1930s. While the &quot;áo dài&quot; and &quot;nón lá&quot; are generally seen as a symbol of Vietnam as a whole, the combination is seen by Vietnamese as being particularly evocative of Hue. Violet-coloured &quot;áo dài&quot; are especially common in Huế, the color having a special connection to the city&#x27;s heritage as a former capital.
=== Cuisine ===
The cuisine of Huế forms the heart of Central Vietnamese cuisine, but one of the most striking differences is the prominence of vegetarianism in the city. Several all-vegetarian restaurants are scattered in various corners of the city to serve the locals who have a strong tradition of eating a vegetarian meal twice a month, as part of their Buddhist beliefs. Nam Châu Hội Quán is a traditional dining hall. Hue dishes are known for their relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine. Hue cuisine is notable for often being very spicy.

Hue cuisine has both luxurious and popular rustic dishes. It consists of several distinctive dishes from small and delicate creations, originally made to please the appetites of Nguyen feudal lords, emperors, and their hundreds of concubines and wives.

Besides Bún bò Huế, other famous dishes include:

* Bánh bèo is a Vietnamese dish that originally comes from Hue city. It is made from a combination of rice flour and tapioca flour. The ingredients include rice cakes, marinated-dried shrimps and crispy pork skin, scallion oil and dipping source. It can be considered as street food, and can eat as lunch or dinner.
* Cơm hến (baby basket clams rice) is a Vietnamese dish originating in Huế. It is made with baby mussels or basket clams and rice; it is normally served at room temperature.
* Bánh ướt thịt nướng (steamed rice pancake with grilled pork) is the most well-known dish of people of Kim Long- Huế. The ingredients include steamed rice pancake, vegetables – Vietnamese mint herb, basil leaves, lettuce, cucumber and cinnamon leaves, pork and is served with dipping sauce.
* Bánh khoái (Hue shrimp and vegetable pancake) is the modified form of Bánh xèo. It is deep fried and served with Hue peanut dipping sauce containing pork liver. Its ingredients include egg, liver, prawns and pork belly or pork sausage, and carrot. It is served with lettuce, fresh mint, Vietnamese mint, star fruit, and perilla leaves.
* Bánh bột lọc (Vietnamese clear shrimp and pork dumplings) can be wrapped with or without banana leaf. It is believed to originate from Huế, Vietnam during the Nguyễn dynasty. Main ingredients include tapioca flour, shrimps and pork belly; it is often served with sweet chili fish sauce.
* Banh it ram (fried sticky rice dumpling) is a specialty in Central Vietnam. It is the combination of fried sticky rice dumplings which is sticky, soft and chewy, and crispy stick rice cake at the bottom.

Additionally, Hue is also famous for its delicious sweet desserts such as Lotus seeds sweet soups, Lotus seed wrapped in logan sweet soup, Areca flower sweet soup, Grilled pork wrapped in cassava flour sweet soup, and Green sticky rice sweet soup.

=== Religion ===
The imperial court practiced various religions such as Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. The most important altar was the Esplanade of Sacrifice to the Heaven and Earth, where the monarch would offer each year prayers to the Heaven and Earth.

In Huế, Buddhism enjoyed stronger support than elsewhere in Vietnam, with more monasteries than anywhere else in the country serving as home to the nation&#x27;s most famous monks.

In 1963, Thích Quảng Đức drove from Huế to Saigon to protest anti-Buddhist policies of the South Vietnamese government, setting himself on fire on a Saigon street. Photos of the self-immolation became some of the enduring images of the Vietnam War.

Thích Nhất Hạnh, a world-famous Zen master who originated from Hue and lived for years in exile including France and the United States, returned to his home town in October 2018 and resided there at the Tu Hieu pagoda until his death in 2022.

=== Tourism ===


Huế is well known for its historic monuments, which have earned it a place in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites. The seat of the Nguyễn emperors was the Imperial City, which occupies a large, walled area on the north side of the Perfume River. Inside the citadel was a forbidden city where only the emperors, concubines, and those close enough to them were granted access; the punishment for trespassing was death. Today, little of the forbidden city remains, though reconstruction efforts are in progress to maintain it as a historic tourist attraction.Roughly along the Perfume River from Huế lie myriad other monuments, including the tombs of several emperors, including Minh Mạng, Khải Định, and Tự Đức. Also notable is the Thiên Mụ Temple, the largest pagoda in Huế and the official symbol of the city.

A number of French-style buildings lie along the south bank of the Perfume River. Among them are Hue High School for the Gifted, the oldest high school in Vietnam, and Hai Ba Trung High School.

The Huế Museum of Royal Fine Arts on 3 Le Truc Street also maintains a collection of various artifacts from the city. In addition to the various touristic attractions in Hue itself, the city also offers day-trips to the Demilitarized Zone lying approximately north, showing various war settings like The Rockpile, Khe Sanh Combat Base or the Vịnh Mốc tunnels. Most of the hotels, bars, and restaurants for tourists in Hue are located in Pham Ngu Lao, Chu Van An and Vo Thi Sau street, which together form the backpacker district.

In the first 11 months of 2012, Hue received 2.4 million visitors, an increase of 24.6% from the same period of 2011. 803,000 of those 2.4 million visitors were foreign guests, an increase of 25.7%. Although tourism plays a key role in the city&#x27;s socioeconomic development, it also has negative impacts on the environment and natural resource base. For example, services associated with tourism, such as travel, the development of infrastructure and its operation, and the production and consumption of goods, are all energy-intensive. Research by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network has identified traditional &#x27;garden houses&#x27; as having the potential to increase tourist traffic and revenue. Apart from the environmental, economic and cultural benefits provided by garden houses, their promotion could pave the way for other low carbon development initiatives.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Health ===
The Huế Central Hospital, established in 1894, was the first Western hospital in Vietnam. The hospital, providing 2078 beds and occupying , is one of three largest in the country along with Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi and Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, and is managed by the Ministry of Health.

=== Transportation ===
Huế railway station provides a rail connection to major Vietnamese cities, via the North–South railway. Phu Bai International Airport is just south of the city centre.
