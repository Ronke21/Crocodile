<text>The 1966 FIFA World Cup was the eighth FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial football tournament for men&#x27;s senior national teams. It was played in England from 11 to 30 July 1966. England defeated West Germany 4–2 in the final to win their first ever World Cup title. The final was level at 2–2 after 90 minutes and went to extra time, when Geoff Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat-trick, the first to be scored in a men&#x27;s World Cup final. Portuguese striker Eusébio was the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, with nine goals clinching the golden boot with three goals more than second placed Helmut Haller. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II during the opening ceremony.

England were the fifth nation to win the event, and the third host nation to win after Uruguay in 1930 and Italy in 1934. Two time reigning champions Brazil failed to get past the group stages as they were defeated by Hungary and Portugal. It was the first time that defending champions were eliminated in the group stages after Italy in 1950. This would not occur again until 36 years later. The two debut teams performed well at the competition – North Korea beat Italy 1–0 on the way to reaching the quarter-finals, where they lost to Portugal 5–3 after leading 3–0. Portugal themselves finished third, losing 2–1 to England in the semi-final. All 15 African nations who entered the qualifying later boycotted the tournament in protest after FIFA, citing competitive and logistical issues, ruled that there would be no direct qualification for any African team. 

The 1966 World Cup was the first FIFA World Cup held in the English-speaking world. Matches were played at eight stadiums across England, with the final being held at Wembley Stadium, which had a capacity of 98,600. Prior to the tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen, but was recovered by a dog named Pickles four months before the tournament began. It was the first World Cup to have selected matches broadcast via satellite to countries on other continents. The final, which was broadcast locally by the BBC, was the last to be shown entirely in black and white.

==Background==

England was chosen as host of the 1966 World Cup in Rome, Italy, on 22 August 1960, over rival bids from West Germany and Spain. This was the first tournament to be held in a country that was affected directly by World War II, as the four previous tournaments were either held in countries out of war theatres or in neutral countries.

===Qualification===
Despite the Africans&#x27; absence, there was another new record number of entries for the qualifying tournament, with 70 nations taking part. FIFA determined that ten teams from Europe would qualify, along with four from South America, one from Asia and one from North and Central America.

Portugal and North Korea qualified for the first time. Portugal would not qualify again until 1986, while North Korea&#x27;s next appearance was at the 2010 tournament. This was also Switzerland&#x27;s last World Cup finals until 1994. Notable absentees from this tournament included 1962 runners-up Czechoslovakia and semi-finalists Yugoslavia.

=== Mascot and match ball ===

The mascot for the 1966 competition was &quot;World Cup Willie&quot;, a lion wearing a Union Jack jersey emblazoned with the words &quot;WORLD CUP&quot;. This was the first World Cup mascot, and one of the first mascots to be associated with a major sporting competition. Willie was designed by freelance children&#x27;s book illustrator Reg Hoye. The official match ball was produced by Slazenger for the tournament.

===Controversies===
====African boycott====
All fifteen entered African nations boycotted the tournament to protest against a 1964 FIFA ruling that required the three second-round winners from the African zone to enter a play-off round against the winners of the Asian zone in order to qualify for the World Cup: they felt winning their zone was enough in itself to merit qualification.

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) felt that the lack of direct representation of African nations in the World Cup was unfair, and demanded that FIFA guarantee at least one African nation a spot in the finals of the following tournament. They also protested against the readmission of South Africa to FIFA in 1963, despite their expulsion from CAF due to the country&#x27;s apartheid regime in 1958.

As a result of this boycott, FIFA fined CAF 5,000 Swiss francs. Yidnekatchew Tessema, then president of the CAF, responded to this punishment by saying, &quot;FIFA has adopted a relentless attitude against the African Associations and its decisions resemble methods of intimidation and repression designed to discourage any further impulses of a similar nature. In our opinion, the African National Associations ... really deserved a gesture of respect rather than a fine.&quot;

South Africa was subsequently assigned to the Asia and Oceania qualifying group, before being disqualified after being suspended again due to pressure from other African nations in October 1964. Despite this, FIFA refused to change the qualifying format, citing competitive and logistical issues, and the African teams withdrew in protest.

CAF subsequently informed FIFA that they would refuse to participate in World Cup qualifying for 1970 unless at least one African team had an automatic place assured in the World Cup: this was put in place for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and all subsequent World Cup finals. Players from the Portuguese African colonies of Angola and Mozambique participated for Portugal.

====North Korea–United Kingdom relations====
The United Kingdom, which had fought for South Korea in the Korean War, was concerned over the entry of North Korea in the tournament. The UK did not recognise North Korea and feared that its presence would strain relations with South Korea and the United States. FIFA told England&#x27;s Football Association that the tournament would be moved if any qualified team were to be refused entry.

On the suggestion of the British Foreign Office, the playing of national anthems, and meetings between players and state figures such as Queen Elizabeth II, would only take place in two games: the opener and the final. North Korea was not scheduled for the former, and was considered unlikely to reach the latter. A Foreign Office suggestion for flags outside stadiums to be removed after each team&#x27;s elimination, in the expectation of an early North Korean exit, was vetoed by the Department of Education and Science.

====Trophy incident ====
The 1966 World Cup had a rather unusual hero off the field, a dog called Pickles. In the build-up to the tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen from an exhibition display. A nationwide hunt for the icon ensued. It was later discovered wrapped in newspaper as the dog sniffed under some bushes in London. The FA commissioned a replica cup in case the original cup was not found in time. This replica, as well as Pickles&#x27; collar, is held at the National Football Museum in Manchester, where it is on display.

====Doping====
West Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. A 2013 report by researchers at Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt University on behalf of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, titled &quot;Doping in Germany from 1950 to today&quot;, linked the West Germany national team of 1966, which reached the World Cup final, with doping.

==Format==
The format of the 1966 competition remained the same as 1962: 16 qualified teams were divided into four groups of four. Each group played a round-robin format. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw, with goal average and eventually drawing lots used to separate teams equal on points. The top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.

In the knockout games, if the teams were tied after 90 minutes, 30 minutes of extra time were played. For any match other than the final, if the teams were still tied after extra time, lots would be drawn to determine the winner. The final would have been replayed if tied after extra time; but if still tied after the replay, the champion would have been decided by drawing lots. In the event, no replays or drawing of lots were necessary.

The draw for the final tournament, taking place on 6 January 1966 at the Royal Garden Hotel in London was the first ever to be televised, with England, West Germany, Brazil and Italy as seeds.

==Venues==
Eight venues were used for this World Cup. The newest and biggest venue used was Wembley Stadium in north west London, which was 43 years old in 1966. As was often the case in the World Cup, group matches were played in two venues close to each other. Group 1 matches (which included the hosts) were all played in London: five at Wembley, which was England&#x27;s national stadium and was considered to be the most important football venue in the world; and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley. The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley. Because Wembley&#x27;s owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London. Group 2&#x27;s matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3&#x27;s matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4&#x27;s matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland. The stadium construction cost are estimated to be today&#x27;s equivalent of £9.2 million, additional to £36.22 million for tournament organisation.

The most used venue was Wembley, which was used for nine matches, including all six featuring England, the final and the third-place match. Goodison Park was used for five matches, Roker Park and Hillsborough both hosted four, while Old Trafford, Villa Park and Ayresome Park each hosted three matches and did not host any knockout round matches.
==Tournament summary==
The opening match took place on Monday, 11 July, which made it the second World Cup after 1930 to not begin on May or June. Before the tournament began, eventual winners England were 9/2 second favourites with bookmakers behind Brazil (9/4), while beaten finalists West Germany were 25/1 outsiders. The final took place on Saturday, 30 July 1966, the 36th anniversary of the first final. Until 2022, this was the latest date that any tournament had concluded. The reason for the unusually late scheduling of the tournament appears to lie with the outside broadcast commitments of the BBC, which also had commitments to cover Wimbledon (which ran between 20 June and 2 July) and the Open Golf Championship (6 to 9 July).

===Group stage===

1966 was a World Cup with few goals as the teams began to play much more tactically and defensively. This was exemplified by Alf Ramsey&#x27;s England as they finished top of Group 1 with only four goals, but having none scored against them. They also became the first World Cup winning team not to win its first game in the tournament. Uruguay were the other team to qualify from that group at the expense of both Mexico and France. All the group&#x27;s matches were played at Wembley Stadium apart from the match between Uruguay and France which took place at White City Stadium.

In Group 2, West Germany and Argentina qualified with ease as they both finished the group with 5 points, Spain managed 2, while Switzerland left the competition after losing all three group matches. FIFA cautioned Argentina for its violent style in the group games, particularly in the scoreless draw with West Germany, which saw Argentinean Rafael Albrecht get sent off and suspended for the next match.

In the northwest of England, Old Trafford and Goodison Park played host to Group 3 which saw the two-time defending champions Brazil finish in third place behind Portugal and Hungary, and be eliminated along with Bulgaria. Brazil were defeated 3–1 by Hungary in a classic encounter before falling by the same scoreline to Portugal in a controversial game. Portugal appeared in the finals for the first time, and made quite an impact. They won all three of their games in the group stage, with a lot of help from their outstanding striker Eusébio, whose nine goals made him the tournament&#x27;s top scorer.

Group 4, however, provided the biggest upset when North Korea beat Italy 1–0 at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the Soviet Union. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup: the next would be Morocco in 1986.

===Knock-out stages===

The quarter-finals provided a controversial victory for West Germany as they cruised past Uruguay 4–0; the South Americans claimed that this occurred only after the referee (who was Jim Finney, from England) had not recognised a handball by Schnellinger on the goal line and then had sent off two players from Uruguay: Horacio Troche and Héctor Silva. It appeared as though the surprise package North Korea would claim another major upset in their match against Portugal at Goodison Park, when after 22 minutes they led 3–0. It fell to one of the greatest stars of the tournament, Eusébio, to change that. He scored four goals in the game and José Augusto added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5–3 win.

Meanwhile, in the other two games, Ferenc Bene&#x27;s late goal for Hungary against the Soviet Union, who were led by Lev Yashin&#x27;s stellar goalkeeping, proved little more than a consolation as they crashed out 2–1, and the only goal between Argentina and England came courtesy of England&#x27;s Geoff Hurst. During that controversial game (for more details see Argentina and England football rivalry), Argentina&#x27;s Antonio Rattín became the first player to be sent off in a senior international football match at Wembley. Rattín at first refused to leave the field and eventually had to be escorted by several policemen. Scoreless when Rattin was dismissed, the game was decided by Hurst&#x27;s headed goal twelve minutes from the end of normal time. This game is called &quot;el robo del siglo&quot; (the robbery of the century) in Argentina.

All semi-finalists were from Europe. Bobby Charlton scored both goals in England&#x27;s win, with Portugal&#x27;s goal coming from a penalty in the 82nd minute after a handball by Jack Charlton on the goal line. The other semi-final also finished 2–1: Franz Beckenbauer scoring the winning goal with a left foot shot from the edge of the area for West Germany as they beat the Soviet Union.

Portugal went on to beat the Soviet Union 2–1 to take third place. Portugal&#x27;s third place was the best finish by a team making its World Cup debut since 1934. It was equalled by Croatia in 1998.

===Final===

London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium was the venue for the final, and 98,000 people attended. After 12 minutes 32 seconds Helmut Haller put West Germany ahead, but the score was levelled by Geoff Hurst four minutes later. Martin Peters put England in the lead in the 78th minute; England looked set to claim the title when the referee awarded a free kick to West Germany with one minute left. The ball was launched goalward and Wolfgang Weber scored, with England appealing in vain for handball as the ball came through the crowded penalty area.

With the score level at 2–2 at the end of 90 minutes, the game went to extra time. In the 98th minute, Hurst found himself on the scoresheet again; his shot hit the crossbar, bounced down onto the goal line, and was awarded as a goal. Debate has long raged over whether the ball crossed the line, with the goal becoming part of World Cup history. England&#x27;s final goal was scored by Hurst again, as a celebratory pitch invasion began. This made Geoff Hurst the first player to have scored three times in a single World Cup final. BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme&#x27;s description of the match&#x27;s closing moments has gone down in history: &quot;Some people are on the pitch. They think it&#x27;s all over ... &quot;[Hurst scores]&quot; It is now!&quot;

England&#x27;s total of eleven goals scored in six games set a new record low for average goals per game scored by a World Cup winning team. The record stood until 1982, when it was surpassed by Italy&#x27;s 12 goals in seven games; in 2010 this record was lowered again by Spain, winning the Cup with eight goals in seven games. England&#x27;s total of three goals conceded also constituted a record low for average goals per game conceded by a World Cup winning team. That record stood until 1994, when it was surpassed by Brazil&#x27;s three goals in seven games. France again lowered the record to two goals in seven during the 1998 tournament, a record that has since been equalled by Italy at the 2006 tournament and by Spain&#x27;s two goals conceded during the 2010 tournament.

England received the recovered Jules Rimet trophy from Queen Elizabeth II and were crowned World Cup winners for the first time.

In this World Cup, the national anthems were played only in the final. They were not played in the earlier matches because the organisers (FIFA and the FA) feared that North Korea&#x27;s presence – a socialist country that was not recognised by the United Kingdom – in the World Cup would cause problems with South Korea. A memo from the Foreign Office months before the finals began stated that the solution would be &quot;denying the visas to North Korean players&quot;. The final, held at Wembley Stadium, was the last to be broadcast in black and white.

<text>John Willard Milnor (born February 20, 1931) is an American mathematician known for his work in differential topology, algebraic K-theory and low-dimensional holomorphic dynamical systems. Milnor is a distinguished professor at Stony Brook University and the only mathematician to have won the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, the Abel Prize and all three Steele prizes.

==Early life and career==
Milnor was born on February 20, 1931, in Orange, New Jersey. His father was J. Willard Milnor, an engineer, and his mother was Emily Cox Milnor. As an undergraduate at Princeton University he was named a Putnam Fellow in 1949 and 1950 and also proved the Fáry–Milnor theorem when he was only 19 years old. Milnor graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1951 after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;Link groups&quot;, under the supervision of Ralph Fox. He remained at Princeton to pursue graduate studies and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1954 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Isotopy of links&quot;, also under the supervision of Fox. His dissertation concerned link groups (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, classifying Brunnian links up to link-homotopy and introduced new invariants of it, called Milnor invariants. Upon completing his doctorate, he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1970 to 1990.

He was an editor of the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books which are famous for their clarity, presentation, and an inspiration for the research by many mathematicians in their areas even after many decades since their publication. He served as Vice President of the AMS in 1976–77 period.

His students have included Tadatoshi Akiba, Jon Folkman, John Mather, Laurent C. Siebenmann, Michael Spivak, and Jonathan Sondow. His wife, Dusa McDuff, is a professor of mathematics at Barnard College and is known for her work in symplectic topology.

==Research==
One of Milnor&#x27;s best-known works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of 7-dimensional spheres with nonstandard differentiable structure, which marked the beginning of a new field – differential topology. He coined the term exotic sphere, referring to any &quot;n&quot;-sphere with nonstandard differential structure. Kervaire and Milnor initiated the systematic study of exotic spheres by Kervaire–Milnor groups, showing in particular that the 7-sphere has 15 distinct differentiable structures (28 if one considers orientation). 

Egbert Brieskorn found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a singular point is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently, Milnor worked on the topology of isolated singular points of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the Milnor fibration whose fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of &quot;μ&quot; spheres where &quot;μ&quot; is known as the Milnor number. Milnor&#x27;s 1968 book on his theory, &quot;Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces&quot;, inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area that continues to mature to this day.

In 1961 Milnor disproved the Hauptvermutung by illustrating two simplicial complexes that are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct, using the concept of Reidemeister torsion.

In 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of attractor. The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called unstable attractors and are now known as Milnor attractors.

Milnor&#x27;s current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of &quot;Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics&quot;:

It is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor&#x27;s work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor&#x27;s approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with Thurston. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with Poincaré&#x27;s work on circle diffeomorphisms, which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor&#x27;s work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems. 

His other significant contributions include microbundles, influencing the usage of Hopf algebras, theory of quadratic forms and the related area of symmetric bilinear forms, higher algebraic K-theory, game theory, and three-dimensional Lie groups.

==Awards and honors==
Milnor was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961. In 1962 Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal for his work in differential topology. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1963 and the American Philosophical Society 1965. He later went on to win the National Medal of Science (1967), the Lester R. Ford Award in 1970 and again in 1984, the Leroy P. Steele Prize for &quot;Seminal Contribution to Research&quot; (1982), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1989), the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2004), and the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2011). In 1991 a symposium was held at Stony Brook University in celebration of his 60th birthday.

Milnor was awarded the 2011 Abel Prize, for his &quot;pioneering discoveries in topology, geometry and algebra.&quot; Reacting to the award, Milnor told the &quot;New Scientist&quot; &quot;It feels very good,&quot; adding that &quot;[o]ne is always surprised by a call at 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning.&quot;

In 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for &quot;contributions to differential topology, geometric topology, algebraic topology, algebra, and dynamical systems&quot;.

In 2020 he received the Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

<text>René Frédéric Thom (; 2 September 1923 – 25 October 2002) was a French mathematician, who received the Fields Medal in 1958.

He made his reputation as a topologist, moving on to aspects of what would be called singularity theory; he became world-famous among the wider academic community and the educated general public for one aspect of this latter interest, his work as founder of catastrophe theory (later developed by Christopher Zeeman).

==Life and career==
René Thom grew up in a modest family in Montbéliard, Doubs and obtained a Baccalauréat in 1940. After the German invasion of France, his family took refuge in Switzerland and then in Lyon. In 1941 he moved to Paris to attend Lycée Saint-Louis and in 1943 he began studying mathematics at École Normale Supérieure, becoming agrégé in 1946.

He received his PhD in 1951 from the University of Paris. His thesis, titled &quot;Espaces fibrés en sphères et carrés de Steenrod&quot; (&quot;Sphere bundles and Steenrod squares&quot;), was written under the direction of Henri Cartan.

After a fellowship at Princeton University Graduate College (1951–1952), he became Maître de conférences at the Universities of Grenoble (1953–1954) and Strasbourg (1954–1963), where he was appointed Professor in 1957. In 1964 he moved to the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, in Bures-sur-Yvette, where he worked until 1990.

In 1958 Thom received the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh for the foundations of cobordism theory, which were already present in his thesis. He was invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians two more times: in 1970 in Nice and 1983 in Warsaw (which he did not attend).

He was awarded the Brouwer Medal in 1970, the Grand Prix Scientifique de la Ville de Paris in 1974, and the John von Neumann Lecture Prize in 1976. He become the first president, together with Louis Néel, of the newly established Fondation Louis-de-Broglie In 1973 and was elected Member of the Académie des Sciences of Paris in 1976.

Salvador Dalí paid homage to René Thom with the paintings &quot;The Swallow&#x27;s Tail&quot; and &quot;Topological Abduction of Europe&quot;.

== Research ==
While René Thom is most known to the public for his development of catastrophe theory between 1968 and 1972, his academic achievements concern mostly his mathematical work on topology.

In the early 1950s it concerned what are now called Thom spaces, characteristic classes, cobordism theory, and the Thom transversality theorem. Another example of this line of work is the Thom conjecture, versions of which have been investigated using gauge theory. From the mid 1950s he moved into singularity theory, of which catastrophe theory is just one aspect, and in a series of deep (and at the time obscure) papers between 1960 and 1969 developed the theory of stratified sets and stratified maps, proving a basic stratified isotopy theorem describing the local conical structure of Whitney stratified sets, now known as the Thom–Mather isotopy theorem. Much of his work on stratified sets was developed so as to understand the notion of topologically stable maps, and to eventually prove the result that the set of topologically stable mappings between two smooth manifolds is a dense set.

Thom&#x27;s lectures on the stability of differentiable mappings, given at the University of Bonn in 1960, were written up by Harold Levine and published in the proceedings of a year long symposium on singularities at Liverpool University during 1969–70, edited by C. T. C. Wall. The proof of the density of topologically stable mappings was completed by John Mather in 1970, based on the ideas developed by Thom in the previous ten years. A coherent detailed account was published in 1976 by Christopher Gibson, Klaus Wirthmüller, Andrew du Plessis, and Eduard Looijenga.

During the last twenty years of his life Thom&#x27;s published work was mainly in philosophy and epistemology, and he undertook a reevaluation of Aristotle&#x27;s writings on science. In 1992, he was one of eighteen academics who sent a letter to Cambridge University protesting against plans to award Jacques Derrida an honorary doctorate.

Beyond Thom&#x27;s contributions to algebraic topology, he studied differentiable mappings, through the study of generic properties. In his final years, he turned his attention to an effort to apply his ideas about structural topography to the questions of thought, language, and meaning in the form of a &quot;semiophysics&quot;.

<doc id="61635" wikidata="Q4895076" url="?curid=61635" title="Bert Geer Phillips">
<text>Bert Geer Phillips (July 15, 1868 – June 16, 1956) was an American artist and a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He settled in what was then Taos, New Mexico Territory (1898) and was a founder of the Taos art colony. He is known for his paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico, and the American Southwest. He was also a benefactor of the Western artist Harold Dow Bugbee, who became curator of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas in 1951.

==Early life and education==
Phillips was born in Hudson, New York in 1868. During his childhood he was influenced by tales of the exploits of American frontiersman Kit Carson and other tales of Western adventure involving American Indians, such as those in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;. In his recollections of childhood, he noted that he could always be found with paintbrush in hand. He was one of the first to enroll when George McKinstry opened an art studio in Hudson.

Phillips left home at age sixteen, moving to New York City where he attended the Art Students League of New York and the National Academy of Design. In 1894 he traveled to Europe, briefly staying in London before moving to Paris, where he studied at the Académie Julian. While at the Académie he became friends with Ernest Blumenschein and Joseph Henry Sharp.

==Artistic career==

Phillips returned to New York in 1896, where together with Ernest Blumenschein he leased a studio. In the Spring of 1898, Phillips accompanied Blumenschein on a journey to the American West. Their first stop was Denver, Colorado, where they bought art and camping supplies, a wagon, horses, and a revolver. Thus equipped, they set out with the intention of reaching Mexico.

In northern New Mexico, one of their wagon wheels broke due to the roughness of the terrain. Blumenschein rode out on horseback to nearby Taos, New Mexico to have the wheel repaired, while Phillips waited with the wagon. After Blumenschein returned with the repaired wheel three days later, they continued on to Taos, where they sold their horse and equipage, set up a studio, and began to paint.

Phillips decided to stay in Taos when Blumenschein returned to New York a few months later. He and a friend caused a skirmish during a religious ceremony on Taos Plaza when they refused to remove their hats; during the skirmish the sheriff was killed. The incident increased tensions between the town&#x27;s Hispanic and Anglo residents. Phillips wrote in a letter to Blumenschein, &quot;I began to feel as if this was the real &#x27;border life&#x27;, and only wish old Kit Carson was here with us.&quot;

Phillips married Rose Martin, the sister of the famous local doctor Thomas &quot;Doc&quot; Martin, in 1899. He conceived the idea of starting an art colony in Taos, which he discussed in correspondence with Blumenschein. In 1915, his dream became reality with the formation of the Taos Society of Artists, of which Phillips was a founding member together with his friends Ernest Blumenschein, Joseph Henry Sharp, and three other artists. The Society was founded in the dining room of Phillips&#x27; in-laws, Doc and Helen Martin, who was herself a batik artist. In addition to being instrumental in the formation of the Society, Phillips also spent more years in Taos than any other member.

==Conservationism==
Phillips was instrumental in the 1906 establishment of the Taos National Forest. He later became its first forest ranger when he needed to rest his eyesight.

<text>Lars Valerian Ahlfors (18 April 1907 – 11 October 1996) was a Finnish mathematician, remembered for his work in the field of Riemann surfaces and his textbook on complex analysis.

==Background==
Ahlfors was born in Helsinki, Finland. His mother, Sievä Helander, died at his birth. His father, Axel Ahlfors, was a professor of engineering at the Helsinki University of Technology. The Ahlfors family was Swedish-speaking, so he first attended the private school Nya svenska samskolan where all classes were taught in Swedish. Ahlfors studied at University of Helsinki from 1924, graduating in 1928 having studied under Ernst Lindelöf and Rolf Nevanlinna. He assisted Nevanlinna in 1929 with his work on Denjoy&#x27;s conjecture on the number of asymptotic values of an entire function.
In 1929 Ahlfors published the first proof of this conjecture, now known as the Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem. It states that the number of asymptotic values approached by an entire function of order ρ along curves in the complex plane going toward infinity is less than or equal to 2ρ.

He completed his doctorate from the University of Helsinki in 1930.

==Career==
Ahlfors worked as an associate professor at the University of Helsinki from 1933 to 1936. In 1936 he was one of the first two people to be awarded the Fields Medal (the other was Jesse Douglas). In 1935 Ahlfors visited Harvard University. He returned to Finland in 1938 to take up a professorship at the University of Helsinki. The outbreak of war in 1939 led to problems although Ahlfors was unfit for military service. He was offered a position at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich in 1944 and finally managed to travel there in March 1945. He did not enjoy his time in Switzerland, so in 1946 he jumped at a chance to leave, returning to work at Harvard, where he remained until his retirement in 1977; he was William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics from 1964. Ahlfors was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1962 and again in 1966. He was awarded the Wihuri Prize in 1968 and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1981. He served as the Honorary President of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1986 at Berkeley, California, in celebration of his 50th year of the award of his Fields Medal.

His book &quot;Complex Analysis&quot; (1953) is the classic text on the subject and is almost certainly referenced in any more recent text which makes heavy use of complex analysis. Ahlfors wrote several other significant books, including &quot;Riemann surfaces&quot; (1960) and &quot;Conformal invariants&quot; (1973).
He made decisive contributions to meromorphic curves, value distribution theory, Riemann surfaces, conformal geometry, quasiconformal mappings and other areas during his career.

==Personal life==
In 1933, he married Erna Lehnert, an Austrian who with her parents had first settled in Sweden and then in Finland. The couple had three daughters. Ahlfors died of pneumonia at the Willowwood nursing home in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1996.

<text>Eanger Irving Couse (September 3, 1866 – April 26, 1936) was an American artist and a founding member and first president of the Taos Society of Artists. Born and reared in Saginaw, Michigan, he went to New York City and Paris to study art. While spending summers in Taos, New Mexico, he began to make the paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico, and the American Southwest for which he is best known. He later settled full time in Taos.

His house and studio in Taos have been preserved as the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio—Joseph Henry Sharp Studios. The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Early life and education==
Couse (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;house&quot;)
was born to a farming family in Saginaw, Michigan. As a boy, he started drawing members of the Chippewa tribe who lived nearby. He attended local schools as a child and continued to work at art.

Couse left Michigan for professional art studies at the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Academy of Design, New York. He went to Paris, where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and Académie Julian under William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He lived in France for 10 years, painting mostly landscapes of the Normandy coast. Between 1893 and 1896, he lived at the Etaples art colony, where he painted its streets and fisher folk, including &quot;Coastal Scene, Etaples&quot;.

==Artistic career in the United States==
After his return to the United States, Couse first lived in New York. He spent time in Taos, New Mexico during the summers. At the turn of the 19th century, the Southwest, and New Mexico in particular, attracted numerous artists and writers because it remained untouched by national expansion efforts dictated by the American policy of Manifest Destiny. The artists and writers of this era wanted to capture the last vestiges of the Old West before it disappeared altogether. During his time in New Mexico, Couse studied and painted the lives and culture of the Taos Indians, a Pueblo tribe. He began to show his paintings of Native American life and earned his first solo show in 1891.

In 1911 Couse was elected to the National Academy of Design. He also became active in the Taos art colony. In 1915, Couse was one of the six founding members of the Taos Society of Artists, and was elected first president. Another founding member was the artist J. H. Sharp, who adapted a chapel near Couse&#x27;s house as a studio. Later Sharp built a combined house and studio on the land. The adjacent properties are recognized jointly as the Couse/Sharp Historic Site, and are preserved and operated by the Couse Foundation.

Among Couse&#x27;s works in public galleries are &quot;Elk-Foot of the Taos Tribe&quot; (Smithsonian American Art Museum); &quot;Taos Pueblo - Moonlight&quot; (New Mexico Museum of Art); &quot;The Forest Camp&quot; (Brooklyn Museum of Art); &quot;The Pottery Maker&quot; (Two Red Roses Foundation); &quot;The Tom-Tom Maker&quot; (Lotos Club, New York); &quot;Medicine Fires&quot; (Montclair Gallery, New Jersey); and &quot;Shapanagons, a Chippewa Chief&quot; (Detroit Museum of Art).

Of these works, &quot;Elk-Foot of the Taos Tribe&quot;, painted in the summer of 1909, is considered Couse&#x27;s masterwork. The painting was purchased for the United States national art collection by the well-known art collector William T. Evans and is now displayed in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Elk-foot, whose anglicized name was Jerry Mirabal, began posing for Couse in 1907 and was one of the painters favorite subjects because of his &quot;physical beauty and ideal features.&quot;

===Early works===
Couse&#x27;s &quot;The Captive&quot; was shown in 1891 at his first solo exhibition, held at the Portland Art Association in Oregon, and then at the Paris Salon of 1892. This large, &quot;salon size&quot; painting was the first Native American subject by Couse, who later achieved fame in the United States for his paintings of the indigenous peoples of New Mexico. In 1991, &quot;The Captive&quot; was included in the National Museum of American Art exhibition entitled &quot;The West as America,&quot; which created controversy by its curatorial interpretation of the artists&#x27; meanings and intents. Art historians have explored the painting&#x27;s racial, sexual, and social motives in the context of American society at the time.

In 1899, Couse exhibited three paintings at the Boston Art Club: &quot;A Cayuse Indian&quot; (oil), &quot;Maternity&quot; (oil), and &quot;Yakima Encampment&quot; (oil). His address at that time was the Van Dyck Studios, 939 8th Avenue, New York City.

===Later works===
* &quot;Mending the War Bonnet&quot;
* &quot;Making Pottery&quot; (awarded $500 National Academy of Design Carnegie Prize)
* &quot;Roasting Corn&quot; (1904)
* &quot;Rushing Water&quot; (1912)
* &quot;Twilight, Taos Pueblo&quot; (1913)
* &quot;Taos Canyon Camp&quot;
* &quot;Taos Pueblo - Moonlight (1914) 
* &quot;The Kachina Painter&quot; (1917)
* The Quiver Maker (1918)

==Legacy and honors==
His works won recognition and numerous awards from such institutions as the following: the Paris Salon, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Academy of Design (Second Hallgarten Prize, 1900; First Hallgarten Prize, 1902; Altman Prize, 1916); and the Salmagundi Club (Isidor prize, 1917). He was awarded the Lippincott prize from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1921). He received awards from the American Exposition, Buffalo; the Boston Art Club, the Corcoran Gallery, and the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco (silver medal, 1915). His works are held in many museums in the United States and around the world, including a collection from David and Peggy Rockefeller, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Two buildings he used as studios are part of the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio—Joseph Henry Sharp Studios listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties. This is one of 30 sites recognized as an &quot;Historic Artist&#x27;s Home and Studio Associate Site&quot; by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In 2001 the Couse Foundation was formed to restore and preserve the properties. It operates the historic site of the two artists and offers scheduled tours.

==Paintings==
*&quot;The Bird Jar&quot;
*&quot;The Captive &quot; (1891), Phoenix Art Museum
*&quot;The Housewife Looking at the Fisherman&#x27;s Catch&quot;
*&quot;In Ambush&quot;
*&quot;Love Song (aka Moonlight)&quot;
*&quot;The Medicine Maker&quot;
*&quot;Pottery Vendor &quot; (1916)

==Death==
Couse died in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1936. He is buried at Sierra View Cemetery in Taos.

<text>William Herbert &quot;Buck&quot; Dunton (August 28, 1878 – March 18, 1936) was an American artist and a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He is noted for paintings of cowboys, New Mexico, and the American Southwest.

==Early life and education==
Dunton worked as a ranch hand as a youth and studied at the Cowles Art School in Boston, Massachusetts. He moved to New York City around 1903, where he worked as an illustrator for publishing companies. In 1912 he briefly studied at the Art Student&#x27;s League, where Ernest Blumenschein told him about Taos, New Mexico.

==Artistic career==
He first visited Taos in 1912 and became part of the Taos art colony. Dunton became one of the founding members of the Taos Society of Artists in 1915.

Among his proteges in Western art was Harold Dow Bugbee of Clarendon and Canyon in the Texas Panhandle.

In 1921, American oil executive W. H. McFadden commissioned Dunton to paint a full-length portrait of big-game hunter Ben Lilly. The portrait was exhibited by the National Academy of Design before being located in McFadden&#x27;s home in New Orleans. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="61641" wikidata="Q55264" url="?curid=61641" title="Charles Laughton">
<text>Charles Laughton (; 1 July 1899 – 15 December 1962) was a British and American actor. He was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and first appeared professionally on the stage in 1926. In 1927, he was cast in a play with his future wife Elsa Lanchester, with whom he lived and worked until his death.

Laughton played a wide range of classical and modern roles, making an impact in Shakespeare at the Old Vic. His film career took him to Broadway and then Hollywood, but he also collaborated with Alexander Korda on notable British films of the era, including &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the title character. He received two further nominations for his roles in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; and &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, and reprised the role of Henry VIII in &quot;Young Bess&quot;. He portrayed everything from monsters and misfits to kings. Among Laughton&#x27;s biggest film hits were &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;The Big Clock&quot;, and &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Daniel Day-Lewis cited Laughton as one of his inspirations, saying: &quot;He was probably the greatest film actor who came from that period of time. He had something quite remarkable. His generosity as an actor; he fed himself into that work. As an actor, you cannot take your eyes off him.&quot;

In his later career, Laughton took up stage directing, notably in &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;, in which he also starred. He directed one film, the thriller &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, which after an initially disappointing reception is acclaimed today as a film classic.

==Early life and career==
Laughton was born on 1 July 1899 in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Robert Laughton (1869–1924) and Eliza (née Conlon; 1869–1953), Yorkshire hotel keepers. A blue plaque marks his birthplace. His mother was a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent, and she sent him to briefly attend a local boys&#x27; school, Scarborough College, before sending him to Stonyhurst College, the pre-eminent English Jesuit school. Laughton served in World War I, during which he was gassed, serving first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Battalion, and then with the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.

He started work in the family hotel, though also participating in amateur theatrical productions in Scarborough. He was permitted by his family to become a drama student at RADA in 1925, where actor Claude Rains was one of his teachers. Laughton made his first professional appearance on 28 April 1926 at the Barnes Theatre, as Osip in the comedy &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, in which he also appeared at London&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre in May. He impressed audiences with his talent and had classical roles in two Chekov plays, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;. Laughton played the lead role as Harry Hegan in the world premiere of Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot; in 1928 in London. He played the title roles in Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Mr Prohack&quot; (Elsa Lanchester was also in the cast) and as Samuel Pickwick in &quot;Mr. Pickwick&quot; at the Theatre Royal (1928–29) in London.

He played Tony Perelli in Edgar Wallace&#x27;s &quot;On the Spot&quot; and William Marble in &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;. He took the last role across the Atlantic and made his United States debut on 24 September 1931, at the Lyceum Theatre. He returned to London for the 1933–34 Old Vic season and was engaged in four Shakespeare roles (as Macbeth, Henry VIII, Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;) and also as Lopakhin in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, Canon Chasuble in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, and Tattle in &quot;Love for Love&quot;. In 1936, he went to Paris and on 9 May appeared at the Comédie-Française as Sganarelle in the second act of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot;, the first English actor to appear at that theatre, where he performed the role in French and received an ovation.

Laughton commenced his film career in Great Britain while still acting on the London stage. He also accepted small roles in three short silent comedies starring his wife Elsa Lanchester, &quot;Daydreams,&quot; &quot;Blue Bottles,&quot; and &quot;The Tonic&quot; (all 1928), which had been specially written for her by H. G. Wells and were directed by Ivor Montagu. He made a brief appearance as a disgruntled diner in another silent film &quot;Piccadilly&quot; with Anna May Wong in 1929. He appeared with Lanchester again in &quot;Comets&quot; (1930), a film revue featuring assorted British variety acts, in which they sang a duet, &quot;The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie.&quot; He made two other early British talkies: &quot;Wolves&quot; with Dorothy Gish (1930) from a play set in a whaling camp in the frozen north, and &quot;Down River&quot; (1931), in which he played a drug-smuggling ship&#x27;s captain.

His New York stage debut in 1931 immediately led to film offers, and Laughton&#x27;s first Hollywood film, &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932) with Boris Karloff, in which he played a bluff Yorkshire businessman marooned during a storm with other travelers in a creepy remote Welsh manor. He then played a demented submarine commander in &quot;Devil and the Deep&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant, and followed this with his best-remembered film role of that year as Nero in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Sign of the Cross.&quot; Laughton gave other memorable performances during that first Hollywood trip, repeating his stage role as a murderer in &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;, playing H. G. Wells&#x27; mad vivisectionist Dr. Moreau in &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot;, and the meek raspberry-blowing clerk in the brief segment of &quot;If I Had A Million&quot;, directed by Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in six Hollywood films in 1932. His association with director Alexander Korda began in 1933 with the hugely successful &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (loosely based on the life of King Henry VIII), for which Laughton won the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Film career==

===1933–1943===

After his smashing success in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, Laughton soon abandoned the stage for films and returned to Hollywood, where his next film was &quot;White Woman&quot; (1933) in which he co-starred with Carole Lombard as a Cockney river trader in the Malayan jungle. Then came &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; (1934) as the malevolent father of Norma Shearer&#x27;s character (although Laughton was only three years older than Shearer); &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1935) as Inspector Javert; one of his most famous screen roles in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935) as Captain William Bligh, co-starring with Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian; and &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; (1935) as the very English butler transported to early 1900s America. He signed to play Micawber in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1934), but after a few days&#x27; shooting asked to be released from the role and was replaced by W. C. Fields.

Back in the UK, and again with Korda, he played the title role in &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (1936). In 1937, also for Korda, he starred in an ill-fated film version of the classic novel, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, by Robert Graves, which was abandoned during filming owing to the injuries suffered by co-star Merle Oberon in a car crash. After &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, he and the expatriate German film producer Erich Pommer founded the production company Mayflower Pictures in the UK, which produced three films starring Laughton: &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot; (US title &quot;The Beachcomber&quot;) (1938), based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham, in which his wife, Elsa Lanchester, co-starred; &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Lane&quot; (US title &quot;Sidewalks of London&quot;), about London street entertainers, which featured Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison; and &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, with Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Robert Newton, about Cornish shipwreckers, based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel (and the last film Alfred Hitchcock directed in Britain), before moving to Hollywood in the late 1930s.

The films produced were not commercially successful enough, and the company was rescued from bankruptcy only when RKO Pictures offered Laughton the title role (Quasimodo) in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), with &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; co-star O&#x27;Hara. Laughton and Pommer had plans to make further films, but the outbreak of World War II, which implied the loss of many foreign markets, meant the end of the company. Laughton&#x27;s early success in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; established him as one of the leading interpreters of the costume and historical drama roles for which he is best remembered (Nero, Henry VIII, Mr. Barrett, Inspector Javert, Captain Bligh, Rembrandt, Quasimodo, and others); he was also type-cast as arrogant, unscrupulous characters.

He largely moved away from historical roles when he played an Italian vineyard owner in California in &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; (1940); a South Seas patriarch in &quot;The Tuttles of Tahiti&quot; (1942); and a US admiral during World War II in &quot;Stand By for Action&quot; (1942). He played a Victorian butler in &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943) and an Australian bar-owner in &quot;The Man from Down Under&quot; (1943). Simon Callow&#x27;s 1987 biography quotes a number of contemporary reviews of Laughton&#x27;s performances in these films. James Agate, reviewing &quot;Forever and a Day&quot;, wrote: &quot;Is there no-one at RKO to tell Charles Laughton when he is being plain bad?&quot; On the other hand, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; boasted &quot;superb performances&quot;.

C. A. Lejeune, wrote Callow, was &quot;shocked&quot; by the poor quality of Laughton&#x27;s work of that period: &quot;One of the most painful screen phenomena of latter years&quot;, she wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;has been the decline and fall of Charles Laughton.&quot; On the other hand, David Shipman, in his book &quot;The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years&quot;, said &quot;Laughton was a total actor. His range was wide&quot;.

===1943–1962===

Laughton played a cowardly schoolmaster in occupied France in &quot;This Land is Mine&quot; (1943), by Jean Renoir, in which he engaged himself most actively; in fact, while Renoir was still working on an early script, Laughton would talk about Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s story &quot;The Last Lesson&quot;, which suggested to Renoir a relevant scene for the film. Laughton played a henpecked husband who eventually murders his wife in &quot;The Suspect&quot; (1944), directed by Robert Siodmak, who would become a good friend. He played sympathetically an impoverished composer-pianist in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942) and starred in &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, based on the Oscar Wilde story in 1944.

Laughton appeared in two comedies with Deanna Durbin, &quot;It Started with Eve&quot; (1941) and &quot;Because of Him&quot; (1946). He portrayed a bloodthirsty pirate in &quot;Captain Kidd&quot; (1945) and a malevolent judge in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947). Laughton played a megalomaniac press tycoon in &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948). He had supporting roles as a Nazi in pre-war Paris in &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; (1948), as a bishop in &quot;The Girl from Manhattan&quot; (1948), as a seedy go-between in &quot;The Bribe&quot; (1949), and as a kindly widower in &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951). He played a Bible-reading pastor in the multi-story &quot;A Miracle Can Happen&quot; (1947), but his piece wound up being cut and replaced with another featuring Dorothy Lamour, and in this form the film was retitled as &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot;. However, an original print of &quot;A Miracle Can Happen&quot; was sent abroad for dubbing before the Laughton sequence was deleted, and in this form it was shown in Spain as &quot;Una Encuesta Llamada Milagro&quot;.

Laughton made his first colour film in Paris as Inspector Maigret in &quot;The Man on the Eiffel Tower&quot; (1949) and, wrote the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, &quot;appeared to overact&quot; alongside Boris Karloff as a mad French nobleman in a version of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Door&quot; in 1951. He played a tramp in &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot; (1952). He became the pirate Captain Kidd again, this time for comic effect, in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd&quot; (1952). Laughton made a guest appearance on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; (featuring Abbott and Costello), in which he delivered the Gettysburg Address. In 1953 he played Herod Antipas in &quot;Salome&quot;, and he reprised his role as Henry VIII in &quot;Young Bess&quot;, a 1953 drama about Henry&#x27;s children.

He returned to Britain to star in &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954), directed by David Lean. Laughton received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957). He played a British admiral in &quot;Under Ten Flags&quot; (1960) and worked with Laurence Olivier in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960). His final film was &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), for which he received favourable comments for his performance as a Southern US Senator (for which accent he studied recordings of Mississippi Senator John C. Stennis).

===&quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; and other projects===

In 1955, Laughton directed &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish, and produced by his friend Paul Gregory. The film has been cited among critics as one of the best of the 1950s, and has been selected by the United States National Film Registry for preservation in the Library of Congress. At the time of its original release it was a critical and box-office failure, and Laughton never directed again. The documentary &quot;Charles Laughton Directs The Night of the Hunter&quot; by Robert Gitt (2002) features preserved rushes and outtakes with Laughton&#x27;s audible off-camera direction.

Laughton had intended to follow up &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; with an adaptation of Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;. Terry and Dennis Sanders were hired as writers, and press releases announced that Robert Mitchum was to star and that Walter Schumann would compose the score. Following the box-office failure of &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, Laughton was replaced by Raoul Walsh as director on the film and recruited an uncredited writer to rewrite the Sanders brothers&#x27; screenplay.

Laughton also developed a remake of the 1927 silent film &quot;White Gold&quot;.

==Theatre==
Laughton made his London stage debut in Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (1926). He appeared in many West End plays in the following few years and his earliest successes on the stage were as Hercule Poirot in &quot;Alibi&quot; (1928); he was the first actor to portray the Belgian detective in this stage adaptation of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, and as William Marble in &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;, making his Lyceum Theatre (New York) debut in 1931.

In 1926, he played the role of the criminal Ficsur in the original London production of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot; (The play became a musical in 1945 by Rodgers and Hammerstein as &quot;Carousel&quot;, where Ficsur became Jigger Craigin, but Laughton never appeared in the musical version). While Laughton is most remembered for his film career, he continued to work in the theatre, as when, after the success of &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; he appeared at the Old Vic Theatre in 1933 as Macbeth, Lopakin in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. In the US, Laughton worked with Bertolt Brecht on a new English version of Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Galileo&quot;. Laughton played the title role at the play&#x27;s premiere in Los Angeles on 30 July 1947 and later that year in New York. This staging was directed by Joseph Losey. The processes by which Laughton painstakingly, over many weeks, created his Galileo—and incidentally, edited and translated the play along with Brecht—are detailed in an essay by Brecht, &quot;Building Up A Part: Laughton&#x27;s Galileo.&quot;

Laughton had one of his most notable successes in the theatre by directing and playing the Devil in &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; beginning in 1950. The piece is actually the third act sequence from George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, frequently cut from productions to reduce its playing time, consisting of a philosophical debate between Don Juan and the Devil with contributions from Doña Ana and the statue of Ana&#x27;s father. Laughton conceived the piece as a staged reading and cast Charles Boyer, Cedric Hardwicke and Agnes Moorehead (billed as &quot;The First Drama Quartette&quot;) in the other roles. Boyer won a special Tony Award for his performance.

He directed several plays on Broadway, mostly under the production of his friend and Broadway producer Paul Gregory. His most notable box-office success as a director came in 1954, with &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, a full-length stage dramatisation by Herman Wouk of the court-martial scene in Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;. The play, starring Henry Fonda as defence attorney Barney Greenwald, opened the same year as the film starring Humphrey Bogart as Captain Queeg and José Ferrer as Greenwald based on the original novel, but did not affect that film&#x27;s box-office performance. Laughton also directed a staged reading in 1953 of Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, a full-length poem about the American Civil War and its aftermath. The production starred Tyrone Power, Raymond Massey (re-creating his film characterisations of Abraham Lincoln and John Brown), and Judith Anderson. Laughton did not appear himself in either production, but &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; was recorded complete by Columbia Masterworks. He directed and starred in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s, &quot;Major Barbara&quot; which ran on Broadway from approximately 1 November 1956, to 18 May 1957. Others in the cast were Glynis Johns, Burgess Meredith, Cornelia Otis Skinner, and Eli Wallach.

Laughton returned to the London stage in May 1958 to direct and star in Jane Arden&#x27;s &quot;The Party&quot; at the New Theatre which also had Elsa Lanchester and Albert Finney in the cast. He made his final appearances on stage as Nick Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and as King Lear at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1959, although failing health resulted in both performances being disappointing, according to some British critics. His performance as King Lear was lambasted by critics, and Kenneth Tynan wrote that Laughton&#x27;s Nick Bottom &quot;... behaves in a manner that has nothing to do with acting, although it perfectly hits off the demeanor of a rapscallion uncle dressed up to entertain the children at a Christmas party&quot;. Although he did not appear in any later plays, Laughton toured the US with staged readings, including a successful appearance on the Stanford University campus in 1960.

==Recordings==
Laughton&#x27;s voice, equally capable of a penetrating, theatre-filling shout and a soft, velvety tone, first appeared on 78-rpm records with the release of five British Regal Zonophone 10-inch discs entitled &quot;Voice of the Stars&quot; issued annually from 1934 to 1938. These featured short soundtrack snippets from the year&#x27;s top films. He is heard on all five records in, respectively, &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (curiously, since this film was unfinished and thus never released), and &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot;. In 1937 he recorded Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address on a 10-inch Columbia 78, having made a strong impression with it in &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;.

He made several other spoken-word recordings, one of his most famous being his one-man album of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Pickwick&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, a twenty-minute version of the Christmas chapter from Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. It was first released by American Decca in 1944 as a four-record 78-rpm set, but was afterward transferred to LP. It frequently appeared on LP with a companion piece, Decca&#x27;s 1941 adaptation of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, starring Ronald Colman as Scrooge. Both stories were released together on a Deutsche Grammophon CD for Christmas 2005.

In 1943, Laughton recorded a reading of the Nativity story from St. Luke&#x27;s Gospel, and this was released in 1995 on CD on a Nimbus Records collection entitled &quot;Prima Voce: The Spirit of Christmas Past&quot;. A Brunswick/American Decca LP entitled &quot;Readings from the Bible&quot; featured Laughton reading Garden of Eden, The Fiery Furnace, Noah&#x27;s Ark, and David and Goliath. It was released in 1958. Laughton had previously included several Bible readings when he played the title role in the film &quot;Rembrandt&quot;. Laughton also narrated the story on the soundtrack album of the film that he directed, &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;, accompanied by the film&#x27;s score. This album has also been released on CD. Also, and derived from the film they made together, a complete radio show (18 June 1945) of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; was broadcast which featured Laughton and Margaret O&#x27;Brien. It has been issued on a Pelican LP. 

A two-LP Capitol Records album was released in 1962, the year of Laughton&#x27;s death, entitled &quot;The Story Teller: A Session with Charles Laughton&quot;. Taken from Laughton&#x27;s one-man stage shows, it compiles dramatic readings from several sources. Three of the excerpts are broadcast annually on a Minnesota Public Radio Thanksgiving program entitled &quot;Giving Thanks&quot;. &quot;The Story Teller&quot; won a Grammy in 1962 for Best Spoken Word Recording. Although the album has yet to be released on compact disc, it can now be heard in its entirety online.

==Television==

Laughton was the fill-in host on 9 September 1956, when Elvis Presley made his first of three appearances on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which garnered 60.7 million viewers (Ed Sullivan was recuperating from a car accident). That same year, Laughton hosted the first of two programmes devoted to classical music entitled &quot;Festival of Music&quot;, and telecast on the NBC television anthology series &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;. One of his last performances was on &quot;Checkmate&quot;, in which he played a missionary recently returned from China. He threw himself into the role, travelling to China for several months to better understand his character.

==Personal life==
In 1927, Laughton began a relationship with Elsa Lanchester, at the time a castmate in a stage play. The two were married in 1929, became US citizens in 1950, and remained together until Laughton&#x27;s death. Over the years, they appeared together in several films, including &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (1936), &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942), &quot;The Vessel of Wrath&quot; (1938), and &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948). Lanchester portrayed Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII&#x27;s fourth wife, opposite Laughton in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;. They both received Academy Award nominations for their performances in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957)—Laughton for Best Actor, and Lanchester for Best Supporting Actress—but neither won.

Laughton&#x27;s bisexuality was corroborated by several of his contemporaries and is generally accepted by Hollywood historians. Hollywood procurer and prostitute Scotty Bowers alleged in his memoir &quot;Full Service&quot; that Laughton was in love with Tyrone Power and that his sex life was exclusively homosexual. Actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara, a friend and co-star of Laughton, disputed the contention that his sexuality was the reason Laughton and Lanchester did not have children, saying Laughton told her he had wanted children but that it had not been possible because of a botched abortion that Lanchester had early in her career of performing burlesque. In her autobiography, Lanchester acknowledged two abortions in her youth – one of the pregnancies purportedly by Laughton – but did not mention infertility. According to her biographer, Charles Higham, the reason she did not have children was that she did not want any.

Laughton owned an estate on the bluffs above Pacific Coast Highway at 14954 Corona Del Mar in Pacific Palisades. The property suffered a landslide in 1944, referenced by Bertolt Brecht in his poem &quot;Garden in Progress&quot;.

Laughton was a Democrat and supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Laughton checked in to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in July 1962 with what was described as a ruptured disc. He had surgery for the collapse of a vertebra and it was revealed he had cancer of the spine. He left the hospital at the end of November. He was in a coma for some time and died at home on 15 December 1962 from renal cancer and bladder cancer. His ashes were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<text>Oscar Edmund Berninghaus (October 2, 1874 – April 27, 1952) was an American artist and a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He is best known for his paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico and the American Southwest. His son, Charles Berninghaus (1905–1988), was also a Taos artist.

==Early life and education==
Berninghaus was born on October 2, 1874, in St. Louis, Missouri. His father ran a lithography business, which stimulated an interest in watercolor painting in Oscar. The young artist regularly sketched local scenes around St. Louis, including the St. Louis riverfront. He developed an interest in business and sold his works to tourists and newspapers. At sixteen, he had quit school and taken a job with Compton &amp; Sons, a local lithography company, where he started as an errand boy, but soon learned the technical details of engraving, color separation and printmaking. In 1893, he left Compton &amp; Sons and joined Woodward and Tiernan, one of the largest printing concerns in the world at the time.

In search of something more than the practical experience he was receiving at the lithography companies, Berninghaus attended night classes at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis and sketched and painted in his spare time.

==St. Louis artistic career==
By 1899, Berninghaus held his first one-man show, developed a reputation as an artist, and worked teaching illustration at the School of Fine Arts. He was offered a commission by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad to produce promotional sketches of the Colorado and New Mexico landscapes and soon traveled West. After spending a day in Denver, he traveled south to Antonito, Colorado, on a standard gauge railroad before transition to a narrow gauge track for the remainder of his trip into New Mexico. All the while, Berninghaus sketched, and was eventually invited by the conductor to ride on the top of the train car.

When he passed nearby Taos, New Mexico, he disembarked the train and travelled overland. During his 8-day stay, he met and befriended Bert Phillips, who had established himself as a painter in Taos the previous year. Although he soon returned to St. Louis, and was married to Emelia Miller in 1900, Berninghaus was captivated by the local Indian culture and the landscape and light of New Mexico. For the next few years, the painter lived in St. Louis during the winters, where he pursued his commercial illustration work, and returned to Taos in the summers to pursue his fine art painting.

In 1903 Berninghaus had two designs selected for the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair medal competition. In 1905 Berninghaus and his wife, Emelia, had their second son, Julius Charles Berninghaus, who would go on to become a well known New Mexican landscape painter in his own right. By 1908 the painter had firmly established himself as one of St. Louis&#x27; foremost artists, having won a competition at the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, become a member of the St. Louis Artists&#x27; Guild, the Society of Western Artists, and the Salmagundi Club, and held a one-man exhibition of fifty Western paintings at the Noonan-Kocian Gallery.

In 1914, a year after his wife died of diabetes, the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company release a promotional booklet titled &quot;Epoch Marking Events of American History&quot; that was composed of billboard illustrations that Berninghaus had previously completed for the company. The book included 10 paintings by the artist featuring historical events important to the American West, including Hernando de Soto&#x27;s founding the Mississippi River, Jacques Marquette&#x27;s descending the same river, Pierre Laclède&#x27;s founding of St. Louis, a scene from the Lewis and Clark Expedition, John C. Frémont, a pioneer wagon train on the Salt Lake Trail, and a Union Pacific train. Berninghaus painted a number of paintings for the Busch family throughout his lifetime, many of which were donated to the St. Louis Art Museum.

==Taos Society of Artists==
In 1915, he became a founding member of the Taos Society of Artists, along with his friend Bert Phillips and four other artists. He was the first (temporary) chairman of the Society. He also spent more time as secretary of the Society than any other member. In 1917, Berninghaus received his first formal accolade for his Taos Indian-based fine art; the prestigious and much coveted St. Louis Artists&#x27; Guild Brown Prize for his painting &quot;The Sage Brush Trail&quot;. This painting went on to be exhibited at The Annual Exhibition, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1917), National Academy of Design, Winter Exhibition (1917), Art World Winter Show, Academy of Design (1918), and numerous other national exhibitions. Arguably his first painting to receive national recognition and acclaim, this painting is referenced in many publications including &quot;American Art Annual&quot;, volume 14, 1017, &quot;El Palacio&quot;, Volume VIII (1920), &quot;Painters, Pictures and The People&quot;, Neuhaus (1918), &quot;Art World&quot; Ruckstull (1917), &quot;American Art Directory, American Federation of Arts&quot; (1918), &quot;Master Painter of American Indians and The Frontier West&quot;, Sanders. He continued to reside in St. Louis until 1925, when he finally made the move to Taos.

Berninghaus was committed to the artist colony of Taos, maintained the Society&#x27;s business affairs, and insisted that Taos would be the single location from which a distinctly American Art would originate; &quot;We have had French, Dutch, Italian and German art. Now we have American art. I feel that from Taos will come that art.&quot;

In 1936, Berninghaus was commissioned to paint &quot;Commerce on the Levee&quot;, a rendition of early commercial life in St. Louis. Upon completing the 8 foot x 12 foot canvas in his Taos, New Mexico studio, the painter is said to have wrapped the work around a stovepipe to be shipped east. The work was installed in the lobby of the &quot;St. Louis Star Times&quot;. o

<text>Year 153 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Nobilior and Luscus (or, less frequently, year 601 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 153 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The uprisings in Rome&#x27;s Hispanic provinces oblige the year&#x27;s consuls to take office earlier than the traditional date of 15 March, a change that becomes permanent. Some suggest that, as a consequence, January 1 becomes the first day of the Roman year.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter&#x27;s relations with Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamum and Ptolemy VI Philometor of Egypt deteriorate to the point where they support a rival claimant to the Syrian throne, Alexander Balas, who claims to be the son of the former Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes and, therefore, a first cousin of Demetrius. He has been &quot;discovered&quot; by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of Timarchus, who has been executed by Demetrius I Soter in 160 BC after leading a revolt against him in Media.
* As a result of the rise of the pretender, Alexander Balas, Demetrius I Soter is forced to recall most of his garrisons in Judea. To retain control of Judea, he makes a bid to gain the loyalty of Jonathan Maccabeus, whom he permits to recruit an army and to take back the hostages that the Syrians are holding in the city of Acre. Jonathan gladly accepts these terms, takes up residence in Jerusalem and begins to fortify the city, becoming High Priest of Jerusalem until 143 BC.

==== Greece ====
* Substantial parts of the city of Sikyon are destroyed by an earthquake.

<text>Theodosius II ( ; 10 April 401 – 28 July 450) was Roman emperor from 402 to 450. He was proclaimed &quot;Augustus&quot; as an infant and ruled as the Eastern Empire&#x27;s sole emperor after the death of his father, Arcadius, in 408. His reign was marked by the promulgation of the Theodosian law code and the construction of the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople. He also presided over the outbreak of two great Christological controversies, Nestorianism and Eutychianism.

== Early life ==

Theodosius was born on 10 April 401 as the only son of Emperor Arcadius and his wife Aelia Eudoxia. On 10 January 402, at the age of 9 months, he was proclaimed co-a&quot;ugustus&quot; by his father, thus becoming the youngest to bear the imperial title up to that point. On 1 May 408, his father died and the seven-year-old boy became the sole emperor of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire.

== Reign ==

=== Early reign ===
The government was at first administered by the praetorian prefect Anthemius, under whose supervision the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople were constructed.

According to the sixth-century historian Procopius and eight-century chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the Sasanian king Yazdegerd I (399–420) was appointed by Arcadius as the guardian of Theodosius, whom Yazdegerd treated as his own child, sending a tutor to raise him and warning that enmity toward him would be taken as enmity toward Persia. Though this story is assumed to be inconclusive, Antiochus, a eunuch of Persian origin, became a tutor and an influence on Theodosius. He also became &quot;praepositus sacri cubiculi&quot; later but Theodosius dismissed him when he reached his adulthood.

In 414, Theodosius&#x27;s older sister Pulcheria vowed perpetual virginity along with her sisters. She was proclaimed &quot;augusta&quot;, and acted as a guardian of her brother. The guardianship ended when he reached his majority, but it is assumed that his sister continued to exert some influence during his reign. In June 421, Theodosius married Aelia Eudocia, a woman of Athenian origin. The two had a daughter named Licinia Eudoxia, another named Flaccilla, and possibly a son called Arcadius.

In 423, the Western Emperor Honorius, Theodosius&#x27;s uncle, died and the &quot;primicerius notariorum&quot; Joannes was proclaimed emperor. Honorius&#x27;s sister Galla Placidia and her young son Valentinian, who had earlier fled to Constantinople to escape Honorius&#x27;s hostility, sought Eastern assistance to claim the throne for Valentinian, and after some deliberation in 424 Theodosius opened the war against Joannes. On 23 October 425, Valentinian III was installed as emperor of the West with the assistance of the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; Helion, with his mother taking an influential role. To strengthen the ties between the two parts of the empire, Theodosius&#x27;s daughter Licinia Eudoxia was betrothed to Valentinian. She married Valentinian III later on 29 October 437, and became empress of the western portion of the empire.

=== University and Law Code ===
In 425, Theodosius founded the University of Constantinople with 31 chairs (15 in Latin and 16 in Greek). Among the subjects were law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music and rhetoric. It is likely that his wife Eudocia encouraged him in this matter and was behind the establishment of the university; she had been born in Athens, where the Neoplatonic School of Athens was the last great center for pagan, classical learning. Eudocia was known for her great intellect.

In 429, Theodosius appointed a commission to collect all of the laws since the reign of Constantine I, and create a fully formalized system of law. This plan was left unfinished, but the work of a second commission that met in Constantinople, assigned to collect all of the general legislations and bring them up to date, was completed; their collection was published as the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; in 438. The law code of Theodosius II, summarizing edicts promulgated since Constantine, formed a basis for the law code of Emperor Justinian I, the , in the following century.

===Banishment of Eudocia===

Eudocia reached the height of her influence with the emperor from 439 to 441, a period in which, according to some sources, the emperor&#x27;s sister Pulcheria was sidelined in favor of his wife. However, a separation ultimately occurred between the imperial couple between 441 and 444, with Eudocia&#x27;s establishment in Jerusalem where she favored monastic Monophysitism. The reasons for her banishment are related by two conflicting tales.

The sixth-century historian John Malalas of Antioch explains Eudocia&#x27;s departure in a legend involving a certain Phrygian apple. Malalas wrote in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that one day, the emperor was on his way to church when a man presented the emperor with an &quot;apple huge beyond any exaggeration.&quot; The emperor thanked the man with 150 solidi, and promptly sent the apple to his wife as a present. Eudocia decided to give the apple to Paulinus, a friend of both her and the emperor. Paulinus, unknowing of where Eudocia had gotten the apple, thought it was fit for only the emperor, and gave it to him. Theodosius was suspicious, and asked Eudocia what she had done with the apple. &quot;I ate it,&quot; she replied, and then Theodosius asked her to confirm her answer with an oath, which she did. Theodosius then presented her with the enormous apple. The emperor was enraged and suspected an affair between Eudocia and Paulinus; he had his lifelong friend Paulinus executed, and Eudocia asked to be exiled to Jerusalem.

But the contemporary East Roman diplomat and historian Priscus and a sixth-century chronicler Marcellinus Comes relate a different story. In their version, Eudocia murdered comes domesticorum Saturninus for killing her close associates. In response, the emperor stripped her of her attendants and she settled in Jerusalem.

===Wars with the Huns, Vandals, and Persians===
The situation between the Romans and the Sassanids deteriorated in 420 due to the Persian persecution of Christians, and the Eastern empire declared war against the Sassanids (421–422); the war ended in an indecisive stalemate, when the Romans were forced to accept peace as the Huns menaced Constantinople. Peace was arranged in 422 without changes to the &quot;status quo&quot;. The later wars of Theodosius were generally less successful.

The Eastern Empire was plagued by raids by the Huns. Early in Theodosius II&#x27;s reign Romans used internal Hun discord to overcome Uldin&#x27;s invasion of the Balkans. The Romans strengthened their fortifications and in 424 agreed to pay 350 pounds of gold to encourage the Huns to remain at peace with the Romans. In 433 with the rise of Attila and Bleda to unify the Huns, the payment was doubled to 700 pounds.

Theodosius became engaged with the affairs of the West after installing Valentinian III as his Western counterpart. When Roman Africa fell to the Vandals in 439, both Eastern and Western Emperors sent forces to Sicily, intending to launch an attack on the Vandals at Carthage, but this project failed. Seeing the borders without significant forces, the Huns and Sassanid Persia both attacked and the expeditionary force had to be recalled. During 443 two Roman armies were defeated and destroyed by the Huns. Anatolius negotiated a peace agreement; the Huns withdrew in exchange for humiliating concessions, including an annual tribute of 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 687 kg) of gold. In 447 the Huns went through the Balkans, destroying among others the city of Serdica (Sofia) and reaching Athyra (Büyükçekmece) on the outskirts of Constantinople. In 449, an Eastern Roman attempt to assassinate Attila failed, however the relations between the two did not deteriorate further.

===Theological disputes===

Theodosius frequently attempted to resolve doctrinal controversies regarding the nature of Christ. During a visit to Syria, Theodosius met the monk Nestorius, a renowned preacher. Nestorius was appointed as archbishop of Constantinople in 428 and became involved in a Christology dispute between two groups. One group called the Virgin Mary &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;birth-giver of God&quot;), based on God being born a man in Christ, and the other rejected the title, based on God being eternal and thus could not be born. Nestorius&#x27; compromise, the title &quot;Christotokos&quot; (&quot;birth-giver of Christ&quot;), was rejected; he was accused of separating Christ&#x27;s divine and human natures, resulting in &quot;two Christs&quot;, in a doctrine later called Nestorianism. Though initially enjoying Theodosius&#x27; favor, Nestorius was strongly opposed by Archbishop Cyril of Alexandria and eventually lost Theodosius&#x27;s support. Nestorius had also alienated the emperor&#x27;s sister, Pulcheria. At Nestorius&#x27;s request, the emperor convened the First Council of Ephesus in 431 to allow Nestorius to contest Cyril&#x27;s accusations of heresy. The council was divided between the Cyrillians and the Nestorians, with Theodosius ultimately favoring the Cyrillians. The council affirmed the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; and condemned Nestorius, who returned to his monastery in Syria and was eventually exiled to a remote monastery in Egypt.

Constantinopolitan abbot Eutyches reignited the theological dispute almost twenty years later by asserting the Monophysite view that Christ&#x27;s divine and human nature were one. Eutyches was condemned by Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople but supported by the powerful Dioscurus of Alexandria, Cyril&#x27;s successor. The Second Council of Ephesus in 449 restored Eutyches and deposed Flavian. The Chalcedonians opposed the decision, with Pope Leo I calling the council the &quot;robber synod&quot;. Theodosius supported the outcome, but it was reversed by the Council of Chalcedon which was held a year after his death in 450.

==Death==

Theodosius died on 28 July 450 as the result of falling off his horse. On 25 November, his sister Pulcheria married the newly elected emperor Marcian, a domesticus under the influential general Aspar. The eunuch Chrysaphius was executed shortly after by the new imperial couple.

Like Constantine I and several of his successors, he was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII in the .

==Assessments and legacy==
Theodosius is often seen by both ancient and modern historians as being constantly pushed around by his sister, wife, and eunuchs, particularly Chrysaphius among them. In the later decades of his life, Chrysaphius rose to prominence as one of the emperor&#x27;s favorites. He favored the pro-Monophysite policy, influenced the foreign policy towards the Huns, and was resented by Pulcheria, general Zeno, and pro-Chalcedonian writers. According to Theodorus Lector, Theodosius was so unmindful of his surroundings that he accidentally signed his sister&#x27;s note selling his wife, Eudocia, into slavery.

However, these views of Theodosius have been challenged in modern scholarship. Some historians argue that contrary to hostile ancient sources, Theodosius was more in control of his government. Others view that the government was controlled mostly by the high ranking civilian officials of the &quot;consistorium&quot;, and not by Pulcheria or Eudocia. Historian Christopher Kelly argues that &quot;the reign of Theodosius II should not be too quickly dismissed, simplified or partitioned&quot;.

Among ancient and medieval writers, Monophysites had a favorable opinion of Theodosius.

Saint Right-Believing Theodosius II the Younger is commemorated in Eastern Orthodox Church on 29 July.

<text>Anne Inez McCaffrey (1 April 1926 – 21 November 2011) was an American writer known for the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; science fiction series. She was the first woman to win a Hugo Award for fiction (Best Novella, &quot;Weyr Search&quot;, 1968) and the first to win a Nebula Award (Best Novella, &quot;Dragonrider&quot;, 1969). Her 1978 novel &quot;The White Dragon&quot; became one of the first science-fiction books to appear on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In 2005 the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named McCaffrey its 22nd Grand Master, an annual award to living writers of fantasy and science fiction. She was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame on 17 June 2006. She also received the Robert A. Heinlein Award for her work in 2007.

== Life and career ==
Anne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the second of three children of Anne Dorothy (née McElroy) and Col. George Herbert McCaffrey. She had two brothers: Hugh (&quot;Mac&quot;, died 1988) and Kevin Richard McCaffrey (&quot;Kevie&quot;). Her father had Irish and English ancestry, and her mother was of Irish descent. She attended Stuart Hall (a girls&#x27; boarding school in Staunton, Virginia), and graduated from Montclair High School in Montclair, New Jersey. In 1947 she graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College with a degree in Slavonic languages and Literature.

In 1950 she married Horace Wright Johnson (died 2009), who shared her interests in music, opera and ballet. They had three children: Alec Anthony, born 1952; Todd, born 1956; and Georgeanne (&quot;Gigi&quot;, Georgeanne Kennedy), born 1959.

Except for a short time in Düsseldorf, the family lived for most of a decade in Wilmington, Delaware. They moved to Sea Cliff, Long Island in 1965, and McCaffrey became a full-time writer.

McCaffrey served a term as secretary-treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1968 to 1970. In addition to handcrafting the Nebula Award trophies, her responsibilities included production of two monthly newsletters and their distribution by mail to the membership.

McCaffrey emigrated to Ireland with her two younger children in 1970, weeks after filing for divorce. Ireland had recently exempted resident artists from income taxes, an opportunity that fellow science-fiction author Harry Harrison had promptly taken and helped to promote. McCaffrey&#x27;s mother soon joined the family in Dublin. The following spring, McCaffrey was guest of honour at her first British science-fiction convention (Eastercon 22, 1971). There she met British reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, who would be a consultant on the science of Pern.

=== Writer ===
McCaffrey had had two short stories published during the 1950s. The first (&quot;Freedom of the Race&quot;, about women impregnated by aliens) was written in 1952 when she was pregnant with her son Alec. It earned a $100 prize in &quot;Science-Fiction Plus&quot;. Her second story, &quot;The Lady in the Tower&quot;, was published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; by editor Robert P. Mills and published again by editor Judith Merril for &quot;The Year&#x27;s Greatest Science Fiction&quot;. McCaffrey said &quot;she thought of the story when wishing herself alone, like a lady in an ivory tower&quot;.

Judith Merril matched McCaffrey with her long-time literary agent Virginia Kidd and invited her to the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop (to which she returned many times), where participants each brought a story to be critiqued. After her first Milford workshop in 1959 she worked on &quot;The Ship Who Sang&quot;, the story which began the Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series. At the story&#x27;s end, the spaceship Helva sings &quot;Taps&quot; for her human partner. Decades later, McCaffrey&#x27;s son Todd called it &quot;almost an elegy to her father&quot;. In interviews between 1994 and 2004, she considered it her best story and her favourite. &quot;I put much of myself into it: myself and the troubles I had in accepting my father&#x27;s death [1954] and a troubled marriage.&quot;

McCaffrey then wrote two more &quot;Ship&quot; stories and began her first novel. Regarding her motivation for &quot;Restoree&quot; (1967), her son recalled her saying, &quot;I was so &quot;tired&quot; of all the weak women screaming in the corner while their boyfriends were beating off the aliens. I wouldn&#x27;t have been—I&#x27;d&#x27;ve been in there swinging with something or kicking them as hard as I could&quot;. McCaffrey explained that it did not require a sequel; it &quot;served its purpose of an intelligent, survivor-type woman as the protagonist of an s-f story&quot;.

Regarding her 1969 &quot;Decision at Doona&quot; (which she dedicated &quot;To Todd Johnson—of course!&quot;), her son recalled that he was directed to lower his voice in his fourth-grade school play when his mother was in the auditorium. That inspired the Doona story, which opens on &quot;an overcrowded planet where just talking too loud made you a social outcast&quot;. As a settler on Doona, the boy talker has a priceless talent.

McCaffrey made a fast start in Ireland, completing for 1971 publication &quot;Dragonquest&quot; and two Gothic novels for Dell, &quot;The Mark of Merlin&quot; and &quot;The Ring of Fear&quot;. With a contract for &quot;The White Dragon&quot; (which would complete the &quot;original trilogy&quot; with Ballantine), her writing stalled. During the next few years the family moved several times in the Dublin area and struggled to make ends meet, supported largely by child-care payments and meager royalties.

The young-adult book market provided a crucial opportunity. Editor Roger Elwood sought short contributions for anthologies, and McCaffrey started the Pern story of Menolly. She delivered &quot;The Smallest Dragonboy&quot; for $154, and four stories which later became &quot;The Crystal Singer&quot;. Futura Publications in London signed her to write books about dinosaurs for children. Editor Jean E. Karl at Atheneum Books sought to attract more female readers to science fiction and solicited &quot;a story for young women in a different part of Pern&quot;. McCaffrey completed Menolly&#x27;s story as &quot;Dragonsong&quot; and contracted for a sequel before its publication in 1976.
The tales of Menolly are continued in &quot;Dragonsinger: Harper of Pern&quot;, and &quot;Dragondrums&quot; as the &quot;Harper Hall Trilogy&quot;. With a contract with Atheneum she was able to buy a home (named &quot;Dragonhold&quot; for the dragons who bought it). Her son wrote, 20 years later, that she &quot;first set dragons free on Pern and then was herself freed by her dragons.&quot;

=== Dragons ===
The first Pern story, &quot;Weyr Search&quot;, was published in 1967 by John W. Campbell in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;. It won the 1968 Hugo Award for best novella, voted by participants in the annual World Science Fiction Convention. The second Pern story, &quot;Dragonrider&quot;, won the 1969 Nebula Award for best novella, voted annually by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Thus she was the first woman to win a Hugo for fiction and the first to win a Nebula.

&quot;Weyr Search&quot; covers the recruitment of a young woman, Lessa, to establish a telepathic bond with a queen dragon at its hatching, thus becoming a dragonrider and the leader of a Weyr community. &quot;Dragonrider&quot; explores the growth of the queen dragon Ramoth, and the training of Lessa and Ramoth. Editor Campbell requested &quot;to see dragons fighting thread [the menace from space]&quot;, and also suggested time travel; McCaffrey incorporated both suggestions. The third story, &quot;Crack Dust, Black Dust&quot;, was not separately published, but the first Pern novel (&quot;Dragonflight&quot;, published by Ballantine Books in 1968) was a fix-up of all three.
Agent Virginia Kidd and editor Betty Ballantine provided advice and assistance for its sequel &quot;Dragonquest&quot;. It was almost complete (and the contract for another sequel signed) before the 1970 move to Ireland. Both Ballantine and fellow writer Andre Norton made suggestions for the mutant white dragon.

Readers waited a long time for the completion of the original trilogy. Progress was not made until 1974–1975, when the New England Science Fiction Association invited McCaffrey to its annual convention (Boskone) as guest of honour (which included publication of a novella for sale on-site). She wrote &quot;A Time When&quot;, which would become the first part of &quot;The White Dragon&quot;.

&quot;The White Dragon&quot; was released with new editions of the first two Pern books, with cover art illustrated by Michael Whelan. It was the first science-fiction book by a woman on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, and the cover painting is still in print from Whelan. The artists share credit for their career breakthroughs.

=== Collaborations ===
McCaffrey said of her collaborations with son Todd McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, &quot;While I would dearly love to have the energy to tell a tale all on my own, I really cannot say that I am not ably represented with my collaborations&quot;. In the Pern collaboration with Todd, she was mainly &quot;making suggestions or being a sounding board&quot;. McCaffrey also gave Todd and his sister Gigi permission to write their own stories set in the Pern universe.

McCaffrey collaborated with author Mercedes Lackey to write &quot;The Ship Who Searched&quot;, the third of seven books in the Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series by McCaffrey and four other authors. She wrote two books in the &quot;Planet Pirates&quot; trilogy with Elizabeth Moon

=== Death ===
McCaffrey died at age 85 on 21 November 2011 at her home in Ireland, following a stroke.

== Books ==
=== Classification ===
In August 1987, &quot;Locus: The magazine of the science fiction &amp; fantasy field&quot; ranked two of the eight extant Pern novels among the &quot;All-Time Best Fantasy Novels&quot;, based on a poll of subscribers; &quot;Dragonflight&quot; was 9th and &quot;The White Dragon&quot; 23rd. Commenting on the &quot;Locus&quot; list, David Pringle called them &quot;arguably science fiction rather than fantasy proper&quot; and named McCaffrey a &quot;leading practitioner&quot; of the planetary romance subgenre of science fiction.

McCaffrey considered most of her work science fiction and enjoyed &quot;cutting them short when they call me a &#x27;fantasy&#x27; writer&quot;. All the Pern books may be considered science fiction, since the dragons were genetically engineered by the Pern colonists. Regarding science, she said &quot;I don&#x27;t keep up with developments, but I do find an expert in any field in which I must explain myself and the science involved&quot;. Astronomer Steven Beard often helped with science questions, and McCaffrey acknowledged reproductive biologist Jack Cohen several times.

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame citation of Anne McCaffrey summarises her genre as &quot;science fiction, though tinged with the tone and instruments of fantasy&quot;, and her reputation as &quot;a writer of romantic, heightened tales of adventure explicitly designed to appeal—and to make good sense to—a predominantly female adolescent audience.&quot;

McCaffrey said in 2000, &quot;There are no demographics on my books which indicate the readers are predominantly of an age or sex group. Dragons have a universal appeal!&quot; Formerly, it was another matter:

I started writing s-f in the late 50s/early 60s, when readership was predominantly male. And their attitudes unreconstructed. [... Women] began reading s-f and fantasy—and, by preference, women writers. My stories had themes and heroines they could, and did, relate to. I never had any trouble with editors and publishers. I had trouble getting male readers to believe I was serious, and a good enough writer to interest them.

In 1999, the American Library Association gave McCaffrey the 11th Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for teens. The librarians credited her with &quot;over 50 novels for young adults and adults&quot; and cited seven published from 1968 to 1979 for the &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot; that the award features: &quot;The Ship Who Sang&quot; (1969) and the first six Pern books (those sometimes called the &quot;original trilogy&quot; and the &quot;Harper Hall trilogy&quot;). The panel chair observed that &quot;McCaffrey&#x27;s focus on the personal and emotional need of human beings mirrors the quest of today&#x27;s teens to find their own place in society.&quot;

=== &quot;Restoree&quot; ===
McCaffrey&#x27;s first novel was &quot;Restoree&quot;, published by Ballantine Books in 1967. Unlike most science fiction books of the era, &quot;Restoree&quot;&#x27;s heroine is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who is willing and able to think for herself and act on her own initiative. McCaffrey was widely quoted as saying that &quot;Restoree&quot; was intended as a &quot;jab&quot; at how women were usually portrayed in science fiction.

=== Federated Sentient Planets universe ===
Several of McCaffrey&#x27;s series (and more than half her books) are set in a universe governed by the &quot;Federated Sentient Planets&quot; (&quot;Federation&quot; or &quot;FSP&quot;). Although Pern&#x27;s history is connected to the Federation, McCaffrey only used it as a backdrop for storytelling and did not consider her different &quot;worlds&quot; to be part of the same universe.

==== Dragonriders of Pern series ====
McCaffrey&#x27;s best-known works are the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series. When colonists from Earth and other planets make a decades-long space journey to Pern (an acronym designating &quot;Parallels Earth, Resources Negligible&quot; stamped on the original exploration team report) to escape interstellar wars, their fledgling society is threatened by &quot;Thread&quot;, a mindless organism that falls like a &quot;hungry rain&quot; to consume all organic material. The survivors of the original expedition create genetically engineered &quot;dragons&quot; from a native species of small fire-breathing, winged reptiles as self-propagating weapons to destroy the encroaching organism in the sky. The majority of the Dragonriders of Pern books take place approximately 2500 years after the planet&#x27;s colonization, when new challenges face the now low-tech, agrarian society that depends on the telepathically linked dragons and riders for protection from their ancient menace, and their long-forgotten origins are ultimately rediscovered.

==== The Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series ====
The Brain &amp; Brawn Ship series comprises seven novels, only the first of which (a fix-up of five previously published stories) was written by McCaffrey alone. The stories in this series deal with the adventures of &quot;shell-people&quot; or &quot;Brains&quot;, who as infants (due to illness or birth defects) have had to be hard-wired into a life-support system. With sensory input and motor nerves tied into a computer they serve as starship pilots (or colony administrators), seeing and feeling the colony or ship as an extension of their own body. They perform this job to pay off their debt for education and hardware, and continue as free agents once the debt is paid. To compensate for the Brains&#x27; inability to move within human habitats they are paired with partners known as &quot;Brawns&quot;, who are trained in a wide array of skills (including the protection of their Brain counterparts). It was considered impossible for a person to adjust to being a shell after the age of two or three. An exception, in &quot;The Ship Who Searched&quot;, was a shell-person who was seven when she became quadriplegic.

The Ship books are set in the same universe as the Crystal Singer books; Brainship-Brawn pairings were also characters in the second and third volumes of that series.

==== The Crystal series ====

The first book (and first of the trilogy), &quot;The Crystal Singer&quot; (1982) is a fix-up of four stories published in 1974–1975.

The Crystal Singer series revolves around the planet Ballybran. Under a permanent biohazard travel restriction due to a potentially-fatal symbiotic organism on the planet&#x27;s surface, Ballybran is the source of valuable crystals that are vital to a number of industries, and home to one of the FSP&#x27;s wealthiest (and most reclusive) organisations: the Heptite Guild. The Heptite Guild is known to require absolute, perfect pitch in hearing and voice for all applicants (especially those seeking to mine crystal by song). Because Ballybran&#x27;s weather is unpredictable and dangerous (Ballybran&#x27;s windstorms will cause exposed crystal to &#x27;scream&#x27; in a discordant, deafening cacophony), the Heptite Guild is prohibited from actively recruiting members.

==== The Coelura series====

&#x27;The Coelura&#x27; explores the theme of environmental abuse, as a precious animal is hunted to near extinction for the thread it spins for its net. The Lady Caissa must choose between protecting the Coelura or meeting her obligations to her father and mother.

&#x27;Nimisha&#x27;s Ship&#x27; takes place in the same universe, as a woman in the First Families becomes a ship designer and on a test run her ship is captured by a wormhole. On exploring a nearby planet, she finds and befriends the remaining crew of a stranded ship who suffered the same fate years before, plus a new sapient species.

==== Ireta ====

The Ireta series (as catalogued by the Internet Speculative Fiction Database) comprises five novels published 1978 to 1991, the first two by McCaffrey as subseries &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; and three as &quot;Planet Pirates&quot; by McCaffrey and co-writers.

They share a fictional premise, and some characters and events overlap. &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; and its sequel follow the Exploration and Evaluation Corps team on the planet Ireta, which did not expect to find dinosaurs. In &quot;Planet Pirates&quot;, all is not well in the FSP: pirates attack the spacelanes. Survivors on Ireta join forces with the survivors of space pirate attacks.

=== The Talents universe ===
&quot;The Talents Universe&quot; (as catalogued by the Internet Speculative Fiction Database) comprises two series: &quot;Talent&quot; and &quot;The Tower and Hive&quot; and share a fictional premise. Eight books (all by McCaffrey alone) tell the story of telepathic, telekinetic individuals that become increasingly important to the proper function of interstellar society.

=== Doona ===

Two civilisations in near-identical circumstances – an overlarge, lethargic population and a tragic history with sentient aliens – end up attempting to colonise the same planet by accident. What the humans do not know is that the people they have misidentified as nomadic natives are more technically advanced than themselves (and under no such illusions regarding the humans). The books are set prior to the formation of the Federation of Sentient Planets; in this series, the ruling body is the &#x27;Amalgamated Planets&#x27;.

=== Petaybee universe ===

The Petaybee universe comprises two trilogies (&quot;Powers&quot; and &quot;The Twins of Petaybee&quot;) by McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough.

=== The Barque Cat series ===

This series introduces a new universe with space faring Barque Cats and their special telepathically linked humans.

=== The Freedom series ===
The Freedom series (or the &quot;Catteni Sequence&quot;) comprises one 1970 short story and four &quot;Freedom&quot; novels written between 1995 and 2002.

=== Acorna universe ===

The &quot;Acorna Universe series&quot; comprises ten novels published between 1997 and 2007: seven sometimes known as &quot;Acorna&quot; and three sometimes known as &quot;Acorna&#x27;s Children&quot;. The series involve a group of intergalactic miners who adopt a mysterious alien foundling with unicorn-like physiognomy and apparent magical abilities. The first two were written by McCaffrey and Margaret Ball, and the rest by McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough.

=== Other works ===
McCaffrey also published two short-story collections, several romances, and children&#x27;s books.

Her nonfiction work includes two cookbooks and a book about dragons in general.

<doc id="61648" wikidata="Q659662" url="?curid=61648" title="Natural abundance">
<text>In physics, natural abundance (NA) refers to the abundance of isotopes of a chemical element as naturally found on a planet. The relative atomic mass (a weighted average, weighted by mole-fraction abundance figures) of these isotopes is the atomic weight listed for the element in the periodic table. The abundance of an isotope varies from planet to planet, and even from place to place on the Earth, but remains relatively constant in time (on a short-term scale).

As an example, uranium has three naturally occurring isotopes: 238U, 235U, and 234U. Their respective natural mole-fraction abundances are 99.2739–99.2752%, 0.7198–0.7202%, and 0.0050–0.0059%. For example, if 100,000 uranium atoms were analyzed, one would expect to find approximately 99,274 238U atoms, approximately 720 235U atoms, and very few (most likely 5 or 6) 234U atoms. This is because 238U is much more stable than 235U or 234U, as the half-life of each isotope reveals: 4.468 × 109 years for 238U compared with 7.038 × 108 years for 235U and 245,500 years for 234U.

Exactly because the different uranium isotopes have different half-lives, when the Earth was younger, the isotopic composition of uranium was different. As an example, 1.7×109 years ago the NA of 235U was 3.1% compared with today&#x27;s 0.7%, and that allowed a natural nuclear fission reactor to form, something that cannot happen today.

However, the natural abundance of a given isotope is also affected by the probability of its creation in nucleosynthesis (as in the case of samarium; radioactive 147Sm and 148Sm are much more abundant than stable 144Sm) and by production of a given isotope as a daughter of natural radioactive isotopes (as in the case of radiogenic isotopes of lead).

==Deviations from natural abundance==
It is now known from study of the Sun and primitive meteorites that the solar system was initially almost homogeneous in isotopic composition. Deviations from the (evolving) galactic average, locally sampled around the time that the Sun&#x27;s nuclear burning began, can generally be accounted for by mass fractionation (see the article on mass-independent fractionation) plus a limited number of nuclear decay and transmutation processes. There is also evidence for injection of short-lived (now-extinct) isotopes from a nearby supernova explosion that may have triggered solar nebula collapse. Hence deviations from natural abundance on Earth are often measured in parts per thousand (per mille or ‰) because they are less than one percent (%).

An exception to this lies with the presolar grains found in primitive meteorites. These small grains condensed in the outflows of evolved (&quot;dying&quot;) stars and escaped the mixing and homogenization processes in the interstellar medium and the solar accretion disk (also known as the solar nebula or protoplanetary disk). As stellar condensates (&quot;stardust&quot;), these grains carry the isotopic signatures of specific nucleosynthesis processes in which their elements were made. In these materials, deviations from &quot;natural abundance&quot; are sometimes measured in factors of 100.

==Natural isotope abundance of some elements==
The next table gives the terrestrial isotope distributions for some elements. Some elements, such as phosphorus and fluorine, only exist as a single isotope, with a natural abundance of 100%.

<text>Year 154 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Opimius and Albinus/Glabrio (or, less frequently, year 600 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 154 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Hispania ====
* The Lusitanians harry the inhabitants of the Roman provinces in Hispania. At the same time, the Celtiberians of Numantia on the Douro revolt against their Roman occupation.

==== Asia Minor ====
* After a two-year struggle, Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamum is finally able to defeat Prusias II, the aggressive king of Bithynia in northern Anatolia. He is assisted in his battle against Prusias II by Ariarathes V of Cappadocia (who has sent his son Demetrius to command his forces) and by the Romans.
* After his victory, Attalus II insists on heavy reparations from Prusias II. In response, Prusias II sends his son Nicomedes to Rome to ask the Romans&#x27; help in reducing the amount of these reparations.

==== Egypt ====
* The Egyptian king Ptolemy VI Philometor defeats his brother, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes, after he attempts to seize Cyprus by force. Nevertheless Philometor restores his brother to Cyrenaica, marries one of his daughters to him, and grants him a grain subsidy.

==== China ====
* The Rebellion of the Seven States against the Han dynasty fails and Emperor Jing of Han further consolidates his power at the expense of the regional, semi-autonomous kings governing the eastern portion of the empire.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Gaius Gracchus, Roman politician, younger brother of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, who, like him, will pursue a popular political agenda that ultimately ends in his death (d. 121 BC)
* Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus, Roman philologist and speechwriter (d. 74 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Chao Cuo, Chinese advisor and official of the Han dynasty (b. c. 200 BC)
* Liu Pi, Chinese prince and general of the Han dynasty (b. 216 BC)

=== By place ===

==== Hispania ====
* Under the command of Punicus and then Caesarus, the Lusitani, a Hispanic tribe, reach a point near modern day Gibraltar. Here they are defeated by the Roman praetor Lucius Mummius.

==== Roman Republic ====
* As part of the Roman efforts to fully conquer and occupy the whole of Illyria, a Roman army under consul Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum attacks the Dalmatians for the first time and conquers the Dalmatian capital of Delminium. As a result, the Dalmatians are compelled to pay tribute to Rome, which puts an end to the first Dalmatian war. In recognition of his victory, Corculum is granted a triumph in Rome.

==== Bactria ====
* Menander I (known as Milinda in Sanskrit and Pali) begins his reign as king of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. His territories cover the eastern dominions of the divided Greek empire of Bactria (Panjshir and Kapisa) and extend to the modern Pakistani province of Punjab, most of the Indian states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and the Jammu region. His capital is considered to have been Sagala, a prosperous city in northern Punjab believed to be modern Sialkot.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Carthaginians, prevented by their treaty with Rome from engaging in armed resistance, but equally guaranteed against any loss of territory, appeal to Rome against the depredations of King Masinissa of Numidia. The Roman censor Marcus Porcius Cato heads a commission which arbitrates a truce between Carthage and her former ally, Masinissa.
* During his time in Carthage, Cato is so struck by the evidence of Carthaginian prosperity that he is convinced that the security of Rome now depends on the annihilation of Carthage. From this time on, Cato keeps repeating the cry &quot;Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot; (&quot;Moreover, I advise that Carthage must be destroyed&quot;) at the end of all his speeches, no matter what subject they concern.
* After Ariarathes V has been deposed from the Cappadocian throne by the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter and has fled to Rome, the new king of Cappadocia, Orophernes, sends two ambassadors to Rome to join the Seleucid emissaries of Demetrius in opposing Ariarathes V&#x27;s return to power. Despite their efforts, Ariarathes V is restored to his throne by the Romans. However, Rome allows Orophernes to reign jointly with him. The joint government, however, does not last long, as Ariarathes V becomes sole king of Cappadocia shortly afterwards.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Jonathan Maccabeus is recognised by the Seleucids as a minor king within their dominions.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* 30 July – Wu of Han, who will be emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty from 141 BC (d. 87 BC)
* Gaius Marius, Roman general, consul (approximate year) (d. 86 BC)
* Sanatruces (also known as Sinatruces or Sanatruk), King of Parthia who will rule the Parthian Empire from around 77 BC (approximate date) (d. c. 70 BC)

== Deaths ==
* July 6 – Wen of Han, Emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty since 180 BC (b. 200 BC)

* The Seleucid king, Demetrius I Soter defeats a Jewish rebellion at Palestine.
* In response to the Jewish high priest, Alcimus&#x27;, request for assistance, the Seleucid general Bacchides leads an army into Judea with the intent of reconquering this now independent kingdom. Bacchides rapidly marches through Judea after carrying out a massacre of the Assideans in Galilee. He quickly makes for Jerusalem, besieging the city and trapping Judas Maccabeus, the spiritual and military leader of the Maccabees, inside. However, Judas and many of his supporters manage to escape the siege.

* Demetrius I defeats and kills the rebel general Timarchus and is recognized as king of the Seleucid empire by the Roman Senate. Demetrius acquires his surname of Soter (meaning &quot;Saviour&quot;) from the Babylonians, for delivering them from the tyranny of Timarchus. The Seleucid empire is temporarily united again.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== by side ===

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The rebel Seleucid general and ruler of Media, Timarchus, who has distinguished himself by defending Media against the emergent Parthians, treats Demetrius I&#x27;s violent accession to the Seleucid throne as the excuse to declare himself an independent king and extend his realm from Media into Babylonia.
* With the restoration of peace in Judea, an internal struggle breaks out between the supporters of Judas Maccabeus and the Hellenic party. The influence of the Hellenic Party all but collapses in the wake of the Seleucid defeat.
* The Jewish High Priest Menelaus, who is supported by the Hellenist party, is removed from office and is executed. His successor is a moderate member of the Hellenic party, Alcimus. However, when Alcimus executes sixty Jews who are opposed to him, he finds himself in open conflict with the Maccabees. Alcimus flees from Jerusalem and goes to Damascus to ask the Seleucid king, Demetrius I, for help.
* The Maccabees, led by Judas Maccabeus, and a Seleucid army, led by the Seleucid general Nicanor, fight the Battle of Adasa, near Beth-horon. Maccabeus wins the battle and Nicanor is killed.

==== Egypt ====
* Ptolemy VIII Euergetes, now king of Cyrenaica, convinces the Roman Senate to back his claim for control of Cyprus, but the Egyptian king Ptolemy VI Philometor ignores this threat, and after Ptolemy VIII Euergetes&#x27; attempt to conquer the island fails, the Roman Senate disengages from the dispute.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman playwright Terence&#x27;s plays &quot;Eunuchus&quot; (The Eunuch) and &quot;Phormio&quot; are first performed.
* Envoys of Judas Maccabeus conclude a treaty of friendship with the Roman Senate.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The Maccabees, under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus, continue their struggle against the Seleucids and persecute the Hellenising faction in Judea.
* Seleucid forces still control the Acra, a strong fortress within Jerusalem that faces the Temple Mount. Judas Maccabeus lays siege to the fortress and in response, the Seleucid general and regent to the young Seleucid king Antiochus V, Lysias, approaches Jerusalem and besieges Beth-zechariah, 25 kilometres from the city. Judas lifts his own siege on the Acra, and leads his army south to Beth-zechariah. In the ensuing Battle of Beth-zechariah, the Seleucids achieve their first major victory over the Maccabees, and Judas is forced to withdraw to Jerusalem.
* Lysias then lays siege to the city. Just when capitulation by the Maccabees seems imminent, Lysias has to withdraw when the commander-in-chief under the late Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Philip, rebels against him. As a result, Lysias decides to propose a peaceful settlement which is accepted by the Maccabees. The terms of peace involve the restoration of religious freedom, permission for the Jews to live in accordance with their own laws, and the official return of the Temple in Jerusalem to the Jews.
* With the aid of the Greek statesman and historian Polybius, the son of the former Seleucid king Seleucus IV Philopator, Demetrius escapes from Rome, where he has been held as a hostage for many years, and returns to Syria to claim the throne from his cousin Antiochus V. In the resulting dispute, Antiochus V and his regent, Lysias, are overthrown and put to death. Demetrius then establishes himself on the Seleucid throne.

==== Georgia ====
* The king of Caucasian Iberia, Saurmag I, dies. Having no son, he is succeeded by his son-in-law, Mirian.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Antiochus V Eupator, ruler of the Seleucid Empire, who has reigned since 164 BC (b. c. 173 BC)
* Lysias or Lusias, Seleucid general and governor of Syria and regent for Antiochus V Eupator
* Saurmag I, king of Caucasian Iberia
* Gnaeus Octavius, Roman statesman and general

<text>The Crisis of the Tumu Fortress, also known as the Tumu Crisis, or the Jisi Incident, was a border conflict between the Oirat Mongols and the Ming dynasty. In July 1449, Esen Taishi, leader of the Oirat Mongols, launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China. Despite having capable generals, Emperor Yingzong of Ming, under the influence of eunuch Wang Zhen who dominated the Ming court at the time, made the decision to personally lead his armies into battle against Esen. On 1 September, the Ming army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the much weaker Mongols, and the emperor was captured. This defeat was one of the biggest military failures in the Ming dynasty&#x27;s three centuries of existence, and it was largely attributed to the poor leadership of the Ming army. 

Esen, for his part, was not prepared for the scale of his victory or for the capture of the Ming emperor. Initially, he attempted to use the captured emperor to raise a ransom and planned to conquer the undefended Ming capital of Beijing. His plan was foiled due to the steadfast leadership of the Ming commander in the capital, Yu Qian, and the ascension of the captured emperor&#x27;s brother, the Jingtai Emperor. Emperor Yingzong was eventually released in 1450, but he was placed under house arrest by his brother. Esen himself faced growing criticism for his failure to exploit his victory over the Ming and was assassinated six years after the battle in 1455.

==Background==
===Military situation===
After the death of the Yongle Emperor in 1424, the defense of the northern borders of Ming China began to deteriorate. Despite complaints from generals about the lack of resources, no action was taken. In 1435 and 1438, some garrisons were reinforced, but the overall situation remained unchanged. Inland, only half of the supposed 2.5 million soldiers in the &quot;Weisuo&quot; garrison system were actually performing their duties. Hereditary soldiers from &quot;Weisuo&quot; garrisons were often exploited by officers, leading to a reliance on inadequate grain supplies from the interior. As a result, the quality of training, weapons, and equipment declined. The Beijing garrison was frequently used for construction projects, such as defensive positions, but more often for the building of palaces, temples, and private residences for officers and eunuchs of the imperial palace.

The defense of the northern border was primarily focused on the area between China and the steppe, as the outposts in present-day Inner Mongolia had been abandoned. The Great Wall had not yet been constructed and the border was only guarded by patrols between fortified cities. The defense of the northeast relied on three main fortified cities: Xuanfu, Datong, and Beijing. The fortifications of Beijing were not completed until 1445. In Xuanfu, there were 90,000 soldiers, with 35,000 ready for battle and 55,000 in training. Additionally, there were 25,000 horsemen and 9,000 firearms of various types, as well as 90,000 hand rockets. Datong had a stronger cavalry force, with 35,000 horses, and was supported by 160,000 men in Beijing. The reserve consisted of garrisons stationed in northeastern China, specifically in North Zhili, Shandong, and Henan.

The border patrol battalions were meant to hold off the enemy until the main forces arrived, but with Xuanfu only 180 km from Beijing, the defense system lacked depth and relied on a quick and decisive response to any attack.

===Sino–Mongol relations===
The Mongols were divided into three groups: the Uriankhai in the southeast, the Eastern Mongols (also known as Tatars) in the east, and the Oirats in the west. After Arughtai, leader of the Eastern Mongols, was defeated in 1434, the Oirats took control over Mongolian Plateau. Their chief, Toghon, the Choros taishi, or &quot;grand marshal&quot;, strengthened their authority by arranging for his daughter to marry the young khan of the Eastern Mongols, Toghtoa Bukha. After Toghon&#x27;s death in 1440, his son Esen inherited the title of taishi, and &quot;de facto ruler of all Mongols&quot;. Esen was more ambitious than his father, and in 1443 and 1445, he launched attacks on Hami, an important city on the route from China to Central Asia near the Chinese border. In 1448, he successfully conquered it. He also attempted to gain the support of the Mongol divisions in the Ming army in the western Chinese province of Gansu. In the east, his authority extended to the borders of Korea. In Beijing, he was viewed as a threat by those who opposed Wang Zhen, a powerful eunuch who held great influence at the imperial court in the 1440s.

In their relationship with China, the Mongols were primarily interested in free trade, specifically in the exchange of horses for tea, silk, and other luxury goods. However, the Ming government imposed restrictions and regulations on trade, limiting it to a few designated border towns, with Datong being the main hub. As Esen&#x27;s power and influence expanded, so did his dependence on these goods to maintain the loyalty of the Mongol tribes. This led to a significant number of Mongols in border markets in the late 1440s, with up to two thousand arriving each year. The large number of armed horsemen posed a serious security concern for the Ming authorities. As a result, the Ming government protested against the excessive number of incoming Mongols, causing a sharp deterioration in their relationship. In 1449, the Ming ultimately rejected the Mongols&#x27; request for goods and only provided them with a fifth of what was requested. This rejection led the Mongols to resort to force. The immediate cause of the war was Ming&#x27;s refusal to grant Esen&#x27;s request to marry an imperial princess for his son.

==Crisis==
===Mongol invasion===

In July 1449, Esen launched a large-scale invasion of China, with the Mongols advancing in three directions. Toghtoa Bukha Khan and the Uriankhai attacked the Liaodong Peninsula in the east, while the second Mongol army advanced on Xuanfu and the third, led by Esen himself, advanced on Datong. The main objective of this campaign was to capture the fortified cities of Xuanfu and Datong, which would grant the Mongols unrestricted access to the northern regions of China.

On 20 July, news of the raid reached Beijing and the emperor responded by ordering four generals and 45,000 soldiers from the Beijing garrison to advance to Datong and Xuanfu to protect the border. After learning on 30 July that Esen had already attacked Datong, Emperor Yingzong ordered the mobilization of the Beijing garrison. He also declared his intention to personally lead a punitive expedition without consulting his ministers.

Emperor Yingzong was known for his love of military parades, often organized for him by Wang Zhen. His self-confidence was further bolstered by the recent successes of the Ming troops in the Luchuan–Pingmian campaigns and in suppressing the rebellion of Deng Maoqi. All previous Ming emperors, except for Jianwen Emperor, personally led armies into battle. Therefore, Wang Zhen used this to support the emperor&#x27;s decision.

The first to protest were Minister of War Kuang Ye () and his deputy Yu Qian. They believed that the monarch&#x27;s participation in a punitive expedition was an unacceptably risky adventure. Other officials also attempted to dissuade the emperor from joining the campaign. Minister of Personnel Wang Zhi () wrote a memorandum on behalf of the dissenting officials, arguing that officers were responsible for the dangers of war, and the emperor, as the head of the imperial family and the empire, and the person on whom the world&#x27;s attention was focused, should not expose themselves to danger. Although the emperor appreciated his concern, he remained determined to carry out his plans. The last attempt to stop the emperor was made by a supervising secretary as the army was leaving the city. He threw himself in front of the emperor&#x27;s palanquin, but was unsuccessful.

On 3 August, Esen&#x27;s army defeated the poorly supplied Ming army from Datong at the Yanghe Pass. On the same day, Emperor Yingzong appointed his younger brother Zhu Qiyu, Prince of Cheng, to oversee the administration of the capital during the campaign. Zhu Qiyu was assisted by four representatives from the most influential power groups. These included Prince Consort Commander Jiao Jing (), who represented the imperial family; Jin Ying, the head of the Directorate of Ceremonial and the highest-ranking eunuch in the absence of Wang Zhen; Minister Wang Zhi, who led the government; and Grand Secretary Gao Gu (). All major decisions were to be postponed until the emperor&#x27;s return.

Despite the deteriorating security situation, the emperor made a sudden decision without any prior preparations. This left the soldiers with only a few days, from 1 to 4 August, to get ready for the campaign. The emperor was accompanied by twenty experienced generals, most of whom held noble titles, and an equal number of high-ranking officials. They were also accompanied by hundreds of lower-ranking dignitaries, with Wang Zhen serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief. While the number of mobilized soldiers is unknown, it is often estimated to be around half a million, but in reality, the actual number may have been significantly smaller. Even under optimal conditions, supplying such a large army would have been challenging. The troops were hastily assembled, poorly supplied, and incompetently led, ultimately leading to disaster.

===Ming counterattack===
The army departed from Beijing on 4 August and headed towards the Juyong Pass. The objective was to make a swift and brief march westward, passing through Xuanfu and reaching Datong. The plan was to conduct a rapid campaign in the steppe and then return to Beijing via the southern route. This route was chosen to avoid excessive destruction in the region along the Beijing–Xuanfu–Datong road, as the army would be passing through it twice. The return journey would take them through Yuzhou and the Zijing Pass.

From the very beginning, chaos and disarray plagued the army. The soldiers trudged on through relentless heavy rain. After seven days, they finally reached Xuanfu, but only after being delayed by a storm. Despite pleas from many to turn back, both in Xuanfu and earlier in Juyong Pass, Wang Zhen urged them to press on. By 12 August, some officials were already discussing the possibility of assassinating Wang Zhen and bringing the emperor back, but they lacked the courage to follow through with their plan.

On 16 August, the army arrived at the corpse-strewn battlefield of Yanghe. Two days later, on 18 August, the emperor reached Datong. During the journey, more soldiers died from starvation due to poor supplies than from skirmishes with the enemy. Upon reaching Datong, Wang Zhen received reports from local commanders and information from nearby border garrisons, which convinced him that continuing the campaign into the steppe would be dangerous. As a result, the expedition was declared victorious and the army turned back on 20 August. The discipline of the army had already begun to deteriorate. Wang Zhen was also concerned about the impact of the army&#x27;s passage on his hometown in Yuzhou (present-day Yu County, Hebei), so he insisted on returning the same way they had come.

On 27 August, the returning troops arrived in Xuanfu. Just three days later, the Mongols launched an attack on the Ming army&#x27;s rear in Xuanfu, resulting in its destruction. The Mongols then proceeded to Yao&#x27;er Gorge, where they ambushed and destroyed a newly formed rear guard of 40,000 cavalry under the command of General Zhu Yong (). The following day, 31 August, the Ming army set up camp at the Tumu post station. Despite suggestions from ministers, Wang Zhen refused to seek refuge in the nearby walled city of Huailai, which was only 10.5 km away. Wang Zhen&#x27;s reluctance was due to his desire to keep his baggage with him. The army faced a lack of water in Tumu, leaving the men and horses thirsty.

===Tumu debacle===

Esen dispatched troops to block Chinese access to the river south of their camp. By the morning of 1 September, the Mongols had surrounded the Chinese camp and offered to negotiate. Wang Zhen ignored their overtures and instead ordered the confused Ming army to advance towards the river. A battle ensued between the disorganized Ming army and the vanguard of the Mongol army, with Esen himself choosing not to participate. Only 20,000 Mongols were involved in the battle but the hungry and thirsty Ming soldiers were unable to put up much resistance. The Ming army suffered a swift defeat, with nearly half of its soldiers lost and a significant amount of weapons and equipment seized by the Mongols. Among the casualties were high-ranking officials, including two dukes, two marquises, five counts, several generals, and hundreds of officials. Notable figures such as the old general Zhang Fu and Grand Secretaries Cao Nai () and Zhang Yi () were also killed. After reclaiming the area, Ming troops were able to gather tens of thousands of firearms, armor, and other equipment left behind by the defeated army.

During the battle, the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard attempted to remove him from the fighting, but were unsuccessful. In the chaos, one of the Ming officers killed Wang Zhen. The emperor was then captured and taken to a Mongol camp near Xuanfu on 3 September. Esen decided not to kill him and instead chose to inform the Ming side of the emperor&#x27;s survival before deciding on his next course of action.

==Aftermath==
Empress Dowager Sun and Empress Qian, who were leading the court, learned of the battle and the emperor&#x27;s capture on the night of 2–3 September. They quickly sent gifts to Esen, along with a request for the emperor&#x27;s release. Panic spread as the Beijing garrison was left with less than 100,000 soldiers and the fate of Datong and Xuanfu was uncertain.

Reader-in-waiting Xu Cheng, a native of Suzhou known for his military strategy skills and familiarity with the border situation, suggested temporarily moving the capital to the south to keep it safe from the enemy. Minister of Rites Hu Ying opposed this plan, arguing that the tombs of the Yongle and Xuande emperors could not be abandoned. Vice Minister of War Yu Qian then strongly opposed the idea, even threatening to execute anyone who suggested it. This calmed down the panicking officials, as Yu Qian was supported by influential eunuchs and Grand Secretaries Chen Xun () and Shang Lu (). Although Empress Dowager Sun reluctantly approved staying and authorized any necessary actions to defend the capital, many officials chose to flee south, and some sent their families there for safety.

Meanwhile, the Mongols approached Xuanfu and demanded entry into the city for the captured Emperor Yingzong and his entourage. The defenders of the city responded by shooting at them. The Mongols then retreated to Datong. In a separate message to Beijing, the emperor requested that supplies be provided for the Mongols. The local commanders at Datong also refused to open the gates; they cited imperial orders as their reason for not surrendering. Regional commander Liu An went to the Mongol camp to meet with the emperor, followed by several officials and officers from the city, but the city was not surrendered. Liu An only handed over the local silver reserve (140,000 &quot;liang&quot;) to the emperor, who then distributed it among the Mongol chieftains.

On 4 September, Minister Wang Zhi requested the empress dowager appoint the Prince of Cheng to govern the country. The empress dowager agreed, but limited his authority by labeling it as &quot;special&quot; and &quot;temporary&quot;. Additionally, she also promoted the two-year-old Zhu Jianshen, eldest son of the captured emperor, to the position of crown prince. This appointment was made on 6 September.

Yu Qian used his position as the highest-ranking official in the Ministry of War to oversee defense preparations. He ensured that grain was transported from the granaries in Tongzhou, located near Beijing, where almost half of the grain stocks were stored. The Prince of Cheng also supported Yu&#x27;s plan to gather military units from nearby provinces and the south, as well as levies from the metropolitan area. On 7 September, Yu was appointed as Minister of War. On the same day, commanders in Datong were warned against responding to the captured emperor&#x27;s requests.

===Enthronement of a new emperor and the defense of Beijing===

On 15 September, officials in Beijing urged the Prince of Cheng to assume the role of emperor in order to stabilize the government and reduce the importance of the captured Emperor Yingzong in the hands of the Oirats. Although initially hesitant, the prince eventually ascended the throne as the Jingtai Emperor on 17 (or 23) September. He declared his captive brother as the &quot;emperor emeritus&quot; (; &quot;Taishang Huangdi&quot;), a title that was purely honorary.

In response to the threat of invasion from the Mongols, Yu Qian withdrew 80,000 soldiers from Xuanfu and other areas to defend Beijing. He also called in reserves from northern China, including transport and training units and coast guard units. New commanders were appointed and defenses were organized. Meanwhile, Esen once again approached Datong, this time claiming to be defending Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s right to the throne. His claim was rejected by the garrison at Yanghe Pass. He then marched on Beijing with the intention of restoring Emperor Yingzong to the throne. The defenders at the Jijing Pass held off the Mongol army for several days before being outnumbered. Esen finally reached Beijing on 27 October. With 220,000 men at his disposal, Yu Qian was able to fend off the 70,000 Mongol troops. After five days of fighting, the Mongols realized they did not have the strength to take the city and returned to their homeland. Following Esen&#x27;s failed campaign, the Ming troops were able to drive out the remaining smaller Mongol forces from China. As a result of Esen&#x27;s defeat, Mongol unity began to crumble rapidly. Just a few days after his departure from Beijing, Toghtoa Bukha Khan sent an envoy with tribute to the Ming court.

In the following weeks, the Mongols continued their border raids, sometimes involving numerous detachments. The Ming army, commanded from Beijing by Yu Qian, responded by strengthening the defenses of the passes, while the Ming cavalry cleared the border steppes. The operations of the Ming troops did not have significant results, but they faced difficulties in supplying their troops due to the destruction of the surrounding area.

Esen then offered to release Emperor Yingzong, but the Jingtai Emperor was hesitant to accept, as he wanted to solidify his position in the palace and government before allowing his brother to return. As a result, Emperor Yingzong was not able to return until September 1450, remaining in captivity for twelve and a half months. Upon his return, the Jingtai Emperor felt threatened by Emperor Yingzong and ordered him to stay in the Southern Palace within the Forbidden City, limiting his contact with the outside world. Essentially, Emperor Yingzong was under house arrest.

==Consequences==

The Tumu Crisis sparked a major reorganization of Ming authorities and the military, which ultimately contributed to the relative stability of the Ming dynasty for the remainder of the 15th century. Although the initial impact of losing the battle and capturing the emperor was significant, the fortified cities were able to hold their ground against the Mongols, preventing them from permanently occupying any territory. There were no territorial changes, and relations between the two sides returned to their previous state after a few months. The Mongols&#x27; main objective was not to gain territory, but rather to establish stable trade relations with China. As a result, Esen quickly established positive relations with the Ming dynasty following the battle. His failure to make significant gains led to widespread criticism in Mongolia and weakened his authority. In 1453, he declared himself Khan, but was murdered just two years later.

<text>The Battle of Xiangyang () was a protracted series of battles between the Yuan dynasty and the Southern Song dynasty from 1267 to 1273. The battle was a significant victory for the Yuan dynasty and ended a 30-year defensive campaign waged by the Southern Song dynasty, allowing Yuan forces to advance into the Southern Song heartland. The capture of Xiangyang also allowed the Yuan dynasty to take control of the Han and Yangtze rivers, thereby depriving the Southern Song dynasty of two formidable natural barriers. The defeat devastated the Southern Song dynasty, which collapsed several years later at the Battle of Yamen.

The battle consisted of skirmishes, ground assault, and the siege of the twin fortified cities of Fancheng and Xiangyang in modern-day Hubei, China. Lü Wenhuan, commander-in-chief of the Southern Song dynasty, surrendered to Yuan Emperor Kublai Khan in 1273. The conventional use of Mongol cavalry was restricted by the woody terrain and numerous military outposts of the Southern Song. Chinese firearms and cannons were employed by the Yuan in the victorious siege of Fancheng after capturing the outposts and relieving Southern Song forces from Sichuan and Yuezhou, which broke through the siege but was eventually defeated. The use of the counterweight trebuchet by the Yuan proved especially effective.

== Background ==

Before the rule of Kublai Khan, the Mongols had launched military campaigns as far as Eastern Europe, and had conquered Russia, Siberia, Tibet, Korea, North China, Yunnan, Iraq, Anatolia and Iran. However, the Song dynasty was difficult to conquer because of the strategic location of Xiangyang, which became a vital position for Kublai to capture and hold. The city guarded the waterways of South China because the Han River was a major tributary into the Yangtze river. Once the city fell, the Mongols obtained easy access into important Southern cities in China and the Southern Song would collapse shortly after.

The Southern Song knew the importance of this vital spot, and treated the defense of Xiangyang as important as their capital. The city was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and a river (Han river) on one side. Song stored massive amount of supplies inside the fortress, as preparation for long sieges. They also built high walls and towers on all four sides of the fortress. Each entrance of the fortress had at least two layers of walls, used to trap enemy sieging forces inside.

In 1133, the famous Song general Yue Fei led many successful campaigns against the Jin dynasty, in the Xiangyang area. From there, he pushed the Jin army back north as far as Kaifeng. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols under the leadership of Ögedei. At that time, Mongols and the Southern Song dynasty were allies. After that, the two former allies did not have any common enemy. The Song killed Mongol envoys and attempted to invade the Mongol territories.

Xiangyang surrendered to the army of the Mongol Empire without resistance in 1236. But the Mongols voluntarily left the city after it was briefly held by them in 1236–38. The twin cities of Xiangyang-Fenchang, with walls almost 5 kilometers around and 200,000 people, withstood a Mongol assault in 1257. The Mongolian cavalry were lured in Xiangyang where they were slaughtered by the Song defenders due to the fortress&#x27;s double-layered wall design. When a Mongol contingent entered the entrance of the fortress, the Mongol forces would be slaughtered to the last man, while trapped between four walls. The Mongols lifted the siege of Xiangyang. The sudden death of Möngke Khan forced the imperial army of the Mongol Empire to withdraw from the Song territory in 1259–60.

In 1260, Kublai Khan was proclaimed successor to the throne after the death of his brother Möngke, as was his youngest brother Ariq Böke. The succession war between him and Ariq Böke began. Kublai Khan won the war eventually, though his claim as the successor to Möngke was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan renamed his empire &quot;Yuan&quot;, establishing the Yuan dynasty, instead of &quot;Ikh Mongol Uls&quot; (Great Mongolian Nation or Great Mongol Empire). After defeating his rivals and opponents in Mongolia and Northern China, Kublai Khan also wanted to continue his grandfather Genghis Khan&#x27;s conquest of China. In 1267, Kublai Khan ordered Aju and the Song defector Liu Zheng to attack Xiangyang and Fencheng. General Lu Zende had levied corruption charges against Liu Zheng, the Luzhou prefect, causing Liu Zheng to defect to the Mongols in 1261

== Siege ==

Aju and Liu Zheng arrived in 1268 and blockaded the city with a ring of forts. Liu Zheng had advised the cities be starved from Sichuan by building forts there. The Mongols probed the defenses of Xiangyang and Fancheng. The Yuan-Mongols learned from their mistake, and this time brought along with them about a hundred trebuchets. These trebuchets had a shooting range of around 100 metres, and could use projectiles of around 50 kg. During Mongol campaigns against the Jin dynasty, the Mongols used about 5,000 trebuchets, and they were very successful in destroying the Jin fortresses. Lu Wende commanded the Song dynasty&#x27;s Yangtze and his son-in-law Fan Wenhu and son Lu Wenhuan commanded Xiangyang.

However the twin cities had expected an assault by bombardment and prepared for it. The city moat was expanded to a width of 150 metres, forcing Yuan siege weapons to set up at a distance. In addition to reinforcing their walls with clay, they made netting screens ten centimetres thick and ten metres in length to cover them and dampen projectile impact. As a result, the Yuan siege weapons were both ineffective and inaccurate, and the few shots that did land bounced off the wall harmlessly.

=== Mongol entrapment ===
The Mongols then started to block Xiangyang off from the rest of Song. A Yuan fleet of 5,000 ships was established, to stop any Song supplies from the Han river. The Han River was blockaded with five stone platforms capped by arbalests. The Mongol trained 70,000 marines but Song food supplies still held out in 1271. The Yuan also sent forces to go around the fortress, and set up camps at the key roads, to stop Song supplies from land. Eventually, Yuan built their own forts at these key locations.

From late 1267 to 1271, Song reinforcements from the south tried, many times, to attack the Mongol positions, in order to supply Xiangyang, but outside of Xiangyang, the Song forces were no match for the Mongolian cavalry. The catalog of useless thrusts continued, the Chinese losing 1,000 in October 1270, 2,000 in August 1271, and most of a 3,000 strong force was destroyed the following month. Once the Yuan forts were completed, the situation became hopeless. As a result, the Song forces inside Xiangyang had to depend on themselves.

The Song had stored years of supplies within Xiangyang. However, by 1271, the fortress finally ran low on their supplies. Still, the Song troops chose to hang on. Finally, in 1272, a small Song force of 3,000 men was able to break through the Yuan naval blockade, and supplied Xiangyang from the Han river. The force, led by two men both named Zhang, commanded a hundred paddle wheel boats, travelling by night under the light of lantern fire, was discovered early on by a Mongol commander. When the Song fleet arrived near the cities, they found the Mongol fleet to have spread themselves out along the entire width of the Yangtze with &quot;vessels spread out, filling the entire surface of the river, and there was no gap for them to enter.&quot; Another defensive measure the Mongols had taken was the construction of a chain, which stretched across the water. The two fleets engaged in combat and the Song opened fire with fire-lances, fire-bombs, and crossbows. A large number of men died trying to cut through chains, pull up stakes, and hurl bombs, while Song marines fought hand to hand using large axes, and according to the Mongol record, &quot;on their ships they were up to the ankles in blood.&quot; With the rise of dawn, the Song vessels made it to the city walls and the citizens &quot;leapt up a hundred times in joy.&quot; This was a major morale boost to the defenders. However, no one could get back out to inform others of the success. The Song officials considered that reinforcement lost and Xiangyang, doomed to fall from the lack of supplies, did not send more Song reinforcements afterwards. The high casualties and low success rates ended the transportation of further supplies.

Aju realized that the twin cities were hard to take with Mongol cavalry and wrote to Kublai that he needed Chinese infantry. Kublai reinforced him with 20,000 men.

=== New weapon of the Yuan forces ===
The defense of Xiangyang came to an end in 1273, with the introduction of the counterweight trebuchet. Because the Han Chinese commander Guo Kan fought with the Mongols under Hulagu in the Middle East, Kublai had heard of siege engines of great effectiveness. Experts Ismail and Al al-Din were sent by Abaqa, Ilkhan of Persia, to China by the decree of Kublai Khan in 1272. They built the powerful siege engines under the Uyghur general Arikhgiya by March, 1273. These counterweight trebuchets had a shooting range of , and could launch projectiles weighing over . On top of their power, these new trebuchets were much more accurate than the old ones, and were the only artillery capable of reaching the walls of Xiangyang. Yuan forces built about 20 of them, and used them to assist the siege of Xiangyang.

The Mongols started the siege with Fancheng in early 1273. Song soldiers in Xiangyang witnessed a giant rock which flew right over the gigantic walls of Fancheng, and hit the houses inside. Under the cover of bombardment, the Yuan army was able to fill the moat and take the walls, after which followed an assault by a cavalry and the storming of the city resulted in high casualties on both sides. Fancheng, after holding out for years, suddenly fell within a few days.

The Yuan Mongol army then turned their attention to Xiangyang. Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong of Song, to request immediate reinforcements. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor. But upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements.

For the next few days, Song soldiers looked to the south for reinforcements, but all they saw were Yuan siege weapons and the Mongols waiting to end their lives. The position of Song forces worsened.

In February, Yuan siege weapons began bombarding the city and a shot happened to hit a stone bridge inside. When the stone landed, it made a thunderous noise. Song soldiers went to check the damage, and saw that the stone had sunk a few feet into the solid ground.

Yuan bombardment began to collapse the city structures as well as reduce the drum tower and turrets on the city walls.

Lu Wenhuan surrendered the city on 14 March 1273; he was made governor of Xiangyang and Fancheng under Yuan rule as part of the terms.

== Aftermath ==
Xiangyang, the strongest fortress of the Song dynasty, had fallen. As a result, Yuan forces were free to conquer the rest of southern China. Everywhere else Yuan went, Song fortresses defected as the defecting Song commander in Xiangyang, Lu Wenhuan, ordered other members of his family commanding Song forces to defect to the Yuan. In 1275, the Song government unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a truce, but by then it was too late.

Many people agree that the fall of Xiangyang essentially marked the end of the Song dynasty. For example, Paul K. Davis wrote, &quot;Mongol victory broke the southern Song dynasty, leading to the establishment of the Yuan dynasty.&quot; For the six years that Yuan sieged Xiangyang, Song were unable to regroup and strike back at Yuan with their resources in the south. In fact, they could not even get much reinforcements and supplies to Xiangyang, to support the hard-working defense there. The emperor of the Song dynasty abdicated on 4 February 1276.

== Role of Chinese-designed gunpowder weapons ==

Both the Song and Mongol forces had thunder crash bombs during the siege, a type of gunpowder weapon. The Mongols also utilized siege crossbows and traction trebuchets. The Song forces used fire arrows and fire lances in addition to their own thundercrash bombs. The Song forces also used paddle ships. Siege crossbows and firebombs were also deployed on Song ships against Mongol forces, in addition to fire lances. The name of the bombs in Chinese was Zhen tian lei. They were made from cast iron and filled with gunpowder, the Chinese Song forces delivered them to the enemy via trebuchets. Armor made out of iron could be penetrated by pieces of the bomb after the explosion, which had a 50-kilometre noise range.

== Role of the counterweight trebuchet ==

Since the Yuan employed Muslim engineers for the designing of the counterweight trebuchets, they were designated in Chinese historiography as the &quot;Muslim&quot; trebuchet (&quot;hui-hui pao&quot;). The Chinese scholar Zheng Sixiao (1206–1283) indicates that, &quot;in the case of the largest ones, the wooden framework stood above a hole in the ground&quot;. After Aju asked Kublai, the Emperor of the Mongol Empire, the powerful siege machines of the Ilkhanate, Ismail and Al-aud-Din from Iraq arrived in South China to construct a new type of trebuchet which used explosive shells. These Muslim engineers built mangonels and trebuchets for the siege. Explosive shells had been in use in China for centuries but what was new was the counterweight type of trebuchet as opposed to the torsion type giving greater range and accuracy as it was easier to judge the weight of the counter weight than the torsion generated by repeated windings.

The counterweight trebuchet built by the Muslims from Mosul were longer in range, and assisted in destroying Fancheng. Chinese and Muslim engineers operated artillery and siege engines for the Mongol armies. The design was taken from those used by Hulegu to batter down the walls of Baghdad.

The Chinese were the first to invent the traction trebuchet, now they faced Muslim designed counterweight trebuchets in the Mongol army. The Chinese responded by building their own counterweight trebuchets, an account from the Chinese said in 1273 &quot;the frontier cities have all fallen. But Muslim trebuchets were constructed with new and ingenious improvements, and different kinds became available, far better than those used before.&quot;

=== The design of the trebuchets deployed at Xiangyang ===
The Chinese scholar Zheng Sixiao (1206–1283) indicates that, &quot;in the case of the largest ones, the wooden framework stood above a hole in the ground&quot;.

Another version is given by Marco Polo in his book &quot;Il Milione&quot; where he claims having been responsible for teaching the Mongols how to build and use catapults during the siege of Xiangyang. However, the names of the Muslim engineers were given by Muslim sources as Talib and his sons Abubakr, Ibrahim and Muhammad, respectively, by Chinese sources as Ala-ud-Din and Isma&#x27;il. Moreover, it has been claimed the siege had already ended before Marco Polo&#x27;s arrival in China.

== Role of political infighting in the Song Court ==
Political infighting among the Song also contributed to the fall of Xiangyang and Fancheng; due to the power of the Lü family, many questioned their allegiance to the Song. The Emperor barred Jia Sidao himself from the command, so Li Tingzhi, an enemy of the Lü family, was appointed commander. Jia permitted the Lü family to ignore Li&#x27;s orders, resulting in a fractious command. Li was then unable to relieve Xiangyang and Fancheng, managing only temporary resupply during several breaks in the siege.

<text>All About My Mother () is a 1999 comedy-drama film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, and starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Candela Peña, Antonia San Juan, Penélope Cruz, Rosa Maria Sardà, and Fernando Fernán Gómez.

The plot originates in Almodóvar&#x27;s earlier film &quot;The Flower of My Secret&quot; (1995) which shows student doctors being trained in how to persuade grieving relatives to allow organs to be used for transplant, focusing on the mother of a teenager killed in a road accident. &quot;All About My Mother&quot; deals with complex issues such as AIDS, gender identity, homosexuality, faith, and existentialism.

The film was a commercial and critical success internationally, winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in addition to the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Awards for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Direction (Almodóvar). The film also won six Goya Awards including Best Film, Best Director (Almodóvar), Best Actress (Roth).

==Plot==
Manuela is an Argentine nurse who supervises donor organ transplants at Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. She is also a single mother to Esteban, a teenager who aspires to become a writer.

On Esteban&#x27;s 17th birthday, he is hit and killed by a car while chasing after actress Huma Rojo for her autograph following a performance of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, where Rojo portrays Blanche DuBois. Manuela allows her son&#x27;s heart to be transplanted to a man in A Coruña. After tracking down the recipient, she resigns from her job and travels to Barcelona in search of Esteban&#x27;s other mother, Lola, a transgender woman whom Manuela had kept secret from her son, just as she had never told Lola about the boy.

In Barcelona, Manuela reunites with her old friend Agrado, a warm and witty transgender sex worker. She also makes several new friends: Rosa, a young HIV positive nun who works in a shelter for battered sex workers and is pregnant with Lola&#x27;s child; Huma Rojo, the actress her son had admired; and Nina Cruz, Huma&#x27;s co-star and lover, who struggles with drug addiction. Manuela&#x27;s life becomes entwined with theirs as she cares for Rosa during her pregnancy, works as Huma&#x27;s personal assistant, or takes the stage as an understudy for Nina during one of her drug abuse crises.

On her way to the hospital, Rosa asks the taxi to stop at a park where she spots her father&#x27;s dog, Sapic, and then her own father, who suffers from Alzheimer&#x27;s. He does not recognize Rosa and asks for her age and height, but Sapic recognizes her. Rosa dies giving birth to a healthy boy; at her funeral, Manuela finally reunites with Lola. Lola (formerly known as Esteban) is dying from AIDS and talks about how she always wanted a son. Manuela tells her about their own son Esteban and his fatal accident. Manuela adopts Rosa&#x27;s son, Esteban, caring for him at Rosa&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. The father does not understand who Manuela is, and Rosa&#x27;s mother introduces her as the new cook who is living there with her son. Rosa&#x27;s father then asks Manuela about her age and height.

Manuela introduces Esteban, Rosa&#x27;s son, to Lola and gives her a picture of their own Esteban. Rosa&#x27;s mother spots them from the street and confronts Manuela about letting strangers see the baby. Manuela tells her that Lola is Esteban&#x27;s other parent, but Rosa&#x27;s mother is appalled and says, &quot;That is the monster that killed my daughter?!&quot;

Manuela flees back to Madrid with Esteban as she cannot live at Rosa&#x27;s house any longer. The grandmother is afraid that she will contract HIV from the baby. Manuela writes a letter to Huma and Agrado saying that she is leaving and apologizes once again for not saying goodbye like she did years before. Two years later, Manuela returns with Esteban to an AIDS convention. She tells Huma and Agrado, who now run a stage show together, that Esteban has been a miracle by becoming HIV-free. Manuela then says she is returning to stay with Esteban&#x27;s grandparents. When Manuela asks Huma about Nina, Huma becomes melancholic and leaves. Agrado tells Manuela that Nina returned to her town, got married, and had a fat, ugly baby boy. Huma rejoins the conversation briefly before exiting the dressing room to go perform.

==Production==
Almodóvar dedicates his film &quot;To all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother&quot;.

Almodóvar recreates the accident scene from John Cassavetes&#x27; &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977) as the epicenter of the dramatic conflict.

The film was mainly shot on location in Barcelona.

The soundtrack includes &quot;Gorrión&quot; and &quot;Coral para mi pequeño y lejano pueblo&quot;, written by Dino Saluzzi and performed by Saluzzi, Marc Johnson, and José Saluzzi, and &quot;Tajabone&quot;, written and performed by Ismaël Lô.

The poster of the film was designed by Madrid illustrator Óscar Mariné. This poster was designed to epitomize the very image of beauty, simplicity, and femininity. The poster intentionally emphasizes red, white, and blue with black accent strokes and a pop of yellow.

==Release==
The film premiered in Spain on 8 April 1999 and went into general theatrical release on 16 April. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, the Auckland Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and the New York Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States. It eventually grossed €9,962,047 in Spain ($12,595,016), $8,344,738 in the US, and $59,609,091 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $67,957,990.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;best film by far&quot;, noting he &quot;presents this womanly melodrama with an empathy to recall George Cukor&#x27;s and an eye-dampening intensity to out-Sirk Douglas Sirk&quot;. She added, &quot;It&#x27;s the crossover moment in the career of a born four-hankie storyteller of ever-increasing stature. Look out, Hollywood, here he comes&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed, &quot;You don&#x27;t know where to position yourself while you&#x27;re watching a film like &quot;All About My Mother&quot;, and that&#x27;s part of the appeal: Do you take it seriously, like the characters do, or do you notice the bright colors and flashy art decoration, the cheerful homages to Tennessee Williams and &quot;All About Eve&quot;, and see it as a parody? . . . Almodóvar&#x27;s earlier films sometimes seemed to be manipulating the characters as an exercise. Here the plot does handstands in its eagerness to use coincidence, surprise, and melodrama. But the characters have a weight and reality, as if Almodóvar has finally taken pity on them – has seen that although their plights may seem ludicrous, they are real enough to hurt&quot;.

Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;No one else makes movies like this Spanish director&quot; and added, &quot;In other hands, these characters might be candidates for confessions – and brawls – on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, but here they are handled with utmost sympathy. None of these goings-on is presented as sordid or seedy. The presentation is as bright, glossy, and seductive as a fashion magazine . . . The tone of &quot;All About My Mother&quot; has the heart-on-the-sleeve emotions of soap opera, but it is completely sincere and by no means camp&quot;.

Wesley Morris of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; called the film &quot;a romantically labyrinthine tribute that piles layers of inter-textual shout-outs to &quot;All About Eve&quot;, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Federico García Lorca and Alfred Hitchcock, and beautifully assesses the nature of facades . . . Almodóvar imbues his Harlequin-novel-meets-Marvel-comic-book melodramas with something more than a wink and a smile, and it is beguiling. His expressionism and his screenwriting have always had fun together, but now there is a kind of faith and spirituality that sexcapades like &quot;Law of Desire&quot; and &quot;Kika&quot; only laughed at... it contains a host of superlative firsts: a handful of the only truly moving scenes he has filmed, the most gorgeous dialogue he has composed, his most dimensional performances of his most dimensional characters and perhaps his most dynamic photography and elaborate production design&quot;.

Jonathan Holland of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;emotionally satisfying and brilliantly played&quot; and commented, &quot;The emotional tone is predominantly dark and confrontational . . . But thanks to a sweetly paced and genuinely witty script, pic doesn&#x27;t become depressing as it focuses on the characters&#x27; stoic resilience and good humor&quot;.

 In 2018 the film was ranked 32nd in BBC&#x27;s list of The 100 greatest foreign language films. British Film Institute ranked the film at No. 69 on its list of &quot;90 great films of 1990s&quot;.

<text>Amorphophallus (from Ancient Greek , &quot;without form, misshapen&quot; + &quot;phallos&quot;, &quot;penis&quot;, referring to the shape of the prominent spadix) is a large genus of some 200 tropical and subtropical tuberous herbaceous plants from the &quot;Arum&quot; family (Araceae), native to Asia, Africa, Australia and various oceanic islands. A few species are edible as &quot;famine foods&quot; after careful preparation to remove irritating chemicals. The genus includes the Titan arum (&quot;A. titanum&quot;) of Indonesia, which has the largest inflorescence in the genus, and is known as the &#x27;corpse flower&#x27; for the pungent odour it produces during its flowering period, which can take up to seven years of growth before it occurs.

== History ==
The oldest systematic record of the plants was in 1692, when Van Rheede tot Drakenstein published descriptions of two plants. The name &quot;Amorphophallus&quot; was first mentioned in 1834 by the Dutch botanist Blume.
Between 1876 and 1911, Engler merged a number of other genera into &quot;Amorphophallus&quot;, with a final monograph published in 1911.

== Distribution ==
These are typical lowland plants, growing in the tropical and subtropical zones of the paleotropics, from West Africa through the Pacific Islands. None of them are found in the Americas, although a remarkably similar but not closely related genus, &quot;Dracontium&quot;, has evolved there. Most species are endemic. They grow preferentially on disturbed grounds, such as secondary forests.

== Description ==

These small to massive plants grow from a tuber. &quot;Amorphophallus&quot; tubers vary greatly from species to species, from the quite uniformly globose tuber of &quot;A. konjac&quot; to the elongated tubers of &quot;A. longituberosus&quot; and &quot;A. macrorhizus&quot; to the bizarre clustered rootstock of &quot;A. coaetaneus&quot;. It can grow up to 6 feet in height and the weight of these tubers range from as little as ten grams (3/10ths of an ounce) in &quot;Amorphophallus pusillus&quot; of Vietnam to as much as 305 pounds (139 kg) for &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;, a 14,000 fold difference in weight. From the top of this tuber a single leaf, which can be several meters across in larger species, is produced atop a trunk-like petiole followed, on maturity, by a single inflorescence. This leaf consists of a vertical leaf stalk and a horizontal blade, which may consist of a number of small leaflets. The leaf lasts one growing season. The peduncle (the primary flower stalk) can be long or short.

As is typical of the Arum family, these species develop an inflorescence consisting of an elongate or ovate spathe (a sheathing bract) which usually envelops the spadix (a flower spike with a fleshy axis). The spathe can have different colors, but mostly brownish-purple or whitish-green. On the inside, they contain ridges or warts, functioning as insect traps.

The plants are monoecious. The spadix has tiny flowers: female flowers, no more than a pistil, at the bottom, then male flowers, each with one stamen, and then a blank sterile area. This last part, called &#x27;the appendix&#x27;, consists of sterile flowers, called staminodes, and can be especially large. The flowers do not have corollas.

Mature female flowers are usually receptive for only one day. In many species, the inflorescence emits a scent of decaying flesh in order to attract insects, though a number of species give off a pleasant odor. Through a number of ingenious insect traps, pollinating insects that entered a spathe when female flowers were receptive remain inside the spathe for about one day while male flowers mature and release pollen. Pollen falls on these insects, and they carry pollen as they exit the spathe and can pollinate female flowers in another spathe. &quot;Amorphophallus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including &quot;Palpifer sexnotatus&quot; and &quot;Palpifer sordida&quot;.

Pollinated flowers usually each develop into a globose berry, a fruit. The berries are red, orange-red, white, white and yellow, or blue, depending on the species.

=== Notable species ===
The species &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;, &#x27;corpse flower&#x27; or titan arum, has the world&#x27;s largest unbranched inflorescence, with a height of up to and a width of . After an over -tall flower opened at Chicago Botanic Gardens on September 29, 2015, thousands lined up to see and smell it. The floriculturalist described it as smelling &quot;like roadkill, a barnyard, a dirty diaper, very strong, a little bit of mothball smell too&quot;. Native to the Indonesian rainforest, it takes about 10 years to blossom. Dubbed &quot;Alice&quot;, its bloom was broadcast via live webcam. It is one of two plants at the Chicago Botanic Gardens, which kept open until 2 am on September 30 to accommodate visitors.

A runner-up is &quot;Amorphophallus gigas&quot;, which is taller, but has a somewhat smaller inflorescence.

&quot;Amorphophallus konjac&quot; tubers are used to make , a Japanese thickening agent and edible jelly containing glucomannan.

Some species are called voodoo-lily, as are some species of &quot;Typhonium&quot; (also in the Araceae).

<text>Year 164 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Torquatus and Longinus (or, less frequently, year 590 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 164 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Egypt ====
* The Egyptian King Ptolemy VI Philometor is expelled from Alexandria by his brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes and flees to Rome to seek support.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes died while on a campaign in Tabae (or Gabae, now Isfahan) in Persia. He is succeeded by his son Antiochus V Eupator who is only nine years old. The regent for the boy is the late king&#x27;s chancellor, Lysias, who was left in charge of Syria when Antiochus IV departed for his campaign in Persia. Lysias is, however, seriously challenged by other Syrian generals and finds himself with a precarious hold on power. To make matters worse for him, the Roman Senate is holding Demetrius, the son of the former king Seleucus IV and, therefore, the rightful heir to the Seleucid throne, as a hostage. By threatening to release him, the Senate can influence events in the Seleucid kingdom.
* The Battle of Beth Zur was fought between Jewish rebel forces led by Judas Maccabeus and a Seleucid army led by the regent Lysias. Judas Maccabeus wins the battle and is able to recapture Jerusalem soon after. Judas purifies the defiled Temple in Jerusalem, destroys the idols erected there by Antiochus IV and restores the service in the Temple. The reconsecration of the Temple becomes an annual feast of dedication in the Jewish calendar, Hanukkah.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Rhodes signs a treaty with Rome and becomes its ally.
* Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus is elected censor in Rome.

=== By topic ===

==== Art ====
* Construction of the detail of the frieze from the east front of the altar in Pergamon, &quot;Athena Attacking the Giants&quot;, begins and is finished eight years later. It is now kept at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Antikensammlung, Pergamonmuseum in Berlin, Germany.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Astronomy ====
* Halley&#x27;s Comet makes its regular appearance in the sky, as recorded by a Babylonian scribe. It last appeared in 240 BC.

== Births ==
* Cleopatra Thea Euergetis (&quot;Benefactress&quot;), ruler of the Seleucid kingdom from 125 BC, a daughter of Ptolemy VI of Egypt and his sister/wife Cleopatra II (d. 121 BC) (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Antiochus IV Epiphanes (&quot;God Manifest&quot;), Seleucid king of the Syrian kingdom who has reigned since 175 BC, and has encouraged Greek culture and institutions but also attempted to suppress Judaism, which has led to the uprisings in Judea towards the end of his reign (b. c. 215 BC)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* King Antiochus IV Epiphanes, believing Judea to be in revolt, returns there after the failure of his Egyptian campaign.
* The Jewish priest Mattathias of Modi&#x27;in defies the king Antiochus IV&#x27;s decrees aimed at hellenizing the Jews and specifically defies the order that Jews should sacrifice to Zeus. Mattathias slays a Syrian official and escapes into the Judean hills with his five sons, beginning the Maccabean Revolt, a Jewish rebellion against Seleucid control of Judea.

==== Greece ====
* Private documents collected by the Romans when they capture Perseus of Macedon incriminate political leaders of the Achaean League. Many influential Greeks are deported to Rome.
* On his way back to Rome, the Roman general Lucius Aemilius Paulus is ordered by the Roman Senate to inflict a brutal revenge on Epirus for being an ally of Macedonia. Seventy towns in Epirus are destroyed, and at least 100,000 citizens are sold into slavery. These actions take place despite the fact that Epirus has not aided Perseus in his war with Rome.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Lucius Aemilius Paulus returns to Italy with the King of Macedonia, Perseus, as his prisoner for his triumphal procession in Rome, where the Macedonians captured are sold into slavery. The huge amount of booty brought home after the battle enriches Rome allowing the Government to relieve her citizens of direct taxation. As a gesture of acknowledgment for his achievements in Macedonia, the senate awards Lucius Aemilius Paulus the surname Macedonicus.

==== Parthia ====
* The Parthians capture the key central Asian city of Herat. This victory effectively chokes off the movement of trade along the Silk Road to China and means that the Hellenic kingdom of Bactria is doomed.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Gaius Claudius Pulcher, Roman consul in 177 BC

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Albania ====
* The king of Illyria, Gentius, is defeated at Scodra by a Roman force under Lucius Anicius Gallus and then brought to Rome as a captive to be interned in Iguvium. This loss removes Illyria as an important ally for Macedonia and effectively weakens Perseus of Macedon in his battle with Rome.
* The Roman general, Lucius Aemilius Paulus, is elected consul and arrives in Thessaly to lead the Roman army which has been trapped by Perseus&#x27; forces.
* June 22 – The Battle of Pydna (in southern Macedonia) gives Roman forces under Lucius Aemilius Paulus a crushing victory over Perseus and his Macedonian forces, thus ending the Third Macedonian War. Perseus is captured by the Romans and will spend the rest of his life in captivity at Alba Fucens, near Rome.
* The Macedonian kingdom is broken up by the Romans into four smaller states, and all the Greek cities which have offered aid to Macedonia, even just in words, are punished. The Romans take hundreds of prisoners from the leading families of Macedonia, including the historian Polybius.

==== Egypt ====
* The joint rulers of Egypt, Ptolemy VI, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II and their sister Cleopatra II send a renewed request to Rome for aid.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The fleet of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV wins a victory off Cyprus, whose governor then surrenders the island to him.
* Antiochus IV then invades Egypt again and occupies Lower Egypt and his forces camp outside Alexandria. However, the Roman ambassador in Alexandria, Gaius Popillius Laenas, intervenes. He presents Antiochus IV with an ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately. Antiochus, taken by surprise, asks for time to consider. Popillius, however, draws a circle in the earth (i.e. &quot;a line in the sand&quot;) around the king with his walking stick and demands an unequivocal answer before Antiochus leaves the circle. Fearing the consequences of a war with Rome, the king agrees to comply with the ambassador&#x27;s demands. In return, the Romans agree that Antiochus IV can retain southern Syria, to which Egypt has laid claim, thus enabling Antiochus IV to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.
* Jason removes Menelaus as High Priest in Jerusalem, which Antiochus IV regards as an affront to his majesty.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Tiberius Gracchus, Roman politician who would create turmoil in the Republic through his attempts to legislate agrarian reforms in the Roman Republic (d. 133 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Caecilius Statius, Roman comic poet, admirer and imitator of the Greek playwright Menander (b. c. 219 BC)
* Jia Yi, Chinese statesman and poet (b. 200 BC)
* Xin Zhui, wife of Li Cang (利蒼), the Marquis of Dai and Chancellor of Changsha Kingdom, during the Western Han dynasty of ancient China. (b. c. 217 BC)

<text>Year 169 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Philippus and Caepio (or, less frequently, year 585 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 169 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==Events==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

===By place===
====Greece====
* Macedonian forces led by Perseus of Macedon trap a Roman army led by Consul Quintus Marcius Phillipus near Tempe, but the Macedonians fail to take advantage of their resulting superior tactical position.
* King Perseus asks the Seleucid King Antiochus IV to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presents to all of the Hellenic monarchs. Antiochus IV does not respond.

====Roman Republic====
* &quot;Lex Voconia&quot; (The Voconian Law) is introduced in Rome by the tribune, Quintus Voconius Saxa, with the support of Cato the Elder. This law prohibits those who own property valued at 100,000 sesterces from making a woman their heir.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Liu Fei, Chinese prince of the Han dynasty. He is also the son of Emperor Jing and a half-brother of Emperor Wu (d. 128 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Quintus Ennius, Roman epic poet, dramatist, and satirist, the most influential of the early Latin poets – and often called the founder of Roman literature or the father of Roman poetry. His epic &quot;Annales&quot;, a poem telling the story of Rome from the wanderings of Aeneas to Ennius&#x27; own time, remains the national epic until it is later eclipsed by Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

<text>Year 170 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mancinus and Serranus (or, less frequently, year 584 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 170 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* In Thessaly, King Perseus of Macedon repulses a Roman army which is commanded by Aulus Hostilius Mancinus. Meanwhile, the Thracian city of Abdera is sacked by Roman and Pergamese troops.

==== Egypt ====
* With the guardians of the young king Ptolemy VI Philometor demanding the return of Coele-Syria to Egyptian control, the Seleucid king, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, decides on a preemptive strike against Egypt and invades the country, conquering all but the city of Alexandria. He is also able to capture Ptolemy VI.
* Antiochus IV decides to let Ptolemy VI continue as king of Egypt, but as his puppet. He does this to minimise any reaction from Rome towards his invasion. Antiochus IV then departs Egypt to deal with disturbances in Palestine, but he safeguards his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.
* With Antiochus IV now absent from the country, the citizens of Alexandria choose Ptolemy VI&#x27;s brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II as their king. The two Ptolemy brothers agree to rule Egypt jointly with their sister Cleopatra II and Coele Syria is invaded by the Egyptian forces.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* The usurped high priest of Judea, Jason, does not abandon his claims to being the high priest which he has lost to Menelaus two years earlier. While Antiochus IV is waging war against Egypt, he succeeds in making himself master of Jerusalem once more and forces Menelaus to seek refuge in the citadel.

==== Bactria ====
* Around this time, Eucratides, who is either a rebellious Bactrian official or a cousin of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, captures the throne of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom by toppling the Euthydemid dynasty&#x27;s king Antimachus I.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Dionysios Thrax, a Hellenic grammarian who will live and work in Alexandria and later on Rhodes (d. 90 BC)
* Lucius Accius (or Lucius Attius), Roman tragic poet and literary scholar (d. c. 86 BC)
* Apollonia Senmothis, Greek-Egyptian businesswoman.

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Epirus joins Macedonia in the latter&#x27;s fight against Rome. However, the leagues of southern Greece remain neutral.
* Thanks to the efforts of Eumenes II of Pergamum while in Rome, the Romans declare war on Macedonia and send troops to Thessaly, thus beginning the Third Macedonian War.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Eumenes II of Pergamum travels to Rome to warn the Roman Senate of the danger from Perseus of Macedon. On his return from Rome, Eumenes II is nearly killed at Delphi and Perseus is suspected of being the instigator.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Since the reign of the Seleucid king, Antiochus III, the Jewish inhabitants of Judea enjoy extensive autonomy under their high priest. However, they are divided into two parties, the orthodox Hasideans (Pious Ones) and a reform party that favours Hellenism. Antiochus IV supports the reform party because of the financial support they provide him with. In return for a considerable payment, he has permitted the high priest, Jason, to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem and to introduce the Greek mode of educating young people. Jason&#x27;s time as high priest is brought to an abrupt end when he sends Menelaus, the brother of Simon the Benjamite, to deliver money to Antiochus IV. Menelaus takes this opportunity to &quot;outbid&quot; Jason for the priesthood, resulting in Antiochus IV confirming Menelaus as the High Priest.

==== Carthage ====
* The peace treaty at the end of the Second Punic War requires that all border disputes involving Carthage be arbitrated by the Roman Senate and requires Carthage to get explicit Roman approval before going to war. As a result, envoys from Carthage appear before the Roman Senate to request resolution of a boundary dispute with Numidia. The dispute is decided in Numidia&#x27;s favour.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>Year 180 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Luscus and Piso/Flaccus (or, less frequently, year 574 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 180 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* After three years of intriguing against his younger brother Demetrius, including accusing him of coveting the succession to the Macedonian throne and being allied to Rome, Perseus persuades his father King Philip V of Macedon to have Demetrius executed.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Rome completes its subjugation of all of Italy with the defeat of the Ligurians in a battle near modern Genoa. Rome deports 40,000 Ligurians to other areas of the Republic.
* Lucca becomes a Roman colony.

==== Egypt ====
* Ptolemy VI Philometor, aged 6, rules as co-regent with his mother, Cleopatra I, who, although a daughter of a Seleucid king, does not take King Seleucus IV&#x27;s side and remains on friendly terms with Rome.
* Following the death of Aristophanes of Byzantium, Aristarchus of Samothrace becomes librarian at Alexandria.

==== Bactria ====
* Demetrius I starts his invasion of present-day Pakistan, following the earlier destruction of the Mauryan dynasty by general Pushyamitra Shunga.
* Apollodotus I, a general with Demetrius I of Bactria, becomes king of the western and southern parts of the Indo-Greek kingdom, from Taxila in Punjab to the areas of Sindh and possibly Gujarat. He maintains his allegiance to Demetrius I.

==== China ====
* September 26 – Lü Clan Disturbance. Following the death of Empress Lü, who had been the de facto ruler of the Han dynasty, the Lü Clan is overthrown and massacred by the imperial princes Liu Zhang and Liu Xiang, General-in-Chief Zhou Bo and Prime Minister Chen Ping. 
* Fearing reprisals should the young Emperor Houshao and his brothers reach adulthood, the conspirators deny that Emperor Hui was the father of Houshao and his brothers. They overthrow the emperor, and despite the imperial pedigree of Liu Xiang as the son of the eldest son of Gaozu of Han, they eventually agree to elevate Gaozu&#x27;s oldest surviving son, Emperor Wen, to the throne. After being evicted from the palace, Houshao is executed later in the year.
* Emperor Wen honours the relatives and ancestors of Zhao Tuo, the Chinese-born ruler of Nanyue (in present-day Vietnam and southern China). As a result, Nanyue returns to the Han dynasty as a vassal, although Zhao Tuo continues to call himself an emperor within his own kingdom. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Egypt ====
* Ptolemy V is poisoned after a reign of 24 years in which the Egyptian kingdom has declined in power and influence and has lost most of its empire outside Egypt other than Cyprus and Cyrenaica. The elder of his two sons, Ptolemy VI Philometor succeeds him, but since he is an infant, he rules under the regency of his mother Cleopatra the Syrian.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Rome founds a colony at Aquileia, on the narrow strip of land between the mountains and the lagoons, as a frontier fortress to check the advance of the Illyrians.

==== Asia Minor ====
* Pharnaces I of Pontus decides to attack both Eumenes II of Pergamum and Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia and therefore invades Galatia with a large force. Eumenes leads an army to oppose him, however, hostilities are soon suspended following the arrival of Roman deputies, who have been appointed by the Roman Senate to inquire into the matters in dispute. Negotiations take place at Pergamum but are inconclusive, with Pharnaces&#x27; demands being rejected by the Romans as unreasonable. As a consequence, the war between Pontus and Pergamum and Cappadocia is renewed.

==== China ====
* Empress Lü of the Han dynasty sends an army under Zhou Zao to attack the formerly vassal state of Nanyue in present-day Vietnam and southern China, but the heat and dampness causes many of Zhou&#x27;s men to fall ill, and he fails to make it across the mountains into enemy territory. 
* Nanyue&#x27;s emperor Zhao Tuo attacks the other vassal kingdoms of Minyue, Western Ou and Luo and secures their submission. He also attacks the state of Changsha.

<text>Year 182 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tamphilus and Paullus (or, less frequently, year 572 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 182 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>PC Card is a parallel peripheral interface for laptop computers and PDAs. The PCMCIA originally introduced the 16-bit ISA-based PCMCIA Card in 1990, but renamed it to PC Card in March 1995 to avoid confusion with the name of the organization. The CardBus PC Card was introduced as a 32-bit version of the original PC Card, based on the PCI specification. CardBus slots are backwards compatible, but older slots are not forward compatible with CardBus cards.

Although originally designed as a standard for memory-expansion cards for computer storage, the existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to the development of many kinds of devices including network cards, modems, and hard disks.

The PC Card port has been superseded by the ExpressCard interface since 2003, which was also initially developed by the PCMCIA. The organization dissolved in 2009, with its assets merged into the USB Implementers Forum.

== Applications ==

Many notebooks in the 1990s had two adjacent type-II slots, which allowed installation of two type-II cards or one, double-thickness, type-III card. The cards were also used in early digital SLR cameras, such as the Kodak DCS 300 series. However, their original use as storage expansion is no longer common.

Some manufacturers such as Dell continued to offer them into 2012 on their ruggedized XFR notebooks.

Mercedes-Benz used a PCMCIA card reader in the W221 S-Class for model years 2006-2009. It was used for reading media files such as MP3 audio files to play through the COMAND infotainment system. After 2009, it was replaced with a standard SD Card reader.

, some vehicles from Honda equipped with a navigation system still included a PC Card reader integrated into the audio system.

Some Japanese brand consumer entertainment devices such as TV sets include a PC Card slot for playback of media.

Adapters for PC Cards to Personal Computer ISA slots were available when these technologies were current. Cardbus adapters for PCI slots have been made. These adapters were sometimes used to fit Wireless (802.11) PCMCIA cards into desktop computers with PCI slots.

The Taito G-NET arcade hardware, based on the original PlayStation, uses PC Card as a software distribution method to allow games to be replaced without total replacement of the arcade board. PlayStation 2 models 10000, 15000 and 18000 shipped with a PC Card slot instead of the Expansion Bay. These models therefore require an external hard disk drive (SCPH-20400) that connects through the PC Card port, instead of an internal IDE port of the Expansion Bay.

== History ==

Before the introduction of the PCMCIA card, the parallel port was commonly used for portable peripherals.

The PCMCIA 1.0 card standard was published by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association in November 1990 and was soon adopted by more than eighty vendors.
 It corresponds with the Japanese JEIDA memory card 4.0 standard. It was originally developed to support Memory cards.

Intel authored the Exchangable Card Architecture (ExCA) specification, but later merged this into the PCMCIA.

SanDisk (operating at the time as &quot;SunDisk&quot;) launched its PCMCIA card in October 1992. The company was the first to introduce a writeable Flash RAM card for the HP 95LX (an early MS-DOS pocket computer). These cards conformed to a supplemental PCMCIA-ATA standard that allowed them to appear as more conventional IDE hard drives to the 95LX or a PC. This had the advantage of raising the upper limit on capacity to the full 32 MB available under DOS 3.22 on the 95LX.

New Media Corporation was one of the first companies established for the express purpose of manufacturing PC Cards; they became a major OEM for laptop manufacturers such as Toshiba and Compaq for PC Card products. 

It soon became clear that the PCMCIA card standard needed expansion to support &quot;smart&quot; I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy disk cards. It also needed interrupt facilities and hot plugging, which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces. This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and JEIDA 4.1 in September 1991, which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.

To recognize increased scope beyond memory, and to aid in marketing, the association acquired the rights to the simpler term &quot;PC Card&quot; from IBM. This was the name of the standard from version 2 of the specification onwards. These cards were used for wireless networks, modems, and other functions in notebook PCs.

After the release of PCIe-based ExpressCard in 2003, laptop manufacturers started to fit ExpressCard slots to new laptops instead of PC Card slots.

== Form factors ==

All PC Card devices use a similar sized package which is long and wide, the same size as a credit card.

; Type I: Cards designed to the original specification (PCMCIA 1.0) are type I and have a 16-bit interface. They are thick and have a dual row of 34 holes (68 in total) along a short edge as a connecting interface. Type-I PC Card devices are typically used for memory devices such as RAM, flash memory, OTP (One-Time Programmable), and SRAM cards.
; Type II: introduced with version 2.0 of the standard. Type-II and above PC Card devices use two rows of 34 sockets, and have a 16- or 32-bit interface. They are thick. Type-II cards introduced I/O support, allowing devices to attach an array of peripherals or to provide connectors/slots to interfaces for which the host computer had no built-in support. For example, many modem, network, and TV cards accept this configuration. Due to their thinness, most Type II interface cards have miniature interface connectors on the card connecting to a dongle, a short cable that adapts from the card&#x27;s miniature connector to an external full-size connector. Some cards instead have a lump on the end with the connectors. This is more robust and convenient than a separate adapter but can block the other slot where slots are present in a pair. Some Type II cards, most notably network interface and modem cards, have a retractable jack, which can be pushed into the card and will pop out when needed, allowing insertion of a cable from above. When use of the card is no longer needed, the jack can be pushed back into the card and locked in place, protecting it from damage. Most network cards have their jack on one side, while most modems have their jack on the other side, allowing the use of both at the same time as they do not interfere with each other. Wireless Type II cards often had a plastic shroud that jutted out from the end of the card to house the antenna. In the mid-90s, PC Card Type II hard disk drive cards became available; previously, PC Card hard disk drives were only available in Type III.
; Type III: introduced with version 2.01 of the standard in 1992. Type-III PC Card devices are 16-bit or 32-bit. These cards are thick, allowing them to accommodate devices with components that would not fit type I or type II height. Examples are hard disk drive cards, and interface cards with full-size connectors that do not require dongles (as is commonly required with type II interface cards).
; Type IV: Type-IV cards, introduced by Toshiba, were not officially standardized or sanctioned by the PCMCIA. These cards are thick.

== Bus ==
=== Original ===

The original standard was defined for both 5 V and 3.3 volt cards, with 3.3 V cards having a key on the side to prevent them from being inserted fully into a 5 V-only slot. Some cards and some slots operate at both voltages as needed. The original standard was built around an &#x27;enhanced&#x27; 16-bit ISA bus platform. A newer version of the PCMCIA standard is CardBus (see below), a 32-bit version of the original standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus of 32 bits (instead of the original 16), CardBus also supports bus mastering and operation speeds up to 33 MHz.

=== CardBus ===

CardBus are PCMCIA 5.0 or later (JEIDA 4.2 or later) 32-bit PCMCIA devices, introduced in 1995 and present in laptops from late 1997 onward. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus in the PC Card design. CardBus supports bus mastering, which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU. Many chipsets, such as those that support Wi-Fi, are available for both PCI and CardBus.

The notch on the left hand front of the device is slightly shallower on a CardBus device so, by design, a 32-bit device cannot be plugged into earlier equipment supporting only 16-bit devices. Most new slots accept both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices. CardBus cards can be distinguished from older cards by the presence of a gold band with eight small studs on the top of the card next to the pin sockets.

The speed of CardBus interfaces in 32-bit burst mode depends on the transfer type: in byte mode, transfer is 33 MB/s; in word mode it is 66 MB/s; and in dword (double-word) mode 132 MB/s.

=== CardBay ===

CardBay is a variant added to the PCMCIA specification introduced in 2001. It was intended to add some forward compatibility with USB and IEEE 1394, but was not universally adopted and only some notebooks have PC Card controllers with CardBay features. This is an implementation of Microsoft and Intel&#x27;s joint Drive Bay initiative.

== Design ==

The &quot;card information structure&quot; (CIS) is metadata stored on a PC card that contains information about the formatting and organization of the data on the card. The CIS also contains information such as:

* Type of card
* Supported power supply options
* Supported power saving capabilities
* Manufacturer
* Model number

When a card is unrecognized it is frequently because the CIS information is either lost or damaged.

== Descendants and variants ==

=== ExpressCard ===

ExpressCard is a later specification from the PCMCIA, intended as a replacement for PC Card, built around the PCI Express and USB 2.0 standards. The PC Card standard is closed to further development and PCMCIA strongly encourages future product designs to utilize the ExpressCard interface. From about 2006, ExpressCard slots replaced PCMCIA slots in laptop computers, with a few laptops having both in the transition period.

ExpressCard and CardBus sockets are physically and electrically incompatible. ExpressCard-to-CardBus and Cardbus-to-ExpressCard adapters are available that connect a Cardbus card to an Expresscard slot, or vice versa, and carry out the required electrical interfacing. These adapters do not handle older non-Cardbus PCMCIA cards.

PC Card devices can be plugged into an ExpressCard adaptor, which provides a PCI-to-PCIe Bridge.

Despite being much faster in speed/bandwidth, ExpressCard was not as popular as PC Card, due in part to the ubiquity of USB ports on modern computers. Most functionality provided by PC Card or ExpressCard devices is now available as an external USB device. These USB devices have the advantage of being compatible with desktop computers as well as portable devices. (Desktop computers were rarely fitted with a PC Card or ExpressCard slot.) This reduced the requirement for internal expansion slots; by 2011, many laptops had none.

Some IBM ThinkPad laptops took their onboard RAM (in sizes ranging from 4 to 16 MB) in the factor of an IC-DRAM Card. While very similar in form-factor, these cards did not go into a standard PC Card Slot, often being installed under the keyboard, for example. They also were not pin-compatible, as they had 88 pins but in two staggered rows, as opposed to even rows like PC Cards. These correspond to versions 1 and 2 of the JEIDA memory card standard.

=== Others ===

The shape is also used by the Common Interface form of conditional-access modules for DVB, and by Panasonic for their professional &quot;P2&quot; video acquisition memory cards.

A CableCARD conditional-access module is a type II PC Card intended to be plugged into a cable set-top box or digital cable-ready television.

The interface has spawned a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of Type I cards: CompactFlash, MiniCard, P2 Card and SmartMedia. For example, the PC Card electrical specification is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter can be a passive physical adapter rather than requiring additional circuitry. CompactFlash is a smaller dimensioned 50 pin subset of the 68 pin PC Card interface. It requires a setting for the interface mode of either &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;ATA storage&quot;.

The EOMA68 open-source hardware standard uses the same 68-pin PC Card connectors and corresponds to the PC Card form factor in many other ways.

<text>Year 183 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Marcellus and Labeo (or, less frequently, year 571 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 183 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Roman colonies are established at Mutina (later Modena), Pisa and Parma in northern and central Italy.
* The Roman general Scipio Africanus dies at Liternum in Campania.
* The Roman statesman Titus Quinctius Flamininus is sent to the court of Prusias I, king of Bithynia, to demand the surrender of the former Carthaginian statesman and general Hannibal. When Hannibal finds out that Prusias is about to agree to the Roman demands and thus betray him, he poisons himself in the village of Libyssa in Bithynia.

==== Greece ====
* The town of Messene rebels against the Achaean League. When the Achaean League&#x27;s general, Philopoemen, intervenes to try to control the rebellion, he is captured during a skirmish and imprisoned. He is then given poison to take so that he can die honourably.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, consul in 138 BC, who will have a prominent part in the murder of Tiberius Gracchus by leading a group of conservative senators and other knights in opposition to Gracchus and his supporters (d. 132 BC).

== Deaths ==
* Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major, Roman statesman and general, famous for his victory over the Carthaginian leader Hannibal in the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, which ended the Second Punic War and gave him the surname Africanus (b. 236 BC)
* Philopoemen, Greek general and statesman, strategos of the Achaean League on eight occasions and a major figure in the demise of Sparta as a Greek power (b. 253 BC)
* Hannibal, Carthaginian statesman, military commander and tactician, one of history&#x27;s great military leaders, who has commanded the Carthaginian forces against Rome in the Second Punic War (b. 247 BC)

<doc id="61695" wikidata="Q1930493" url="?curid=61695" title="Whipping knot">
<text>A whipping knot or whipping is a binding of twine or whipcord around the end of a rope to prevent its natural tendency to fray. 

Some whippings are finished cleanly, as by drawing the bitter end of the cordage beneath the whipping itself. Others are tied off or have the end(s) of the twine sewn through the rope. According to &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;, &quot;The purpose of a &quot;whipping&quot; is to prevent the end of a rope from fraying ... A whipping should be, in width, about equal to the diameter of the rope on which it is put ... [Two sailmaker&#x27;s whippings], a short distance apart, are put in the ends of every reef point, where the constant &#x27;whipping&#x27; against the sail makes the wear excessive; this is said to be the source of the name &quot;whipping&quot;.&quot; The other type of stopping knot is a seizing knot.

Whipping is suitable for synthetic and natural stranded and braided lines, including 3-strand rope, 4-strand cable and 8-strand multiplait, as well as concentric and braided constructions.

==Tying==

Multiple turns of twine (sometimes called small stuff for smaller lines) or heavier whipcord (for large diameter cables and ropes) are tightly wrapped around a rope&#x27;s cut end to prevent its fibers from unlaying.

Usually one end of the whipping cord is looped along the rope to be whipped, and the remaining cord wound tightly over the loop. Finally the loose end of the wound whipping is passed through the loop so that both ends may be drawn securely inside the winding. 
Whippings may also be applied by hand or using a palm and needle, and either simply tied off or made neat and permanent by reeving the twine&#x27;s cut ends into or behind the whipping, sewing them to adjacent strands, or through the rope itself.

In applications where a lot of flexing is expected, the whipping may be impregnated with dilute spar varnish or superglue.

==Types==

===French whipping===

French whipping is a whipping knot that consists of a series of half hitches. It is used to stop unraveling of rope ends as well as to provide a grip over railings.
===Portuguese whipping===

The Portuguese whipping is a type of whipping knot. To make it you take the small diameter string and lay one end against the rope. Wrap backwards up the rope until you have both ends side by side, finish by tying a reef knot. This is the quickest of the seizings, but is not as secure as some.

==Alternatives==

===Constrictor knot===
A constrictor knot can be used temporarily to hold the fibres of a cut line until a final whipping can be applied.

===Tape===
Several turns of self-adhesive plastic tape may form a temporary or emergency substitute for whipping.

===Fusion===

The ends of some man-made fibers such as Dacron, Nylon, polyethylene, polyester, and polypropylene (but not aramid fibers) may be melted to fuse their fibers to prevent fraying. However, the rope and knotting expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against this practice for boat operators thus:
&quot;Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous.&quot; A tugboat operator once sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and obviously &quot;sharp&quot;) end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping.
Among the methods of fusing are using an electrically heated rope cutter, heating the blade of a knife, or melting cut ends in a flame. The cool (transparent) part of a butane lighter flame works best.

It is helpful to wrap the end of a line to be fused with several turns of plastic tape first. The finished end will be neater and narrower if a cut is made through the tape.

===Back splice===
Back splicing uses a stranded rope&#x27;s own fibres to prevent fraying. A back splice adds extra thickness to the rope end, preventing it from running through blocks and sheaves. It can also be of benefit when a user needs to feel the end of the rope, as on a bucket lanyard.

===Liquid===
Liquid whipping is a semi-permanent rubbery coating applied by dipping the cut end of a line into a container of the product. When the coating sets it is flexible but solid enough to keep the rope together. Liquid whipping can be used on both natural and synthetic fibers.

===Aglet===

An aglet is a permanent ending applied mechanically to bind the end of the rope. A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable.

<text>The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is a long-fingered lemur, a strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar with rodent-like teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger that they can use to catch grubs and larvae out of tree trunks.

It is the world&#x27;s largest nocturnal primate. It is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called &quot;percussive foraging&quot;, and takes up 5–41% of foraging time. The only other living mammal species known to find food in this way are the striped possum and trioks (genus &quot;Dactylopsila&quot;) of northern Australia and New Guinea, which are marsupials. From an ecological point of view, the aye-aye fills the niche of a woodpecker, as it is capable of penetrating wood to extract the invertebrates within.

The aye-aye is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Daubentonia&quot; and family Daubentoniidae. It is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN. A second species, &quot;Daubentonia robusta&quot;, appears to have become extinct at some point within the last 1000 years, and is known from subfossil finds.

== Etymology ==
The genus &quot;Daubentonia&quot; was named after the French naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton by his student, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name &quot;Scolecophagus&quot; (&quot;worm-eater&quot;) in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye&#x27;s habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered. In 1863, British zoologist John Edward Gray coined the family name Daubentoniidae.

The French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat was the first to use the vernacular name &quot;aye-aye&quot; in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the &quot;long-fingered lemur&quot; by English zoologist George Shaw in 1800—a name that did not stick. According to Sonnerat, the name &quot;aye-aye&quot; was a &quot;&quot; (cry of exclamation and astonishment). However, American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall noted in 1982 that the name resembles the Malagasy name &quot;hai hai&quot; or &quot;hay hay&quot;, (also &quot;ahay&quot;, , &quot;haihay&quot;) which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel &quot;et al.&quot; (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from &quot;heh heh&quot;, which is Malagasy for &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying &quot;heh heh&quot; to avoid saying the name of a feared, magical animal.

== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==
Due to its derived morphological features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery. The possession of continually growing incisors (front teeth) parallels those of rodents, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order Rodentia and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.

The aye-aye&#x27;s classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain. It has been considered a highly derived member of the family Indridae, a basally diverging branch of the strepsirrhine suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates. In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs.

However, molecular results have consistently placed &quot;Daubentonia&quot; as the most basally diverging of lemurs. The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that rafted from Africa to Madagascar during the Paleogene. Similarities in dentition between aye-ayes and several African primate fossils (&quot;Plesiopithecus&quot; and &quot;Propotto&quot;) have led to the alternate theory that the ancestors of aye-ayes colonized Madagascar separately from other lemurs. In 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.

Further evidence indicating that the aye-aye belongs in the superfamily Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of petrosal bullae encasing the ossicles of the ear. The aye-ayes are also similar to lemurs in their shorter back legs.

== Anatomy and morphology ==


A full-grown aye-aye is typically about long with a tail longer than its body. The species has an average head and body length of plus a tail of , and weighs around .

Young aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.

Among the aye-aye&#x27;s signature traits are its fingers. The third finger, which is much thinner than the others, is used for extracting grubs and insects out of trees, using the hooked nail. The finger is unique in the animal kingdom in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint, can reach the throat through a nostril and is used for picking one&#x27;s nose and eating mucus (mucophagy) so harvested from inside the nose. The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a pseudothumb, to aid in gripping.

The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of aye-aye ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals from the tapping of its finger, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others.

Females have two nipples located in the region of the groin. The male&#x27;s genitalia are similar to those of canids, with a large prostate and long baculum.

== Behaviour and lifestyle ==
The aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent. The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.

Mating season extends throughout the year, with females typically starting to breed at the age of three or four. They give birth to one offspring every two to three years. During the period of parenting, a female becomes the dominant figure over males, likely to secure better access to food while caring for her young. The infant remains in a nest for up to two months before venturing out, but it takes another seven months before the young aye-aye can maneuver the canopy as skillfully as an adult.

=== Diet and foraging ===

The aye-aye is an omnivore and commonly eats seeds, nuts, fruits, nectar, plant exudates and fungi, but also xylophagous, or wood boring, insect larvae (especially cerambycid beetle larvae) and honey.
Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to a night.

Though foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups. Individual movements within the group are coordinated using both vocalisations and scent signals.

=== Social systems ===
The aye-aye is classically considered &#x27;solitary&#x27; as they have not been observed to groom each other. However, recent research suggests that it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male&#x27;s home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to , while females have smaller living spaces that go up to . It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this. Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.

Like many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging. The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses echolocation to find its prey.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is rainforest or dry deciduous forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built from interwoven twigs and dead leaves up in the canopy among the vines and branches.

== Conservation ==
The aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. In 1966, nine individuals were transported to Nosy Mangabe, an island near Maroantsetra off eastern Madagascar. Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to endangered in 2014. This is for four main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil by local cultures, and is killed as such. The forests of Madagascar are declining in range due to deforestation. Local farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops; aye-aye poaching is another major issue. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest aye-ayes pose any legitimate threat to crops and therefore are killed based on superstition.

As many as 50 aye-ayes can be found in zoological facilities worldwide.

=== Folk belief ===

The aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and death and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle fingers to puncture their victims&#x27; aorta.

=== Captive breeding ===
The conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet.

<text>Genera is a commercial operating system and integrated development environment for Lisp machines created by Symbolics. It is essentially a fork of an earlier operating system originating on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab&#x27;s Lisp machines which Symbolics had used in common with Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI), and Texas Instruments (TI). Genera was also sold by Symbolics as Open Genera, which runs Genera on computers based on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Alpha processor using Tru64 UNIX. In 2021 a new version was released as Portable Genera which runs on Tru64 UNIX on Alpha, Linux on x86-64 and Arm64 Linux, and macOS on x86-64 and Arm64 (Apple Silicon M Series). It is released and licensed as proprietary software.

Genera is an example of an object-oriented operating system based on the programming language Lisp.

Genera supports incremental and interactive development of complex software using a mix of programming styles with extensive support for object-oriented programming.

== MIT&#x27;s Lisp machine operating system ==
The Lisp Machine operating system was written in Lisp Machine Lisp. It was a one-user workstation initially targeted at software developers for artificial intelligence (AI) projects. The system had a large bitmap screen, a mouse, a keyboard, a network interface, a disk drive, and slots for expansion. The operating system was supporting this hardware and it provided (among others):

* code for a frontend processor
* means to boot the operating system
* virtual memory management
* garbage collection
* interface to various hardware: mouse, keyboard, bitmap frame buffer, disk, printer, network interface
* an interpreter and a native code compiler for Lisp Machine Lisp
* an object system: Flavors
* a graphical user interface (GUI) window system and window manager
* a local file system
* support for the Chaosnet (CHAOS) network
* an Emacs-like Editor named Zmacs
* a mail program named Zmail
* a Lisp listener
* a debugger

This was already a complete one-user Lisp-based operating system and development environment.

The MIT Lisp machine operating system was developed from the middle 1970s to the early 1980s.

In 2006, the source code for this Lisp machine operating system from MIT was released as free and open-source software.

== Genera operating system ==
Symbolics developed new Lisp machines and published the operating system under the name &quot;Genera&quot;. The latest version is 8.5. Symbolics Genera was developed in the early 1980s and early 1990s. In the final years, development entailed mostly patches, with very little new function.

Symbolics developed Genera based on this foundation of the MIT Lisp machine operating system. It sells the operating system and &quot;layered software&quot;. Some of the layered software has been integrated into Genera in later releases. Symbolics improved the operating system software from the original MIT Lisp machine and expanded it. The Genera operating system was only available for Symbolics Lisp machines and the Open Genera virtual machine.

Symbolics Genera has many features and supports all the versions of various hardware that Symbolics built over its life. Its source code is more than a million lines; the number depends on the release and what amount of software is installed. Symbolics Genera was published on magnetic tape and CD-ROM. The release of the operating system also provided most of the source code of the operating system and its applications. The user has free access to all parts of the running operating system and can write changes and extensions. The source code of the operating system is divided into &quot;systems&quot;. These systems bundle sources, binaries and other files. The &quot;system construction toolkit&quot; (SCT) maintains the dependencies, the components and the versions of all the systems. A system has two numbers: a major and a minor version number. The major version number counts the number of full constructions of a system. The minor version counts the number of patches to that system. A &quot;patch&quot; is a file that can be loaded to fix problems or provide extensions to a particular version of a system.

Symbolics developed a version named &quot;Open Genera&quot;, that included a virtual machine that enabled executing Genera on DEC Alpha based workstations, plus several Genera extensions and applications that were sold separately (like the Symbolics &quot;S-Graphics&quot; suite). Also, they made a new operating system named &quot;Minima&quot; for embedded uses, in Common Lisp. The latest version is &quot;Portable Genera&quot;, which has the virtual machine ported to x86-64, Arm64 and Apple M1 processors - additionally to the DEC Alpha processor. The virtual machine then runs under the Linux and macOS, additionally to Tru64 UNIX.

The original Lisp machine operating system was developed in Lisp Machine Lisp, using the &quot;Flavors&quot; object-oriented extension to that Lisp. Symbolics provided a successor to Flavors named &quot;New Flavors&quot;. Later Symbolics also supported Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). Then Symbolics Common Lisp became the default Lisp dialect for writing software with Genera. The software of the operating system was written mostly in Lisp Machine Lisp (named ZetaLisp) and Symbolics Common Lisp. These Lisp dialects are both provided by Genera. Also parts of the software was using either Flavors, New Flavors, and Common Lisp Object System. Some of the older parts of the Genera operating system have been rewritten in Symbolics Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Object system. Many parts of the operating systems remained written in ZetaLisp and Flavors (or New Flavors).

== User interface ==
The early versions of Symbolics Genera were built with the original graphical user interface (GUI) windowing system of the Lisp machine operating system. Symbolics then developed a radically new windowing system named &quot;Dynamic Windows&quot; with a &quot;presentation-based user interface&quot;. This window system was introduced with Genera 7 in 1986. Many of the applications of Genera have then been using Dynamic Windows for their user interface. Eventually there was a move to port parts of the window system to run on other Common Lisp implementations by other vendors as the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM). Versions of CLIM have been available (among others) for Allegro Common Lisp, LispWorks, and Macintosh Common Lisp. An open source version is available (McCLIM).

&quot;Dynamic Windows&quot; uses typed objects for all output to the screen. All displayed information keeps its connection to the objects displayed (&quot;output recording&quot;). This works for both textual and graphical output. At runtime the applicable operations to these objects are computed based on the class hierarchy and the available operations (&quot;commands&quot;). Commands are organized in hierarchical &quot;command tables&quot; with typed parameters. Commands can be entered with the mouse (making extensive use of mouse chording), keystrokes, and with a command line interface. All applications share one command line interpreter implementation, which adapts to various types of usage. The graphical abilities of the window system are based on the PostScript graphics model.

The user interface is mostly in monochrome (black-and-white) since that was what the hardware console typically provided. But extensive support exists for color, using color frame buffers or X Window System (X11) servers with color support. The &quot;activities&quot; (applications) use the whole screen with several panes, though windows can also be smaller. The layout of these activity windows adapts to different screen sizes. Activities can also switch between different pane layouts.

Genera provides a &quot;system menu&quot; to control windows, switch applications, and operate the window system. Many features of the user interface (switching between activities, creating activities, stopping and starting processes, and much more) can also be controlled with keyboard commands.

The &quot;Dynamic Lisp Listener&quot; is an example of a command line interface with full graphics abilities and support for mouse-based interaction. It accepts Lisp expressions and commands as input. The output is mouse sensitive. The Lisp listener can display forms to input data for the various built-in commands.

The user interface provides extensive online help and context sensitive help, completion of choices in various contexts.

== Documentation ==
Genera supports fully hyperlinked online documentation. The documentation is read with the Document Examiner, an early hypertext browser. The documentation is based on small reusable documentation records that can also be displayed in various contexts with the Editor and the Lisp Listener. The documentation is organized in books and sections. The books were also provided in printed versions with the same contents as the online documentation. The documentation database information is delivered with Genera and can be modified with incremental patches.

The documentation was created with a separate application that was not shipped with Genera: Symbolics &quot;Concordia&quot;. Concordia provides an extension to the &quot;Zmacs&quot; editor for editing documentation records, a graphics editor and a page previewer.

The documentation provides user guides, installation guidelines and references of the various Lisp constructs and libraries.

The markup language is based on the Scribe markup language and also usable by the developer.

Genera supports printing to postscript printers, provides a printing queue and also a PostScript interpreter (written in Lisp).

== Features ==
Genera also has support for various network protocols and applications using those. It has extensive support for TCP/IP.

Genera supports one-processor machines with several threads (called &quot;processes&quot;).

Genera supports several different types of garbage collection (GC): full GC, in-place GC, incremental GC, and ephemeral GC. The ephemeral collector uses only physical memory and uses the memory management unit to get information about changed pages in physical memory. The collector uses generations and the virtual memory is divided into areas. Areas can contain objects of certain types (strings, bitmaps, pathnames, ...), and each area can use different memory management mechanisms.

Genera implements two file systems: the FEP file system for large files and the &quot;Lisp Machine File System&quot; (LMFS) optimized for many small files. These systems also maintain different versions of files. If a file is modified, Genera still keeps the old versions. Genera also provides access to, can read from and write to, other, local and remote, file systems including: NFS, FTP, HFS, CD-ROMs, tape drives.

Genera supports netbooting.

Genera provides a client for the &quot;Statice&quot; object database from Symbolics.

Genera makes extensive use of the &quot;condition system&quot; (exception handling) to handle all kinds of runtime errors and is able to recover from many of these errors. For example, it allows retrying network operations if a network connection has a failure; the application code will keep running. When errors occur, users are presented a menu of restarts (abort, retry, continue options) that are specific to the error signalled.

Genera has extensive debugging tools.

Genera can save versions of the running system to &quot;worlds&quot;. These worlds can be booted and then will contain all the saved data and code.

== Programming languages ==
Symbolics provided several programming languages for use with Genera:

* ZetaLisp, the Symbolics version of Lisp Machine Lisp
* Common Lisp in several versions: Symbolics Common Lisp, Future Common Lisp (ANSI Common Lisp), CLtL1
* Symbolics Pascal, a version of Pascal written in Lisp (Lisp source is included in Genera distribution)
* Symbolics C, a version of C written in Lisp (Lisp source is included in Genera distribution)
* Symbolics Fortran, a version of Fortran written in Lisp (Lisp source is included in Genera distribution)

Symbolics Common Lisp provides most of the Common Lisp standard with very many extensions, many of them coming from ZetaLisp.

=== Other languages from Symbolics ===
* Symbolics Prolog, a version of Prolog written and integrated in Lisp
* Symbolics Ada, a version of Ada written in Lisp

It is remarkable that these programming language implementations inherited some of the dynamic features of the Lisp system (like garbage collection and checked access to data) and supported incremental software development.

Third-party developers provided more programming languages, such as OPS5, and development tools, such as the Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) from IntelliCorp).

== Applications ==
Symbolics Genera comes with several applications. Applications are called &quot;activities&quot;. Some of the activities:

* Zmacs, an Emacs-like text editor
* Zmail, a mail reader also providing a calendar
* File system browser with tools for file system maintenance
* Lisp Listener with command-line interface
* Document Examiner for browsing documentation
* Restore Distribution to install software.
* Distribute Systems, to create software distributions
* Peek to examine system information (processes, windows, network connections, ...)
* Debugger
* Namespace Editor to access information about objects in the network (users, computers, file systems, ...)
* Converse, a chat client
* Terminal
* Inspector, for browsing Lisp data structures
* Notifications
* Frame-Up, for designing user interfaces
* Flavor Examiner, to examine the classes and methods of the Flavor object-oriented extension to Lisp

=== Other applications from Symbolics ===
Symbolics sold several applications that run on Symbolics Genera.

* Symbolics Concordia, a document production suite
* Symbolics Joshua, an expert system shell
* Symbolics Macsyma, a computer algebra system
* Symbolics NS, a chip design tool
* Symbolics Plexi, a neural network development tool
* Symbolics S-Graphics, a suite of tools: S-Paint, S-Geometry, S-Dynamics, S-Render
* Symbolics S-Utilities: S-Record, S-Compositor, S-Colorize, S-Convert
* Symbolics Scope, digital image processing with a Pixar Image Computer
* Symbolics Statice, an object database

=== Third-party applications ===
Several companies developed and sold applications for Symbolics Genera. Some examples:

* Ascent Technology Gatekeeper, a rule-based resource manager for airports and airlines
* Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), an expert system shell from Inference Corporation
* ICAD, 3d parametric CAD system
* Illustrate, graphics editor
* Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE), an expert system shell, from IntelliCorp
* Knowledge Craft, an expert system shell, from Carnegie Group
* Metal, machine translation system from Siemens

== Highlights ==
* Genera is written fully in Lisp, using ZetaLisp and Symbolics Common Lisp, including all low-level system code, such as device drivers, garbage collection, process scheduler, network stacks, etc.
* The source code is more than a million lines of Lisp, yet relatively compact, compared to the provided functions, due to extensive reuse. It is also available for users to inspect and change.
* The operating system is mostly written in an object-oriented style using Flavors, New Flavors, and CLOS
* It has extensive online documentation readable with the Document Examiner
* Dynamic Windows provides a presentation-based user interface
* The user interface can be used locally (on Lisp Machines and MacIvories) and remotely (using X11)
* Groups of developers can work together in a networked environment
* A central namespace server provides a directory of machines, users, services, networks, file systems, databases, and more
* There is little protection against changing the operating system. The whole system is fully accessible and changeable.

== Limits ==
Genera&#x27;s limits include:
* Only runs on Symbolics Lisp Machines or the Open Genera emulator.
* Only one user can be logged in at once.
* Only one Lisp system can run at once. Data and code is shared by applications and the operating system. However, multiple instances of Open Genera can run on one DEC Alpha.
* Development effectively stopped in the middle 1990s.

<text>Sahelanthropus is an extinct genus of hominid dated to about during the Late Miocene. The type species, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, was first announced in 2002, based mainly on a partial cranium, nicknamed &quot;Toumaï&quot;, discovered in northern Chad.

The definitive phylogenetic position of &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; within hominids is uncertain. It was initially described as a possible hominin ancestral to both humans and chimpanzees, but subsequent interpretations suggest that it could be an early member of the tribe Gorillini or a stem-hominid outside the hominins. Examinations on the postcranial skeleton of &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; also indicated that this taxon was not a habitual biped.

==Taxonomy==
===Discovery===

Four employees of the Centre National d&#x27;Appui à la Recherche (CNAR, National Research Support Center) of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Republic of Chad, three Chadians (Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye,&lt;ref name=&quot;researchgate/2007191460&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fanoné Gongdibé and Mahamat Adoum) and one French (Alain Beauvilain&lt;ref name=&quot;researchgate/9991597&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) collected and identified the first remains in the Toros-Menalla area (TM 266 locality) in the Djurab Desert of northern Chad, July 19, 2001. By the time Michel Brunet and colleagues formally described the remains in 2002, a total of six specimens had been recovered: a nearly complete but heavily deformed skull, a fragment of the midline of the jaw with the tooth sockets for an incisor and canine, a right third molar, a right first incisor, a right jawbone with the last premolar to last molar, and a right canine. With the skull as the holotype specimen, they were grouped into a new genus and species as &quot;Sahelanthropus tchadensis&quot;, the genus name referring to the Sahel, and the species name to Chad. These, along with &quot;Australopithecus bahrelghazali&quot;, were the first discoveries of any fossil African great ape (outside the genus &quot;Homo&quot;) made beyond eastern and southern Africa. By 2005, a third premolar was recovered from the TM 266 locality, a lower jaw missing the region behind the second molar from the TM 292 locality, and a lower left jaw preserving the sockets for premolars and molars from the TM 247 locality.

The skull was nicknamed Toumaï by the then-president of the Republic of Chad, Idriss Déby, not only because it designates in the local Daza language meaning &quot;hope of life&quot;, given to infants born just before the dry season and who, therefore, have fairly limited chances of survival, but also to celebrate the memory of one of his comrades-in-arms, living in the north of the country where the fossil was discovered, and killed fighting to overthrow President Hissène Habré supported by France. Toumaï also became a source of national pride, and Brunet announced the discovery before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a television audience in the capital of N&#x27;Djamena, &quot;l&#x27;ancêtre de l&#x27;humanité est Tchadien...Le berceau de l&#x27;humanité se trouve au Tchad. Toumaï est votre ancêtre&quot; (&quot;The ancestor of humanity is Chadian...The cradle of humanity is in Chad. Toumaï is your ancestor.&quot;).

Toumaï had been found with a femur, but this was stored with animal bones and shipped to the University of Poitiers in 2003, where it was stumbled upon by graduate student Aude Bergeret the next year. She took the bone to the head of the Department of Geosciences, Roberto Macchiarelli, who considered it to be inconsistent with bipedalism contra what Brunet &quot;et al.&quot; had earlier stated in their description analysing only the distorted skull. This was conspicuous because Brunet and his team had already explicitly stated Toumaï was associated with no limb bones, which could have proven or disproven their conclusions of locomotion. Because Brunet had declined to comment on the subject, Macchiarelli and Bergeret petitioned to present their preliminary findings during an annual conference organised by the Anthropological Society of Paris, which would be held at Poitiers that year. This was rejected as they had not formally published their findings yet. They were able to publish a full description in 2020, and concluded &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; was not bipedal.

In 2022, French primatologist Franck Guy and colleagues reported that a hominin left femur (TM 266-01-063), and a right (TM 266-01-358) and a left (TM 266-01-050) ulna (forearm bone) were also discovered at the site in 2001, but were excluded originally from &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; because they could not be reliably associated with the skull. They decided to include it because &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; is the only hominin known from the site, and they concluded that the material is consistent with obligate bipedalism, the earliest evidence of such. In 2023, Meyer and colleagues suggested that its phylogenetic position and its status as a hominin still remain equivocal.

All &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; specimens, representing six to nine different adults, have been recovered within the area.

===Taphonomy===
Upon description, Brunet and colleagues were able to constrain the TM 266 locality to 7 or 6 million years ago (near the end of the Late Miocene) based on the animal assemblage, which made &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; the earliest African ape at the time. In 2008, Anne-Elisabeth Lebatard and colleagues (which includes Brunet) attempted to radiometrically date using the 10Be/9Be ratio the sediments Toumaï was found near (dubbed the &quot;anthracotheriid unit&quot; after the commonplace &quot;Libycosaurus petrochii&quot;). Averaging the ages of 28 samples, they reported an approximate date of 7.2–6.8 million years ago.

Their methods were soon challenged by Beauvilain, who clarified that Toumaï was found on loose sediments at the surface rather than being &quot;unearthed&quot;, and had probably been exposed to the harsh sun and wind for some time considering it was encrusted in an iron shell and desert varnish. This would mean it is unsafe to assume that the skull and nearby sediments were deposited at the same time, making such radiometric dating impossible. Further, the &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; fossils lack white silaceous cement which is present on every other fossil in the site, which would mean they date to different time periods. Because the large mammal fossils were scattered across the area instead of concentrated like the &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; fossils, the discoverers originally believed the &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; fossils were dumped there by a palaeontologist or geologist, but later dismissed this because the skull was too complete to have been thrown away like that. In 2009, Alain Beauvilain and argued that Toumaï was purposefully buried in a &quot;grave&quot;, because the skull was also found with two parallel rows of large mammal fossils, seemingly forming a box. Because the &quot;grave&quot; is orientated in a northeast–southwest direction towards Mecca, and all sides of the skull were exposed to the wind and were eroded (meaning the skull had somehow turned), they argued that Toumaï was first buried by nomads who identified the skull as human and collected nearby limb fossils (believing them to belong with the skull) and buried them, and was reburied again sometime after the 11th century by Muslims who reorientated the grave towards Mecca when the fossils were re-exposed.

===Classification===
When describing the species in 2002, Brunet &quot;et al.&quot; noted the combination of features that would be considered archaic or derived for a species on the human line (the subtribe Hominina), the latter being bipedal locomotion and reduced canine teeth, which they interpreted as evidence of its position near the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA). This classification made &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; the oldest Hominina, shifting the centre of origin for the clade away from East Africa. They also suggested that &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; could be a sister group to the 5.5-to-4.5-million-year-old &quot;Ardipithecus&quot; and later Hominina. The classification of &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; in Hominina, as well as &quot;Ardipithecus&quot; and the 6-million-year-old &quot;Orrorin&quot;, was at odds with molecular analyses of the time, which had placed the CHLCA between 6 and 4 million years ago based on a high mutation rate of about 70 mutations per generation. All these genera were anatomically too derived to represent a basal hominin (the group containing chimps and humans), so molecular data would only permit their classification into more ancient and now-extinct lineages. This was overturned in 2012 by geneticists Aylwyn Scally and Richard Durbin, who studied the genomes of children and their parents and found the mutation rate was actually half that, placing the CHLCA anywhere from 14 to 7 million years ago, though most geneticists and palaeoanthropologists use 8 to 7 million years ago. A recent phylogenetic analysis classified &quot;Orrorin&quot; as a hominin, but placed &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; as a stem-hominid outside hominins, though dental metric analysis supports its position as a hominin.

A further possibility is that Toumaï is not ancestral to either humans or chimpanzees at all, but rather an early representative of the Gorillini lineage. Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford, the discoverers of &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot;, suggested that the features of &quot;S. tchadensis&quot; are consistent with a female proto-gorilla. Even if this claim is upheld the find would lose none of its significance, because at present very few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa. Thus, if &quot;S. tchadensis&quot; is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees or gorillas, then it represents the earliest known member of &quot;their&quot; lineage. &quot;S. tchadensis&quot; does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to closely resemble extant chimpanzees, as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists. Additionally, with the significant sexual dimorphism known to have existed in early hominins, the difference between &quot;Ardipithecus&quot; and &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; may not be large enough to warrant a separate genus for the latter.

==Anatomy==
===Cranium===

Existing fossils include a relatively small cranium, five pieces of jaw, and some teeth, making up a head that has a mixture of derived and primitive features. A virtual reconstruction of the interior of the braincase indicated a cranial capacity of 378 cm3, similar to that of extant chimpanzees and approximately a third the size of modern human brains.

The teeth, brow ridges, and facial structure differ markedly from those found in modern humans. Cranial features show a flatter face, U-shaped tooth rows, small canines, an anterior foramen magnum, and heavy brow ridges. The only known skull suffered a large amount of distortion during the time of fossilisation and discovery, as the cranium is dorsoventrally flattened, and the right side is depressed.

===Locomotion===
In the original description in 2002, Brunet &quot;et al.&quot; said it &quot;would not be unreasonable&quot; to speculate that &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; was capable of maintaining an upright posture while walking bipedally. Because they had not reported any limb bones or other post-cranial material (anything other than the skull), this was based on the reconstructed original orientation of the foramen magnum (where the skull connects the spine), and their classification of &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; into Hominina based on facial comparisons (one of the diagnostic characteristics of Hominina is bipedalism). This was soon disputed because the orientation of the foramen magnum is not an entirely conclusive piece of evidence in regard to the question of habitual posture, and the features used to classify &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; into Hominina are not entirely unique to Hominina.

In 2020, the femur had been formally described, and the study concluded it was not consistent with habitual bipedalism. But, in 2022, Daver and colleagues suggested that the ulnar and femoral morphologies do show characteristics consistent with habitual bipedalism. In 2023, however, Meyer and colleagues examined its ulna shaft and argued that &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; is not an obligate biped based on the mathematical analysis of its locomotor behavior which indicated that its forelimbs had different functions compared to modern humans and hominins, and that it probably walked on its knuckles like modern gorillas and chimpanzees, so more examination is required to truly identify its locomotor behavior (i.e. whether it exhibited facultative bipedalism) and its phylogenetic position as a hominin in the evolution of humans. A 2024 study re-examined the 2022 study&#x27;s postcranial evidence, and concluded that it is not sufficient to determine whether &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; was a habitual biped, since none of the features are consistent with or unique to bipedal hominins, but with non-hominin apes or even non-primates.

== Palaeoecology ==
Based on dental mesowear patterns of the bovids found in the same palaeoenvironment, &quot;S. tchadensis&quot; inhabited a mosaic environment with patches of both forests and grasslands.

<text>A Venn diagram is a widely used diagram style that shows the logical relation between sets, popularized by John Venn (1834–1923) in the 1880s. The diagrams are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses simple closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets. Very often, these curves are circles or ellipses.

Similar ideas had been proposed before Venn such as by Christian Weise in 1712 (&quot;Nucleus Logicoe Wiesianoe&quot;) and Leonhard Euler (&quot;Letters to a German Princess&quot;) in 1768. The idea was popularised by Venn in &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot;, Chapter V &quot;Diagrammatic Representation&quot;, published in 1881.

== Details ==
A Venn diagram, also called a &quot;set diagram&quot; or &quot;logic diagram&quot;, shows &quot;all&quot; possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. The points inside a curve labelled &quot;S&quot; represent elements of the set &quot;S&quot;, while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set &quot;S&quot;. This lends itself to intuitive visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, denoted &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot; and read &quot;the intersection of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;&quot;, is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.

In Venn diagrams, the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams, which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science.

A Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an area-proportional (or scaled) Venn diagram.

==Example==

This example involves two sets of creatures, represented as overlapping circles: one circle that represents all types of creatures that have two legs, and another representing creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram. Living creatures that have two legs &quot;and&quot; can fly—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the two circles overlap. This overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example, creatures) that are members of both the set of two-legged creatures and set of flying creatures.

Humans and penguins are bipedal, and so are in the &quot;has two legs&quot; circle, but since they cannot fly, they appear in the part of the that circle that does not overlap with the &quot;can fly&quot; circle. Mosquitoes can fly, but have six, not two, legs, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the &quot;can fly&quot; circle that does not overlap with the &quot;has two legs&quot; circle. Creatures that are neither two-legged nor able to fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.

The combined region of the two sets is called their &quot;union&quot;, denoted by , where A is the &quot;has two legs&quot; circle and B the &quot;can fly&quot; circle. The union in this case contains all living creatures that either are two-legged or can fly (or both). The region included in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the &quot;intersection&quot; of A and B, denoted by .

== History ==
Venn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by John Venn in a paper entitled &quot;On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings&quot; in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science&quot;, about the different ways to represent propositions by diagrams. The use of these types of diagrams in formal logic, according to Frank Ruskey and Mark Weston, predates Venn but are &quot;rightly associated&quot; with him as he &quot;comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them&quot;.

Diagrams of overlapping circles representing unions and intersections were introduced by Catalan philosopher Ramon Llull (c. 1232–1315/1316) in the 13th century, who used them to illustrate combinations of basic principles. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) produced similar diagrams in the 17th century (though much of this work was unpublished), as did Johann Christian Lange in a work from 1712 describing Christian Weise&#x27;s contributions to logic. Euler diagrams, which are similar to Venn diagrams but don&#x27;t necessarily contain all possible unions and intersections, were first made prominent by mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. 

Venn did not use the term &quot;Venn diagram&quot; and referred to the concept as &quot;Eulerian Circles&quot;. He became acquainted with Euler diagrams in 1862 and wrote that Venn diagrams did not occur to him &quot;till much later&quot;, while attempting to adapt Euler diagrams to Boolean logic. In the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn wrote that Euler diagrams were the only diagrammatic representation of logic to gain &quot;any general acceptance&quot;.

Venn viewed his diagrams as a pedagogical tool, analogous to verification of physical concepts through experiment. As an example of their applications, he noted that a three-set diagram could show the syllogism: &#x27;All &quot;A&quot; is some &quot;B&quot;. No &quot;B&quot; is any &quot;C&quot;. Hence, no &quot;A&quot; is any &quot;C&quot;.&#x27;

Charles L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) includes &quot;Venn&#x27;s Method of Diagrams&quot; as well as &quot;Euler&#x27;s Method of Diagrams&quot; in an &quot;Appendix, Addressed to Teachers&quot; of his book &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (4th edition published in 1896). The term &quot;Venn diagram&quot; was later used by Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, in his book &quot;A Survey of Symbolic Logic&quot;.

In the 20th century, Venn diagrams were further developed. David Wilson Henderson showed, in 1963, that the existence of an &quot;n&quot;-Venn diagram with &quot;n&quot;-fold rotational symmetry implied that &quot;n&quot; was a prime number. He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when &quot;n&quot; is five or seven. In 2002, Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for &quot;n&quot; = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. These combined results show that rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist, if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a prime number.

Venn diagrams and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory, as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted in the curriculum of other fields such as reading.

==Popular culture==
Venn diagrams have been commonly used in memes. At least one politician has been mocked for misusing Venn diagrams.

==Overview==
A Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in a plane. According to Lewis, the &quot;principle of these diagrams is that classes [or &quot;sets&quot;] be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not-null&quot;.

Venn diagrams normally comprise overlapping circles. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the elements of the set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all wooden objects, while the other circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region, or &quot;intersection&quot;, would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn&#x27;s own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes (cardinality) of sets. That is, they are schematic diagrams generally not drawn to scale.

Venn diagrams are similar to Euler diagrams. However, a Venn diagram for &quot;n&quot; component sets must contain all 2&quot;n&quot; hypothetically possible zones, that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion in each of the component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram, the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents &quot;dairy products&quot; and another &quot;cheeses&quot;, the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context &quot;cheese&quot; means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.

The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3

The Euler and the Venn diagram of those sets are:

==Extensions to higher numbers of sets==
Venn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a simplex and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a tesseract (or the cells of a 16-cell, respectively).

For higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find &quot;symmetrical figures ... elegant in themselves,&quot; that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an &quot;elegant&quot; four-set diagram using ellipses (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for &quot;any&quot; number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.

===Edwards–Venn diagrams===

Anthony William Fairbank Edwards constructed a series of Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting the surface of a sphere, which became known as Edwards–Venn diagrams. For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (&quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; = 0 and &quot;z&quot; = 0). A fourth set can be added to the representation, by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane, to give &quot;cogwheel&quot; diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth—as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a stained-glass window in memory of Venn.

===Other diagrams===
Edwards–Venn diagrams are topologically equivalent to diagrams devised by Branko Grünbaum, which were based around intersecting polygons with increasing numbers of sides. They are also two-dimensional representations of hypercubes.

Henry John Stephen Smith devised similar &quot;n&quot;-set diagrams using sine curves with the series of equations
formula_4

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (also known as Lewis Carroll) devised a five-set diagram known as Carroll&#x27;s square. Joaquin and Boyles, on the other hand, proposed supplemental rules for the standard Venn diagram, in order to account for certain problem cases. For instance, regarding the issue of representing singular statements, they suggest to consider the Venn diagram circle as a representation of a set of things, and use first-order logic and set theory to treat categorical statements as statements about sets. Additionally, they propose to treat singular statements as statements about set membership. So, for example, to represent the statement &quot;a is F&quot; in this retooled Venn diagram, a small letter &quot;a&quot; may be placed inside the circle that represents the set F.

==Related concepts==

Venn diagrams correspond to truth tables for the propositions formula_5, formula_6, etc., in the sense that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the truth table. This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph&#x27;s R-diagrams.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards (also known as Oscars) presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929. This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot. The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.

The Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award&#x27;s inception. There have been 611 films nominated for Best Picture and 96 winners.

==History==
===Category name changes===
At the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: &quot;Outstanding Picture&quot; and &quot;Unique and Artistic Picture&quot;, the former being won by the war epic &quot;Wings&quot;, and the latter by the art film &quot;&quot;. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a &quot;sui generis&quot; item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.

The following year, the Academy dropped the &quot;Unique and Artistic Picture&quot; award, deciding retroactively that the award won by &quot;Wings&quot; was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award. Although the award kept the title &quot;Outstanding Picture&quot; for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years, as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called &quot;Best Picture&quot;.

* 1927/28–1928/29: Academy Award for Outstanding Picture
* 1929/30–1940: Academy Award for Outstanding Production
* 1941–1943: Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture
* 1944–1961: Academy Award for Best Motion Picture
* 1962–present: Academy Award for Best Picture

===Recipients===
Until 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; had received the award.

, the &quot;Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award&quot; limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:
* Those with screen credit of &quot;producer&quot; or &quot;produced by&quot;, explicitly excluding those with the screen credit &quot;executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with&quot;
* those three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions
The rules allow a team of not more than two people to be considered a single &quot;producer&quot; if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.

The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for &quot;The Reader&quot;. the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in &quot;rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].&quot;

Steven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at thirteen, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. During the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer received the most, with five wins and 40 nominations.

===Best Picture and Best Director===
The Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 96 films that have won Best Picture, 69 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: &quot;Wings&quot; directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), &quot;Argo&quot; directed by Ben Affleck (2012), &quot;Green Book&quot; directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and &quot;CODA&quot; directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for &quot;The Divine Lady&quot; (1928/29).

===Nomination limit increased===
On June 24, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from 5 to 10, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009). Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot; (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture. Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy&#x27;s early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when 8 to 12 films were nominated each year. &quot;Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,&quot; AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.&quot;

At the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting). In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between 5 and 10; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process. Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, &quot;A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn&#x27;t feel an obligation to round out the number.&quot; This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.

===Language and country of origin===
Nineteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (French, 1938); &quot;Z&quot; (French, 1969); &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (Swedish, 1972); &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (Swedish, 1973); &quot;The Postman (Il Postino)&quot; (Italian/Spanish, 1995); &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; (Italian, 1998); &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); &quot;Amour&quot; (French, 2012); &quot;Roma&quot; (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); &quot;Parasite&quot; (Korean, 2019); &quot;Minari&quot; (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production); &quot;Drive My Car&quot; (Japanese/Korean/Mandarin Chinese/German/Korean Sign Language, 2021), &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (German, 2022), &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot; (French, 2023), &quot;Past Lives&quot; (Korean, 2023, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production), &quot;The Zone of Interest&quot; (German/Polish/Yiddish, 2023), &quot;Emilia Pérez&quot; (Spanish, 2024) and &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (Portuguese, 2024). &quot;Parasite&quot; became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.

Ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), and &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010). The ninth film, &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011), was financed in France, and the tenth film, &quot;Parasite&quot; (2019), was financed in South Korea.

===Rating===
Since 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association&#x27;s rating system. &quot;Oliver!&quot; is the only G-rated film and &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; is the only X-rated film (what is categorized as an NC-17 film today), so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been changed to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was &quot;Patton&quot; (1970) and the most recent was &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) and the most recent was &quot;CODA&quot; (2021). For unrated films, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985) is the first film to not be rated by the MPA and be nominated Best Picture, though no unrated films have won Best Picture.

===Genres and mediums===

Three animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Up&quot; (2009) and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.

No comic book film has won, although three have been nominated: &quot;Skippy&quot; (1931), &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), and &quot;Joker&quot; (2019).

Two fantasy films have won: &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; (2017), although more have been nominated.

&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture. Six others have been nominated: &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Substance&quot; (2024).

Several science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022) was the first one to win.

&quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including &quot;Airport&quot; (1970) &quot;and The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).

No documentary has been nominated for Best Picture, although &quot;&quot; was nominated in the &quot;Unique and Artistic Picture&quot; category at the 1927/28 awards. A Best Documentary Feature category was introduced in 1941.

Several musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including &quot;Gigi&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Several epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient &quot;Wings&quot;. Others include &quot;Cimarron&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

===Sequel nominations and winners===
Ten films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, &quot;Going My Way&quot;), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015)&quot;, &quot; (2022), &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022) and &quot;&quot; (2024).

&quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; and &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. &quot;The Godfather&quot; series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.

Another nominee, &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was adapted from the sequel novel to &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. The latter had been adapted for film as &quot;Manhunter&quot; by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series. Conversely, &quot;Wicked&quot; uses iconography and characters who appeared in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and other &quot;Oz&quot; films, but is not a direct prequel to any film. 

&quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; features Peter O&#x27;Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film &quot;Becket&quot;, but &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; is not a sequel to &quot;Becket&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The Queen&quot; features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film &quot;The Deal&quot;. Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described &quot;The Queen&quot; as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.

Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; was a companion piece to his film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.

In addition, &quot;Black Panther&quot; is a continuation of the events that occurred in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

===Remake nominations and winners===
Along similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title and both were adapted from Lew Wallace&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;. &quot;The Departed&quot;, which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win.

Other nominees include 1963&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot; about the titular last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018&#x27;s &quot;A Star is Born&quot; following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel. &quot;True Grit&quot;, which was nominated for Best Picture of 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis&#x27;s 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name.

Four of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: &quot;CODA&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, and &quot;West Side Story&quot;. The 2021 version of &quot;West Side Story&quot; became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962&#x27;s &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;. For that same ceremony, &quot;CODA&quot; became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win.

The 2022 German-language &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.

===Silent film winners===
At the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named &quot;Academy Award for Outstanding Picture&quot;) was presented to the 1927 silent film &quot;Wings&quot;.

&quot;The Artist&quot; (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since &quot;Wings&quot; to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&quot;. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Apartment&quot;. (&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)

===Version availability===
No Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.

The 1928 film &quot;The Patriot&quot; is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant). &quot;The Racket&quot;, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes&#x27; archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies. The only surviving complete prints of 1931&#x27;s &quot;East Lynne&quot; and 1934&#x27;s &quot;The White Parade&quot; exist within the UCLA film archive.

===Diversity standards===
The Academy has established a set of &quot;representation and inclusion standards&quot;, called Academy Aperture 2025, which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023. There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development. As explained by Vox, the standards &quot;basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment&quot;. The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities (not counting developmental disabilities like the autism spectrum), or who are deaf or hard of hearing.

For the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards. These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film&#x27;s eligibility in other Oscar categories.

===2016 ceremony mistake===
At the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, presenter Faye Dunaway read &quot;La La Land&quot; as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the &quot;Best Actress in a Leading Role&quot; award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in &quot;La La Land&quot;. While accepting the award, &quot;La La Land&quot; producer Jordan Horowitz, who was given the correct envelope, realized the mistake and announced that &quot;Moonlight&quot; had won the award.

== Criticisms and controversies ==

=== &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; ===

Many film historians believe that &quot;High Noon&quot; lost out to &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; due to the initial release of &quot;High Noon&quot; showing a panoramic view of modern downtown Los Angeles. Retrospectively, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; has been considered by some to be one of the worst Best Picture winners in history.

=== Diversity criticisms ===
In general, the awardees of that category have been criticized for disproportionately recognizing films about white men over those of women or non-white people. Though there have been exceptions like Barry Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot;, films like &quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Get Out&quot; have been seen as potentially being shut out of the Best Picture race because of older and white Academy voters choosing not to see them. From 2018 onwards, the Academy made an effort to add more younger, female, non-white and non-American voters, and to create a non-voting &quot;emeritus&quot; status for people who had not worked in the film industry after a certain length of time, in order to diversify and rejuvenate their voter bloc.

=== &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; ===
&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was immediately pegged as a favorite for the category by many members and fans of Spielberg&#x27;s films, but it lost to &quot;Shakespeare in Love.&quot; The Academy&#x27;s decision was widely criticized. seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history, which led to DreamWorks executives (including Terry Press) and many industry pundits accusing Miramax and one of the producers, Harvey Weinstein, that this win was attributed to the award campaign led by himself. Press stated that Weinstein and Miramax &quot;tried to get everybody to believe that &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was all in the first 15 minutes&quot;.

=== &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; ===

&quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; losing the Best Picture to &quot;Crash&quot; was heavily criticized, with some critics such as Kenneth Turan accusing the Academy members of homophobia and benefitting from making a non-groundbreaking choice in &quot;Crash&quot;, considered as one of the most notable Oscars upsets. After announcing the award, presenter Jack Nicholson was caught on camera mouthing the word &quot;whoa&quot; out of apparent surprise at the result. The film&#x27;s use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic since many saw it as the &quot;safe&quot; alternative to &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, which is about a gay relationship (the other nominees, &quot;Good Night and Good Luck&quot;, &quot;Capote&quot;, and &quot;Munich&quot; also tackle heavy subjects of McCarthyism, homosexuality, and terrorism). Some of whom openly voiced their discomfort with &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; due to its subject matter.

=== Animated films in Best Picture category ===
The category of Best Animated Feature was created for the 74th Academy Awards to ensure the recognition of animated films; prior to its creation, the only animated film ever nominated for Best Picture was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; However, the award has since received criticism on the grounds that it discourages animated films from being eligible to win Best Picture. While the Academy rules allow for a film to be nominated in both categories, only two animated films (&quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;) have been nominated for Best Picture since the creation of the two categories.

A prominent example was the 2001 film &quot;Shrek;&quot; Dreamworks and producer Jeffrey Katzenberg campaigned heavily for the film to be awarded Best Picture, but it was not nominated in the category despite receiving nominations for a Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy, PGA Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, BAFTA Award for Best Film, and Critics&#x27; Choice Awards for Best Picture (and was the first animated film nominated in the latter three categories). Similarly, the 2008 film &quot;WALL-E&quot; received many accolades and garnered speculation that it might be nominated for Best Picture, but it was instead nominated for (and received) the award for Best Animated Picture. Other animated films that garnered Best Picture speculation but were ultimately not nominated include &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Pinocchio&quot; &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;.

=== &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; nomination ===
Critics and audiences criticized &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot;&#x27;s nomination for Best Picture, with some calling the film one of the worst Best Picture nominees ever. Chris Krapek of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; wrote very negatively about the film&#x27;s nomination, calling the film &quot;not only the worst reviewed Best Picture nominee of the last 10 years, [but] easily the worst film of 2011&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Adam Vitcavage called the film&#x27;s consensus for a Best Picture nominee &quot;certainly the worst for at least 28 years&quot;, and David Gritten of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; called the nomination &quot;mysterious&quot;.

==Winners and nominees==
In the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees. Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, but it may be the year after first release (as with &quot;Casablanca&quot; and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.

Until 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; made speeches after its win. A three-producer limit has been applied some years since. There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;. The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for &quot;The Reader&quot;. However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.

For the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2022.

For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.

Since 2023, the category&#x27;s winners and nominees from the 1927/28 and 1928/29 ceremonies have entered the public domain.

<text>Boustrophedon () is a style of writing in which alternate lines of writing are reversed, with letters also written in reverse, mirror-style. This is in contrast to modern European languages, where lines always begin on the same side, usually the left.

The original term comes from , &#x27;, a composite of ,&#x27;, &quot;ox&quot;; , &#x27;, &quot;turn&quot;; and the adverbial suffix -, -&#x27;, &quot;like, in the manner of&quot; – that is, &quot;like the ox turns [while plowing]&quot;. It is mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. It was a common way of writing on stone in ancient Greece, becoming less and less popular throughout the Hellenistic period. Many ancient scripts, such as Etruscan, Safaitic, and Sabaean, were frequently or even typically written boustrophedon.

== Reverse boustrophedon ==

The wooden boards and other incised artefacts of Rapa Nui also bear a boustrophedonic script called Rongorongo, which remains undeciphered. In Rongorongo, the text in alternate lines was rotated 180 degrees rather than mirrored; this is termed &quot;reverse boustrophedon.&quot;

The reader begins at the bottom left-hand corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line from left to right again. When reading one line, the lines above and below it appear upside down. However, the writing continues onto the second side of the tablet at the point where it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, the second will start at the &quot;upper&quot; left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom. Larger tablets and staves may have been read without turning, if the reader were able to read upside-down.

The Hungarian folklorist (1864–1946) writes that ancient boustrophedon writing resembles how the Hungarian rovás-sticks of Old Hungarian script were made by shepherds. A notcher would hold the wooden stick in their left hand, cutting the letters with their right hand from right to left. When the first side was complete, they would flip the stick over vertically and start to notch the opposite side in the same manner. When unfolded horizontally (as in the case of the stone-cut boustrophedon inscriptions), the final result is writing which starts from right to left, and continues from left to right in the next row, with letters turned upside down. Sebestyén suggests that the ancient boustrophedon writings were copied from such wooden sticks with cut letters, applied for epigraphic inscriptions (not recognizing the real meaning of the original wooden type).

==Example of Hieroglyphic Luwian==

The Luwian language had a version, Hieroglyphic Luwian, that is read in boustrophedon style (most of the language was written down in cuneiform).

Hieroglyphic Luwian is read boustrophedonically, with the direction of any individual line pointing into the front of the animals or body parts constituting certain hieroglyphs. However, unlike Egyptian hieroglyphs with their numerous ideograms and logograms, which show an easy directionality, the lineal direction of the text in hieroglyphic Luwian is harder to see.

== Other examples ==
A modern example of boustrophedonics is the numbering scheme of sections within survey townships in the United States and Canada. In both countries, survey townships are divided into a 6-by-6 grid of 36 sections. In the U.S. Public Land Survey System, Section 1 of a township is in the northeast corner, and the numbering proceeds boustrophedonically until Section 36 is reached in the southeast corner. Canada&#x27;s Dominion Land Survey also uses boustrophedonic numbering, but starts at the southeast corner. Following a similar scheme, street numbering in the United Kingdom sometimes proceeds serially in one direction then turns back in the other (the same numbering method is used in some mainland European cities). This is in contrast to the more common method of odd and even numbers on opposite sides of the street both increasing in the same direction.
The Avoiuli script used on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is written boustrophedonically by design.

Additionally, the Indus script, although still undeciphered, can be written boustrophedonically.

Another example is the boustrophedon transform, known in mathematics.

Sources also indicate that Linear A may have been written left-to-right, right-to-left, and in boustrophedon fashion.

Permanent human teeth are numbered in a boustrophedonic sequence in the American Universal Numbering System.

In art history Marilyn Aronberg Lavin adopted the term to describe a type of narrative direction a mural painting cycle may take: &quot;The boustrophedon is found on the surface of single walls [&quot;linear&quot;] as well on one or more opposing walls [&quot;aerial&quot;] of a given sanctuary. The narrative reads on several tiers, first from left to right, then reversing from right to left, or vice versa.&quot;

===In constructed languages===
The constructed language Ithkuil uses a boustrophedon script.

The Atlantean language created by Marc Okrand for Disney&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;&quot; is written in boustrophedon to recreate the feeling of flowing water.

The code language used in &quot;The Montmaray Journals&quot;, Kernetin, is written boustrophedonically. It is a combination of Cornish and Latin and is used for secret communication.

In late writings, J.R.R. Tolkien states many elves were ambidextrous and as such, would write left-to-right or right-to-left as needed.

In the &quot;Green Star&quot; novels by Lin Carter, the script of the Laonese people is written in boustrophedon style.

== Rousseau ==
To make it easier to read from one musical staff to another, and avoid &quot;jumping the eye,&quot; Jean-Jacques Rousseau envisioned a &quot;boustrophedon&quot; notation. This required the writer to write the second staff from right to left, then the one after from left to right, etc. As for the words, they were reversed, every second line.

<doc id="61708" wikidata="Q42295" url="?curid=61708" title="Shrub">
<text>A shrub or bush is a small-to-medium-sized perennial woody plant. Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than tall. Small shrubs, less than tall are sometimes termed as subshrubs. Many botanical groups have species that are shrubs, and others that are trees and herbaceous plants instead.

Some define a shrub as less than and a tree as over 6 m. Others use as the cutoff point for classification. Many trees do not reach this mature height because of hostile, less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble shrub-sized plants. Others in such species have the potential to grow taller in ideal conditions. For longevity, most shrubs are classified between perennials and trees. Some only last about five years in good conditions. Others, usually larger and more woody, live beyond 70. On average, they die after eight years.

Shrubland is the natural landscape dominated by various shrubs; there are many distinct types around the world, including fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland. In gardens and parks, an area largely dedicated to shrubs (now somewhat less fashionable than a century ago) is called a shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden. There are many garden cultivars of shrubs, bred for flowering, for example rhododendrons, and sometimes even leaf colour or shape.

Compared to trees and herbaceous plants, a small number of shrubs have culinary usage. Apart from the several berry-bearing species (using the culinary rather than botanical definition), few are eaten directly, and they are generally too small for much timber use unlike trees. Those that are used include several perfumed species such as lavender and rose, and a wide range of plants with medicinal uses. Tea and coffee are on the tree-shrub boundary; they are normally harvested from shrub-sized plants, but these would be large enough to become small trees if left to grow instead.

==Definition==
Shrubs are perennial woody plants, and therefore have persistent woody stems above ground (compare with succulent stems of herbaceous plants). Usually, shrubs are distinguished from trees by their height and multiple stems. Some shrubs are deciduous (e.g. hawthorn) and others evergreen (e.g. holly). Ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastus divided the plant world into trees, shrubs and herbs.
There is a type of shrub called a shrub of Ham which is very unique.
Small, low shrubs, generally less than tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of rose, are often termed as subshrubs.

Most definitions characterize shrubs as possessing multiple stems with no main trunk below. This is because the stems have branched below ground level. There are exceptions to this, with some shrubs having main trunks, but these tend to be very short and divide into multiple stems close to ground level without a reasonable length beforehand. Many trees can grow in multiple stemmed forms also while being tall enough to be trees, such as oak or ash.

==Use in gardens and parks==

An area of cultivated shrubs in a park or a garden is known as a shrubbery. When clipped as topiary, suitable species or varieties of shrubs develop dense foliage and many small leafy branches growing close together. Many shrubs respond well to renewal pruning, in which hard cutting back to a &quot;stool&quot;, removes everything but vital parts of the plant, resulting in long new stems known as &quot;canes&quot;. Other shrubs respond better to selective pruning to dead or unhealthy, or otherwise unattractive parts to reveal their structure and character.

Shrubs in common garden practice are generally considered broad-leaved plants, though some smaller conifers such as mountain pine and common juniper are also shrubby in structure. Species that grow into a shrubby habit may be either deciduous or evergreen.

== Botanical structure ==


In botany and ecology, a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical canopy structure or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than high and usually multiple stems arising at or near the surface of the ground. For example, a descriptive system widely adopted in Australia is based on structural characteristics based on life-form, plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant species.

For shrubs that are high, the following structural forms are categorized:
* dense foliage cover (70–100%) — closed-shrubs
* mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — open-shrubs
* sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — tall shrubland
* very sparse foliage cover (&lt;10%) — tall open shrubland

For shrubs less than high, the following structural forms are categorized:
* dense foliage cover (70–100%) — closed-heath or closed low shrubland—(&quot;North America&quot;)
* mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — open-heath or mid-dense low shrubland—(&quot;North America&quot;)
* sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — low shrubland
* very sparse foliage cover (&lt;10%) — low open shrubland

<text>David Warren Ellefson (born November 12, 1964) is an American musician, best known for his long tenure as the bassist and backing vocalist for thrash metal band Megadeth across two stints.

Ellefson initially became an accomplished bassist and honed his songwriting skills while leading several of his own bands through the club scene of North America&#x27;s Midwest region before relocating to Los Angeles. He was then the bassist of Megadeth from 1983 to their breakup in 2002, and again from 2010 to 2021. 

Ellefson co-founded the hard rock band the Lucid in 2021 alongside vocalist Vinnie Dombroski (Sponge), guitarist Drew Fortier (formerly of Bang Tango), and drummer Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy, Raven). In addition to playing bass guitar in Megadeth and the Lucid, Ellefson had various side projects, which include Temple of Brutality, F5, Killing Machine, and Metal Allegiance.

==Biography==

===First tenure with Megadeth and initial departure (1983–2002)===
Other than guitarist, vocalist, and primary lyricist Dave Mustaine, Ellefson was the only constant member of Megadeth from the time of their establishment in 1983 to the group&#x27;s dissolution in 2002; Mustaine reformed Megadeth without Ellefson in 2004. Mustaine referred to Ellefson as &quot;Dave Junior&quot;, which was often shortened to &quot;Junior&quot; after former vocalist Lawrence Renna started calling him it to differentiate between the two Daves. He appeared on every album and tour from 1985&#x27;s record &quot;Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!&quot; up until 2002&#x27;s &quot;Rude Awakening.&quot; In the early days of Megadeth, Ellefson played using his fingers, but as Megadeth progressed and the music became more complex, he tended to prefer playing with a pick, or plectrum. Ellefson was credited with some Megadeth songs, including &quot;Family Tree&quot; from 1994&#x27;s &quot;Youthanasia&quot; (in the 2004 remastered collection of the CD, however, the track is credited to Mustaine, Ellefson, Friedman, Menza, but Mustaine credited the &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;-era line-up with the entire &quot;Youthanasia&quot; album as a tribute to the band&#x27;s success at the time of the record&#x27;s initial release).

===Post-Megadeth career and return (2002–2010)===
Ellefson formed F5 following Megadeth&#x27;s 2002 disbandment. The band featured Ellefson on bass, Dale Steele on vocals, Steve Conley on lead guitar, John Davis on rhythm guitar, and former Megadeth bandmate Jimmy DeGrasso on drums. Their first album, &quot;A Drug for all Seasons&quot;, was released in 2005. F5 appeared in support for Disturbed in February 2006 and toured the American Mid-West in the summer of 2006. Ellefson also appeared on the new Killing Machine record &quot;Metalmorphosis&quot; in 2006 alongside DeGrasso; he has also been working with Temple of Brutality. Ellefson is currently a member of the melodic power metal band Avian, which features singer Lance King. He commented in an interview with Alternative-Zine.com that &quot;Megadeth was really just a starting point for me, creatively&quot;. Ellefson played five tracks for the Soulfly album &quot;Prophecy&quot; and also played on one track on &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. He also worked with underground emcee/Record producer Necro for his album entitled &quot;Death Rap&quot;.

Ellefson is also a member of a cover band called Hail!. Ellefson, DeGrasso (Mike Portnoy for 2010), Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Andreas Kisser formed the band in late 2008. The band was, as of April 2009, touring Europe. Ellefson participated in the Christmas Rock project Northern Light Orchestra, he performed bass on many of the 17 tracks produced by rock drummer Ken Mary and also at the live show Christmas in April Orpheum Theatre, Phoenix, Arizona.

In February 2010, Ellefson received a text message from Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover, saying &quot;if ever there was a time for you and Dave [Mustaine] to talk, now is it&quot;. Ellefson was invited to rehearse with the band. After the phone call, the news was released that Ellefson would return to the Megadeth lineup. Ellefson was quoted saying &quot;it felt like I never left&quot; after their first rehearsal together.

===Second tenure with Megadeth and departure (2010–2021)===

In 2013, Ellefson announced that his autobiography, entitled &quot;My Life with Deth&quot;, would be issued by American publisher Howard Books. The memoir was co-written with author Joel McIver, and features a foreword by Alice Cooper.

In 2018, it was announced that Ellefson had begun work on &quot;More Life with Deth&quot;, the follow-up to his 2013 memoir &quot;My Life with Deth&quot;, to be co-written with Ellefson&#x27;s business partner, and frequent collaborator, Thom Hazaert. The book was released on July 16, 2019, by UK based Jawbone Press, and features contributions from Alice Cooper, K.K. Downing of Judas Priest, Dan Donegan of Disturbed, Brian Welch of Korn, Mark Slaughter, Ron Keel, Jason McMaster of Dangerous Toys, Frank Bello of Anthrax, Chris Adler (Lamb of God, ex-Megadeth), Mark Tremonti of Creed and Alter Bridge, Kiko Loureiro and Dirk Verbeuren of Megadeth, actor Kristian Nairn (&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), and more, plus a foreword by &quot;My Life with Deth&quot; co-author, and &quot;Bass Player Magazine&quot; editor Joel McIver.

In late 2018, he confirmed he was considered for the role of Metallica bassist twice: in 1986, after Cliff Burton was killed in a bus accident, and again in 2002 when bassist Jason Newsted left the band a year earlier. He was not included in the documentary &quot;&quot; showing musicians auditioning for the band, however, and after Newsted&#x27;s departure the position was ultimately filled by Robert Trujillo (former Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Ozzy Osbourne). In 2019, Ellefson said since he rejoined Megadeth, he is a salaried member as opposed to being an &quot;equal owner&quot; with Mustaine in order to retain their friendship.

On May 24, 2021, Dave Mustaine released a statement on behalf of the band that David Ellefson had once again parted ways with Megadeth, following allegations of sexual misconduct with an underage fan. Ellefson denied any wrongdoing, and the other party denied being underage and said explicit videos were released without her consent. On June 17, 2021, Dave Mustaine announced in his weekly Gimme Radio show that he intended to hire a new bassist to rerecord Ellefson&#x27;s bass tracks for Megadeth&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot; Ellefson&#x27;s parts were overdubbed by Steve Di Giorgio of Testament. Former Megadeth bassist James LoMenzo, who Ellefson replaced in 2010, would rejoin Megadeth in 2022 as Ellefson&#x27;s full-time replacement.

===Post Megadeth projects (2021–present)===

Following his departure from Megadeth, Ellefson formed a new band named The Lucid. With Ellefson on bass, the band also consists of drummer Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy), guitarist Drew Fortier, and vocalist Vinnie Dombroski (Sponge, Spys4Darwin). Between September and October 2021, the band released three singles; &quot;Maggot Wind&quot;, &quot;Damned&quot;, and &quot;Hair&quot;. Their self-titled debut, &quot;The Lucid&quot;, was released on October 15, 2021.

In January 2023, the Lucid released their sophomore effort, a five-track EP titled &quot;Saddle Up and Ride&quot;. The EP includes a guest performance from Insane Clown Posse vocalist Violent J on the title track as well as a cover of Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;Epic&quot; retitled as &quot;Sweet Toof&quot;. Between December 2022 and January 2023, four singles from the EP were released; &quot;Saddle Up and Ride&quot;, &quot;Mumps&quot;, &quot;Risk Machine&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Toof&quot;.

In 2022, Ellefson formed the death metal band Dieth with Guilherme Miranda on guitar and vocals and Michał Łysejko on drums. The band released their first single, &quot;In the Hall of the Hanging Serpents&quot;, on July 13, 2022. The band released three more singles and their first album &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; in 2023. Song &quot;Walk With Me Forever&quot; from the same album marks Ellefson&#x27;s first time in his career singing lead vocals.

In 2022, Ellefson formed the band Kings Of Thrash with former Megadeth guitarist Jeff Young. The band plays songs from the first three studio albums of Megadeth live (and sometimes Mustaine-penned Metallica tunes, such as &quot;Jump In The Fire&quot;). They had former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland as a guest on their &quot;The MEGA Years&quot; tour in 2022. In February 2023, the group also played shows with the original lead guitarist for Megadeth, Greg Handevidt. Ellefson and Handevidt were the first two members who joined Megadeth.

In April 2024, Ellefson fillied in for bassist D.D. Verni on Overkill&#x27;s Latin American tour when Verni was unable to perform as he was recovering from shoulder surgery.

==Other ventures==

===Ellefson Music Productions – EMP Label Group===
In October 2015 it was announced that Ellefson had launched a record label and production company, Ellefson Music Productions, also known as EMP Label Group, and would release &quot;In Your Face&quot;, the debut EP from Phoenix-based all-girl pop punk group Doll Skin (which Ellefson also produced), in conjunction with Megaforce Records in North America, and Cargo Records in Europe. The EP was released October 30 in North America, and December 18 in Europe, and re-released as an LP titled in Your Face (Again) in March 2016 via eOne Distribution. The singles from the LP received airplay on many prominent stations in the US and Europe, including Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s weekly show on influential LA Rock station KROQ.

Since forming in 2015, EMP Label Group has secured distribution from eOne in North America and SPV in Europe, with the roster spread among several imprints including EMP Label Group (Ellefson Music Productions in Europe) and EMP Underground. Ellefson also appears on a recurring segment &quot;Mandatory Megadeth&quot; on Hazaert&#x27;s Dash Radio show. In January 2017, Ellefson opened Ellefson Coffee Co. in his hometown, Jackson, Minn.

===Ellefson Films===
In May 2019 Ellefson along with business partner Thom Hazaert formed Ellefson Films and are producing the upcoming found footage horror film Dwellers; written, directed by, and starring Drew Fortier with James L. Edwards and Douglas Esper co-starring. On top of producing the project, Ellefson and Hazaert will also be appearing in the film as featured cameos.

A 50 second teaser trailer for the film was released in August 2019.

Ellefson Films held a Q&amp;A panel at Rue Morgue&#x27;s annual Frightmare in the Falls horror convention to speak about Dwellers, which is intended to be released in 2020 through film festival showings eventually leading to digital and physical distribution. During the panel Ellefson along with Drew Fortier revealed that Dwellers is a gritty found footage horror film with the story being told as a documentary gone severely wrong drawing influences from such films as &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999) and &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; (1984) 

In November 2019, the full trailer for Dwellers was released.

The film was released October 12, 2021.

===The Ellefson Book Co.===
In November 2020 Ellefson announced that he had completed a fiction thriller novel titled &quot;Rock Star Hitman&quot; co-written with Drew Fortier to be released via his book imprint The Ellefson Book Co in December 2020. It was revealed on the Decibel Geek Podcast in an interview with Ellefson and Fortier that an album very loosely tying into &quot;Rock Star Hitman&quot; recorded with Vinnie Dombroski from Sponge on vocals, Mike Heller from Fear Factory on drums, Drew Fortier on guitar, and Ellefson on bass would be released in 2021 under the name Lucid.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
Ellefson and his wife, Julie, were married in 1993. They have a son and a daughter. 

===Feud with Mustaine===
Mustaine intended to release a solo album in 2004, which would become &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;, although due to contractual obligations, Mustaine released it under the Megadeth name. Ellefson and Mustaine had a severe legal disagreement over royalties and rights to Megadeth&#x27;s name and back catalog, resulting in Ellefson filing an unsuccessful lawsuit. Though the two once enjoyed a close friendship, considerable animosity developed between Ellefson and Mustaine during this period to the point that on Ellefson&#x27;s website, Megadeth was not mentioned in his biography, only in the discography.

In a mid-2005 podcast, Ellefson did not mention his past with Megadeth at all, instead concentrating on discussing his current projects. Mustaine felt Ellefson was unfairly using the Megadeth name when advertising an amplifier for Peavey. Mustaine claims to have had dinner with Ellefson around Christmas in 2005 to talk things through; this got them on good terms, as Mustaine has stated that they spoke on the phone numerous times afterward. In 2010 Mustaine and Ellefson agreed to keep any unresolved issues in the past and were working on building and maintaining their friendship again. Since this time Ellefson has gone on to say that he feels &quot;that having that time away created a realization for both of us that, while we are both productive individually, Megadeth is definitely stronger with both of us in it together.&quot;

Ellefson&#x27;s dismissal from Megadeth in 2021 spurred renewed tensions with Mustaine, with the pair frequently attacking each other in interviews. Ellefson accused Mustaine of “not having his back” when the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced, while Mustaine has downplayed Ellefson&#x27;s contributions to Megadeth and denied he was a founding member of the band.

===Christianity===
Ellefson, like his ex-bandmate Dave Mustaine, is a committed Christian. &quot;Well, I was actually brought up in a Christian household, so I have, you know, a pretty broad knowledge of it; [I had] strayed from it for quite a while, [but] now that I have children, I actually do go to church, so I&#x27;ve kinda sorta returned to it, you know?&quot; Ellefson further discussed his Christianity in a 2010 interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast explaining &quot;I&#x27;ve found that when you just suit up and show up and walk your talk instead of talking your talk all the time, that is often the best testimony!&quot;

In an article titled CODA – Ready for a MEGA Life, Ellefson indicated that in the fall of 2007 he began the new MEGA Life Ministries worship service in Scottsdale, AZ. &quot;Oddly, the service has become one of my most rewarding and musically invigorating gigs I&#x27;ve ever had... a gig that literally landed in my lap and not something I had to chase down either. Not only are the parishioners respectful (no bar fights, spilled drinks and foul mouthed hecklers in the crowd like many secular gigs) but it&#x27;s a musical event my whole family participates in. Plus, I was finally given the venue to put into practical application the very words I&#x27;d been trying to live by for many years which is &#x27;Play music for God, not us&#x27;.&quot; Ellefson began studying for the ministry in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod through an extension program of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis.

===Controversy===
On May 10, 2021, videos of Ellefson masturbating were posted on Twitter. The videos, recorded in 2020 by a fan that Ellefson was in correspondence with, initially led to accusations of child grooming. However, Ellefson and the other party both denied the accusations and stated that it was consensual adult conduct. An official statement released the next day from Megadeth stated that the situation was being &quot;watched closely&quot;. On May 24, 2021, Dave Mustaine released a statement stating that, in light of the recent allegations and an already strained relationship, Megadeth had officially parted ways with Ellefson again.

On May 26, 2021, Ellefson released the following statement: 
==Equipment==
After rejoining Megadeth in early 2010, Ellefson started using his old Jackson Custom and Concert bass guitars and Hartke amps again.
He used an LH1000 with two HX810s on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour. He has since moved onto using the Kilo amplifier. In early 2011, Jackson released a Dave Ellefson Concert and Kellybird signature model, both in 4-string and 5-string variants. According to providence website, Ellefson has used or is still using the Dual Bass Station. Ellefson formerly used Peavey amps and his Peavey Zodiac DE Scorpio 4-string signature bass. In the early days of Megadeth, Ellefson, along with Dave Mustaine, primarily used B.C. Rich instruments, most notably Ironbird and Mockingbird basses, the latter of which he has still been known to periodically bring out on occasion.

Ellefson plays exclusively with a guitar pick, as he is unable to perform in fingerstyle the fast tempos and palm-muting in many Megadeth songs. Ellefson shifted exclusively to pick playing since &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, after recording their debut effort with a mix of fingerstyle and playing with a pick.

<text>Light poetry or light verse is poetry that attempts to be humorous. Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature word play including puns, adventurous rhyme, and heavy alliteration. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as doggerel or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned &quot;serious&quot; poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

<text>Year 223 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Flaminius and Philus (or, less frequently, year 531 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 223 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Year 246 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Licinus (or, less frequently, year 508 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 246 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Egypt ====
* Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemy II dies and is succeeded by his son, Ptolemy III. At the time of Ptolemy II&#x27;s death, Egypt comprises the ancient kingdom of Egypt in the Nile Valley, Cyrene, Judea and the coast of southern Syria, Cyprus and a number of cities on the shores and islands of the Aegean Sea. The Macedonian Ptolemies maintain their authority over their territories with a small mercenary army made up of Macedonians and other Greeks.

==== India ====
* The Ashokan pillar in Lauriya, Nandangarh (from the Maurya period) is made.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Antiochus II leaves Berenice in order to live again with his former wife Laodice and his son Seleucus. However, Laodice poisons him and proclaims her son as King Seleucus II Callinicus, while her supporters in Antioch kill Berenice and her children who have taken refuge at Daphne, near Antioch, in Syria.
* Berenice&#x27;s brother, Ptolemy III, sets about to avenge his sister&#x27;s murder by invading Syria which begins the Third Syrian War (also known as the Laodicean War). Ptolemy III&#x27;s navy, perhaps with the aid of rebels in the cities, advances against Seleucus II&#x27;s forces as far as Thrace, across the Hellespont, and also captures some islands off the Anatolian coast.
* Ptolemy III wins major victories over Seleucus II in Syria and Anatolia and briefly occupies Antioch. These victories are marred by the loss of the Cyclades to Antigonus II Gonatas in the Battle of Andros.
* Seleucus II Callinicus&#x27; mother, Laodice attempts to take control over the Seleucid Empire by insisting that Seleucus II make his younger brother, Antiochus Hierax, co-regent and give him all the Seleucid territory in Anatolia. Antiochus promptly declares independence and begins fighting a war with his brother.
* In order to secure the Bactrian King Diodotus&#x27; friendship, Seleucus II Callinicus arranges the marriage of one of his sisters to King Diodotus.

==== Roman Republic ====
* With Hamilcar Barca wearing the Romans down in Sicily, the Romans, by private subscription, build another fleet with the aim of regaining command of the sea.
* In Rome, the number of praetors is increased from one to two. The second praetor is appointed to relieve the backlog of judicial business and to give the Republic a magistrate with Imperium who can field an army in an emergency when both consuls are away fighting a war.

==== China ====
* The Zhengguo Canal, approximately one hundred miles long, is built across the current-day province of Shaanxi in China, greatly adding to the agricultural productivity of the area and to the military potency of the Qin dynasty.
* The Qin general Meng Ao crushes a revolt in Jinyang.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births==
* Arsinoe III, queen of Egypt from 220 BC, daughter of Ptolemy III and Berenice II (d. 204 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Ptolemy II Philadelphus, king of Egypt from 285 BC, second king of the Ptolemaic dynasty, who has extended his power by skillful diplomacy, developed agriculture and commerce, and made Alexandria a leading centre of the arts and sciences (b. 308 BC)
* Antiochus II Theos, king of the Seleucid dominions in the Middle East from 261 BC. He has spent much of his reign at war with Egypt, recovering much of the territory in Anatolia lost in earlier wars between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties (b. c. 287 BC)
* Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Arsinoe, wife of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II Theos, supplanting his first wife, Laodice, whose children she has persuaded him to bar from the succession to the throne in favour of her own.

<text>Year 224 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Torquatus and Flaccus (or, less frequently, year 530 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* After the Spartan King Cleomenes III takes on Pellene, Phlius and Argos, Aratus of Sicyon is forced to call upon King Antigonus III of Macedonia for assistance. Antigonus III&#x27;s forces fail to pierce Cleomenes&#x27; lines near Corinth, but a revolt against Cleomenes at Argos put the Spartans on the defensive.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Romans, led by Consuls Gaius Atilius Regulus and Lucius Aemilius Papus, decisively defeat the coalition of Cisalpine Gallic tribes at the Battle of Telamon thus extending Roman influence over northern Italy. On the Roman side Gaius Atilius Regulus, commander of the Roman cavalry, is killed in the battle. On the Gallic side, one of the leaders, Concolitanus, is captured in battle, while the leader of the Gaesatae, Aneroëstes, kills himself when the battle is lost.

==== China ====
* Qin begins the invasion of Chu. Initially, the Qin generals Li Xin and Meng Tian capture several cities and defeat the Chu army. 
* The Qin Prime Minister Lord Changping, who was born in Chu, incites a Chu rebellion against the Qin invaders. He and the Chu general Xiang Yan then surprise and defeat the Qin army led by Li Xin and Meng Tian in the Battle of Chengfu.
* Taking command of the Qin war effort, Wang Jian twice defeats Xiang Yan and captures Fuchu, the king of Chu, as well as the Chu capital Chen and the city of Pingyu.
* Xiang Yan retreats his forces south of the Huai River and makes Lord Changping the new king of Chu.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="61720" wikidata="Q11751" url="?curid=61720" title="Nagoya">
<text>is the largest city in the Chūbu region of Japan. It is the fourth-most populous city in Japan, with a population of 2.3million in 2020, and the principal city of the Chūkyō metropolitan area, which is the third-most populous metropolitan area in Japan with a population of 10.11million. Located on the Pacific coast in central Honshu, it is the capital and most populous city of Aichi Prefecture, with the Port of Nagoya being Japan&#x27;s largest seaport.

In 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. The arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Nagoya during the Meiji Restoration, and it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, ceramic, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area&#x27;s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. These factors made the city a target for air raids during the Pacific War.

Following the war, Nagoya&#x27;s economy diversified, but the city remains a significant centre for industry and transport in Japan. It is linked with Tokyo, Kyōto, and Osaka by the Tokaido Shinkansen, and is home to the Nagoya Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others. Nagoya is home of educational institutes such as Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. Famous landmarks in the city include Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, Nagoya Castle, Hisaya Ōdori Park, and Nagoya TV Tower, one of the oldest TV towers in Japan. It will be the third Japanese city to host the 2026 Asian Games, after Tokyo 1958 and Hiroshima 1994.

== Toponymy ==
The city&#x27;s name was historically written as or (both read as &quot;Nagoya&quot;). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning &#x27;calm&#x27;.

The name , consisting of &quot;chū&quot; (middle) + &quot;kyō&quot; (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Chūkyō include the Chūkyō Industrial Area, Chūkyō Metropolitan Area, Chūkyō Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.

== History ==
===Origins===
;Jōmon period
In the Jomon and Yayoi period, the Ōguruwa Shell Midden was discovered before the settlement of Nagoya. 
;Kofun period
In the Kofun period, Nagoya was settled and the Danpusan Kofun and Shiratori Kofun was built in this area. The Atsuta Shrine is of ancient origin, it is home to the Imperial Regalia of Japan, the legendary sword &quot;Kusanagi no Tsurugi&quot;. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in 113 AD. The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home.

;Heian period
The Seigan-ji was built by the Fujiwara clan in the late Heian period. A member served as the head priest of the nearby Atsuta Shrine, one of the legendary shrines of Japan. It is believed that Yura-Gozen, also known as Urahime, a daughter of Fujiwara no Suenori, was married to Minamoto no Yoshitomo (1123–60) and their son Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s birthplace is Nagoya, he is also the founder of the Kamakura shogunate.
===Feudal period===
;Azuchi–Momoyama period
Oda Nobunaga and his protégés Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers () away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.

In May–June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.

===Early modern period===
During this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important Tōkaidō road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.

===Modern period===
;Meiji period
During the Meiji Restoration Japan&#x27;s provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on 1 September 1956, by government ordinance. Nagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called &quot;karakuri ningyō&quot;.

;Taisho period
Mitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.

;Pacific War and post-war years
Nagoya was the target of air raids during the Pacific War. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during the war.

Air raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command&#x27;s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission—3,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945, followed by the Yokkaichi bombing in June 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26, 1945, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima. In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.

===Contemporary period===
After the war the city was able to rebuild and take up its role again as one of the country&#x27;s leading industrial and manufacturing centers, it became known as the &quot;Houston and Montreal of the Orient&quot;. It also plays an increasing role in the meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) industry, hosting the Expo 2005 and the Nagoya Protocol conference in 2010.

== Geography and administrative divisions ==
===Geography===
Nagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the Nōbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation&#x27;s most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Shōnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The human-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Shōnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at Ōdaka into the bay.

The city&#x27;s location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.
===Climate===
Nagoya has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.
===Area===
====Wards====
Nagoya has 16 wards.

===Demographics===

One of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of . Also an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there—a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of the Pacific War in 1945.

The area is . Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.

=== Ceramics ===
Japanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of &quot;oniwa-yaki&quot; (literally &quot;garden ware&quot;) called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord&#x27;s court. Almost every feudal lord had his own &quot;oniwa-yaki&quot;, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord&#x27;s taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kurō and Masaki Sōzaburō, who made their own pieces.

Toyoraku ware continued on until the Taishō era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.

An early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialization during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also &quot;Nagoya E-tsuke&quot; () became popular.

Nagoya was a major trading city and political seat of the Owari lords, the most important house of the Tokugawa clan. They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city&#x27;s wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During the Pacific War many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region&#x27;s economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.

=== Dialect ===
The is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called . The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.

=== Handicrafts ===
The industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.
* Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6–12 months to complete.
* &quot;Geta&quot; clog straps: wooden clogs called &quot;geta&quot; were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.
* &quot;Shippo&quot;: the technique for enamelware called &quot;shippo&quot; arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.
* Candles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (&quot;washi&quot;) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.
* &quot;Yuzen&quot;: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.
* &quot;Sekku Ningyo&quot;: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.
* The city also gave its name to a type of &quot;obi&quot;, the sash that is used to tie a &quot;kimono&quot;. The term &quot;Nagoya obi&quot; can refer to an older type of &quot;obi&quot; used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current – or to differentiate from the &quot;fukuro Nagoya obi&quot;, also called – is the most-used &quot;obi&quot; type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo&#x27;s geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The &quot;Nagoya obi&quot; was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the or , which is more formal.
* Japanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Seto ware and Tokoname ware are from the region. In the town itself Ofukei ware, Toyoraku ware, Sasashima ware and Kawana ware were produced.
* &quot;Netsuke&quot; artists such as Tametaka and Ikkan were well known during the Edo period.

=== Cuisine ===
The city and the region are known for their unique local . Dishes include: 
* &quot;Tebasaki&quot;: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of &quot;yakitori&quot;
* &quot;Tenmusu&quot;: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp
* &quot;Kishimen&quot;: flat &quot;udon&quot; noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.
* Red &quot;miso&quot;: various dishes that use red &quot;miso&quot;, such as &quot;miso katsu&quot; (pork cutlet) with sweet &quot;miso&quot; sauce and &quot;miso nikomi udon&quot; (hard &quot;udon&quot; stewed in &quot;miso&quot; soup)
* &quot;Hitsumabushi&quot;: rice dish with &quot;unagi&quot; in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as &quot;unadon&quot;, with spice and as &quot;chazuke&quot;.
* &quot;Miso nikomi udon&quot;: Firmer texture udon noodles. It is served in a Donabe pot and it usually arrives still bubbling and steaming hot at the table.

===In popular culture===
The world premiere of the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954. The city, especially Nagoya Castle, has been featured in two other Godzilla movies: &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;.

The city was the setting for the 2007 movie &quot;Ashita e no yuigon&quot; (translated as &quot;Best Wishes for Tomorrow&quot;), in which a Japanese war criminal sets out to take responsibility for the execution of U.S. airmen. The anime &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; by Hayao Miyazaki, released in 2013, is a highly fictionalized biography of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero&#x27;s chief engineer Jiro Horikoshi and takes mostly place in Nagoya of the 1920s and 1930s.

<text>is the smallest of the four main islands of Japan. It is long and between at its widest. It has a population of 3.8 million, the least populated of Japan&#x27;s four main islands. It is south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. Shikoku&#x27;s ancient names include , , and , and its current name refers to the four former provinces that make up the island: Awa, Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo.

==Geography==
Shikoku Island, comprising Shikoku and its surrounding islands, covers about and consists of four prefectures: Ehime, Kagawa, Kōchi, and Tokushima. Across the Seto Inland Sea lie Wakayama, Osaka, Hyōgo, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi Prefectures on Honshu. To the west lie Ōita and Miyazaki Prefectures on Kyushu.

Shikoku is ranked as the 50th largest island by area in the world. Additionally, it is ranked as the 23rd most populated island in the world, with a population density of 193 inhabitants per square kilometre (500/sq mi).

Mountains running east and west divide Shikoku into a narrow northern subregion, fronting on the Seto Inland Sea, and a southern part facing the Pacific Ocean. The &quot;Hydrangea hirta&quot; species can be found in these mountain ranges. Most of the 3.8 million inhabitants live in the north, and all but one of the island&#x27;s few larger cities are located there. Mount Ishizuchi () in Ehime at is the highest mountain on the island. Industry is moderately well developed and includes the processing of ores from the important Besshi copper mine. Land is used intensively. Wide alluvial areas, especially in the eastern part of the zone, are planted with rice and subsequently are double-cropped with winter wheat and barley. Fruit is grown throughout the northern area in great variety, including citrus fruits, persimmons, peaches, and grapes. Because of wheat production, Sanuki udon () became an important part of the diet in Kagawa Prefecture (formerly Sanuki Province) in the Edo period.

The larger southern area of Shikoku is mountainous and sparsely populated. The only significant lowland is a small alluvial plain at Kōchi, the prefectural capital. The area&#x27;s mild winters stimulated some truck farming, specializing in growing out-of-season vegetables under plastic covering. Two crops of rice can be cultivated annually in the southern area. The pulp and paper industry took advantage of the abundant forests and hydroelectric power.

The major river in Shikoku is the Yoshino River. It runs from its source close to Mount Ishizuchi, flowing basically west to east across the northern boundaries of Kōchi and Tokushima Prefectures, reaching the sea at the city of Tokushima. The Yoshino is famous for Japan&#x27;s best white-water rafting, with trips going along the Oboke Koboke sections of the river.

Shikoku has four important capes: Gamōda in Anan, Tokushima on the easternmost point on the island, Sada in Ikata, Ehime on the westernmost point. Muroto in Muroto, Kōchi and Ashizuri, the southern extreme of Shikoku, in Tosashimizu, Kōchi, jut into the Pacific Ocean. The island&#x27;s northernmost point is in Takamatsu.

Unlike the other three major islands of Japan, Shikoku has no active volcanoes, and is the largest of Japan&#x27;s islands to completely lack them. But Shikoku did experience volcanic activity in the distant prehistoric past; a major volcanic caldera in the area of Mount Ishizuchi was active during the Miocene around 14 million years ago and the small volcanic cone of Mount Iino at an unknown date.

== Population ==
Shikoku has a total population of 3,630,320 in 2022. The largest city is Matsuyama (population: 507,137) and is the capital of Ehime Prefecture. Shikoku is the main island with the third largest population density, at .


Per Japanese census data, and, Shikoku region&#x27;s peak population was at 1950 and has had negative population growth from 1950 to 1970 and 1990 onward.

==Culture==

===Society and architecture===
Shikoku has historically been quite isolated and therefore it has kept the original characteristics of Japan for a longer period, especially in regards to vegetation and some architectural techniques. There are many Buddhist temples.

The &quot;lost&quot; Shikoku has been described by an American writer, Alex Kerr, who lived in a remote mountain village near Oboke (大歩危) for many years from 1970 onwards.

Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park is located in the south-west part of Shikoku.

===Traditions===

Shikoku is also famous for its 88-temple pilgrimage of temples. The pilgrimage was established by the Heian-period Buddhist priest Kūkai, a native of present-day Zentsūji-cho in Kagawa prefecture. According to legend, Kūkai still appears to pilgrims today. Most modern-day pilgrims travel by bus, rarely choosing the old-fashioned method of going by foot. They are seen wearing white jackets emblazoned with the characters reading &quot;dōgyō ninin&quot; () meaning &quot;two traveling together&quot;.

Tokushima Prefecture also has its annual Awa Odori running in August at the time of the Obon festival, which attracts thousands of tourists each year from all over Japan and from abroad.

Kōchi Prefecture is home to the first annual Yosakoi festival. The largest festival in Kōchi, it takes place in August every year and attracts dancers and tourists from all over Japan.

===Food===

One of the major foods of Shikoku is udon. Udon is often served hot as a noodle soup in its simplest form, as &quot;kake udon&quot;, in a mildly flavoured broth called &quot;kakejiru,&quot; which is made of dashi, soy sauce (shōyu), and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or &quot;kakiage&quot; (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or &quot;aburaage&quot;, a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added. Shichimi can be added to taste. Another specialty is Kōchi&#x27;s signature dish, seared bonito.

The warm climate of Shikoku lends itself to the cultivation of citrus fruits. As a result, yuzu, mikan and other citrus fruits are plentiful on Shikoku and have become synonymous with the regions they are grown in.

===Movements===
Pioneering natural farmer Masanobu Fukuoka, author of &quot;The One-Straw Revolution&quot;, developed his methods here on his family&#x27;s farm.

===Sports===
Historically no Shikoku-based sports team has competed in the top Japanese division of baseball, football (soccer) or even rugby union. However, Tokushima Vortis have had two spells in the top flight of Japanese soccer (J1) in 2014 and 2021. Currently the major teams competing in Shikoku&#x27;s major cities include:
*Naruto, Tokushima:
**Tokushima Vortis (football, J2)
**Tokushima Indigo Socks (baseball, SKIL)
*Matsuyama, Ehime
**Ehime FC (football, J2)
**Ehime Mandarin Pirates (baseball, SKIL)
*Imabari, Ehime: 
**FC Imabari (football, J2)
*Takamatsu, Kagawa: 
**Kamatamare Sanuki (football, J3)
**Kagawa Olive Guyners (baseball, SKIL)
*Kōchi, Kōchi: 
**Kōchi United SC (football, J3)
**Kōchi Fighting Dogs (baseball, SKIL)

===Notable sportspeople===

Two time darts Women&#x27;s World Champion Mikuru Suzuki is a native of Takamatsu in Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku.

== Transportation ==

===Roads===

Shikoku is connected to Honshu by three expressways, which together form the Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project.

* Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway (Eastern Shikoku)
* Nishiseto Expressway (Western Shikoku)
* Seto-Chūō Expressway (Central Shikoku)

The eastern gateway to Shikoku, Naruto in Tokushima Prefecture has been linked to the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway since 1998. This line connects Shikoku to the Kansai area which has a large population, including the large conurbations of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. Therefore, the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway carries a large traffic volume. Many highway buses are operated between Kansai and Tokushima Prefecture.

The central part of Shikoku is connected to Honshu by ferry, air, and – since 1988 – by the Great Seto Bridge network. Until completion of the bridges, the region was isolated from the rest of Japan. The freer movement between Honshu and Shikoku was expected to promote economic development on both sides of the bridges, which has not materialized yet.

Within the island, a web of national highways connects the major population centers. These include Routes 11, 32, 33, 55, and 56.

===Rail===

The Shikoku Railway Company (JR Shikoku) serves the island and connects to Honshu via the Great Seto Bridge. JR lines include:

* Dosan Line
* Honshi Bisan Line
* Kōtoku Line
* Mugi Line
* Naruto Line
* Seto Ōhashi Line
* Tokushima Line
* Uchiko Line
* Yodo Line
* Yosan Line

Private railway lines operate in each of the four prefectures on Shikoku.

=== Air travel ===

Shikoku lacks a full international airport but has four regional/domestic airports (Tokushima Airport, Takamatsu Airport, Kōchi Ryōma Airport and Matsuyama Airport). All of these airports have flights to Tokyo and other major Japanese cities such as Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, and Fukuoka. International flights to Seoul, South Korea are serviced by Asiana Airlines from Matsuyama and Takamatsu. There are periodic international charter flights as well.

Sea Travel

Ferries link Shikoku to destinations including Honshu, Kyushu, and islands around Shikoku.

<doc id="61728" wikidata="Q134638" url="?curid=61728" title="Chūbu region">
<text>The , Central region, or is a region in the middle of Honshū, Japan&#x27;s main island. In a wide, classical definition, it encompasses nine prefectures (&quot;ken&quot;): Aichi, Fukui, Gifu, Ishikawa, Nagano, Niigata, Shizuoka, Toyama, and Yamanashi.

It is located directly between the Kantō region and the Kansai region and includes the major city of Nagoya as well as Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan coastlines, extensive mountain resorts, and Mount Fuji.

The region is the widest part of Honshū and the central part is characterized by high, rugged mountains. The Japanese Alps divide the country into the Pacific side, sunny in winter, and the Sea of Japan side, snowy in winter.

Although Mie is part of Kinki/Kansai/Western Japan in traditional geographical regional divisions, Northern Mie is part of the metropolitan area around Nagoya, and Mie is in many practical contexts considered to be part of Tōkai/Chūbu/Central Japan. Including Mie, Chūbu had a population of 23,010,276 as of 1 June 2019.

== Other definitions ==
In the MLIT of the central government, the jurisdiction of the Chūbu regional development bureau (中部地方整備局, &quot;Chūbu-chihō seibi-kyoku&quot;; ) extends to five prefectures: Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie and the Southern part of Nagano.

In the National Police Agency, the Chūbu Regional Police Bureau (中部管区警察局, &quot;Chūbu kanku keisatsu-kyoku&quot;; ) is responsible for six prefectural police forces: Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Gifu, Aichi and Mie.

In local government, the Chūbu area governors&#x27; association (中部圏知事会, &quot;Chūbuken chijikai&quot;) unites the governors of Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie and Shiga and the mayor of Nagoya City in Aichi.

== Geography ==

Located in the center of the Japanese archipelago. It refers to the area between the Kanto, Tohoku and Kansai regions. It began to be used in the late Meiji era as a tentative name for unclassified areas. In a broad sense, it often refers to the eight regional divisions and similar ranges. In a narrow sense it may refer to a range similar to the Tōkai region.

The terrain is mainly rugged and mountainous except for the Nōbi Plain and coastal areas. The steep Japanese Alps rise in the central area. It is located between Tokyo and Osaka, which are the east–west centers of the Japanese economy and culture. Thus the Chubu region has various differences between the eastern side and the western side.

==Subregions==
The Chūbu region covers a large and geographically diverse area of Honshū which leads to it generally being divided into three distinct subregions: Tōkai, Kōshin&#x27;etsu, and Hokuriku. There is also another subregion occasionally referred to in business circles called Chūkyō.

===Tōkai===
The Tōkai region, mostly bordering the Pacific Ocean, is a narrow corridor interrupted in places by mountains that descend into the sea.

Since the Tokugawa period (1600–1867), this corridor has been critical in linking Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. One of old Japan&#x27;s most important ancient roadways, the Tōkaidō, ran through it connecting Tokyo (at that time called Edo) and Kyoto, the old imperial capital. In the twentieth century, it became the route for new super-express highways and high-speed railroad lines (shinkansen). The area consists of Aichi, Mie, Shizuoka, and southern Gifu prefectures.

A number of small alluvial plains are found in the corridor section. A mild climate, favorable location relatively close to the great metropolitan complexes, and availability of fast transportation have made this area a center for truck-gardening and out-of-season vegetables. Upland areas of rolling hills are extensively given over to the growing of mandarin oranges and tea. Nagoya, which faces Ise Bay, is a center for heavy industry, including iron and steel and machinery manufacturing. The corridor also has a number of small but important industrial centers. The western part of Tōkai includes the Nōbi Plain, where rice was being grown by the seventh century.

====Chūkyō====
The three Tōkai prefectures centered on Nagoya (Aichi, Gifu, and Mie) have particularly strong economic ties, and the parts of these prefectures that are closest to the city comprise the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area. This area boasts the third strongest economy in Japan and this influence can sometimes extend into the more remote parts of these prefectures that are farther away from Nagoya. Thus, these three prefectures are sometimes called the &quot;Chūkyō region&quot; in a business sense. This name does not see widespread usage throughout Japan; however, as the economy in the area strengthens, this name may become more well-known country-wide.
===Kōshin&#x27;etsu===

Kōshin&#x27;etsu is an area of complex and high rugged mountains—often called the &quot;roof of Japan&quot;—that include the Japanese Alps. The population is chiefly concentrated in six elevated basins connected by narrow valleys. It was long a main silk-producing area, although output declined after World War II. Much of the labor formerly required in silk production was absorbed by the district&#x27;s diversified manufacturing industry, which included precision instruments, machinery, textiles, food processing, and other light manufacturing. Kōshin&#x27;etsu means Yamanashi, Nagano, and Niigata prefectures; Niigata is also included to the Hokuriku region. Yamanashi, Nagano and northern Gifu Prefecture are sometimes referred to as Chūō-kōchi or Tōsan region.
===Hokuriku===

The Hokuriku region lies on the Sea of Japan coastline, northwest of the massive mountains that comprise Kōshin&#x27;etsu. Hokuriku includes the four prefectures of Ishikawa, Fukui, most of Niigata and Toyama,

The district has very heavy snowfall (sometimes enough to block major roads) and strong winds in winter, and its turbulent rivers are the source of abundant hydroelectric power. Niigata Prefecture is the site of domestic gas and oil production as well. Industrial development is extensive, especially in the cities in Niigata and Toyama; Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures also have large manufacturing industries.

Historically, Hokuriku&#x27;s development is owed to markets in the Kansai region, however recently the urban areas at the heart of the Kantō region and Tōkai region are having a heavy an influence as well. Hokuriku has port facilities which are mainly to facilitate trade with Russia, Korea and China. Transportation between Niigata and Toyama used to be geographically limited and so Niigata has seen especially strong influence from the Kantō region, because of this Niigata Prefecture is often classified as being part of the Kōshin&#x27;etsu region with Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures.
== Demographics ==
The three most dense areas of Chūbu region are Chūkyō metropolitan area (greater Nagoya), Niigata-Toyama area at Hokuriku subregion, and Nagano at the mountains (Chūō-kōchi).

Per Japanese census data, and, Chūbu region has had positive population growth.

<doc id="61729" wikidata="Q81863" url="?curid=61729" title="Akita Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Tōhoku region of Honshu. Its population is estimated 915,691 as of 1 August 2023 and its geographic area is 11,637 km2 (4,493 sq mi). Akita Prefecture is bordered by Aomori Prefecture to the north, Iwate Prefecture to the east, Miyagi Prefecture to the southeast, and Yamagata Prefecture to the south.

Akita is the capital and largest city of Akita Prefecture. Other major cities include Yokote, Daisen, and Yurihonjō. Akita Prefecture is located on the coast of the Sea of Japan and extends east to the Ōu Mountains, the longest mountain range in Japan, at the border with Iwate Prefecture. Akita Prefecture formed the northern half of the historic Dewa Province with Yamagata Prefecture.

== History ==
The region of Akita was created from the ancient provinces of Dewa and Mutsu.

Separated from the principal Japanese centres of commerce, politics, and population by several hundred kilometres and by the Ōu and Dewa mountain ranges to the east, Akita remained largely isolated from Japanese society until after the year 600. Akita was a region of hunter-gatherers and principally nomadic tribes.

The first historical record of what is now Akita Prefecture dates to 658, when Abe no Hirafu conquered the native Ezo tribes at what are now the cities of Akita and Noshiro. Abe, then governor of Koshi Province (the northwestern part of Honshū bordering the Sea of Japan), established a fort on the Mogami River, and thus began the Japanese settlement of the region.

In 733, a new military settlement (later renamed Akita Castle) was built in what is now the Takashimizu area of Akita, and more permanent roads and structures were developed. The region was used as a base of operations for the Japanese empire as it drove the native Ezo people from northern Honshū.

Governance of the region shifted hands several times. During the Tokugawa shogunate it was appropriated to the Satake clan, who ruled the region for 260 years and developed the agriculture and mining industries that are still predominant today. Throughout this period, it was classified as part of Dewa Province. In 1871, during the Meiji Restoration, Dewa Province was reshaped and the old daimyō domains were abolished and administratively reconstructed, resulting in the modern-day borders of Akita.

The famous Heian period waka poet, Ono no Komachi, is said to have been born in Yuzawa City, Ogachi Town, located in the southeast of the prefecture.

== Geography ==


Located on the north-western side of Honshu, Akita Prefecture is adjacent to the Sea of Japan to the west and borders four other prefectures: Aomori in the north, Iwate in the east, Miyagi in the southeast, and Yamagata in the south.

The borders of Akita Prefecture roughly form a rectangle that is 169 kilometres (105 miles) from north to south and 86 kilometres (54 miles) from west to east. The Oga Peninsula is a prominent feature of the western edge, while the Ōu Mountains mark the eastern border and the higher Dewa Mountains run parallel through the center. Like much of northern Japan, the prefecture has cold winters, particularly in areas farther from the sea.

As of 31 March 2019, 11% of the total land area of the prefecture is designated as Natural Parks, namely the Towada-Hachimantai National Park; Chōkai, Kurikoma, and Oga Quasi-National Parks; and Akita Shirakami, Hachimori Iwadate, Kimimachizaka, Magi Mahiru, Moriyoshizan, Taiheizan, Tashirodake, and Tazawako Dakigaeri Prefectural Natural Parks.

== Economy and population ==
Like much of the Tōhoku Region, Akita&#x27;s economy remains dominated by traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing, and forestry. This has led many young people to migrate to Tokyo and other large cities. Akita Prefecture has seen some of the most severe population decline in Japan: it is one of four prefectures in Japan registering declines in population since 1955. Its population also has the lowest percentage of children (defined as under the age of 15), at 9.3% in 2022, down from 11.2% in 2010. 38.6% of residents are 65 or older, the highest percentage of any Japanese prefecture. As of October 1, 2022, it has an estimated population of 944,902 people.

The high rate of depopulation in Akita Prefecture has led smaller communities to merge with each other, which has affected the smallest of these merged communities. As depopulation in these communities continues, educational and health facilities have closed in some areas, encouraging families to migrate to larger cities for better access to health and educational opportunities and perpetuating the decline in population. This decline, combined with an aging population, has been concerning for rural communities.

==Culture==
Akita, 秋田, meaning autumn rice paddy, is famous for rice farming and its sake breweries. It is well known for having the highest consumption of sake in Japan and is thought to be the origin of the Akita breed of dog which carries the prefecture&#x27;s name. The women of the region, referred to as , have also gained widespread renown for their white skin, rounded faces and high voices, all of which are considered highly desirable. Ono no Komachi is a famous example of an &quot;Akita bijin&quot;.

=== Food ===

==Tourism==
Recently there have been efforts to revitalize rural communities facing depopulation with different forms of green tourism and agritourism. These efforts are primarily aimed at attracting urbanites and foreign tourists to Akita Prefecture, advertising its pristine forests, sprawling rice fields, and range of cultures. There has been a push for home stays, farmers markets for locally produced foods, and the integration of outsiders into local cultural practices. The Namahage ritual in Oga on New Year&#x27;s Eve draws a large number of tourists to Akita Prefecture every year.

Near Lake Tazawa, there are a number of hot springs resorts (&quot;onsen&quot;). These are popular with tourists from all over Japan. In addition, numerous seasonal festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;) offer a glimpse of rural or traditional Japan. Some famous examples are the Akita Kantō, the Omagari Fireworks, Namahage Festival, and the Yokote Kamakura Festivals.

Kakunodate, known as the little Kyoto, features many preserved samurai houses. The Aoyagi house is the former residence of Odano Naotake, who illustrated Japan&#x27;s first modern guide to human anatomy. The house is now a museum and gallery of medical illustrations and traditional crafts.

Starting in 2009, Akita began experiencing a huge surge in Korean tourism after the airing of the popular drama &quot;Iris&quot;, which featured several scenes shot in Akita, most notably at Lake Tazawa and Oga&#x27;s GAO Aquarium.

Aomori is one of Japan&#x27;s 62 core cities and the core of the Aomori metropolitan area.

==Etymology==

The original name of the Aomori was Utō, named for the , a seabird that is closely related to the puffin. In 1626 the name was changed to , but this was not fully embraced until 1783.

==History==

&quot;Aomori&quot; literally means blue forest, although it could possibly be translated as &quot;green forest&quot;. The name is generally considered to refer to a small forest on a hill which existed near the town. This forest was often used by fishermen as a landmark. A different theory suggests the name might have been derived from the Ainu language.

The area has been settled extensively since prehistoric times, and numerous Jōmon period sites have been found by archaeologists, the most famous being the Sannai-Maruyama Site located just southwest of the city center dating to 5500–4000 BC, and the Komakino Site slightly farther south dating to around 4000 BC. The large scale of these settlements revolutionized theories on Jōmon period civilization. During the Heian period, the area was part of the holdings of the Northern Fujiwara clan, but remained inhabited by the Emishi people well into the historic period. After the fall of the Northern Fujiwara in the Kamakura period, the territory was part of the domain assigned to the Nambu clan, and into the Sengoku period, it came under the control of the rival Tsugaru clan, whose main castle was located in Namioka. After the start of the Edo period, what would become the core of present-day Aomori was a minor port settlement in the Hirosaki Domain called . The town was rebuilt in 1626 under orders of the &quot;daimyō&quot;, Tsugaru Nobuhira and renamed &quot;Aomori&quot;, but this name did not come into common use until after 1783; however, the historical accuracy of this claim is debated since there is no written material from the time to definitively connect Utō to Aomori. Some evidence even claims that Aomori and Utō co-existed in different parts of the city in its current state. It was not until 1909 that a local scholar claimed that the village of Utō became Aomori.

After the Meiji Restoration, the feudal domains were abolished and replaced with prefectures, of which a total of six were initially created in the territory of modern Aomori Prefecture. These were merged into the short-lived Hirosaki Prefecture in July 1871. However, due to the historic enmity between the former Tsugaru territories in the west and the former Nambu territories in the east, the prefectural capital was relocated from Hirosaki to the more centrally-located Aomori immediately after the merger and the prefecture was renamed Aomori Prefecture on 23 September 1871. However, the municipality of Aomori was not given town status within Higashitsugaru District until 1 April 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was later designated as a city on 1 April 1898.

The Hokkaidō Colonization Office began operations of a ferry service from Aomori to Hakodate in Hokkaido from 1872. In September 1891, Aomori was connected with Tokyo by rail with the opening of the Tōhoku Main Line. The Ōu Main Line running along the Sea of Japan coast opened in December 1894. The development of modern Aomori was primarily due to its prefectural capital status and the singular importance as the terminus of these rail lines and the Seikan Ferry, which officially opened in 1908. The 8th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army were stationed in Aomori from 1896. In the winter of 1902, 199 of 210 soldiers on a military cold-weather readiness exercise perished while attempting to cross the Hakkōda Mountains from Aomori to Towada in what was later called the Hakkōda Mountains incident.

Much of the town burned down in a large fire on 3 May 1910. The port facilities were expanded in 1924, and the city received its first bus services in 1926. Japan Air Transport began scheduled air services from 1937.

Towards the final stages of World War II, on the night of 28–29 July 1945, Aomori was subject to an air raid as part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States against military and civilian targets and population centers during the Japan home islands campaign. The 28–29 July bombing claimed 1,767 lives and destroyed 88% of the city.

In the post-war period, Aomori was rebuilt as the local political and commercial center. The Tsugaru Line railway opened between Aomori Station and Kanita Station in 1951. Aomori Airport was opened in 1964 in nearby Namioka. The city was connected to Tokyo by highway in 1979 with the opening of the Tōhoku Expressway. Construction began on a new airport within the city of Aomori in 1982. Aomori&#x27;s landmark pyramidal Aomori Prefecture Tourist Center opened in 1986. The new airport was completed on 19 July 1987. On 1 October 2002, Aomori was proclaimed a core city, granting it an increased level of local autonomy.

On 1 April 2005, Aomori absorbed the town of Namioka to create the new and expanded city of Aomori; but lost a portion of Namioka to the town of Fujisaki (from Minamitsugaru District) on 1 September 2007.

In contrast, Sapporo&#x27;s heaviest snowfall which occurred in 1939 was , and Wakkanai which is located further north has recorded similar maxima. The particularly heavy snow is caused by several winds that collide around the city and make the air rise and cool, resulting in quick, thick cloud formation followed by intense precipitation.

In summer, a cool wind called &quot;Yamase&quot; often blows from the east, which sometimes results in abnormally cool weather and poor harvests. Additionally, thick fogs from the Oyashio Current are often observed in mountainous areas in the summer. Due to this fog, flights to Aomori Airport are often cancelled.
