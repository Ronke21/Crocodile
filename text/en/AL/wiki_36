<text>Ascaris lumbricoides is a large parasitic roundworm of the genus &quot;Ascaris.&quot; It is the most common parasitic worm in humans. An estimated 807 million–1.2 billion people are infected with &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; worldwide. People living in tropical and subtropical countries are at greater risk of infection. Infection by &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; is known as ascariasis.

It has been proposed that &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; and &quot;Ascaris suum&quot; (pig roundworm) are the same species.

==Life cycle==

&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;, a roundworm, infects humans via the fecal-oral route. Eggs released by adult females are shed in feces. Unfertilized eggs are often observed in fecal samples but never become infective. Fertilized eggs embryonate and become infectious after 18 days to several weeks in soil, depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil).

Infection occurs when a human swallows water or food contaminated with embryonated eggs. In the duodenum, a single rhabditiform larva hatches from each of the ingested eggs. The larvae then penetrate the mucosa and submucosa and enter the venules or lymphatic vessels. From there, the larvae then pass through the heart to enter the pulmonary circulation. The larvae then break through the walls of the pulmonary capillaries to enter the alveoli. The juvenile worms then migrate from the alveoli, through the bronchioles and bronchi, and into the trachea. An acute inflammatory reaction can occur if some of the worms get lost during this migration process and accumulate in other organs of the body.

Once in the trachea, the worms are coughed up into the pharynx and then swallowed again, after which they pass through the stomach and into the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms. The adult worms begin producing fertilized eggs within 60–65 days of being swallowed; females produce as many as 200,000 eggs per day for 12–18 months. These fertilized eggs become infectious after two weeks in soil; they can persist in soil for 10 years or more.

It might seem odd that the worms end up in the same place where they began. One hypothesis to account for this behavior is that the migration mimics an intermediate host, which would be required for juveniles of an ancestral form to develop to the third stage. Another possibility is that tissue migration enables faster growth and larger size, which increases reproductive capacity. The eggs have a lipid layer which makes them resistant to the effects of acids and alkalis, as well as other chemicals.

==Morphology==

&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; is characterized by its great size. Males are in diameter and long. The male&#x27;s posterior end is curved ventrally and has a bluntly pointed tail. Females are wide and long. The vulva is located in the anterior end and accounts for about one-third of its body length. Uteri may contain up to 27 million eggs at a time, with 200,000 being laid per day. Fertilized eggs are oval to round in shape and are long and wide with a thick outer shell. Unfertilized eggs measure long and wide.

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 807 million–1.2 billion people are infected with &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; worldwide. While infection occurs throughout most of the world, ascariasis is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China, and east Asia. Although the prevalence is low in the United States, ascariasis is still endemic in the southeastern United States due to the temperature and humid climate.

&quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; eggs are extremely resistant to strong chemicals, desiccation, and low temperatures. The eggs can remain viable in soil for months or even years. Eggs of &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; have been identified in coprolites in the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and New Zealand, the oldest ones being more than 24,000 years old.

==Infections==

Infections with these parasites are more common where sanitation is poor, and raw human feces are used as fertilizer.

===Symptoms===
Often, no symptoms are presented with a minor &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; infection, the inevitable consequence being the e.g. once a year passage of such clearly visible worm(s) on close inspection. In the case of bad infections symptoms commonly include bloody sputum, cough, fever, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ulcer(s), as well as a less commonly missed passing of the quite long worms. Ascariasis is the most common cause of Löffler&#x27;s syndrome worldwide. Accompanying pathological symptoms include pulmonary infiltration, eosinophilia (symptoms of the overabundance of eosinophils in the blood such as asthma and allergic reactions), and a diagnostic symptom is, aside from standard microscopy of stools, radiographic opacities. One study has observed increases in fertility in infected women, in a similar vein to good diet and exercise, but with all of the pathological negatives and discomforts the disease carries with it, varying from host to host and again with diet.

===Distribution===
&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. It is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia (including countries like India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia), and parts of Latin America, where inadequate sanitation infrastructure and the use of human faeces as fertilizer contribute to its spread.

===Prevention===
Preventing any fecal-borne disease requires educated hygienic habits/culture and effective fecal treatment systems. This is particularly important with &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; because its eggs are one of the most difficult pathogens to kill (second only to prions), and the eggs commonly survive 1–3 years. &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; lives in the intestine where it lays eggs. Infection occurs when the eggs, too small to be seen by the unaided eye, are eaten. The eggs may get onto vegetables when improperly processed human feces of infected people are used as fertilizer for food crops. Infection may occur when food is handled without removing or killing the eggs on the hands, clothes, hair, raw vegetables/fruit, or cooked food that is (re)infected by handlers, containers, etc. Bleach does not readily kill &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; eggs, but it will remove their sticky film, to allow the eggs to be rinsed away. &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; eggs can be reduced by hot composting methods, but to completely kill them may require rubbing alcohol, iodine, specialized chemicals, cooking heat, or &quot;unusually&quot; hot composting (for example, over for 24 hours).

===Treatment===

Control of roundworm infections is based on treatment with medication, improved sanitation and health education. This usually takes around three days.

==History==
Giant intestinal roundworms have been known since antiquity. In 1758 Linnaeus named them &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;. For many centuries, they were thought to arise by spontaneous generation. In 1855, &quot;Ascaris&quot; eggs were found in human faeces by Henry Ransom in England then this was described in the literature two years later by Casimir-Joseph Davaine in France. Attempts to infect animals by feeding them eggs were unsuccessful. In 1886, Salvatore Calandruccio in Italy successfully infected a boy to whom he had given 150 eggs. Battista Grassi published this information without giving any acknowledgement to Calandruccio. Development was thought to occur directly within the bowel lumen but Francis Stewart in Hong Kong in 1916 fed eggs to rats, then later mice, and found infective larvae in the faeces and in the lungs but no mature worms. In 1918, Sadao Yoshida ingested larvae recovered from the trachea of a guinea pig, then found eggs in his own stools 76 days later. In 1922, Shimesu Koino ingested 2,000 &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; eggs, found larvae in his sputum a few days later, then after 50 days took an anthelmintic and recovered 667 immature &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;, thus confirming the life cycle.

<doc id="60211" wikidata="Q1154414" url="?curid=60211" title="Trichuris trichiura">
<text>Trichuris trichiura,Trichocephalus trichiuris or whipworm, is a parasitic roundworm (a type of helminth) that causes trichuriasis (a type of helminthiasis which is one of the neglected tropical diseases) when it infects a human large intestine. It is commonly known as the &quot;whipworm&quot; which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a whip with wider &quot;handles&quot; at the posterior end. The helminth is also known to cause rectal prolapse.

== Life cycle ==
The female &quot;T. trichiura&quot; produces 2,000–10,000 single-celled eggs per day. Eggs are deposited from human feces to soil where, after two to three weeks, they become embryonated and enter the &quot;infective&quot; stage. These embryonated infective eggs are ingested by hand-mouth or through fomites and hatch in the human small intestine, exploiting the intestinal microflora as a stimulus to hatching. This is the location of growth and molting. The infective larvae penetrate the villi and continue to develop in the small intestine. The young worms move to the caecum and penetrate the mucosa, and there they complete development as adult worms in the large intestine. The life cycle from the time of ingestion of eggs to the development of mature worms takes approximately three months. During this time, there may be limited signs of infection in stool samples, due to a lack of egg production and shedding. The female &quot;T. trichiura&quot; begin to lay eggs after three months of maturity. Worms commonly live for about one year, during which time females can lay up to 20,000 eggs per day.

Recent studies using genome-wide scanning revealed that two quantitative trait loci on chromosome 9 and chromosome 18 may be responsible for a genetic predisposition or susceptibility to infection of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; by some individuals.

==Morphology==
&quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; has a narrow anterior esophageal end and shorter and thicker posterior end. These pinkish-white worms are threaded through the mucosa. They attach to the host through their slender anterior end and feed on tissue secretions instead of blood. Females are larger than males; approximately 35–50 mm long compared to 30–45 mm. The females have a bluntly round posterior end compared to their male counterparts with a coiled posterior end. Their characteristic eggs are barrel-shaped and brown, and have bipolar protuberances.

==Infection==

Trichuriasis, also known as &quot;whipworm infection,&quot; occurs through ingestion of whipworm eggs and is more common in warmer climates. Whipworm eggs are passed in the feces of infected persons, and if an infected person defecates outdoors or if untreated human feces is used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil where they can mature into an infective stage. Ingestion of these eggs &quot;can happen when hands or fingers that have contaminated dirt on them are put in the mouth or by consuming vegetables or fruits that have not been carefully cooked, washed or peeled.&quot; The eggs hatch in the small intestine, then move into the wall of the small intestine and develop. On reaching adulthood, the thinner end (the anterior of the worm) burrows into the large intestine, the thicker (posterior) end projecting into the lumen, where it mates with nearby worms. The females can grow to long.

&quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; can cause the serious disease Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS), with chronic dysentery, anemia, rectal prolapse, and poor growth. TDS is treated with anthelminthics as well as iron supplementation for anemia.

Whipworm commonly infects patients also infected with &quot;Giardia&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;, and hookworms.

==Treatment==
&quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; can be treated with a single dose of albendazole. In Kenya, half of a group of children, 98% of whom had &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; with or without infections by other soil-transmitted helminths, were given albendazole, while the other half of the children received placebos. It was found that the children who received the drug grew significantly better than the group of children who did not receive the treatment. Another treatment that can be used is mebendazole, or flubendazole. The medication interferes with the parasite’s nutrient intake, which eventually leads to death. 

However, it has been shown that both albendazole and mebendazole have low cure rate for &quot;Trichuris thrichiura&quot; specifically, with treatments only achieving cure rates 30,7% for albendazole and 42,1% for mebendazole.

==Epidemiology==
There is a worldwide distribution of &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;, with an estimated one billion human infections. However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America. Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2.2 million people are thought to be infected. Poor hygiene is associated with trichuriasis as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated. Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk. Eggs are infective about 2–3 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution.

A closely related species, &quot;Trichuris suis&quot;, which typically infects pigs, is capable of infecting humans. This shows that the two species have very close evolutionary histories. However, morphology and developmental stages remain different, making them two separate species.

WHO have since 2001 had a strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminths, including whipworms. This strategy entails treating at-risk individuals in the endemic areas. Risk groups for whipworm infections are children at preschool and school-aged children, people with specific high-risk jobs, women in reproductive and pregnant and breastfeeding women. The periodic treatment of the risk groups is done through either deworming campaigns or preventative chemotherapy.

==Treatment of inflammatory disorders==

The hygiene hypothesis suggests that various immunological disorders that have been observed in humans only within the last 100 years, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease, or that have become more common during that period as hygienic practices have become more widespread, may result from a lack of exposure to parasitic worms (helminths) during childhood. The use of &quot;Trichuris suis&quot; ova (TSO, or pig whipworm eggs) by Weinstock, et al., as a therapy for treating Crohn&#x27;s disease and to a lesser extent ulcerative colitis are two examples that support this hypothesis. There is also anecdotal evidence that treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with TSO decreases the incidence of asthma, allergy, and other inflammatory disorders. Some scientific evidence suggests that the course of multiple sclerosis may be very favorably altered by helminth infection; TSO is being studied as a treatment for this disease.

<doc id="60212" wikidata="Q244111" url="?curid=60212" title="Strongyloides stercoralis">
<text>Strongyloides stercoralis is a human pathogenic parasitic roundworm causing the disease strongyloidiasis. Its common name in the US is threadworm. In the UK and Australia, however, the term &quot;threadworm&quot; can also refer to nematodes of the genus &quot;Enterobius&quot;, otherwise known as pinworms.

The &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot; nematode can parasitize humans. The adult parasitic stage lives in tunnels in the mucosa of the small intestine. The genus &quot;Strongyloides&quot; contains 53 species, and &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; is the type species. &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; has been reported in other mammals, including cats and dogs. However, it seems that the species in dogs is typically not &quot;S. stercoralis&quot;, but the related species &quot;S. canis&quot;. Non-human primates are more commonly infected with &quot;S. fuelleborni&quot; and &quot;S. cebus&quot;, although &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; has been reported in captive primates. Other species of &quot;Strongyloides&quot; that are naturally parasitic in humans, but with restricted distributions, are &quot;S. fuelleborni fuelleborni&quot; in central Africa and &quot;S. fuelleborni kellyi&quot; in Papua New Guinea.

==Geographic distribution==
&quot;S. stercoralis&quot; infection is associated with fecal contamination of soil or water. Hence, it is a very rare infection in developed economies. In developing countries, it is less prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas (where sanitation standards are poor). &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; can be found in areas with tropical and subtropical climates.

Strongyloidiasis was first described in the 19th century in French soldiers returning home from expeditions in Indochina. Today, the countries of the old Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) still have endemic strongyloidiasis, with the typical prevalences being 10% or less. Regions of Japan used to have endemic strongyloidiasis, but control programs have eliminated the disease. Strongyloidiasis appears to have a high prevalence in some areas of Brazil and Central America. It is endemic in Africa, but the prevalence is typically low (1% or less). Pockets have been reported from rural Italy, but the current status is unknown. In the Pacific islands, strongyloidiasis is rare, although some cases have been reported from Fiji. In tropical Australia, some rural and remote Australian Aboriginal communities have very high prevalences of strongyloidiasis.

In some African countries (e.g., Congo), &quot;S. fuelleborni&quot; was more common than &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; in parasite surveys from the 1970s, but the current status is unknown. In Papua New Guinea, &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; is endemic, but prevalence is low. However, in some areas, another species, &quot;S. kellyi&quot;, is a very common parasite of children in the New Guinea Highlands and Western Province.

Knowledge of the geographic distribution of strongyloidiasis is of significance to travelers who may acquire the parasite during their stays in endemic areas.

Because strongyloidiasis could theoretically be transmittable through unsanitary bedclothes care must be taken never to use unclean hotel bed sheets in endemic areas. Using plastic slippers when showering may be very important when travelling in tropical regions.

Estimates of the number of people infected vary with one estimate putting the figure at 370 million worldwide. Local prevalence can exceed 40% in some tropical and subtropical countries.

==Life cycle==
The life cycle of this parasite is more complex than that of most nematodes, with its alternation between free-living and parasitic cycles, and its potential for autoinfection (the parasite has the ability to complete its life cycle without the involvement of another host) and multiplication within the host. The parasitic cycle is homogonic, while the free-living cycle is heterogonic. The heterogonic life cycle is advantageous to the parasite because it allows reproduction in the absence of a host.

In the free-living cycle, the rhabditiform larvae passed in the stool can either molt twice and become infective filariform larvae (direct development) or molt four times and become free-living adult males and females that mate and produce eggs from which rhabditiform larvae hatch. In the direct development, first-stage larvae (L1) transform into infective larvae (IL) via three molts. The indirect route results first in the development of free-living adults that mate; the female lays eggs, which hatch and then develop into IL. The direct route gives IL faster (three days) versus the indirect route (seven to 10 days). However, the indirect route results in an increase in the number of IL produced. Speed of development of IL is traded for increased numbers. The free-living males and females of &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; die after one generation; they do not persist in the soil. The latter, in turn, can either develop into a new generation of free-living adults or develop into infective filariform larvae. The filariform larvae penetrate the human host skin to initiate the parasitic cycle.
Upon contact with contaminated soil, infectious larvae contained in the soil can penetrate the skin. 

Some of the larvae enter the superficial veins and are carried in the blood to the lungs, where they enter the alveoli. They are then coughed up and swallowed into the gut, where they parasitise the intestinal mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. In the small intestine, they molt twice and become adult female worms. The females live threaded in the epithelium of the small intestine and, by parthenogenesis, produce eggs, which yield rhabditiform larvae. Only females will reach reproductive adulthood in the intestine. Female strongyloids reproduce through parthenogenesis. The eggs hatch in the intestine and young larvae are then excreted in the feces. It takes about two weeks to reach egg development from the initial skin penetration. By this process, &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; can cause both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worms also participate in autoinfection, in which the rhabditiform larvae become infective filariform larvae, which can penetrate either the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perianal area (external autoinfection); in either case, the filariform larvae may follow the previously described route, being carried successively to the lungs, the bronchial tree, the pharynx, and the small intestine, where they mature into adults; or they may disseminate widely in the body. To date, occurrence of autoinfection in humans with helminthic infections is recognized only in &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot; and &quot;Capillaria philippinensis&quot; infections. In the case of &quot;Strongyloides&quot;, autoinfection may explain the possibility of persistent infections for many years in persons not having been in an endemic area and of hyperinfections in immunodepressed individuals.

&quot;Strongyloides&quot; is thought to be attracted to humans via paired thermosensory neurons. While &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; is attracted to chemicals such as carbon dioxide or sodium chloride, these chemicals are not specific. Larvae have been thought to locate their hosts via chemicals in the skin, the predominant one being urocanic acid, a histidine metabolite on the uppermost layer of skin that is removed by sweat or the daily skin-shedding cycle. Urocanic acid concentrations can achieve at least fivefold greater levels on the foot sole than any other part of the human body.

==Zoonotic transmission==
Dogs can act as a host for this parasite both in the wild and in the laboratory, but transmission from dog to human has been difficult to prove. Molecular genetic analyses have shown that there are two populations of this parasite in dogs, one of which (type B) is exclusive to dogs and a second (type A) that is common to dogs and humans. These two genotypes may be separate species. The identity of the genes suggests that dog to human transmission may occur.

==Morphology==
Whereas males grow to only about in length, females can grow from . Both sexes also possess a tiny buccal capsule and cylindrical esophagus without a posterior bulb. In the free-living stage, the esophagi of both sexes are rhabditiform. Males can be distinguished from females by two structures: the spicules and gubernaculum.

==Autoinfection==
An unusual feature of &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; is autoinfection. Only one other species in the genus &quot;Strongyloides&quot;, &quot;S. felis&quot;, has this trait. Autoinfection is the development of L1 into small infective larvae in the gut of the host. These autoinfective larvae penetrate the wall of the lower ileum or colon or the skin of the perianal region, enter the circulation again, travel to the lungs, and then to the small intestine, thus repeating the cycle. Autoinfection makes strongyloidiasis due to &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; an infection with several unusual features.

Persistence of infection is the first of these important features. Because of autoinfection, humans have been known to still be infected up to 65 years after they were first exposed to the parasite (e.g., World War II or Vietnam War veterans). Once a host is infected with &quot;S. stercoralis&quot;, infection is lifelong unless effective treatment eliminates all adult parasites and migrating autoinfective larvae.

==Symptoms==

Many people infected are asymptomatic at first. Symptoms include dermatitis: swelling, itching, larva currens, and mild hemorrhage at the site where the skin has been penetrated. Spontaneous scratch-like lesions may be seen on the face or elsewhere. If the parasite reaches the lungs, the chest may feel as if it is burning, and wheezing and coughing may result, along with pneumonia-like symptoms (Löffler&#x27;s syndrome). The intestines could eventually be invaded, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, sepsis, and ulcers. Stools may have yellow mucus with a recognizable smell. Chronic diarrhea can be a symptom. In severe cases, edema may result in obstruction of the intestinal tract, as well as loss of peristaltic contractions.

Strongyloidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is usually an indolent disease. However, in immunocompromised individuals, it can cause a hyperinfective syndrome (also called disseminated strongyloidiasis) due to the reproductive capacity of the parasite inside the host. This hyperinfective syndrome can have a mortality rate close to 90% if disseminated.

Immunosuppressive drugs, especially corticosteroids and agents used for tissue transplantation, can increase the rate of autoinfection to the point where an overwhelming number of larvae migrate through the lungs, which in many cases can prove fatal. In addition, diseases such as human T-lymphotropic virus 1, which enhance the Th1 arm of the immune system and lessen the Th2 arm, increase the disease state. Another consequence of autoinfection is the autoinfective larvae can carry gut bacteria back into the body. About 50% of people with hyperinfection present with bacterial disease due to enteric bacteria. Also, a unique effect of autoinfective larvae is larva currens due to the rapid migration of the larvae through the skin. Larva currens appears as a red line that moves rapidly (more than per day), and then quickly disappears. It is pathognomonic for autoinfective larvae and can be used as a diagnostic criterion for strongyloidiasis due to &quot;S. stercoralis&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Locating juvenile larvae, either rhabditiform or filariform, in recent stool samples will confirm the presence of this parasite. Other techniques used include direct fecal smears, culturing fecal samples on agar plates, serodiagnosis through ELISA, and duodenal fumigation. Still, diagnosis can be difficult because of the day-to-day variation in juvenile parasite load.

==Prevention==
Ideally, prevention, by improved sanitation (proper disposal of feces), practicing good hygiene (washing of hands), etc., is used before any drug regimen is administered.

==Treatment==
Ivermectin is the drug of choice for treatment, due to its low side effect profile. Albendazole is also effective in treating strongyloidiasis. Mebendazole has a much higher failure rate in clinical practice than albendazole or ivermectin. However, these drugs have little effect on the autoinfective larvae. Hence, repeat treatments with ivermectin or albendazole must be administered to kill newly matured parasites that have developed from the autoinfective larvae. This means a full treatment dose every two weeks until all larvae capable of maturing into adults have been extirpated. Follow-up stool samples, potential additional treatment, and blood tests are necessary to ensure a cure.

==Chemoattractant==
This parasite depends on chemical cues to find a potential host. It uses sensor neurons of class AFD to identify cues excreted by the host.&quot; S. stercoralis&quot; is attracted to nonspecific attractants of warmth, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride. Urocanic acid, a component of skin secretions in mammals, is a major chemoattractant. Larvae of &quot;S. stercoralis&quot; are strongly attracted to this compound. This compound can be suppressed by metal ions, suggesting a possible strategy for preventing infection.

<text>Robert Curthose ( – February 1134, ), was the eldest son of William the Conqueror and succeeded his father as Robert II of Normandy in 1087, reigning until 1106. 

Robert was also an unsuccessful pretender to the throne of the Kingdom of England. The epithet &quot;Curthose&quot; originated in the Norman French word &quot;courtheuse&quot; (&quot;short stockings&quot;). The chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Orderic Vitalis wrote that his father had derisively called him &quot;brevis-ocrea&quot; (&quot;short boot&quot;).

Robert&#x27;s reign is noted for the discord with his brothers William II and Henry I in England. He mortgaged his duchy to finance his participation in the First Crusade, where he was an important commander. In 1106, his disagreements with Henry led to defeat in the Battle of Tinchebray and lifelong captivity, with Normandy temporarily absorbed into England&#x27;s possession.

==Early life==

Robert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England and Matilda of Flanders. Estimates of Robert&#x27;s birth-date range between 1051 and 1053. As a child he was betrothed to Margaret, the heiress of Maine, but she died before they could wed, and Robert did not marry until his late forties. In his youth he was courageous and skilful in military exercises. He was also prone to laziness and weakness of character that discontented nobles and the King of France exploited to stir discord with his father. He was unsatisfied with the share of power allotted to him and quarrelled with his father and brothers fiercely. In 1063, his father made him the Count of Maine in view of his engagement to Margaret, and Robert may have ruled independently in Maine. The county remained under Norman control until 1069, when the county revolted and reverted to Hugh V of Maine.

In 1077, Robert instigated his first insurrection against his father as the result of a prank played by his younger brothers William Rufus and Henry, who had dumped a full chamber pot over his head. Robert was enraged and, urged on by his companions, started a brawl with his brothers that was only interrupted by the intercession of their father. Feeling that his dignity was wounded, Robert was further angered when King William failed to punish his brothers. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize the castle of Rouen. The siege failed, but, when King William ordered their arrest, Robert and his companions took refuge with Hugh of Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. They were forced to flee again when King William attacked their base at Rémalard.

== Exile ==

Robert fled to Flanders to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders before plundering the county of the Vexin and causing such mayhem that his father, King William, allied himself with King Philip I of France to stop his rebellious son. Relations were not helped when King William discovered that his wife, Robert&#x27;s mother Queen Matilda, was secretly sending him money. At a battle in January 1079, Robert is said to have unhorsed King William in combat and succeeded in wounding him, only stopping his attack when he recognised his father&#x27;s voice. Humiliated, King William cursed his son. King William then raised the siege and returned to Rouen.

At Easter 1080, father and son were reunited by the efforts of Queen Matilda, and a truce between the two lasted until she died in 1083. Robert seems to have left court soon after the death of his mother and spent several years travelling throughout France, Germany, and Flanders. He visited Italy seeking the hand of the great heiress Matilda of Tuscany (b. 1046) but was unsuccessful. During this period as a wandering knight Robert sired several illegitimate children. His son Richard seems to have spent much of his life at the royal court of his uncle William Rufus. This Richard was killed in a hunting accident in the New Forest in 1100, as was his uncle, King William Rufus, the same year. An illegitimate daughter was later married to Helias of Saint-Saens.

== Reign as Duke of Normandy ==
In 1087, the elder William died of wounds suffered from a riding accident during a siege of Mantes. At his death he reportedly wanted to disinherit his eldest son but was persuaded to instead divide the Norman dominions between his two eldest sons. To Robert he granted the Duchy of Normandy and to William Rufus he granted the Kingdom of England. The youngest son, Henry, was given money to buy land. Of the two elder sons Robert was considered to be much weaker and was generally preferred by the nobles who held lands on both sides of the English Channel since they could more easily circumvent his authority.

When their father died, the two brothers agreed to be each other&#x27;s heirs. This agreement lasted less than a year, when barons joined with Robert to displace Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. It failed in part because Robert never showed up to support the English rebels.

Robert took on Ranulf Flambard as his adviser, who had been previously a close adviser to his father. Flambard later became an astute but much-disliked financial adviser to William Rufus until the latter&#x27;s death in 1100.

== First Crusade and return ==
In 1096, Robert formed an army and left Normandy to join the First Crusade to aid the Byzantine Empire against the Seljuk Turks and travel to Jerusalem. To raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William for the sum of 10,000 marks. 

Robert joined forces with his cousin, Count Robert of Flanders, brother-in-law, Count Stephen of Blois, and travelled together to Italy where he stayed in Norman Apulia during the winter of 1096/97. It is then that he most likely met his future wife, Sybil of Conversano, daughter of the wealthy Norman count of Conversano, Geoffrey, and according to Orderic he fell in love with her.

Crossing from Brindisi to the city of Dyrrachium in the Byzantine Empire on 5 April 1097, Robert and his army marched along the Via Egnatia and past Ohrid, Thessaloniki and the Aegean coast of Thrace on their way to Constantinople. Robert and Stephen were the last leading nobles to arrive at the gathering point in Constantinople in May of 1097 but were nonetheless welcomed with great respect by Emperor Alexios and memories of Robert&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s visit to Constantinople during his own pilgrimage to Jerusalem were reignited. Both then swore, as had the other crusading leaders except for Raymond of Toulouse, an oath to restore all cities that had been in Byzantine possession to Alexios and honour his superior status.

In the first week of June 1097 Robert and Stephen joined the main forces of the crusading army who at this point were besieging Nicaea which was successfully conquered on the 19th of June. At the Battle of Dorylaeum on 1 July, the crusader vanguard led by Robert and Bohemond of Taranto were ambushed and surrounded by the Seljuk Turks. After a heavy cavalry charge failed to disperse them, the Normans formed a defensive circle and held the line for hours in the hot summer sun until the rest of the army arrived, surrounding the Turks and forcing them to flee after inflicting heavy casualties. Robert then participated in the brutal Siege of Antioch and commanded the Normans and English in the first line alongside Robert of Flanders at the subsequent Battle of Antioch in which a huge Muslim relief army was defeated. After months spent languishing at Antioch, Robert joined Raymond of Toulouse and Tancred in pressing on to Jerusalem on 13 January 1099 after the former paid Robert to join him. Together they advanced down the Mediterranean coast and laid siege to Arqa in February but were met with failure and left on 13 May 1099 and went to Jerusalem, finally arriving outside its walls on 7 June. Robert left Raymond&#x27;s service during the siege on Jerusalem and instead joined Godfrey of Bouillon. As the crusaders lacked the necessary materials, Robert was sent out to gather wood to aid in the construction of siege towers. He was among the crusaders that captured Jerusalem on 15 July 1099. He also took on a prominent role in the final battle of the crusade at Ascalon on 12 August 1099 as one of the commanders of the crusader centre, personally killing the Egyptian standard-bearer and capturing the tent of the Egyptian commander, Al-Afdal. The fulfilment of his crusader vows was a personal triumph for Robert: he had shown military skills as well as the ability to mediate between different factions in the crusading forces.

Robert left the Holy Land around September 1099 and sailed to Constantinople, where Emperor Alexios showered him with gifts, for he was one of the few crusade leaders to have kept the oath he had made back in 1096, and offered him to enter into the service of the Byzantine Empire, but Robert declined. Instead, he travelled again to Southern Italy where he wintered again and married Sybil which also brought him a big dowry which enabled him to raise the necessary funds to buy back his duchy. When William II died on 2 August 1100, Robert was still on the return journey and absent from Normandy and would not arrive until September, allowing his other brother Henry was to seize the crown of England for himself.

Upon his return, Robert—urged by Flambard and several Anglo-Norman barons—claimed the English crown, on the basis of the short-lived agreement of 1087, and in July 1101 led an invasion to oust his brother Henry. He landed near Portsmouth with his army, but the lack of popular support among the English (Anselm, the archbishop of Canterbury, was decidedly against him and the Charter of Liberties issued at Henry&#x27;s coronation was well-liked) as well as Robert&#x27;s own mishandling of the invasion tactics enabled Henry to resist the invasion. Robert was forced by diplomacy to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. Orderic claimed that Robert squandered his wealth and became so poor that he had nothing to wear, but this seems unlikely given that Robert would have been reduced to penury so short after his return and might rather refer to his pre-Crusade persona.

== Imprisonment and death ==

In 1105, Robert&#x27;s continual stirring of discord with his brother in England, as well as civil disorder in Normandy, prompted Henry to invade Normandy. Orderic reports on an incident at Easter 1105 when Robert was supposed to hear a sermon by the venerable Serlo, Bishop of Sées. Robert spent the night before sporting with harlots and jesters, and while he lay in bed sleeping off his drunkenness his unworthy friends stole his clothes. He awoke to find himself naked and had to remain in bed and missed the sermon.

In 1106, Henry defeated Robert&#x27;s army decisively at the Battle of Tinchebray and claimed Normandy as a possession of the English crown, a situation that endured for almost a century. Captured after the battle, Robert was imprisoned in Devizes Castle in Wiltshire for twenty years before being moved to Cardiff.

In 1134, Robert died in Cardiff Castle in his early eighties. Robert Curthose, sometime Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the Conqueror, was buried in the abbey church of St Peter in Gloucester. The exact place of his burial is difficult to establish—legend states that he requested to be buried before the High Altar. His effigy carved in bog oak adorns a mortuary chest decorated with the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies (missing one—Joshua, and replaced with the arms of Edward the Confessor). The effigy dates from about 100 years after his death and the mortuary chest much later. The church subsequently became Gloucester Cathedral.

==Descendants==
Robert married Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Brindisi, Count of Conversano (and a grandniece of Robert Guiscard, another Norman duke) on the way back from Crusade; they had one child:

William Clito, was born 25 October 1102 and became heir to the Duchy of Normandy. William Clito was unlucky all his life; his attempts to invade Normandy failed twice (1119 and 1125), his first marriage to a daughter of the Count of Anjou was annulled by his uncle&#x27;s machinations, and even his late inheritance of the county of Flanders was mishandled. William Clito died in 1128 leaving no issue, thus leaving the field clear in the Norman succession (at least until the death of Henry I).

Sybilla, who was admired and often praised by chroniclers of the time, died shortly after the birth of her son. William of Malmesbury says she died as a result of binding her breasts too tightly; both Robert of Torigny and Orderic Vitalis suggest she was murdered by a cabal of noblewomen led by her husband&#x27;s mistress, Agnes Giffard.

Robert also had at least three illegitimate children: Richard, who died hunting in the New Forest in May 1100; William, a full brother of Richard; and a daughter, who married Helias of Saint-Saëns. William went to the Holy Land after 1106 and was named lord of Tortosa, but disappears from the historical record after 1110.

<doc id="60215" wikidata="Q735319" url="?curid=60215" title="The Forsyte Saga">
<text>The Forsyte Saga, first published under that title in 1922, is a series of three novels and two interludes published between 1906 and 1921 by the English author John Galsworthy, who won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature. They chronicle the vicissitudes of the leading members of a large upper-middle-class English family that is similar to Galsworthy&#x27;s. Only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors, its members are keenly aware of their status as &quot;new money&quot;. The main character, the solicitor and connoisseur Soames Forsyte, sees himself as a &quot;man of property&quot; by virtue of his ability to accumulate material possessions, but that does not succeed in bringing him pleasure.

Separate sections of the saga, as well as the lengthy story in its entirety, have been adapted for cinema and television. &quot;The Man of Property&quot;, the first book, was adapted in 1949 by Hollywood as &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot;, starring Errol Flynn, Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, and Robert Young. In 1967, the BBC produced a popular 26-part serial that dramatised &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; and a subsequent trilogy concerning the Forsytes, &quot;A Modern Comedy&quot;. In 2002 Granada Television produced two series for the ITV network: &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; and &quot;The Forsyte Saga: To Let&quot;. Both made runs in the US as parts of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. In 2003, &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; was listed as #123 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novel&quot;.

Following &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, Galsworthy wrote two more trilogies and several more interludes based around the titular family. The resulting series is collectively titled The Forsyte Chronicles.

==Books==

===&quot;The Man of Property&quot; (1906)===
In this first novel of the &quot;Forsyte Saga&quot;, after introducing us to the impressive array of Forsytes headed by the formidable Aunt Ann, Galsworthy moves into the main action of the saga by detailing Soames Forsyte&#x27;s desire to own things, including his beautiful wife, Irene Forsyte (née Heron). The character of Irene is based upon Galsworthy&#x27;s wife Ada Galsworthy. Forsyte is jealous of her friendships and wants her to be his alone. He concocts a plan to move her to a house he is having built at Robin Hill, away from everyone she knows and cares for. She resists his grasping intentions, and falls in love with the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been engaged by Soames to build the house. Bosinney returns her love, although he is the fiancé of her young friend June Forsyte, the daughter of Soames&#x27;s estranged cousin &quot;Young&quot; Jolyon. There is no happy ending: Irene leaves Soames after he asserts what he perceives to be his ultimate right on his property by raping her, and Bosinney dies under the wheels of a bus after being driven frantic by the news of the rape.

=== &quot;Indian Summer of a Forsyte&quot; (1918)===
In a short interlude after &quot;The Man of Property&quot; Galsworthy delves into the newfound friendship between Irene and Old Jolyon Forsyte (June&#x27;s grandfather, now the owner of the house Soames had built). This attachment gives Old Jolyon pleasure, but exhausts his strength. He leaves Irene money in his will, with Young Jolyon, his son, as trustee. In the end Old Jolyon dies under an ancient oak tree in the garden of the Robin Hill house.

===&quot;In Chancery&quot; (1920)===
The marital discord of both Soames and his sister Winifred is the subject of the second novel (the title refers to the Court of Chancery, which dealt with domestic issues). They take steps to divorce their spouses, Irene and Montague Dartie respectively. However, while Soames tells his sister to brave the consequences of going to court, he is unwilling to go through a divorce. Instead he stalks and hounds Irene, follows her abroad, and asks her to have his child, which was his father&#x27;s wish.

Irene inherits £15,000 after Old Jolyon&#x27;s death. His son, Young Jolyon Forsyte, also Soames&#x27;s cousin, manages Irene&#x27;s finances. When she first leaves Soames, Young Jolyon offers his support. By the time his son Jolly dies in the South African War, Irene has developed a strong friendship with Jolyon. Then Soames confronts young Jolyon and Irene at Robin Hill, falsely accusing them of having an affair. Young Jolyon and Irene assert that they have had an affair because Soames has it in his mind already. This statement gives Soames the evidence he needs for divorce proceedings. That confrontation sparks an eventual consummation between young Jolyon and Irene, leading to their marriage once the divorce is final and the birth of a son Jolyon &quot;Jon&quot; Forsyte. Soames marries Annette, the young daughter of a French Soho restaurant owner. With his new wife, he has his only child, a daughter named Fleur Forsyte.

===&quot;Awakening&quot; (1920)===
The subject of the second interlude is the naive and exuberant lifestyle of eight-year-old Jon Forsyte. He loves and is loved by his parents. He has an idyllic youth, and his every desire indulged.

===&quot;To Let&quot; (1921)===
This novel concludes the Forsyte Saga. Second cousins Fleur and Jon Forsyte meet and fall in love, ignorant of their parents&#x27; past troubles, indiscretions and misdeeds. Once Soames, Jolyon, and Irene discover their romance, they forbid their children to see each other again. Irene and Jolyon also fear that Fleur is too much like her father, and once she has Jon in her grasp, will want to possess him entirely. Despite her feelings for Jon, Fleur has a very suitable suitor, Michael Mont, heir to a baronetcy, who has fallen in love with her. If they marry, Fleur would elevate the status of her family from &quot;nouveau riche&quot; to the aristocratic upper class. The title derives from Soames&#x27; reflections as he breaks up the house in which his Uncle Timothy, recently deceased in 1920 at age 101 and the last of the older generation of Forsytes, had lived a recluse, hoarding his life like property.

Knowing he is soon to die from a weak heart, Jolyon writes a letter to Jon, detailing the events of Irene&#x27;s marriage to Soames, including her love affair with Philip Bosinney and Soames&#x27;s rape of her and warns him that Irene would be alone if he were to marry Fleur. But while Jon reads the letter, Jolyon suddenly dies of a heart attack, and Jon is left torn between the past and his present love for Fleur. He ultimately rejects Fleur, breaking his own heart as well as hers, and leaves for Canada. Fleur marries Michael Mont, though she knows she doesn&#x27;t love him. With her marriage, Soames is separated from the only person whom he has truly loved. Irene also leaves for Canada, selling the house at Robin Hill. Soames and Irene briefly exchange glances at a distance and a kind of peace is made between them, but Soames is left contemplating all that he never really had but tried to possess.

==Adaptations==

===Twentieth century===

====Silent films====
The book was filmed in 1920 and 1922. There was also a silent film adaptation of &quot;The White Monkey&quot; (1925).

====1949 movie====
A 1949 adaptation, called &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; in its United States release, starred Errol Flynn as Soames, Greer Garson as Irene, Walter Pidgeon as Young Jolyon, and Robert Young as Philip Bosinney.

====1967 serial====
A television adaptation by the BBC of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, and its sequel trilogy &quot;A Modern Comedy&quot;, starred Eric Porter as Soames, Joseph O&#x27;Conor as Old Jolyon, Susan Hampshire as Fleur, Kenneth More as Young Jolyon and Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene. It was produced by Donald Wilson and was shown in 26 episodes on Saturday evenings between 7 January and 1 July 1967 on BBC2. It was the repeat on Sunday evenings on BBC1 starting on 8 September 1968 that secured the programme&#x27;s success, with 18 million tuning in for the final episode in 1969. It was shown in the United States on public television and broadcast all over the world, and became the first British television programme to be sold to the Soviet Union.

==== Radio adaptations ====
There have been various BBC radio dramatisations. The first was probably a radio production of &quot;The Man of Property&quot; in 11 weekly parts commencing 9 December 1945 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, specifically the &quot;Nimrod&quot; variation. This adaptation starred Leo Genn as Jo, Grizelda Hervey as Irene and Ronald Simpson as Soames. It was adapted by Muriel Levy and produced by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton. Young Jolyons in later adaptations included Andrew Cruickshank, Leo Genn and Guy Rolfe. Another production of the dramatised cycle, which had Rachel Gurney as Irene, Noel Johnson as Young Jolyon and Alan Wheatley as Soames, came soon after the 1967 television series. The version broadcast in 1990 comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled &quot;The Forsyte Chronicles&quot;. It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast, which included Dirk Bogarde, Diana Quick, Michael Williams and Alan Howard. This radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004, and has been released commercially.

In January 2016, BBC Radio 4 began broadcasting a new radio adaptation by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan under the title &quot;The Forsytes&quot;, scheduled to continue until late 2017. The cast was led by Joseph Millson as Soames, Jessica Raine as Fleur, Juliet Aubrey as Irene, Harry Haddon Paton as Bosinney and Ewan Bailey as Young Jolyon. It was directed by Marion Nancarrow and Gemma Jenkins.

===Twenty-first century===

====&quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (2002)====

In 2002, the first two books and the first interlude were adapted by Granada Television for the ITV network, although, like the 1967 production, the miniseries took many liberties with Galsworthy&#x27;s original work. Additional funding for this production was provided by American PBS station WGBH, the BBC version having been a success on PBS in the early 1970s.

====&quot;The Forsyte Saga: To Let&quot; (2003 serial)====

Immediately following the success of the 2002 adaptation, a second series was released in 2003. It portrays the saga&#x27;s last book &quot;To Let&quot;. Much of the cast resumed their roles, but most of the first generation of Forsytes had died in the previous series. The principal characters played by Damian Lewis, Gina McKee, Rupert Graves, and Amanda Root return. It has also been released on DVD.

====&quot;The Forsyte Saga: Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; (2024 stage play)====
An adaptation of Forsyte Saga for stage will be premiering at London&#x27;s Park Theatre in October 2024, bringing unheard female voices to the fore. The two parts were adapted for stage by Shaun Mckenna and Lin Coghlan, starring Fiona Hampton, Joseph Millson, and Flora Spencer-Longhurst.

==Themes==
Duty versus Desire: Young Jolyon was the favourite of the family until he left his wife for his daughter&#x27;s governess. He eschews his status in society and in the Forsyte clan to follow his heart. Soames, though it seems he is the polar opposite of Jolyon, has those same inclinations toward doing what he desires. For example, instead of finding a wife who is rich, he marries Irene and then Annette, who have neither money nor status. When he takes Irene to a play about a married woman and her lover, he ironically sympathizes with the lover and not the husband. However, most of his decisions are on the side of duty.

Generations and Change: The many generations of the Forsyte clan remind everyone of what has come to pass over the years. However, as the old ranks begin to die, people are able to change. For example, after a few generations, the fact that they are nouveau riche does not matter as much. This is also the case with Soames and Irene&#x27;s marital problems. Once they grow old and their children can overcome their parents&#x27; past, Soames can finally let go of the past. Another change with generations is the diminished number of Forsyte offspring. Many of the second generation have fewer children.

==Sequels==

Galsworthy&#x27;s sequel to &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; was &quot;A Modern Comedy&quot;, a further trilogy written in the years 1924 to 1928. This comprises the novel &quot;The White Monkey&quot;; an interlude, &quot;A Silent Wooing&quot;; a second novel, &quot;The Silver Spoon&quot;; a second interlude, &quot;Passers By&quot;; and a third novel, &quot;Swan Song&quot;. The principal characters are Soames and Fleur, and the second saga ends with the death of Soames in 1926. This is also the point reached at the end of the 1967 television series.

===&quot;The White Monkey&quot; (1924)===
Fleur Forsyte has settled into married life with Michael Mont, following her aborted romance with Jon Forsyte. Unbeknownst to Michael, his best friend Wilfred Desert has also fallen in love with Fleur. Fleur seems to treat Wilfred’s affection as an amusement in her otherwise dull life.

Michael works for a publishing firm and catches one of his employees, Bickett, stealing books and is forced to fire him. Feeling bad for a man who was trying to help his sick wife, Michael helps Bickett’s wife Victorine gain a job posing as a nude model for various artists. Victorine eventually gains enough money for the two of them to move to Australia.

Soames Forsyte, Fleur’s father, is on the board for a company with extensive capital invested overseas. A young man comes to him and advises that he has overheard that the Chairman of the Board, Mr Emerson, has been taking commissions to invest in failing stock, losing a considerable amount of the shareholders’ money in the process. Soames and Lawrence Mont, Michael’s father, attempt to bring this to the attention of the Board but are too late to stop Mr Emerson escaping prosecution. They both resign in protest.

Soames also visits his cousin George shortly before his death and secures a Chinese painting, the titular ‘White Monkey’. He gives the painting to Fleur and Michael.

Eventually, Wilfred tires of Fleur tormenting him and leaves to go to the East. A depressed Fleur turns to Michael and falls pregnant and eventually gives birth to a son, Christopher (or Kit).

===A Silent Wooing (Interlude 1927)===
In America, Jon goes on a picnic with his friend Francis Wilmot and meets his sister Anne. Anne and Jon go to explore an Indian mound and become lost, returning hours later. Jon then visits Francis and Anne at home and falls in love with her. They eventually marry.

===&quot;The Silver Spoon&quot; (1926)===
The book focuses mainly on Michael Mont’s political career, and Fleur’s social activities. Jon Forsyte’s brother-in-law, Francis Wilmot, arrives in London, staying with Fleur and Michael. He attends one of Fleur’s evening parties, and is smitten with Marjorie Ferrar, grand-daughter of the Marquess of Shropshire, and a lively member of a ‘fast set’.

Soames overhears her talking disparagingly about Fleur, and strong words are exchanged. Fleur writes some injudicious letters about the incident, and Marjorie is persuaded to launch a libel action. Soames, Sir Lawrence Mont and Lord Shropshire attempt to mediate, but in vain, and neither party will back down.

Michael chucks publishing, and launches his political career. His maiden speech promotes a scheme known as ‘Foggartism’, which advocates a policy of child migration to the Dominions. He also attempts to assist a group of ‘down-and-outs’, but the project only partly succeeds. He has a run-in with Marjorie’s fiancée, Sir Alexander McGown, a fiery Scottish MP.

The libel case comes to court. As a result of legal manoevering by Soames, Marjorie’s views on modern morality, including the reading of ‘advanced literature’, are aired in public. She defends her opinions bravely, but is persuaded to quietly settle out of court, without an apology from Fleur.

Now deeply in debt, and refusing to disclose her various love affairs to McGown, he breaks their engagement. Lord Shropshire offers to pay her debts, on her word as a lady to pay cash for her needs in future.

Marjorie is now the toast of her set, and Fleur is humiliated. She asks Michael to take her ‘around the world’. She and Soames decide to go together, with Michael joining them later, when Parliament rises.

===Passers-By (Interlude 1927)=== 
Soames is in the final days of his holiday with Fleur and Michael in Washington when he becomes aware that Jon, Anne and Irene Forsyte are in town and staying at the same hotel. He works to ensure Fleur remains unaware of their existence, though he cannot stop himself from spying on Irene playing the piano. They return to England with only Soames aware of the near encounter.

===&quot;Swan Song&quot; (1928)===
The General Strike is called. Many Forsytes enrol as special constables. Michael Mont’s sympathies are with the strikers, but he can do nothing to help. Fleur takes over the running of a canteen for the volunteers who will keep the trains running. Holly joins her, as well as Anne, Jon’s wife. Jon volunteers to stoke an engine; he eats at the canteen, but he and Fleur do not meet.
Anne and Jon decide to stay in England, and buy a farm in Sussex..

Disillusioned with Foggartism, Michael is drawn into a scheme promoted by his uncle, Rev. Hilary Charwell, to buy and convert the worst of the London slums. He and his father help to set up the Fund, and recruit rich and influential men to invest in the scheme. Soames is co-opted as legal advisor.

Michael visits June Forsyte, who tells him the story of Fleur and Jon’s affair, and something of the tangled family history, which he hadn’t previously known. 

Val Dartie is visited by an old college pal, Stainforth, now fallen on hard times, who claims to know something about an employee at Val’s racehorse stables, and offers to sell him the information. He later forges Val’s name on a cheque.

Fleur sets up a rest home in the country for working girls, but it’s really an excuse to be close to Jon. She schemes to arrange ‘accidental’ meetings. Jon and Fleur have one last fling, but when Anne becomes pregnant, he breaks it off. Fleur is devastated.

A fire breaks out in Soames’ house, almost certainly started accidentally by Fleur. Most of the pictures are saved, but a heavy painting falls and hits Soames as he tries to rescue Fleur. He is badly injured, and dies a few days later.

===Later works===
Galsworthy wrote one further trilogy, &quot;End of the Chapter&quot;, comprising &quot;Maid in Waiting&quot;, &quot;Flowering Wilderness&quot;, and &quot;Over the River&quot; (also known as &quot;One More River&quot;), chiefly dealing with Michael Mont&#x27;s young cousin, Dinny Cherrell.

The three trilogies have been republished under the collective title of &quot;The Forsyte Chronicles&quot;.

In 1930 Galsworthy published &quot;On Forsyte &#x27;Change&quot;, which deals in the main with the older Forsytes before the events chronicled in &quot;The Man of Property&quot;. Galsworthy states in a foreword that &quot;They have all been written since &quot;Swan Song&quot; was finished but in place they come between the Saga and the Comedy ...&quot; By way of explanation he writes that &quot;It is hard to part suddenly and finally from those with whom one has lived so long; and these footnotes do really, I think, help to fill in and round out the chronicles of the Forsyte family.&quot;

In 1994 Suleika Dawson published a sequel to &quot;The Forsytes&quot; titled &quot;The Forsytes: The Saga Continues&quot; in which Soames&#x27;s daughter, Fleur, Lady Mont, is the main character. She has been a dutiful wife and mother, and has long forgotten her love for Jon Forsyte, but when tragedy brings Jon back to England Fleur is determined to recapture the past and the love of her life.

==Awards==
&quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; earned John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932.

==Dedication==
A framed letter from Galsworthy stood next to his wife&#x27;s bed until her death. It read &quot;I super-dedicate in its entirety &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; whose first word was written on Campden Hill, London of a May morning in 1903 and whose last word was written at Hampstead on 15 August 1920. Of all my work I have most enjoyed the making of this chronicle, and on the whole set more store by it than anything else I have written up to now. This is why I super-dedicate the whole of it to one without whose instigation, sympathy, interest and criticism, my obscure inner necessity might never have pushed through the mufflement of circumstance and made me a writer – such as I am.&quot; (1921)

<text>The Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is a single-chip microcontroller (MCU) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems. The architect of the Intel MCS-51 instruction set was John H. Wharton. Intel&#x27;s original versions were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, and enhanced binary compatible derivatives remain popular today. It is a complex instruction set computer with separate memory spaces for program instructions and data.

Intel&#x27;s original MCS-51 family was developed using N-type metal–oxide–semiconductor (NMOS) technology, like its predecessor Intel MCS-48, but later versions, identified by a letter C in their name (e.g., 80C51) use complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology and consume less power than their NMOS predecessors. This made them more suitable for battery-powered devices.

The family was continued in 1996 with the enhanced 8-bit MCS-151 and the 8/16/32-bit MCS-251 family of binary compatible microcontrollers. While Intel no longer manufactures the MCS-51, MCS-151 and MCS-251 family, enhanced binary compatible derivatives made by numerous vendors remain popular today. Some derivatives integrate a digital signal processor (DSP) or a floating-point unit (coprocessor, FPU). Beyond these physical devices, several companies also offer MCS-51 derivatives as IP cores for use in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs.

== Important features and applications ==

The 8051 architecture provides many functions (central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), input/output (I/O) ports, serial port, interrupt control, timers) in one package:
* 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and accumulator, 8-bit registers (one 16-bit register with special move instructions), 8-bit data bus and 2 × 16-bit address buses, program counter, data pointer, and related 8/11/16-bit operations; hence it is mainly an 8-bit microcontroller
* Boolean processor with 17 instructions, 1-bit accumulator, 32 registers (4 × 8-bit, bit-addressable) and up to 144 special 1 bit-addressable RAM variables (18 × 8-bit)
* Multiply, divide and compare instructions
* Four fast switchable register banks with 8 registers each (memory-mapped)
* Fast interrupt with optional register bank switching
* Interrupts and threads with selectable priority
* 128 or 256 bytes of on-chip RAM (IRAM)
* Dual 16-bit address bus; it can access 2 × 216 memory locations: 64 KB (65,536 locations) each of ROM (PMEM) and external RAM (XRAM), using two memory buses in a Harvard architecture.
* On-chip ROM (not included on 803x variants)
* Four (three full) 8-bit bidirectional input/output ports, bit-addressable
* UART (serial port)
* Two 16-bit counters/timers
* Power-saving mode (on some derivatives)

One feature of the 8051 core is the inclusion of a Boolean processing engine, which allows bit-level Boolean logic operations to be carried out directly and efficiently on select internal registers, ports and select RAM locations. Another feature is the inclusion of four bank-selectable working register sets, which greatly reduce the time required to perform the context switches to enter and leave interrupt service routines. With one instruction, the 8051 can switch register banks, avoiding the time-consuming task of transferring the critical registers to RAM.

Once a UART, and a timer if necessary, has been configured, the programmer needs only write a simple interrupt routine to refill the &quot;send&quot; shift register whenever the last bit is shifted out by the UART and/or empty the full &quot;receive&quot; shift register (copy the data somewhere else). The main program then performs serial reads and writes simply by reading and writing 8-bit data to stacks.

=== Derivative features ===
, new derivatives are still being developed by many major chipmakers, and major compiler suppliers such as IAR Systems, Keil and TASKING continuously release updates.

MCS-51-based microcontrollers typically include one or two UARTs, two or three timers, 128 or 256 bytes of internal data RAM (16 bytes of which are bit-addressable), up to 128 bytes of I/O, 512 bytes to 64 KB of internal program memory, and sometimes a quantity of extended data RAM (ERAM) located in the external data space. External RAM and ROM share the data and address buses. The original 8051 core ran at 12 clock cycles per machine cycle, with most instructions executing in one or two machine cycles. With a 12 MHz clock frequency, the 8051 could thus execute 1 million one-cycle instructions per second or 500,000 two-cycle instructions per second. Enhanced 8051 cores are now commonly used which run at six, four, two, or even one clock per machine cycle (denoted &quot;1T&quot;) and have clock frequencies of up to 100 MHz, thus being capable of an even greater number of instructions per second. All Silicon Labs, some Dallas (now part of Maxim Integrated) and a few Atmel (now part of Microchip) devices have single-cycle cores.

8051 variants may include built-in reset timers with brown-out detection, on-chip oscillators, self-programmable flash ROM program memory, built-in external RAM, extra internal program storage, bootloader code in ROM, EEPROM non-volatile data storage, I2C, SPI, and USB host interfaces, CAN or LIN bus, Zigbee or Bluetooth radio modules, PWM generators, analog comparators, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, RTCs, extra counters and timers, in-circuit debugging facilities, more interrupt sources, extra power-saving modes, more or fewer parallel ports etc. Intel manufactured a mask-programmed version, 8052AH-BASIC, with a BASIC interpreter in ROM, capable of running user programs loaded into RAM.

MCS-51-based microcontrollers have been adapted to extreme environments. Examples for high-temperature variants are the Tekmos TK8H51 family for −40°C to +250°C or the Honeywell HT83C51 for −55°C to +225°C (with operation for up to 1 year at +300°C). Radiation-hardenend MCS-51 microcontrollers for use in spacecraft are available; e.g., from Cobham (formerly Aeroflex) as the UT69RH051 or from NIIET as the 1830VE32 ().

In some engineering schools, the 8051 microcontroller is used in introductory microcontroller courses.

== Family naming conventions ==

Intel&#x27;s first MCS-51 microcontroller was the 8051, with 4 KB ROM and 128 byte RAM. Variants starting with 87 have a user-programmable EPROM, sometimes UV-erasable. Variants with a C as the third character are some kind of CMOS. 8031 and 8032 are ROM-less versions, with 128 and 256 bytes of RAM. The last digit can indicate memory size, e.g. 8052 with 8 KB ROM, 87C54 16 KB EPROM, and 87C58 with 32 KB EPROM, all with 256-byte RAM.

== Memory architecture ==
The MCS-51 has four distinct types of memory: internal RAM, special function registers, program memory, and external data memory. To access these efficiently, some compilers utilize as many as 7 types of memory definitions: internal RAM, single-bit access to internal RAM, special function registers, single-bit access to selected (divisible by 8) special function registers, program RAM, external RAM accessed using a register indirect access, using one of the standard 8-bit registers, and register indirect external RAM access utilizing the 16-bit indirect access register.

The 8051&#x27;s instruction set is designed as a Harvard architecture with segregated memory (data and instructions); it can only execute code fetched from program memory and has no instructions to write to program memory. However, the bus leaving the IC has a single address and data path, and strongly resembles a von Neumann architecture bus.

Most 8051 systems respect the instruction set and require customized features to download new executable programs, e.g. in flash memory.

=== Internal RAM ===
Internal RAM (IRAM) has an 8-bit address space, using addresses 0 through 0xFF. IRAM from 0x00 to 0x7F contains 128 directly addressable 1-byte registers, which can be accessed using an 8-bit absolute address that is part of the instruction. Alternatively, IRAM can be accessed indirectly: the address is loaded into R0 or R1, and the memory is accessed using the codice_1 or codice_2 syntax, or as stack memory through the stack pointer SP, with the codice_3/codice_4 and codice_5/codice_6 operations.

The original 8051 has only 128 bytes of IRAM. The 8052 added IRAM from 0x80 to 0xFF, which can &quot;only&quot; be accessed indirectly (e.g. for use as stack space). Most 8051 clones also have a full 256 bytes of IRAM.

Direct accesses to the IRAM addresses 0x80–0xFF are, instead, mapped onto the special function registers (SFR), where the accumulators A, B, carry bit C, and other special registers for control, status, etc., are located.

=== Special function registers ===
Special function registers (SFR) are located in the same address space as IRAM, at addresses 0x80 to 0xFF, and are accessed directly using the same instructions as for the lower half of IRAM. They cannot be accessed indirectly via codice_1 or codice_2 or by the stack pointer SP; indirect access to those addresses will access the second half of IRAM instead.

The special function registers (SFR) include the accumulators A (or ACC, at E0) and B (at F0) and program status word (or PSW, at D0), themselves, as well as the 16-bit data pointer DPTR (at 82, as DPL and 83 as DPH). In addition to these, a small core of other special function registers including the interrupt enable IE at A8 and interrupt priority IP at B8; the I/O ports P0 (80), P1 (90), P2 (A0), P3 (B0); the serial I/O control SCON (98) and buffer SBUF (99); the CPU/power control register PCON (87); and the registers for timers 0 and 1 control (TCON at 88) and operation mode (TMOD at 89), the 16-bit timer 0 (TL0 at 8A, TH0 at 8C) and timer 1 (TL1 at 8B, TH1 at 8D) are present on all versions of the 8051. Other addresses are version-dependent; in particular, the registers of timer 2 for the 8052, the control register T2CON (at C8), the 16-bit capture/latch (RCAP2L at CA, RCAP2H at CB) and timer 2 (TL2 at CC and TH2 at CD) are not included with the 8051.

=== Register windows ===
The 32 bytes in IRAM from 0x00 to 0x1F contain space for four 8-byte register windows, which the eight registers R0–R7 map to. The currently active window is determined by a two-bit address contained in the program status word.

=== Bit registers ===
The 16 bytes (128 bits) at IRAM locations 0x20–0x2F contain space for 128 1-bit registers, which are separately addressable as bit registers 00–7F.

The remaining bit registers, addressed as 80–FF, are mapped onto the 16 special function registers 80, 88, 90, 98, ..., F0 and F8 (those whose addresses are multiples of 8), and therefore include the bits comprising the accumulators A, B and program status word PSW. The register window address, being bits 3 and 4 of the PSW, is itself addressable as bit registers D3 and D4 respectively; while the carry bit C (or CY), at bit 7 of the PSW, is addressable as bit register D7.

=== Program memory ===
Program memory (PMEM, though less common in usage than IRAM and XRAM) is up to 64 KB of read-only memory, starting at address 0 in a separate address space. It may be on- or off-chip, depending on the particular model of chip being used. Program memory is read-only, though some variants of the 8051 use on-chip flash memory and provide a method of re-programming the memory in-system or in-application.

In addition to code, it is possible to store read-only data such as lookup tables in program memory, retrieved by the or instructions. The address is computed as the sum of the 8-bit accumulator and a 16-bit register (PC or DPTR).

Special jump and call instructions ( and ) slightly reduce the size of code that accesses local (within the same 2 KB) program memory.

When code larger than 64 KB is required, a common system makes the code bank-switched, with general-purpose I/O selecting the upper address bits. Some 8051 compilers make provisions to automatically access paged code. In these systems, the interrupt vectors and paging table are placed in the first 32 KB of code and are always resident.

=== External data memory ===
External data memory (XRAM) is a third address space, also starting at address 0, and allowing 16 bits of address space. It can also be on- or off-chip; what makes it &quot;external&quot; is that it must be accessed using the (move external) instruction. Many variants of the 8051 include the standard 256 bytes of IRAM plus a few kilobytes of XRAM on the chip.

The first 256 bytes of XRAM may be accessed using the , , , and instructions. The full 64 KB may be accessed using and . The 16-bit address requires the programmer to load the 16-bit index register. For this reason, RAM accesses with 16-bit addresses are substantially slower.

Some CPUs permit the 8-bit indirect address to use any 8-bit general-purpose register.

To permit the use of this feature, some 8051-compatible microcontrollers with internal RAM larger than 256 bytes, or an inability to access external RAM, access internal RAM as if it were external and have a special function register (e.g. PDATA) that permits them to set the upper address of the 256-byte page. This emulates the MCS8051 mode that can page the upper byte of a RAM address by setting the general-purpose I/O pins.

When RAM larger than 64 KB is required, a common system makes the RAM bank-switched, with general-purpose I/O selecting the upper address bits. Some 8051 compilers make provisions to automatically access paged data.

== Registers ==
The only register on an 8051 that is not memory-mapped is the 16-bit program counter (PC). This specifies the address of the next instruction to execute. Relative branch instructions supply an 8-bit signed offset which is added to the PC.

Eight general-purpose registers R0–R7 may be accessed with instructions one byte shorter than others. They are mapped to IRAM between 0x00 and 0x1F. Only eight bytes of that range are used at any given time, determined by the two bank-select bits in the PSW.

The following is a partial list of the 8051&#x27;s registers, which are memory-mapped into the special function register space:

; Stack pointer, SP (0x81): This is an 8-bit register used by subroutine call and return instructions. The stack grows upward; the SP is incremented before pushing and decremented after popping a value.
; Data pointer, DP (0x82–83): This is a 16-bit register that is used for accessing PMEM and XRAM.
; Program status word, PSW (0xD0): This contains important status flags, by bit number: 
; Accumulator, A (0xE0): This register is used by most instructions.
; B register (0xF0): This is used as an extension to the accumulator for multiply and divide instructions.

256 single bits are directly addressable. These are the 16 IRAM locations from 0x20–0x2F, and the 16 special function registers 0x80, 0x88, 0x90, ..., 0xF8. Any bit of these bytes may be directly accessed by a variety of logical operations and conditional branches.

Note that the PSW does not contain the common negative (N), or zero (Z) flags. For the former, the most significant bit of the accumulator can be addressed directly, as it is a bit-addressable SFR. For the latter, there are explicit instructions to jump on whether or not the accumulator is zero. There is also a two-operand compare and jump operation.

The parity (P) bit is often used to implement serial modes that include parity. To support this, the standard MCS51 UARTs could send 9 bits.

== Microarchitecture ==
The microarchitecture of the Intel MCS8051 is proprietary, but published features suggest how it works. It is a multi-cycle processor. The MCS8051 used 12 clock cycles for most instructions. Many instructions utilize an accumulator. In contrast, most compatible computers execute instructions in one to three cycles, except for the multiply and divide instructions. The much higher speed is a major reason why these have replaced the MCS8051 in most applications.

Each interrupt has four priorities. Within each priority, the interrupts of devices are in a fixed priority.

== Instruction set ==
Instructions are all 1 to 3 bytes long, consisting of an initial opcode byte, followed by up to 2 bytes of operands.

 of the opcode bytes, &quot;x&quot;0–&quot;x&quot;3, are used for irregular opcodes.

 of the opcode bytes, &quot;x&quot;4–&quot;x&quot;F, are assigned to 16 basic ALU instructions with 12 possible operands. The least significant nibble of the opcode selects the primary operand as follows:

* &quot;x&quot;8–&quot;x&quot;F: Register direct, R0–R7.
* &quot;x&quot;6–&quot;x&quot;7: Register indirect, @R0 or @R1.
* &quot;x&quot;5: Memory direct, a following byte specifies an IRAM or SFR location.
* &quot;x&quot;4: Immediate, a following byte specifies an 8-bit constant. When the operand is a destination (, ) &quot;or&quot; the operation already includes an immediate source (, ), this instead specifies that the accumulator is used.

The most significant nibble specifies the operation as follows. Not all support all addressing modes; the immediate mode in particular is unavailable when the primary operand is written to. Instruction mnemonics use &quot;destination&quot;, &quot;source&quot; operand order.

; 0&quot;y&quot; : Increment the specified operand. Immediate mode (opcode 0x04) specifies the accumulator, .
; 1&quot;y&quot; : Decrement the specified operand. Immediate mode (opcode 0x14) specifies the accumulator, .
; 2&quot;y&quot; : Add the operand to the accumulator, A. Opcode 0x23 (, &quot;rotate left&quot; but actually a shift left) may be thought of as .
; 3&quot;y&quot; : Add the operand, plus the C bit, to the accumulator. Opcode 0x33 (, rotate left through carry) may be thought of as .
; 4&quot;y&quot; : Logical OR the operand into the accumulator. Two memory-destination forms of this operation, and , are specified by opcodes 0x43 and 0x42.
; 5&quot;y&quot; : Logical AND the operand into the accumulator. Two memory-destination forms of this operation, and , are specified by opcodes 0x53 and 0x52.
; 6&quot;y&quot; : Logical exclusive-OR the operand into the accumulator. Two memory-destination forms of this operation, and , are specified by opcodes 0x63 and 0x62.
; 7&quot;y&quot; : Move immediate to the operand. Immediate mode (opcode 0x74) specifies the accumulator, .
; 8&quot;y&quot; : Move value to an IRAM or SFR register. Immediate mode (opcode 0x84) is not used for this operation, as it duplicates opcode 0x75.
; 9&quot;y&quot; : Subtract the operand from the accumulator. This operation borrows and there is no subtract &quot;without&quot; borrow.
; A&quot;y&quot; : Move value from an IRAM or SFR register. Immediate mode (opcode 0xA4) is not used, as immediates serve only as sources. Memory direct mode (opcode 0xA5) is not used, as it duplicates 0x85. 
; B&quot;y&quot; : Compare &quot;operand&quot; to the immediate , and jump to if not equal. Immediate and memory direct modes (opcodes 0xB4 and 0xB5) compare the operand against the accumulator, . Note that there is no compare and jump if equal instruction, .
; C&quot;y&quot; : Exchange the accumulator and the operand. Immediate mode (opcode 0xC4) is not used for this operation.
; D&quot;y&quot; : Decrement the operand, and jump to if the result is non-zero. Immediate mode (opcode 0xD4), and register indirect mode (0xD6, 0xD7) are not used.
; E&quot;y&quot; : Move operand to the accumulator. Immediate mode is not used for this operation (opcode 0xE4), as it duplicates opcode 0x74.
; F&quot;y&quot; : Move accumulator to the operand. Immediate mode (opcode 0xF4) is not used, as it would have no effect.

Only the , , and instructions set PSW flags. The , , and logical instructions do not. The instruction modifies the C bit only, to the borrow that results from .

The irregular instructions comprise 64 opcodes, having more limited addressing modes, plus several opcodes scavenged from inapplicable modes in the regular instructions.

; 85: move directly between two IRAM or SFR registers.
; A5: &quot;Unused&quot; 
; B5: compare accumulator to an IRAM or SFR register, and jump to if not equal.
; D6–7: exchange low-order nibble of operands.

The (short jump) opcode takes a signed relative offset byte operand and transfers control there relative to the address of the following instruction. The / opcodes combine the three most significant bits of the opcode byte with the following byte to specify an 11-bit destination that is used to replace 11 bottom bits of the PC register (top 5 bits of PC register remain intact). For larger addresses, the and instructions allow a 16-bit destination.

One of the reasons for the 8051&#x27;s popularity is its range of operations on single bits. Bits are always specified by absolute addresses; there is no register-indirect or indexed addressing. Instructions that operate on single bits are:

* , , : Set, clear, or complement the specified bit
* : Jump if bit set
* : Jump if bit clear
* : Jump if bit set, and clear bit
* , : Move the specified bit to the carry bit, or vice versa
* , : Or the bit (or its complement) to the carry bit
* , : And the bit (or its complement) to the carry bit

A bit operand is written in the form . Because the carry flag is bit 7 of the bit-addressable program status word, the , and instructions are shorter equivalents to , and .

== Programming ==
There are various high-level programming language compilers for the 8051. Several C compilers are available for the 8051, most of which allow the programmer to specify where each variable should be stored in its six types of memory, and provide access to 8051-specific hardware features such as the multiple register banks and bit manipulation instructions. There are many commercial C compilers. Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) is a popular open-source C compiler.
Other high level languages such as C++, Forth,
BASIC, Object Pascal, Pascal, PL/M and Modula-2 are available for the 8051, but they are less widely used than C and assembly.

Because IRAM, XRAM, and PMEM (read only) all have an address 0, C compilers for the 8051 architecture provide compiler-specific pragmas or other extensions to indicate where a particular piece of data should be stored (i.e. constants in PMEM or variables needing fast access in IRAM). Since data could be in one of three memory spaces, a mechanism is usually provided to allow determining to which memory a pointer refers, either by constraining the pointer type to include the memory space or by storing metadata with the pointer.

== Related processors ==

Intel discontinued its MCS-51 product line in March 2007; however, there are plenty of enhanced 8051 products or silicon intellectual property added regularly from other vendors.

The 8051&#x27;s predecessor, the 8048, was used in the keyboard of the first IBM PC, where it converted keypresses into the serial data stream which is sent to the main unit of the computer. An Intel 8049 served a similar role in the Sinclair QL. The 8048 and derivatives are still used for basic model keyboards.

The 8031 was a reduced version of the original 8051 that had no internal program memory (read-only memory, ROM). To use this chip, external ROM had to be added containing the program that the 8031 would fetch and execute. An 8051 chip could be sold as a ROM-less 8031, as the 8051&#x27;s internal ROM is disabled by the normal state of the EA pin in an 8031-based design. A vendor might sell an 8051 as an 8031 for any number of reasons, such as faulty code in the 8051&#x27;s ROM, or simply an oversupply of 8051s and undersupply of 8031s.
The 8044 (as well as the ROM-less 8344 and the 8744 with EPROM) added an SDLC controller to the 8051 core (especially for Bitbus applications).

The 8052 was an enhanced version of the original 8051 that featured 256 bytes of internal RAM instead of 128 bytes, 8 KB of ROM instead of 4 KB, and a third 16-bit timer. Most modern 8051-compatible microcontrollers include these features.

The 8032 had these same features as the 8052 except it lacked internal ROM program memory.

The 8751 was an 8051 with 4 KB EPROM instead of 4 KB ROM. They were identical except for the non-volatile memory type. This part was available in a ceramic package with a clear quartz window over the top of the die so UV light could be used to erase the EPROM. Related parts are: 8752 had 8 KB EPROM, 8754 had 16 KB EPROM, 8758 had 32 KB EPROM.

The 80C537 (ROM-less) and 80C517 (8 KB ROM) are CMOS versions, designed for the automotive industry. Enhancements mostly include new and enhanced peripherals. The 80C5x7 has fail-safe mechanisms, analog signal processing facilities, enhanced timer capabilities, and a 32-bit arithmetic peripheral. Other features include:

* 256-byte on-chip RAM
* 256 directly addressable bits
* External program and data memory expandable up to 64 KB
* 8-bit A/D converter with 12 multiplexed inputs
* Arithmetic peripheral can perform 16×16→32-bit multiplication, 32/16→16-bit division, 32-bit shift and 32-bit normalize operations
* Eight data pointers instead of one for indirect addressing of program and external data memory
* Extended watchdog facilities
* Nine I/O ports
* Two full-duplex serial interfaces with individual baud rate generators
* Four priority level interrupt systems, 14 interrupt vectors
* Three power-saving modes

=== Derivative vendors ===
More than 20 independent manufacturers produce MCS-51 compatible processors. 

Other ICs or IPs compatible with the MCS-51 have been developed by Analog Devices, Integral Minsk,
Kristall Kyiv, and
NIIET Voronezh.

== Use as intellectual property ==
Today, 8051s are still available as discrete parts, but they are mostly used as silicon intellectual property cores. Available in hardware description language source code (such as VHDL or Verilog) or FPGA netlist forms, these cores are typically integrated within embedded systems, in products ranging from USB flash drives to washing machines to complex wireless communication systems on a chip. Designers use 8051 silicon IP cores, because of the smaller size, and lower power, compared to 32-bit processors like ARM Cortex-M series, MIPS and BA22.

Modern 8051 cores are faster than earlier packaged versions. Design improvements have increased 8051 performance while retaining compatibility with the original MCS 51 instruction set. The original Intel 8051 ran at 12 clock cycles per machine cycle, and most instructions executed in one or two machine cycles. A typical maximum clock frequency of 12 MHz meant these old 8051s could execute one million single-cycle instructions, or 500,000 two-cycle instructions, per second. In contrast, enhanced 8051 silicon IP cores now run at one clock cycle per machine cycle, and have clock frequencies of up to 450 MHz. That means an 8051-compatible processor can now execute instructions per second.

== Digital signal processor (DSP) variants ==
Several variants with an additional 16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) (for example for MP3 or Vorbis coding/decoding) with up to 675 million instructions per second (MIPS) and integrated USB 2.0 interface or as intellectual property exist.

== Enhanced 8-bit binary compatible microcontroller: MCS-151 family ==

In 1996 Intel announced the MCS-151 family, an up to 6 times faster variant, that&#x27;s fully binary and instruction set compatible with 8051. Unlike their 8051 MCS-151 is a pipelined CPU, with 16-bit internal code bus and is 6x the speed. The MCS-151 family was also discontinued by Intel, but is widely available in binary compatible and partly enhanced variants.

== 8/16/32-bit binary compatible microcontroller: MCS-251 family ==

The 80251 8/16/32-bit microcontroller with 16 MB (24-bit) address-space and 6 times faster instruction cycle was introduced by Intel in 1996. It can perform as an 8-bit 8051, has 24-bit linear addressing, an 8-bit ALU, 8-bit instructions, 16-bit instructions, a limited set of 32-bit instructions, 16 8-bit registers, 16 16-bit registers (8 16-bit registers which do not share space with any 8-bit registers, and 8 16-bit registers which contain 2 8-bit registers per 16-bit register), and 10 32-bit registers (2 dedicated 32-bit registers, and 8 32-bit registers which contain 2 16-bit registers per 32-bit register).

It features extended instructions – see also the programmer&#x27;s guide – and later variants with higher performance, also available as intellectual property (IP). It is 3-stage pipelined. The MCS-251 family was also discontinued by Intel, but is widely available in binary compatible and partly enhanced variants from many manufacturers.

<text>The relationships between the various denominations of Judaism are complex and include a range of trends from the conciliatory and welcoming to hostile and antagonistic.

==Orthodox Judaism==
The essential position of Orthodox Judaism is the view that Conservative and Reform Judaism made major and unjustifiable breaks with historic Judaism - both by their skepticism of the verbal revelation of the Written and the Oral Torah, and by their rejection of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) as binding (although to varying degrees). It views religious pluralism as a construct of the liberal movements, and does not see their ideology as rooted in historic Jewish norms. While not recognizing Reform and Conservative as valid expressions of Judaism, it recognizes most who are affiliated with these movements as full-fledged Jews, aside from those whose Judaism is of patrilineal descent or who were converted under Conservative or Reform auspices.
When dealing with the individual, Moshe Feinstein is famously quoted as characterizing all current-day non-Orthodox Jews as &quot;Tinokot Shenishbu&quot;, literally, &quot;captured children&quot;, in a category analogous to Jewish children captured by non-Jews who were never taught Judaism, meaning that they do not act out of wrong intent or motives, but out of ignorance and poor upbringing (Iggeroth Moshe).

However, when dealing with the movement/philosophy, they perceive the generation of other denominations to have historically been engendered by heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion. They view Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, and Conservative Judaism as heretical, less observant Jewish movements. As such, Orthodox authorities have strongly fought attempts by the Reform and Conservative movements to gain official recognition and denominational legitimacy in Israel. Haredi groups and authorities will not work with non-Orthodox religious movements in any way, as they view this as lending legitimacy to those movements. The members of those movements who have been born of a Jewish mother are, however, still regarded as Jews.

===Modern Orthodox views===
In his 1964 responsum on relations with non-Orthodox Judaism, Joseph B. Soloveitchik developed the intellectual foundations for the way Modern Orthodox Judaism was to approach the issue in subsequent decades. Soloveitchik developed the idea that Jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants. One is the &quot;brit yi&#x27;ud&quot;, &#x27;covenant of destiny&#x27;, which is the covenant by which Jews are bound together through their adherence to halakha. The second is the &quot;brit goral&quot;, &#x27;covenant of fate&#x27;, the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by God to live a sacred mission in the world, and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression, even if they do not live by halakha. Soloveitchik held that non-Orthodox Jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny; yet, they are still bound together with Orthodox Jews in the covenant of fate. This approach permitted cooperation in matters effecting the covenant of fate, while recognizing differences, and limits, based on the covenant of destiny.

Following this lead, until the 1970s, the Modern Orthodox and the non-Orthodox movements worked together in the now-defunct Synagogue Council of America. However, the relationship between Modern Orthodoxy and the non-Orthodox movements has worsened over the last few decades. The movements have seen a polarization of views. Haredi Judaism has seen a great resurgence in its popularity, and many formerly Modern Orthodox rabbis have been swayed to some degree by their views. As well, non-Orthodox movements have progressively moved to the &quot;left&quot;. Reform Judaism rejected the traditional definition of a Jew via matrilineal descent, effectively severing the united peoplehood that had linked Reform and non-Reform movements. For practically all Orthodox Jews (and many Conservative Jews), this was seen as splitting the Jewish people into two mutually incompatible groups. The confluence of these two phenomena helped drive most of Modern Orthodoxy further to the right, and effectively ended all official cooperation between Modern Orthodoxy and all of the non-Orthodox denominations.

Some within the Orthodox world advocate that while non-Orthodox forms of Judaism are incorrect, they nonetheless have functional validity and spiritual dignity. Rabbi Norman Lamm writes:

A number of modern Orthodox rabbis advocate good relations with their non-Orthodox peers. In 1982, &quot;Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought&quot; published a symposium on the state of Orthodox Judaism, with contributions by many leading Orthodox rabbis. The first question the editor asked the rabbis was: &quot;Do you believe that recent developments warrant the triumphalism exhibited by segments of Orthodoxy which predict the total disappearance of non-Orthodox movements?&quot; Rabbi Marc D. Angel replied that &quot;we should be frightened by the possibility. With all our theological differences, yet we part of one Jewish people and work together in so many ways for the benefit of the Jewish community... It is not a happy prospect that the overwhelming majority of American Jews will lose their Jewishness. It is also unlikely that the vast numbers of the non-Orthodox community will move into Orthodoxy in the relatively near future.&quot; Rabbi David Berger replied, &quot;I confess that I would not look forward to such a disappearance... The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing... The only weakening of Conservatism and Reform for which Orthodoxy can legitimately hope would come through conversion to Orthodoxy. No such development appears imminent in statistically significant numbers.&quot; The message of other rabbis rings a similar note; no rabbis profiled in the symposium believed that most non-Orthodox Jews would ever convert to Orthodoxy. Thus Orthodoxy should work together on some issues with non-Orthodox Judaism, and it is far better for Jews to be members of non-Orthodox Judaism than to assimilate and not be religious Jews at all.

A small number of modern Orthodox rabbis cooperate with non-Orthodox rabbis on a regular basis through smaller organizations such as CLAL (&quot;The National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership&quot;) and the New York Board of Rabbis.

Some American Modern Orthodox rabbis created a new modern Orthodox advocacy group, &quot;Edah&quot;, which included members of the Rabbinical Council of America. Edah&#x27;s mission statement stated: &quot;The Vision of Edah is an Orthodox Jewish community in which we, as members, leaders, and institutions ... reach out to and interact with Jews of all the movements as well as non-affiliated Jews as an expression of the wholeness of, and in an effort to strengthen, the entire Jewish people.&quot;

==Conservative views==
Conservative Judaism holds that Orthodox Judaism is a valid and legitimate form of normative rabbinic Judaism and respects the validity of its rabbis. Conservative Judaism holds that both Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have made major and unjustifiable breaks with historic Judaism by their rejection of the normativity of Halakha and redefinition of Jewishness (e.g., the acceptance of patrilineal descent as conferring Jewishness). Despite this disagreement, Conservative Judaism respects the right of Reform and Reconstructionist Jews to interpret Judaism in their own way(s). Thus, the Conservative movement recognizes the right of Jews to form denominations and recognizes Reform and Reconstructionist ordinations, but, in general, does not accept their decisions as valid. For example, since the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed their 1983 resolution to recognize patrilineal descent, the Conservative movement has not accepted Reform converts to Judaism. Conservative denominational leadership has since agreed to recognize Reform converts who complete necessary rituals (i.e., appearing before a beth din and immersing in a mikveh) and a full &quot;introduction to Judaism&quot; course without inquiring regarding the status of the sponsoring rabbi or deciding beth din.

The Conservative movement, while respecting the validity of Orthodox rabbis, believes that Orthodoxy has deviated from historical Judaism through an insistence on the halachic principle of binding legal precedent, in particular with respect to relatively recent codifications of Jewish law. A prominent Conservative spokesman has written:

Reform has asserted the right of interpretation but it rejected the authority of legal tradition. Orthodoxy has clung fast to the principle of authority, but has in our own and recent generations rejected the right to any but minor interpretations. The Conservative view is that both are necessary for a living Judaism. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism holds itself bound by the Jewish legal tradition, but asserts the right of its rabbinical body, acting as a whole, to interpret and to apply Jewish law.
:— Mordecai Waxman, &quot;Tradition and Change: The Development of Conservative Judaism&quot;

The Conservative movement, however, has clashed with Orthodoxy over its refusal to recognize the Conservative and Reform movements as legitimate, and in February 1997, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, the Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews, and called on Reform and Conservative Jews, as well as the Jewish Federations throughout the United States, to stop funding Orthodox organizations and institutions that disagree with the Conservative view of pluralism. Several weeks later, at the movement&#x27;s annual Rabbinical Assembly conference in Boston, he called for the disintegration of Israel&#x27;s chief rabbinate and its network of courts.

==Reform views==
Reform Judaism espouses the notion of religious pluralism; it believes that most Jewish denominations (including Orthodoxy and the Conservative movement) are valid expressions of Judaism. Historically, however, the Reform view of Orthodox Judaism had been negative. Early battles between Reform and Orthodox groups in Germany for control of communal leadership were fierce. Reform viewed Orthodoxy as overly focused on tradition and a literal interpretation of scripture that conflicted with modern science. Relations with the Conservative movement are much more cordial (although the two split due to such affairs as the Trefa Banquet), and Conservative and Reform leaders cooperate on many areas of mutual concern.

==Humanistic views==
Humanistic Judaism views other forms of Judaism as valid from a traditional point of view, but itself emphasizes Jewish culture and history – rather than belief in God – as the sources of Jewish identity.

==Karaite views==
Karaite Judaism does not recognize the Oral Law as a divine authority, maintaining that the Written Torah, and the subsequent prophets which God sent to Israel, whose writings are recorded in the Tanakh, are the only suitable sources for deriving halakha, which Karaite Judaism maintains, must not deviate from the plain meaning of the Hebrew Bible. Rabbinic laws which either allow Jews something the Torah forbids, or release Jews from a commandment the Torah requires, are seen as a break with the Torah, and transgression of Divine Law. An example being the white tzitzit donned by Rabbinic Jews, which has no tekhelet. This is regarded as a violation of the Torah, which requires that tzitzit be made with tekhelet. The tzitzit worn by some in the rabbinic community, which does have tekhelet, is also seen as a violation of the Torah, because according to the Talmud, a tekhelet string must be made of wool, and the white strings from linen, making the tzitzit shatnez. Karaite Jews also maintain that Rabbinic Jews are not observing Jewish holy days on their correct date, because the dates are fixed according to the pre-calculated Hillel II calendar, instead of beginning each month with the sighting of the New Moon from the horizon of Israel, and starting the year during the month when the barley reaches the stage of Aviv in the land of Israel. However, despite Rabbinic Judaism deviating from the plain meaning of the Torah, Karaite Jews recognize Rabbinic Jews who have unbroken patrilineal Jewish descent, as Jewish, and eligible to join Karaite Judaism without a conversion.

<doc id="60228" wikidata="Q1753717" url="?curid=60228" title="Intel MCS-48">
<text>The MCS-48 microcontroller series, Intel&#x27;s first microcontroller, was originally released in 1976. Its first members were 8048, 8035 and 8748. The 8048 is arguably the most prominent member of the family. Initially, this family was produced using NMOS (n-type metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology. In the early 1980s, it became available in CMOS technology. It was manufactured into the 1990s to support older designs that still used it.

The MCS-48 series has a modified Harvard architecture, with internal or external program ROM and 64 to 256 bytes of internal (on-chip) RAM. The I/O is mapped into its own address space, separate from programs and data.

Though the MCS-48 series was eventually replaced by the very successful MCS-51 series, it remained quite popular even by the year 2000 due to its low cost, wide availability, memory-efficient one-byte instruction set, and mature development tools. Because of this, it is used in high-volume, cost-sensitive consumer electronics devices such as TV remotes, computer keyboards, and toys.

== Variants ==
The 8049 has 2 KB of masked ROM (the 8748 and 8749 had EPROM) that can be replaced with a 4 KB external ROM, as well as 128 bytes of RAM and 27 I/O ports. The microcontroller&#x27;s oscillator block divides the clock input frequency by three and then further divides the result into five machine states. Using the 11 MHz maximum crystal frequency will produce 0.73 MIPS of single-cycle instructions. Some 70% of instructions are single byte and single cycle ones, but 30% need two cycles or two bytes, so its typical performance would be closer to 0.5 MIPS.



== Uses ==
The MCS-48 series was commonly used in computer and terminal keyboards, converting key presses into protocols that can be understood by digital circuits. This also allows the possibility of serial communication, reducing the amount of conductors needed in cables on external keyboards. Microprocessors had been used in keyboards since at least 1972, simplifying earlier discrete designs. The 8048 has been used in this application since its introduction in 1978.

The Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, released in 1979, used the 8021 in its keyboard. The 8021 processor scans the key matrix, converts switch closures to an 8-bit code and then transmits that code serially to the keyboard interface on the main system. It will also accept commands to turn indicator LEDs on or off. The 8021 was also used in the keyboards for the TRS-80 Model 12, 12B, 16, 16B and the Tandy 6000/6000HD.

The original IBM PC keyboard used an 8048 as its internal microcontroller. The PC AT replaced the PC&#x27;s Intel 8255 peripheral interface chip at I/O port addresses with an 8042 accessible through port addresses and . As well as managing the keyboard interface, the 8042 controlled the A20 line gating function for the AT&#x27;s Intel 80286 CPU and could be commanded by software to reset the 80286 (unlike the 80386 and later processors, the 80286 had no way of switching from protected mode back to real mode except by being reset). Later PC compatibles integrate the 8042&#x27;s functions into their super I/O devices.

The 8048 was used in the Magnavox Odyssey² video game console, the Korg Trident series, and the Korg Poly-61, Roland Jupiter-4 and Roland ProMars analog synthesizers. The Sinclair QL used the closely related Intel 8049 to manage its keyboard, joystick ports, RS-232 inputs and audio. The ROM-less 8035 variant was used in Nintendo&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; to generate the background music.

== Derived microcontrollers ==
Philips Semiconductors (now NXP) owned a license to produce this series and developed their MAB8400-family based on this architecture. These were the first microcontrollers with an integrated I²C-interface and were used in the first Philips (Magnavox in the US) Compact Disc players (e.g. the CD-100).

<text>Georg Trakl (3 February 1887 – 3 November 1914) was an Austrian poet and the brother of the pianist Grete Trakl. He is considered one of the most important Austrian Expressionists. He is perhaps best known for his poem &quot;Grodek&quot;, which he wrote shortly before he died of a cocaine overdose.

==Life and work==
Trakl was born and lived the first 21 years of his life in Salzburg. His father, Tobias Trakl (11 June 1837, Ödenburg/Sopron – 1910), was a hardware dealer from Hungary. His mother, Maria Catharina Halik (17 May 1852, Wiener Neustadt – 1925), was a housewife of partly Czech descent who struggled with substance use disorder. She left her son&#x27;s education to a French &quot;gouvernante&quot;, who brought Trakl into contact with French language and literature at an early age. His sister Grete Trakl was a musical prodigy with whom he shared artistic endeavors. Poems allude to an incestuous relationship between the two.

Trakl attended a Catholic elementary school, although his parents were Protestants. He matriculated in 1897 at the Salzburg Staatsgymnasium, where he had problems in Latin, Greek, and mathematics, for which he had to repeat one year and then leave without Matura. At age 13, Trakl began to write poetry.

After quitting high school, Trakl worked for a pharmacist for three years and decided to adopt pharmacy as a career; this facilitated access to drugs, such as morphine and cocaine. It was during this time that he experimented with playwriting, but his two short plays, &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot; and &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, were not successful. However, from May to December 1906, Trakl published four prose pieces in the &quot;feuilleton&quot; section of two Salzburg newspapers. All cover themes and settings found in his mature work. This is especially true of &quot;Traumland&quot; (Dreamland), in which a young man falls in love with a dying girl who is his cousin.

In 1908, Trakl moved to Vienna to study pharmacy, and became acquainted with some local artists who helped him publish some of his poems. Trakl&#x27;s father died in 1910, soon before Trakl received his pharmacy certificate; thereafter, Trakl enlisted in the army for a year-long stint. His return to civilian life in Salzburg was unsuccessful and he re-enlisted, serving as a pharmacist at a hospital in Innsbruck. There he became acquainted with a group of avant-garde artists involved with the well-regarded literary journal &quot;Der Brenner&quot;, a journal that began the Kierkegaard revival in the German-speaking countries. Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of &quot;Der Brenner&quot; (and son of the historian Julius von Ficker), became his patron; he regularly printed Trakl&#x27;s work and endeavored to find him a publisher to produce a collection of poems. The result of these efforts was &quot;Gedichte&quot; &quot;(Poems)&quot;, published by Kurt Wolff in Leipzig during the summer of 1913. Ficker also brought Trakl to the attention of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who anonymously provided him with a sizable stipend so that he could concentrate on his writing.

At the beginning of World War I, Trakl served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was sent as a medical officer to attend soldiers on the Eastern Front. Trakl suffered frequent bouts of depression. On one such occasion during the Battle of Gródek (fought in autumn 1914 at Gródek, then in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), Trakl had to steward the recovery of some ninety soldiers wounded in the fierce campaign against the Russians. He tried to shoot himself from the strain, but his comrades prevented him. Hospitalized at a military hospital in Kraków and observed closely, Trakl lapsed into worse depression and wrote to Ficker for advice. Ficker convinced him to communicate with Wittgenstein. Upon receiving Trakl&#x27;s note, Wittgenstein travelled to the hospital, but found that Trakl had died of a cocaine overdose. Trakl was buried at Kraków&#x27;s Rakowicki Cemetery on 6 November 1914, but on 7 October 1925, as a result of the efforts by Ficker, his remains were transferred to the municipal cemetery of Innsbruck-Mühlau (where they now repose next to Ficker&#x27;s).

==Themes and motifs==
While Trakl&#x27;s very earliest poems are more philosophical and do not deal as much with the real world, most of his poems are either set in the evening or have evening as a motif. Silence is also a frequent motif in Trakl&#x27;s poetry, and his later poems often feature the silent dead, who are unable to express themselves.

<text>Dugongidae is a family in the order of Sirenia. The family has one surviving species, the dugong (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;), one recently extinct species, Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;), and a number of extinct genera known from fossil records.
 Dugongidae&#x27;s body weight ranges from 217 to 307 kg for juveniles, 334 to 424 kg for subadults, and 435 to 568.5 kg for adults. Oral temperatures for individual dugongs is determined from 24° to 34.2 °C. Heart rate readings are from 40 to 96 bpm and vary between individual dugongs. Respiration rate during the out-of-water phase is from 1 to 33.

The genera &quot;Eosiren&quot;, &quot;Eotheroides&quot;, and &quot;Prototherium&quot; have been assigned to Halitheriinae in the past, but recent cladistic analysis recovers these genera as basal to the clade formed by Trichechidae and Dugongidae. Moreover, Halitheriinae is paraphyletic with respect to Dugonginae and Hydrodamalinae, and further use of the name should be discontinued because the type genus is based on a non-diagnostic tooth.

<text>The Intel 430HX (codenamed Triton II) is a chipset from Intel, supporting Socket 7 processors, including the Pentium and Pentium MMX. It is also known as i430HX and it was released in February 1996. The official part number is 82430HX.

==Features==
The 430HX chipset had all the features of the 430FX (Triton I) plus support for ECC, parity RAM, two-way SMP, USB, and then current PCI to improve speed.

It consists of one 82439HX TXC, the northbridge and one PIIX3, the southbridge. The 430HX chipset supported up to 512MB of RAM (64MB or 512MB cacheable depending on tag RAM size).

===Gallery===
==Limitations==
Not all 430HX boards allowed for tag RAM expansion, only allowing 64MB cacheable; 430HX also did not support the then-new SDRAM memory technology. Dual-voltage support, for Pentium MMX or AMD K6 CPUs, was also not mandatory on 430HX boards, requiring the use of an interposer to step down the voltage.

<doc id="60244" wikidata="Q129544" url="?curid=60244" title="Dugong">
<text>The dugong (; Dugong dugon) is a marine mammal. It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.

The dugong is the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats that support seagrass meadows, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas such as bays, mangrove channels, the waters of large inshore islands and inter-reefal waters. The northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong&#x27;s contemporary stronghold.

Like all modern sirenians, the dugong has a body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs. The forelimbs or flippers are paddle-like. The dugong is easily distinguishable from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail; moreover, it possesses a unique skull and teeth. Its snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities. The molar teeth are simple and peg-like, unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees.

The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil. Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The dugong&#x27;s current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction. The IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction, while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species limits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fishing-related fatalities, habitat degradation, and hunting. With its long lifespan of 70 years or more and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction.

==Evolution==
Dugongs are part of the Sirenia order of placental mammals which comprises modern &quot;sea cows&quot; (manatees as well as dugongs) and their extinct relatives. Sirenia are the only extant herbivorous marine mammals and the only group of herbivorous mammals to have become completely aquatic. Sirenians are thought to have a 50-million-year-old fossil record (early Eocene-recent). They attained modest diversity during the Oligocene and Miocene but subsequently declined as a result of climatic cooling, oceanographic changes, and human interference.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The word &quot;dugong&quot; derives from the Visayan (probably Cebuano) &quot;&quot;. The name was first adopted and popularized by the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, as &quot;dugon&quot; in &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (1765), after descriptions of the animal from the island of Leyte in the Philippines. The name ultimately derives from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *duyuŋ. Despite common misconception, the term does not come from Malay &quot;duyung&quot; and it does not mean &quot;lady of the sea&quot; (Mermaid).

Other common local names include &quot;sea cow&quot;, &quot;sea pig&quot; and &quot;sea camel&quot;. It is known as the &quot;balguja&quot; by the Wunambal people of the Mitchell Plateau area in the Kimberley, Western Australia.

&quot;Dugong dugon&quot; is the only extant species of the family Dugongidae, and one of only four extant species of the Sirenia order, the others forming the manatee family. It was first classified by Müller in 1776 as &quot;Trichechus dugon&quot;, a member of the manatee genus previously defined by Linnaeus. It was later assigned as the type species of &quot;Dugong&quot; by Lacépède and further classified within its own family by Gray and subfamily by Simpson.

Dugongs and other sirenians are not closely related to other marine mammals, being more related to elephants. Dugongs and elephants share a monophyletic group with hyraxes and the aardvark, one of the earliest offshoots of eutherians. The fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the Eocene, where they most likely lived in the Tethys Ocean. The two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the mid-Eocene, after which the dugongs and their closest relative, the Steller&#x27;s sea cow, split off from a common ancestor in the Miocene. The Steller&#x27;s sea cow became extinct in the 18th century. No fossils exist of other members of the Dugongidae.

Molecular studies have been made on dugong populations using mitochondrial DNA. The results have suggested that the population of Southeast Asia is distinct from the others. Australia has two distinct maternal lineages, one of which also contains the dugongs from Africa and Arabia. Limited genetic mixing has taken place between those in Southeast Asia and those in Australia, mostly around Timor. One of the lineages stretches from Moreton Bay to Western Australia, while the other only stretches from Moreton Bay to the Northern Territory. There is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear boundaries between distinct groups.

==Anatomy and morphology==
The dugong&#x27;s body is large with a cylindrical shape that tapers at both ends. It has thick, smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth, but darkens dorsally and laterally to brownish-to-dark-grey with age. The colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of algae on the skin. The body is sparsely covered in short hair, a common feature among sirenians which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment. These hairs are most developed around the mouth, which has a large horseshoe-shaped upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle. This muscular upper lip aids the dugong in foraging.
The dugong&#x27;s tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of dolphins. These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. The dugong lacks nails on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong&#x27;s body length. The tail has deep notches.

A dugong&#x27;s brain weighs a maximum of , about 0.1% of the animal&#x27;s body weight. With very small eyes, dugongs have limited vision, but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds. Their ears, which lack pinnae, are located on the sides of their head. The nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves. Dugongs have two teats, one located behind each flipper. There are few differences between the sexes; the body structures are almost the same. A male&#x27;s testes are not externally located, and the main difference between males and females is the location of the genital aperture to the umbilicus and the anus. The lungs in a dugong are very long, extending almost as far as the kidneys, which are also highly elongated to cope with the saltwater environment. If the dugong is wounded, its blood will clot rapidly.
The skull of a dugong is unique. The skull is enlarged with a sharply down-turned premaxilla, which is stronger in males. The spine has between 57 and 60 vertebrae. Unlike in manatees, the dugong&#x27;s teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two incisors (tusks) which emerge in males during puberty. The female&#x27;s tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty, sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong, and the cheek teeth move forward with age.

The full dental formula of dugongs is , meaning they have two incisors, three premolars, and three molars on each side of their upper jaw, and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars on each side of their lower jaw. Like other sirenians, the dugong experiences pachyostosis, a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow. These heavy bones, which are among the densest in the animal kingdom, may act as a ballast to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water&#x27;s surface.

An adult&#x27;s length rarely exceeds . An individual this long is expected to weigh around . Weight in adults is typically more than and less than . The largest individual recorded was long and weighed , and was found off the Saurashtra coast of west India. Females tend to be larger than males.

==Distribution and habitat==
Dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa, along an estimated of coastline between 26° and 27° to the north and south of the equator. Their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the Potamogetonaceae and Hydrocharitaceae families. The full size of the former range is unknown, although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range, which is highly fractured. Their distributions during warmer periods of Holocene might have been broader than today. Today populations of dugongs are found in the waters of 37 countries and territories. Recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers, due to a lack of accurate surveys. Despite this, the dugong population is thought to be shrinking, with a worldwide decline of 20 percent in the last 90 years. They have disappeared from the waters of Hong Kong, Mauritius, and Taiwan, as well as parts of Cambodia, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Further disappearances are likely.

Dugongs are generally found in warm waters around the coast with large numbers concentrated in wide and shallow protected bays. The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal, as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree. Nonetheless, they can tolerate the brackish waters found in coastal wetlands, and large numbers are also found in wide and shallow mangrove channels and around leeward sides of large inshore islands, where seagrass beds are common. They are usually located at a depth of around , although in areas where the continental shelf remains shallow dugongs have been known to travel more than from the shore, descending to as far as , where deepwater seagrasses such as &quot;Halophila spinulosa&quot; are found. Special habitats are used for different activities. It has been observed that shallow waters are used as sites for calving, minimizing the risk of predation. Deep waters may provide a thermal refuge from cooler waters closer to the shore during winter.

===Australia===
Australia is home to the largest population, stretching from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland. The population of Shark Bay is thought to be stable with over 10,000 dugongs. Smaller populations exist up the coast, including one in Ashmore Reef. Large numbers of dugongs live to the north of the Northern Territory, with a population of over 20,000 in the Gulf of Carpentaria alone. A population of over 25,000 exists in the Torres Strait such as off Thursday Island, although there is significant migration between the strait and the waters of New Guinea. 

The Great Barrier Reef provides important feeding areas for the species; this reef area houses a stable population of around 10,000, although the population concentration has shifted over time. Large bays facing north on the Queensland coast provide significant habitats for dugong, with the southernmost of these being Hervey Bay and Moreton Bay. Dugongs had been occasional visitors along the Gold Coast where a re-establishment of a local population through range expansions has started recently.

===Persian Gulf===
The Persian Gulf has the second-largest dugong population in the world, inhabiting most of the southern coast, and the current population is believed to range from 5,800 to 7,300. In the course of a study carried out in 1986 and 1999 on the Persian Gulf, the largest reported group sighting was made of more than 600 individuals to the west of Qatar. A 2017 study found a nearly 25% drop in population since 1950. Reasons for this drastic population loss include illegal poaching, oil spills, and net entanglement.

===East Africa and South Asia===
In the late 1960s, herds of up to 500 dugongs were observed off the coast of East Africa and nearby islands. Current populations in this area are extremely small, numbering 50 and below, and it is thought likely they will become extinct. The eastern side of the Red Sea is home to large populations numbering in the hundreds, and similar populations are thought to exist on the western side. In the 1980s, it was estimated there could be as many as 4,000 dugongs in the Red Sea. Dugong populations in Madagascar are poorly studied, but due to widespread exploitation, it is thought they may have severely declined, with few surviving individuals. The resident population around Mayotte is thought to number just 10 individuals. In Mozambique, most of the remaining local populations are very small and the largest (about 120 individuals) occurs at Bazaruto Island, but they have become rare in historical habitats such as in Maputo Bay and on Inhaca Island. The Bazaruto Island population is possibly the last long-term viable population in East Africa, with only some of its core territory lying within protected waters.

The East African population is genetically distinct from those of the Red Sea and those off Madagascar. In Tanzania, observations have recently increased around the Mafia Island Marine Park where a hunt was intended by fishermen but failed in 2009. In the Seychelles, dugongs had been regarded as extinct in the 18th century until a small number was discovered around the Aldabra Atoll. This population may belong to a different group than that distributed among the inner isles. Dugongs once thrived among the Chagos Archipelago and Sea Cow Island was named after the species, although the species no longer occurs in the region.

There are less than 250 individuals scattered throughout Indian waters. A highly isolated breeding population exists in the Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch, the only remaining population in western India. It is from the population in the Persian Gulf, and from the nearest population in India. Former populations in this area, centered on the Maldives and the Lakshadweep, are presumed to be extinct. A population exists in the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, but it is seriously depleted. Recoveries of seagrass beds along former ranges of dugongs, such as the Chilika Lake have been confirmed in recent years, raising hopes for re-colorizations of the species. The population around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is known only from a few records, and although the population was large during British rule, it is now believed to be small and scattered.

===Southeast Asia and the West Pacific===
A small population existed along the southern coast of China, particularly the Gulf of Tonkin (Beibu Gulf), where efforts were made to protect it, including the establishment of a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna ranging in Guangxi. Despite these efforts, numbers continued to decrease, and in 2007 it was reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of Hainan. Historically, dugongs were also present in the southern parts of the Yellow Sea. The last confirmed record of dugongs in Chinese waters was documented in 2008. In August 2022, an article published on the Royal Society Open Science concluded that dugongs were functionally extinct in China, which was based on a large-scale interview survey conducted across four southern Chinese maritime provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian) in the summer of 2019.

In Vietnam, dugongs have been restricted mostly to the provinces of Kiên Giang and Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu, including Phu Quoc Island and Con Dao Island, which hosted large populations in the past. Con Dao is now the only site in Vietnam where dugongs are regularly seen, protected within the Côn Đảo National Park. Nonetheless, dangerously low levels of attention to the conservation of marine organisms in Vietnam and Cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catches, and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugongs. On Phu Quoc, the first &#x27;Dugong Festival&#x27; was held in 2014, aiming to raise awareness of these issues.

In Thailand, the present distribution of dugongs is restricted to six provinces along the Andaman Sea, and very few dugongs are present in the Gulf of Thailand. The Gulf of Thailand was historically home to a large number of animals, but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent years, and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining. Dugongs are believed to exist in the Straits of Johor in very small numbers. The waters around Borneo support a small population, with more scattered throughout the Malay Archipelago.

All the islands of the Philippines once provided habitats for sizeable herds of dugongs. They were common until the 1970s when their numbers declined sharply due to accidental drownings in fishing gear and habitat destruction of seagrass meadows. Today, only isolated populations survive, most notably in the waters of the Calamian Islands in Palawan, Isabela in Luzon, Guimaras, and Mindanao. The dugong became the first marine animal protected by Philippine law, with harsh penalties for harming them. Recently, the local marine trash problem in the archipelago remained unabated and became the biggest threat to the already dwindling population of Dugongs in the country. Litters of plastic waste (single-use sachets, plastic bottles, fast food to-go containers, etc.) and other non-biodegradable materials abound in the coastal areas. As these materials may be mistaken as food by dugongs, these may lead to death due to plastic ingestion. Overpopulation and lack of education of all coastal fisherfolk in the Philippines regarding marine trash are harming the coastal environment not only in Palawan but also across the islands of the Philippines. The first documented sighting in Sarangani Bay occurred in July 2024.

Populations also exist around the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, stretching to an easternmost population in Vanuatu. A highly isolated population lives around the islands of Palau.

A single dugong lives at Cocos (Keeling) Islands although the animal is thought to be a vagrant.

===Northern Pacific===
Today, possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugongs exists around the Ryukyu islands, and a population formerly existed off Taiwan. An endangered population of 50 or fewer dugongs, possibly as few as three individuals, survives around Okinawa. New sightings of a cow and calf have been reported in 2017, indicating a possible breeding had occurred in these waters. A single individual was recorded at Amami Ōshima, at the northernmost edge of the dugong&#x27;s historic range, more than 40 years after the last previous recorded sighting. A vagrant strayed into a port near Ushibuka, Kumamoto, and died due to poor health. Historically, the Yaeyama Islands held a large concentration of dugongs, with more than 300 individuals. On the Aragusuku Islands, large quantities of skulls are preserved at a utaki that outsiders are strictly forbidden to enter. Dugong populations in these areas were reduced by historical hunts as payments to the Ryukyu Kingdom, before being wiped out because of large-scale illegal hunting and fishing using destructive methods such as dynamite fishing after the Second World War.

Populations around Taiwan appear to be almost extinct, although remnant individuals may visit areas with rich seagrass beds such as Dongsha Atoll. Some of the last reported sightings were made in Kenting National Park in the 1950s and 60s. There had been occasional records of vagrants at the Northern Mariana Islands before 1985. It is unknown how much mixing there was between these populations historically. Some theorize that populations existed independently, for example, that the Okinawan population was isolated members derived from the migration of a Philippine subspecies. Others postulate that the populations formed part of a super-population where migration between Ryukyu, Taiwan, and the Philippines was common.

===Extinct Mediterranean population===
It has been confirmed that dugongs once inhabited the water of the Mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilizations along the inland sea. This population possibly shared ancestry with the Red Sea population, and the Mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factors and climate changes. The Mediterranean is the region where the Dugongidae originated in the mid-late Eocene, along with Caribbean Sea.

==Ecology and life history==
Dugongs are long-lived, and the oldest recorded specimen reached age 73. They have few natural predators, although animals such as crocodiles, killer whales, and sharks pose a threat to the young, and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb. A large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs. Detected pathogens include helminths, cryptosporidium, different types of bacterial infections, and other unidentified parasites. 30% of dugong deaths in Queensland since 1996 are thought to be because of disease.

Although they are social animals, they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations. Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen, but they last only for a short time. Because they are shy and do not approach humans, little is known about dugong behavior. They can go six minutes without breathing (though about two and a half minutes is more typical), and have been known to rest on their tails to breathe with their heads above water. They can dive to a maximum depth of ; they spend most of their lives no deeper than . Communication between individuals is through chirps, whistles, barks, and other sounds that echo underwater. Different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies, implying different purposes. Visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight and is mainly used for activities such as lekking for courtship purposes. Mothers and calves are in almost constant physical contact, and calves have been known to reach out and touch their mothers with their flippers for reassurance.

Dugongs are semi-nomadic, often traveling long distances in search of food, but staying within a certain range their entire lives. Large numbers often move together from one area to another. It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability. Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels. Dugong movements mostly occur within a localized area of seagrass beds, and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement. Daily movement is affected by the tides. In areas where there is a large tidal range, dugongs travel with the tide to access shallower feeding areas. In Moreton Bay, dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters. At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter. Occasionally individual dugongs make long-distance travels over many days and can travel over deep ocean waters. One animal was seen as far south as Sydney. Although they are marine creatures, dugongs have been known to travel up creeks, and in one case a dugong was caught up a creek near Cooktown.

===Feeding===

Dugongs, along with other sirenians, are referred to as &quot;sea cows&quot; because their diet consists mainly of seagrass, particularly the genera &quot;Halophila&quot; and &quot;Halodule&quot;. When eating they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce. Although almost completely herbivorous, they will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases. In other southern areas of both western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. This does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas, in which fecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eaten.

Most dugongs do not feed on lush areas, but where the seagrass is more sparse. Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed. The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass are important, and the grass species most often eaten are low in fiber, high in nitrogen, and easily digestible. In the Great Barrier Reef, dugongs feed on low-fiber high-nitrogen seagrass such as &quot;Halophila&quot; and &quot;Halodule&quot;, to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating. Seagrasses of a lower seral are preferred, where the area has not fully vegetated. Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption, due to the dugong&#x27;s highly specialized diet. There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels. Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass. Feeding trails have been observed as deep as , and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as . Dugongs are relatively slow-moving, swimming at around . When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins.

Dugong feeding may favor the subsequent growth of low-fibre, high-nitrogen seagrasses such as &quot;Halophilia&quot; and &quot;Halodule.&quot; Species such as &quot;Zosteria capricorni&quot; are more dominant in established seagrass beds, but grow slowly, while &quot;Halophilia&quot; and &quot;Halodule&quot; grow quickly in the open space left by dugong feeding. This behavior is known as cultivation grazing and favors the rapidly growing, higher nutrient seagrasses that dugongs prefer. Dugongs may also prefer to feed on younger, less fibrous strands of seagrasses, and cycles of cultivation feeding at different seagrass meadows may provide them with a greater number of younger plants.

Due to their poor eyesight, dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants. They also have a strong tactile sense and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles. They will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it. They have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them. The flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants. This leaves furrows in the sand in their path.

===Reproduction and parental care===
A dugong reaches sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen, older than in most other mammals. The way that females know how a male has reached sexual maturity is by the eruption of tusks in the male since tusks erupt in males when testosterone levels reach a high enough level. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years, while others place it as early as six years. There is evidence that male dugongs lose fertility at older ages. 

Despite the longevity of the dugong, which may live for 50 years or more, females give birth only a few times during their lives and invest considerable parental care in their young. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2.4 to 7 years.

Mating behaviour varies between populations located in different areas. In some populations, males will establish a territory that females in estrus will visit. In these areas, a male will try to impress the females while defending the area from other males, a practice known as lekking. In other areas many males will attempt to mate with the same female, sometimes inflicting injuries to the female or each other. During this, the female will have copulated with multiple males, who will have fought to mount her from below. This greatly increases the chances of conception.

Females give birth after a 13- to 15-month gestation, usually to just one calf. Birth occurs in very shallow water, with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore. As soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath. Newborns are already long and weigh around . Once born, they stay close to their mothers, possibly to make swimming easier. The calf nurses for 14–18 months, although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth. A calf will only leave its mother once it has matured.

==Importance to humans==
Dugongs have historically provided easy targets for hunters, who killed them for their meat, oil, skin, and bones. As the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn has noted, they are often considered the inspiration for mermaids, and people around the world developed cultures around dugong hunting. In some areas, it remains an animal of great significance, and a growing ecotourism industry around dugongs has had an economic benefit in some countries.
There is a 5,000-year-old wall painting of a dugong, apparently drawn by Neolithic peoples, in Tambun Cave, Ipoh, Malaysia. This was discovered by Lieutenant R.L. Rawlings in 1959 while on a routine patrol.

Dugongs feature in Southeast Asian, especially Austronesian, folklore. In languages like Ilocano, Mapun, Yakan, Tausug, and Kadazan Dusun of the Philippines and Sabah, the name for dugongs is a synonym for &quot;mermaid&quot;. In Malay, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;perempoen laut&quot; (&quot;woman of the sea&quot;) or &quot;putri duyong&quot; (&quot;dugong princess&quot;), leading to the misconception that the word &quot;dugong&quot; itself means &quot;lady of the sea&quot;. A common belief found in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, is that dugongs were originally human or part-human (usually women), and that they cry when they are butchered or beached. Because of this, it is considered bad luck if a dugong is killed or accidentally dies in nets or fish corrals in the Philippines, some parts of Sabah (Malaysia), and northern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesia). Dugongs are predominantly not traditionally hunted for food in these regions and they remained plentiful until around the 1970s.

Conversely, dugong &quot;tears&quot; are considered aphrodisiacs in other parts of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Dugong meat is considered a luxury food and is also believed to have aphrodisiac properties. They are actively hunted in these regions, in some places to near-extinction.

In Palau, dugongs were traditionally hunted with heavy spears from canoes. Although it is illegal and there is widespread disapproval of killing dugongs, poaching remains a major problem. Dugongs are also widely hunted in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia; where their meat and ornaments made from bones and tusks are highly prized in feasts and traditional rituals. However, hunting dugongs is considered taboo in some areas of Vanuatu. Dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable foods of Australian Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Some Aboriginals regard dugongs as part of their Aboriginality.

Local fishermen in Southern China traditionally revered dugongs and regarded them as &quot;miraculous fish&quot;. They believed it was bad luck to catch them and they were plentiful in the region before the 1960s. Beginning in the 1950s, a wave of immigrants from other regions that do not hold these beliefs resulted in dugongs being hunted for food and traditional Chinese medicine. This led to a steep decline in dugong populations in the Gulf of Tonkin and the sea around Hainan Island. In Japan, dugongs have been traditionally hunted in the Ryukyu Islands since prehistoric times. Carved ribs of dugongs in the shape of butterflies (a psychopomp) are found throughout Okinawa. They were commonly hunted throughout Japan up until around the 1970s.

Dugongs have also played a role in legends in Kenya, and the animal is known there as the &quot;Queen of the Sea&quot;. Body parts are used as food, medicine, and decorations. In the Gulf states, dugongs served not only as a source of food but their tusks were used as sword handles. Dugong oil is important as a preservative and conditioner for wooden boats to people around the Gulf of Kutch in India, who also believe the meat to be an aphrodisiac.

==Conservation==

Dugong numbers have decreased in recent times. For a population to remain stable, the mortality of adults cannot exceed 5% annually. The estimated percentage of females humans can kill without depleting the population is 1–2%. This number is reduced in areas where calving is minimal due to food shortages. Even in the best conditions, a population is unlikely to increase more than 5% a year, leaving dugongs vulnerable to over-exploitation. The fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity. Research on dugongs and the effects of human activity on them has been limited, mostly taking place in Australia. In many countries, dugong numbers have never been surveyed. As such, trends are uncertain, with more data needed for comprehensive management. The only data stretching back far enough to mention population trends comes from the urban coast of Queensland, Australia. The last major worldwide study, made in 2002, concluded that the dugong was declining and possibly extinct in a third of its range, with unknown status in another half.

The IUCN Red List lists the dugong as vulnerable, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulates and in some areas has banned international trade. Most dugong habitats fall within proposed important marine mammal areas. Regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal, and in 1998 there was strong support for Southeast Asian cooperation to protect dugongs. Kenya has passed legislation banning the hunting of dugongs and restricting trawling, but the dugong is not yet listed under Kenya&#x27;s Wildlife Act as an endangered species. Mozambique has had legislation to protect dugongs since 1955, but this has not been effectively enforced. France has a National Action Plan covering the species, implemented within the Mayotte Marine Natural Park. 

Many marine parks have been established on the African coast of the Red Sea, and the Egyptian Gulf of Aqaba is fully protected. The United Arab Emirates has banned all hunting of dugongs within its waters, as has Bahrain. The UAE has additionally banned drift net fishing, and has declared an intention to restore coastal ecosystems dugongs rely on. India and Sri Lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugongs and their products. Japan has listed dugongs as endangered and has banned intentional killing and harassment. Hunting, catching, and harassment are banned by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The first marine mammal to be protected in the Philippines was the dugong, although monitoring this is difficult. Palau has legislated to protect dugongs, although this is not well enforced and poaching persists. Indonesia listed dugongs as a protected species in 1999, and in 2018 the Fisheries Ministry began implementing a conservation plan. Protection is not always enforced and souvenir products made from dugong parts can be openly found in markets in Bali. Traditional dugong hunters continued to hunt for many years, and some have struggled to find alternative incomes after ceasing. The dugong is a national animal of Papua New Guinea, which bans all except traditional hunting. Vanuatu and New Caledonia ban the hunting of dugongs. Dugongs are protected throughout Australia, although the rules vary by state; in some areas, indigenous hunting is allowed. 

Dugongs are listed under the Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable. Most currently live in established marine parks, where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted. The World Wide Fund for Nature has purchased gillnet licences in northern Queensland to reduce the impact of fishing. In Vietnam, an illegal network targeting dugongs had been detected and was shut down in 2012. Potential hunts along Tanzanian coasts by fishermen have raised concerns as well.

===Human activity===
Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related fatalities. Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths, although there are no precise statistics. Most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low, with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters. As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly prone to death due to entanglement. The use of shark nets has historically caused large numbers of deaths, and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks. Hunting has historically been a problem too, although in most areas they are no longer hunted, except in certain indigenous communities. In areas such as northern Australia, hunting has the greatest impact on the dugong population.

Vessel strikes have proved a problem for manatees, but the relevance of this to dugongs is unknown. Increasing boat traffic has increased danger, especially in shallow waters. Ecotourism has increased in some countries, although the effects remain undocumented. It has been seen to cause issues in areas such as Hainan due to environmental degradation. Modern farming practices and increased land clearing have also had an impact, and much of the coastline of dugong habitats is undergoing industrialization, with increasing human populations. Dugongs accumulate heavy metal ions in their tissues throughout their lives, more so than other marine mammals. The effects are unknown.

While international cooperation to form a conservative unit has been undertaken, socio-political needs are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing countries. The shallow waters are often used as a source of food and income, problems exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing. In many countries, legislation does not exist to protect dugongs, and if it does it is not enforced.

Oil spills are a danger to dugongs in some areas, as is land reclamation. In Okinawa, the small dugong population is threatened by United States military activity. Plans exist to build a military base close to the Henoko reef, and military activity also adds the threats of noise pollution, chemical pollution, soil erosion, and exposure to depleted uranium. The military base plans have been fought in US courts by some Okinawans, whose concerns include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitats. It was later revealed that the government of Japan was hiding evidence of the negative effects of ship lanes and human activities on dugongs observed during surveys carried out off Henoko reef. One of the three individuals has not been observed since June 2015, corresponding to the start of the excavation operations.

===Environmental degradation===
If dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young. Food shortages can be caused by many factors, such as a loss of habitat, death and decline in the quality of seagrass, and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity. Sewage, detergents, heavy metals, hypersaline water, herbicides, and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows. Human activity such as mining, trawling, dredging, land reclamation, and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it. This is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrass.

&quot;Halophila ovalis&quot;—one of the dugong&#x27;s preferred species of seagrass—declines rapidly due to lack of light, dying completely after 30 days. Extreme weather such as cyclones and floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometres of seagrass meadows, as well as wash dugongs ashore. The recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of seagrass into new areas, or areas where it has been destroyed, can take over a decade. Most measures for protection involve restricting activities such as trawling in areas containing seagrass meadows, with little to no action on pollutants originating from land. In some areas, water salinity is increased due to wastewater, and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstand.

Dugong habitat in the Oura Bay area of Henoko, Okinawa, Japan, is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by the Japanese Government in order to build a US Marine base in the area. In August 2014, preliminary drilling surveys were conducted around the seagrass beds there. The construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population&#x27;s habitat, possibly leading to local extinction.

===Capture and captivity===
The Australian state of Queensland has sixteen dugong protection parks, and some preservation zones have been established where even Aboriginal Peoples are not allowed to hunt. Capturing animals for research has caused only one or two deaths; dugongs are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mothers and calves spend together, and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugongs eat in an aquarium. Only one orphaned calf has ever been successfully kept in captivity.

Worldwide, only three dugongs are held in captivity. A female from the Philippines lives at Toba Aquarium in Toba, Mie, Japan. A male also lived there until he died on 10 February 2011. The second resides in Sea World Indonesia, after having been rescued from a fisherman&#x27;s net and treated. The last one, a male, is kept at Sydney Aquarium, where he has resided since he was a juvenile. Sydney Aquarium had a second dugong for many years, until she died in 2018.

Gracie, a captive dugong at Underwater World, Singapore, was reported to have died in 2014 at the age of 19, from complications arising from an acute digestive disorder.

<text>An 8.3 filename (also called a short filename or SFN) is one that obeys the filename convention used by CP/M and old versions of DOS and versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5. It is also used in modern Microsoft operating systems as an alternate filename to the long filename, to provide compatibility with legacy programs. The filename convention is limited by the FAT file system. Similar 8.3 file naming schemes have also existed on earlier CP/M, TRS-80, Atari, and some Data General and Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer operating systems.

==Overview==
8.3 filenames are limited to at most eight characters (after any directory specifier), followed optionally by a filename extension consisting of a period and at most three further characters. For systems that only support 8.3 filenames, excess characters are ignored. If a file name has no extension, a trailing has no significance (that is, and are equivalent). Furthermore, file and directory names are uppercase in this system, even though systems that use the 8.3 standard are usually case-insensitive (making equivalent to the name ). However, on non-8.3 operating systems (such as almost any modern operating system) accessing 8.3 file systems (including DOS-formatted floppy disks, but also including some modern memory cards and networked file systems), the underlying system may alter filenames internally to preserve case and avoid truncating letters in the names, for example in the case of VFAT.

===VFAT and computer-generated 8.3 filenames===
VFAT, a variant of FAT with an extended directory format, was introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5. It allowed mixed-case Unicode long filenames (LFNs) in addition to classic 8.3 names by using multiple 32-byte directory entry records for long filenames (in such a way that old 8.3 system software will only recognize one as the valid directory entry).

To maintain backward-compatibility with legacy applications (on DOS and Windows 3.1), on FAT and VFAT filesystems, the operating system automatically generates an 8.3 filename for every LFN, through which the file can [also] be opened, renamed, or deleted, although the generated name (e.g. ) may show little similarity to the original. The generation of 8.3 filenames on NTFS filesystems can be turned off system-wide (with risks). The 8.3 filename can be obtained using the Kernel32.dll function GetShortPathName.

Although there is no compulsory algorithm for creating the 8.3 name from an LFN, Windows uses the following convention:
# If the LFN is 8.3 uppercase, no LFN will be stored on disk at all.
#* Example: 
# If the LFN is 8.3 mixed case, the LFN will store the mixed-case name, while the 8.3 name will be an uppercase version of it.
#* Example: becomes .
# If the filename contains characters not allowed in an 8.3 name (including space which was disallowed by convention though not by the APIs) or either part is too long, the name is stripped of invalid characters such as spaces and extra periods. If the name begins with periods the leading periods are removed. Other characters such as are changed to the underscore , and letters are put in uppercase. The stripped name is then truncated to the first 6 letters of its basename, followed by a tilde, followed by a single digit, followed by a period , followed by the first 3 characters of the extension.
#* Example: becomes (or , should already exist). becomes . becomes 
# On all NT versions including Windows 2000 and later, if at least 4 files or folders already exist with the same extension and first 6 characters in their short names, the stripped LFN is instead truncated to the first 2 letters of the basename (or 1 if the basename has only 1 letter), followed by 4 hexadecimal digits derived from an undocumented hash of the filename, followed by a tilde, followed by a single digit, followed by a period , followed by the first 3 characters of the extension.
#* Example: becomes .
# On Windows 95, 98 and ME, if more than 9 files or folders with the same extension and first 6 characters and in their short names (so that through suffixes aren&#x27;t enough to resolve the collision), the name is further truncated to 5 letters, followed by a tilde, followed by two digits starting from 10, followed by a period and the first 3 characters of the extension.
#* Example: becomes if through all exist already.

During the 2001 Microsoft antitrust case, the names MICROS~1 and MICROS~2 were humorously used to refer to the companies that might exist after a proposed split of Microsoft.

NTFS, a file system used by the Windows NT family, supports LFNs natively, but 8.3 names are still available for legacy applications. Windows NTVDM are known to use 8.3 names. This can optionally be disabled system-wide to improve performance in situations where large numbers of similarly named files exist in the same folder. 8.3 filename creation can be disabled system-wide and/or per-volume, and existing 8.3 filenames can be stripped using or a Registry key.

The ISO 9660 file system (mainly used on compact discs) has similar limitations at the most basic Level 1, with the additional restriction that directory names cannot contain extensions and that some characters (notably hyphens) are not allowed in filenames. Level 2 allows filenames of up to 31 characters, more compatible with classic AmigaOS and classic Mac OS filenames.

On VFAT and NTFS file systems, 8.3 filenames are stored as ANSI encoding, for backward-compatibility.

The ReFS no longer supports 8.3 filenames.

==Compatibility==
This legacy technology is used in a wide range of products and devices, as a standard for interchanging information, such as compact flash cards used in cameras. VFAT LFN long filenames introduced by Windows 95/98/ME retained compatibility, but the VFAT LFN used on NT-based systems (Windows NT/2K/XP) uses a modified 8.3 shortname.

If a filename contains only lowercase letters, or is a combination of a lowercase &quot;basename&quot; with an uppercase &quot;extension&quot;, or vice versa; and has no special characters, and fits within the 8.3 limits, a VFAT entry is not created on Windows NT and later versions such as XP. Instead, two bits in byte 0x0c of the directory entry are used to indicate that the filename should be considered as entirely or partially lowercase. Specifically, bit 4 means lowercase &quot;extension&quot; and bit 3 lowercase &quot;basename&quot;, which allows for combinations such as or but not . Few other operating systems support this. This creates a backward-compatibility filename mangling problem with older Windows versions (95, 98, ME) that see all-uppercase filenames if this extension has been used, and therefore can change the capitalization of a file when it is transported, such as on a USB flash drive. This can cause problems for operating systems that do not exhibit the case-insensitive filename behavior as DOS and Windows do. Linux will recognize this extension when reading; the mount option &quot;shortname&quot; determines whether this feature is used when writing.
For MS-DOS, Henrik Haftmann&#x27;s DOSLFN may be used.

==Directory table==

A directory table is a special type of file that represents a directory. Each file or directory stored within it is represented by a 32-byte entry in the table. Each entry records the name, extension, attributes (archive, directory, hidden, read-only, system and volume), the date and time of creation, the address of the first cluster of the file/directory&#x27;s data and finally the size of the file/directory.

Legal characters for DOS filenames include the following:
* Uppercase letters –
* Numbers –
* Space (though trailing spaces in either the base name or the extension are considered to be padding and not a part of the filename, also filenames with spaces in them must be enclosed in quotes to be used on a DOS command line, and if the DOS command is built programmatically, the filename must be enclosed in double double-quotes (...) when viewed as a variable within the program building the DOS command.)
* Values 128–255 (though if NLS services are active in DOS, some characters interpreted as lowercase are invalid and unavailable)

This excludes the following ASCII characters:
* , , , , , , , , codice_1, , , , , , codice_2MS-DOS has no shell escape character
* () within name and extension fields, except in and entries (see below)
* Lowercase letters –, stored as – on FAT12/FAT16
* Control characters 0–31
* Value 127 (DEL) 

The DOS filenames are in the OEM character set.
Code 0xE5 as the first byte (see below) causes issues when extra-ASCII characters are used.

Directory entries, both in the Root Directory Region and in subdirectories, are of the following format:


==Working with short filenames in a command prompt==
Sometimes it may be desirable to convert a long filename to a short filename, for example when working with the command prompt. A few simple rules can be followed to attain the correct 8.3 filename.

# A SFN filename can have at most 8 characters before the dot. If it has more than that, the first 6 must be written, then a tilde as the seventh character and a number (usually 1) as the eighth. The number distinguishes it from other files with both the same first six letters and the same extension.
# Dots are important and must be used even for folder names (if there is a dot in the folder name). If there are multiple dots in the long file/directory name, only the last one is used. The preceding dots should be ignored. If there are more characters than three after the final dot, only the first three are used.
# Generally:
#*Any spaces in the filenames should be ignored when converting to SFN.
#*Ignore all periods except the last one. Do not include any other periods, just like the spaces. Use the last period if any, and the next characters (up to 3). For instance, for .manifest, .man only would be used.
#* Commas, square brackets, semicolons, = signs and + signs are changed to underscores.
#* Case is not important; upper case and lower case characters are treated equally.

To find out for sure the SFN or 8.3 names of the files in a directory

use: shows the short names if there is one, and the long names.

or: shows only the short names, in the original DIR listing format.

In Windows NT-based operating systems, the command prompt applet (cmd.exe) accepts long filenames with wildcard characters (question mark and asterisk ); long filenames with spaces in them need to be escaped (i.e. enclosed in single or double quotes).

Starting with Windows Vista, console commands and PowerShell applets perform limited pattern matching by allowing wildcards in filename and each subdirectory in the file path and silently substituting the first matching directory entry (for example, will change the current directory to ).

<text>IBM 8514 is a graphics card manufactured by IBM and introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of personal computers in 1987. It supports a display resolution of pixels with 256 colors at 43.5 Hz (interlaced), or at 60 Hz (non-interlaced). 8514 usually refers to the display controller hardware (such as the 8514/A display adapter). However, IBM sold the companion CRT monitor (for use with the 8514/A) which carries the same designation, 8514.

The 8514 uses a standardised API called the &quot;Adapter Interface&quot; or AI. This interface is also used by XGA, IBM Image Adapter/A, and clones of the 8514/A and XGA such as the ATI Technologies Mach series and IIT &quot;AGX&quot;. The interface allows computer software to offload common 2D-drawing operations (line-draw, color-fill, and block copies via a blitter) onto the 8514 hardware. This frees the host CPU for other tasks, and greatly improves the speed of redrawing a graphics visual (such as a pie-chart or CAD-illustration).

The 8514 initially sold for $1290 for the adapter and $270 for the 512KB memory expansion (equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in ). The 8514/A required a Micro Channel architecture bus at a time when ISA systems were standard.

==History==
The 8514 was introduced with the IBM PS/2 computers in April 1987. It was an optional upgrade to the Micro Channel architecture based PS/2&#x27;s Video Graphics Array (VGA), and was delivered within three months of PS/2&#x27;s introduction.

Although not the first PC video card to support hardware acceleration, IBM&#x27;s 8514 is often credited as the first PC mass-market fixed-function accelerator. Up until the 8514&#x27;s introduction, PC graphics acceleration was relegated to expensive workstation-class, graphics coprocessor boards. Coprocessor boards (such as the TARGA Truevision series) were designed around special CPU or digital signal processor chips which were programmable. Fixed-function accelerators, such as the 8514, sacrificed programmability for better cost/performance ratio.

Later compatible 8514 boards were based on the Texas Instruments TMS34010 chip.

Even though the 8514 was not a best-seller, it created a market for fixed-function PC graphics accelerators which grew exponentially in the early 1990s. 

The &quot;ATI Mach 8&quot; and &quot;Mach 32&quot; chips were popular clones, and several companies (notably S3) designed graphics accelerator chips which were not register compatible but were conceptually very similar to the 8514/A.

The 8514 was superseded by IBM XGA. 

The VESA Group introduced a common standardized way to access features like hardware cursors, Bit Block transfers (Bit Blt), off screen sprites, hardware panning, drawing and other functions with VBE/accelerator functions (VBE/AF) in August 1996.

==Software support==
Software that supported this graphic standard:

*OS/2
*Windows 2.1
*Windows 3.x
*Windows 95
*XFree86 2.1.1
*AutoCAD 10
*QuikMenu
*Any BGI software using &quot;IBM8514.BGI&quot;

==Output capabilities==
The 8514 offered:
* graphics with 256 colors out of 262,144 (18 bit RGB); text mode with 80×34 characters;
* graphics with 256 colors out of 262,144 (18 bit RGB); text mode with 85×38 or 146×51 characters;

Latter clone board offered additional resolutions:
* with 16-bit and 24-bit color depths
* with 16-bit and 24-bit color depths

==Clones==
In the late 1980s, several companies cloned the 8514/A often for the ISA bus. Notable among those was Western Digital Imaging&#x27;s &quot;PWGA-1&quot; (also known as the &quot;WD9500&quot; chip set), the Chips &amp; Technologies &quot;82C480&quot;, and ATI&#x27;s &quot;Mach8&quot; and later &quot;Mach32&quot; chips. In one way or another, the clones were all better than the original with more speed, enhanced drawing functionality and overall improved video mode selections. Clone support for non-interlaced modes at resolutions like 800×600 and 1280×1024 was typical, and all clones had longer command queues for increased performance.

*ATI Technologies: the &quot;Mach8&quot;, &quot;Mach32&quot;, &quot;Graphics Vantage&quot; and &quot;8514/Ultra&quot;
*Chips and Technologies: &quot;F82C480 B EIZO - AA40&quot; and &quot;F82C481 Miro Magic Plus&quot;
*Matrox: &quot;MG-108&quot;
*Paradise Systems: &quot;Plus-A&quot;, Renaissance &quot;Rendition II&quot;
*Desktop Computing: &quot;AGA 1024 (also capable of emulating TIGA standards)&quot;
*NEC: &quot;Multisync Graphics Engine&quot;
*IIT &quot;AGX&quot; and Tseng Labs ET4000 are also referenced as being IBM 8514 compatible.

<text>88open was an industry standards group set up by Motorola in 1988 to standardize Unix systems on their Motorola 88000 RISC CPU systems. At its peak, the spinoff 88open Consortium Ltd. had a staff of 30 people and over 50 supporters. The effort was largely a failure, at least in terms of attracting attention to the 88000 platform. The group was closed in favor of the AIM alliance, and the 88000 platform was folded into AIM&#x27;s PowerPC.

==Members==
Motorola provided 50% of the financial support for the consortium. Early members were Data General, Convergent, and Tektronix. By May 1988, 28 companies had joined with 7 not releasing their names.

<doc id="60255" wikidata="Q379732" url="?curid=60255" title="California sea lion">
<text>The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America. It is one of six species of sea lions. Its natural habitat ranges from southeast Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. California sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck, and a protruding sagittal crest. They mainly haul out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. California sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and great white sharks.

California sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories and try to attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. California sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, California sea lions spend much of their time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.

California sea lions are particularly intelligent, can be trained to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. To protect fish, the US states of Oregon and Washington engage in annual kill quotas of California sea lions.

==Taxonomy==

The California sea lion was described by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus &quot;Zalophus&quot;, which derives from the Greek words &quot;za&quot;, meaning &quot;intensive&quot;, and &quot;lophus,&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot;. This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.

Traditionally, the Galapagos sea lion and Japanese sea lion were classified as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the &quot;Zalophus&quot; sea lions, being a sister taxon.

==Appearance, physiology, and movement==
Being sexually dimorphic, California sea lions differ in size, shape, and coloration between the sexes. Males can grow up to long and weigh around , while females are typically around and weigh around . The heaviest recorded male weighed . Females and juveniles have a tawny brown pelage, although they may be temporarily light gray or silver after molting. The pelage of adult males can be anywhere from light brown to black, but is typically dark brown. The face of adult males may also be light tan in some areas. Pups have a black or dark brown pelage at birth. Although the species has a slender build, adult males have robust necks, chests, and shoulders. Adult males also have a protruding crest which gives them a &quot;high, domed forehead&quot;; it is tufted with white hairs. They also have manes, which are less developed than those of adult male South American and Steller sea lions. Both sexes have long, narrow muzzles.

As an otariid, the California sea lion relies on its foreflippers to propel itself when swimming. This form of aquatic locomotion, along with its streamlined body, effectively reduces drag underwater. Its foreflipper movement is not continuous; the animal glides in between each stroke. The flexibility of its spine allows the California sea lion to bend its neck backwards far enough to reach its hindflippers. This allows the animal to make dorsal turns and maintain a streamlined posture. When moving on land, the California sea lion is able to turn its hindflippers forward and walk on all fours. It moves the foreflippers in a transverse, rather than a sagittal, fashion. In addition, it relies on movements of its head and neck more than its hindflippers for terrestrial locomotion. California sea lions may travel at speeds of around , and can dive at depths of and for up to 9.9 minutes, though most dives are typically and last less than 3 minutes.
California sea lions have color vision, though it is limited to the blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an adaptation for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. California sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion&#x27;s vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well.

==Ecology==
===Range and habitat===

The California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the California sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.

Vagrants can reach the north-western Pacific such as on the Commander Islands. Although several otariinae have been recorded around the Japanese archipelago in recent years, their exact origins are unclear.
During the breeding season, California sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly up the Columbia River. In 2004, a healthy California sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half a mile from the San Joaquin River.

===Diet and predation===
California sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and seamounts. They may also search along the ocean bottom. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. California sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between from shore. Adult males may forage as far as from shore when water temperatures rise. They also have learned to feed on steelhead and salmon below fish ladders at Bonneville Dam and at other locations where fish must queue in order to pass through dams and locks that block their passage.

California sea lions are preyed on by orcas and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions appear to be the more common food items for transient mammal-eating orcas pods. The California sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. California sea lions are also common prey for great white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both great white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack California sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. California sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.
==Life history==
===Reproductive behavior and parenting===

California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male California sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Most fights occur during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. Since temperatures can reach over during this time, males must include water within their territories. Some territories are underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. California sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach.

Before mating begins, females gather into &quot;milling&quot; groups of 2–20 individuals. The females in these groups will mount each other as well as the males. These groups begin to disintegrate as the females begin to mate. The territorial and mating system of the California sea lion has been described as similar to a lek system, as females appear to choose their mates while moving through different territories. They avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic. Males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories, particularly in water. Mating may occur outside the rookeries, between non-territorial males and females, as the latter move to and from the mating site. In some rookeries, copulation may be monopolized by a few males, while at others, a single male may sire no more than four pups.

Female California sea lions have a 12-month reproductive cycle, consisting of a 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups onshore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups for up to a day. Pups left onshore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other&#x27;s calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.

===Communication===

California sea lions communicate with a range of vocalizations. The most commonly used one is their characteristic bark. Territorial males are the loudest and most continuous callers, and barks are produced constantly during the peak of the breeding season. California sea lions bark especially rapidly when excited. The barks of territorial and non-territorial males sound similar, although those of the former are deeper. Males may bark when threatening other males or during courtship. The only other vocalization made by territorial males is a &quot;prolonged hoarse grunt sound&quot; made when an individual is startled by a human. This vocalization is also made by groups of non-reproductive males.

Female California sea lions are less vocal. Their barks, high-pitched and shorter than those made by males, are used in aggressive situations. Other aggressive vocalizations given by females include the &quot;squeal&quot;, the &quot;belch&quot;, and the &quot;growl&quot;. The sound a female California sea lion gives when calling her pups is called a &quot;pup-attraction call&quot;, described as &quot;loud&quot; and &quot;brawling&quot;. Pups respond with a &quot;mother-response call&quot;, which is similar in structure. Pups will also bleat or bark when playing or in distress. California sea lions can produce vocalizations underwater. These include &quot;whinny&quot; sounds, barks, buzzings, and clicks.

===Nonbreeding activities===
Outside the breeding season, males migrate to the northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near the breeding rookeries. California sea lions can stay at sea for as long as two weeks at a time. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. California sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. California sea lions in the Gulf of California do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf of California year-round.

==Intelligence and trainability==

Marine biologist Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied the California sea lions&#x27; cognitive ability. They have discovered that California sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli&#x27;s common features. California sea lions have demonstrated the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language. However, California sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing her head in synchronization to musical rhythms.
This &quot;rhythmic entrainment&quot; was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry.
Because of their intelligence and trainability, California sea lions have been used by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. Trainers reward their animals with fish, which motivates them to perform. For ball balancing, trainers toss a ball at a California sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining an understanding of what to do. A California sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a behavior for the public. However, its memory allows it to perform a behavior even after three months of resting. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using California sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are &quot;exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors&quot; and distract the audience from the animal&#x27;s unnatural environment.

The California sea lion is used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals can swim behind divers approaching a US naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver&#x27;s leg. Navy officials say California sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. However, the Navy insists that California sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.

==Status==

The IUCN lists the California sea lion as Least Concern due to &quot;its large and increasing population size.&quot; The estimated population is 238,000–241,000 for the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, 75,000–85,000 for the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and 31,393 for the population in the Gulf of California. Off the Pacific coast of the United States, California sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity, while the Gulf of California population declined by 20% by 2008. California sea lions may be killed when in conflict with fishermen, by poaching, and by entanglements in human-made garbage. They are also threatened by pollutants like DDT and PCB which accumulate in the marine food chain.
In the United States, the California sea lion is protected on the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal. In 1994 an amendment to the Act allowed for the possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should the level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact on the decline or recovery of ESA-listed salmonids. Applications have been granted for removal of several individual California sea lions at Ballard Locks and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 California sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective.
Critics have objected to the killing of the California sea lions, pointing out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.

These animals exploit more human-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting California sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.

===2015 Californian shore sea lions pups crisis===
In January and February 2015, 1450 malnourished or sick California sea lion pups were found along stretches of the California coast, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed to unprecedentedly warm Pacific coastal waters, related to Pacific decadal oscillation and El Niño, as the likely cause. Elevated water temperatures reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the California sea lion pup diet during nursery season. This caused many California sea lion pups to starve, while others died when they took to open waters in search of food at too early an age.
Several months earlier, in the summer of 2014, a large number of Cassin&#x27;s auklet chicks died during the fledging period due to similar circumstances brought about by elevated water temperatures.

===Oregon and Washington state governments annual killings===
In November 2018, the State of Oregon obtained a permit to kill 93 California sea lions per year below Willamette Falls. Under a similar program, Oregon and Washington had killed over 150 California sea lions on the Columbia River by January 2019. In both cases, the purpose was to protect the local populations of fish (such as trout or salmon) from predation by the sea lions. In August 2020, the federal government authorized the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as well as six regional tribes to cull sea lions that preyed upon endangered species of fish in the Columbia River basin, allowing for the killing of up to 540 California sea lions and 176 Steller sea lions over the following five years. Between 2020 and April 2023, Oregon killed 99 sea lions as part of this program.

<text>Jean de La Fontaine (, ; ; 8 July 162113 April 1695) was a French fabulist and one of the most widely read French poets of the 17th century. He is known above all for his &quot;Fables&quot;, which provided a model for subsequent fabulists across Europe and numerous alternative versions in France, as well as in French regional languages.

After a long period of royal suspicion, he was admitted to the French Academy and his reputation in France has never faded since. Evidence of this is found in the many pictures and statues of the writer, later depictions on medals, coins and postage stamps.

==Life==

===Early years===
La Fontaine was born at Château-Thierry in France. His father was Charles de La Fontaine, maître des eaux et forêts – a kind of deputy-ranger – of the Duchy of Château-Thierry; his mother was Françoise Pidoux. Both sides of his family were of the highest provincial middle class; though they were not noble, his father was fairly wealthy.

Jean, the eldest child, was educated at the collège (grammar school) of Château-Thierry, and at the end of his school days he entered the Oratory in May 1641, and the seminary of Saint-Magloire in October of the same year; but a very short sojourn proved to him that he had mistaken his vocation. He then apparently studied law, and is said to have been admitted as &quot;avocat&quot;/lawyer.

===Family life===
He was, however, settled in life, or at least might have been so, somewhat early. In 1647 his father resigned his rangership in his favor, and arranged a marriage for him with Marie Héricart, a girl of fourteen, who brought him 20,000 livres, and expectations. She seems to have been both beautiful and intelligent, but the two did not get along well together. There appears to be absolutely no ground for the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was, for the most part, raised long afterwards by gossip or personal enemies of La Fontaine. All that can be positively said against her is that she was a negligent housewife and an inveterate novel reader; La Fontaine himself was constantly away from home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and was so bad a man of business that his affairs became involved in hopeless difficulty, and a financial separation of property (&quot;separation de biens&quot;) had to take place in 1658. This was a perfectly amicable transaction for the benefit of the family; by degrees, however, the pair, still without any actual quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the greater part of the last forty years of de la Fontaine&#x27;s life he lived in Paris while his wife remained in Château -Thierry which, however, he frequently visited. One son was born to them in 1653, and was educated and taken care of wholly by his mother.

===Paris===
Even in the earlier years of his marriage, La Fontaine seems to have been much in Paris, but it was not until about 1656 that he became a regular visitor to the capital. The duties of his office, which were only occasional, were compatible with this non-residence. It was not until he was past thirty that his literary career began. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke poetical fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing but trifles in the fashion of the time – epigrams, ballades, rondeaux, etc.

His first serious work was a translation or adaptation of the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; of Terence (1654). At this time the patron of French writing was the Superintendent Fouquet, to whom La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a connection of his wife&#x27;s. Few people who paid their court to Fouquet went away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension of 1000 livres (1659), on the easy terms of a copy of verses for each quarters receipt. He also began a medley of prose and poetry, entitled &quot;Le Songe de Vaux&quot;, on Fouquet&#x27;s famous country house.

It was about this time that his wife&#x27;s property had to be separately secured to her, and he seems by degrees to have had to sell everything that he owned; but, as he never lacked powerful and generous patrons, this was of small importance to him. In the same year he wrote a ballad, &quot;Les Rieurs du Beau-Richard&quot;, and this was followed by many small pieces of occasional poetry addressed to various personages from the king downwards. Fouquet fell out of favour with the king and was arrested. La Fontaine, like most of Fouquet&#x27;s literary protégés, showed some fidelity to him by writing the elegy &quot;Pleurez, Nymphes de Vaux&quot;.

Just at this time his affairs did not look promising. His father and he had assumed the title of esquire, to which they were not strictly entitled, and, some old edicts on the subject having been put in force, an informer procured a sentence against the poet fining him 2000 livres. He found, however, a new protector in the duke and still more in the Duchess of Bouillon, his feudal superiors at Château-Thierry, and nothing more is heard of the fine.

Some of La Fontaine&#x27;s liveliest verses are addressed to the duchess Marie Anne Mancini, the youngest of Mazarin&#x27;s nieces, and it is even probable that the taste of the duke and duchess for Ariosto had something to do with the writing of his first work of real importance, the first book of the &quot;Contes&quot;, which appeared in 1664. He was then forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.

=== Fame ===

It was about this time that the quartet of the Rue du Vieux Colombier, so famous in French literary history, was formed. It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau and Molière, the last of whom was almost of the same age as La Fontaine, the other two considerably younger. Chapelain was also a kind of outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, some evidently apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic is perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain&#x27;s unlucky &quot;Pucelle&quot; always lay on the table, a certain number of lines of which was the appointed punishment for offences against the company. The coterie furnished under feigned names the personages of La Fontaine&#x27;s version of the &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; story, which, however, with &quot;Adonis&quot;, was not printed till 1669.
Meanwhile, the poet continued to find friends. In 1664 he was regularly commissioned and sworn in as gentleman to the duchess dowager of Orléans, and was installed in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 we have something like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look into some malpractices at Château-Thierry. In the same year appeared the second book of the &quot;Contes&quot;, and in 1668 the first six books of the &quot;Fables&quot;, with more of both kinds in 1671. In this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating, at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince of Conti.

A year afterwards his situation, which had for some time been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing very much for the worse. The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.

===Academy===
In 1682 he was, at more than sixty years of age, recognized as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of &quot;Fables&quot; published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it is pretty certain that this was the general opinion. It was not unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the Académie française, and, though the subjects of his &quot;Contes&quot; were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.

He was first proposed in 1682, but was rejected for Marquis de Dangeau. The next year Colbert died and La Fontaine was again nominated. Boileau was also a candidate, but the first ballot gave the fabulist sixteen votes against seven only for the critic. The king, whose assent was necessary, not merely for election but for a second ballot in case of the failure of an absolute majority, was ill-pleased, and the election was left pending. Another vacancy occurred, however, some months later, and to this Boileau was elected. The king hastened to approve the choice effusively, adding, &quot;Vous pouvez incessamment recevoir La Fontaine, il a promis d&#x27;etre sage&quot;.

His admission was indirectly the cause of the only serious literary quarrel of his life. A dispute took place between the academy and one of its members, Antoine Furetière, on the subject of the latter&#x27;s French dictionary, which was decided to be a breach of the academy&#x27;s corporate privileges. Furetière, a man of no small ability, bitterly assailed those whom he considered to be his enemies, and among them La Fontaine, whose unlucky &quot;Contes&quot; made him peculiarly vulnerable, his second collection of these tales having been the subject of a police condemnation. The death of the author of the &quot;Roman Bourgeois&quot;, however, put an end to this quarrel.

Shortly afterwards La Fontaine had a share in a still more famous affair, the celebrated Ancient-and-Modern squabble in which Boileau and Charles Perrault were the chiefs, and in which La Fontaine (though he had been specially singled out by Perrault for better comparison with Aesop and Phaedrus) took the Ancient side. About the same time (1685–1687) he made the acquaintance of the last of his many hosts and protectors, Monsieur and Madame d&#x27;Hervart, and fell in love with a certain Madame Ulrich, a lady of some position but of doubtful character. This acquaintance was accompanied by a great familiarity with Vendôme, Chaulieu and the rest of the libertine coterie of the Temple; but, though Madame de la Sablière had long given herself up almost entirely to good works and religious exercises, La Fontaine continued an inmate of her house until her death in 1693. What followed is told in one of the best known of the many stories bearing on his childlike nature. Hervart on hearing of the death, had set out at once to find La Fontaine. He met him in the street in great sorrow, and begged him to make his home at his house. &quot;J&#x27;y allais&quot; was La Fontaine&#x27;s answer.
In 1692, the writer had published a revised edition of the &quot;Contes&quot;, although he suffered a severe illness. In that same year, La Fontaine converted to Christianity. A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the &quot;Contes&quot; and it is said that the destruction of a new play was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the Viaticum, and the following years he continued to write poems and fables.

A story is told of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon&#x27;s pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine recovered for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing his &quot;Fables&quot; among other things; but he did not survive Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the Père Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine&#x27;s remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.

===Anecdotes===
The curious personality of La Fontaine, like that of some other men of letters, has been enshrined in a kind of legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it; these anecdotes include: La Fontaine meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, &quot;Ah, yes, I thought I had seen him somewhere!&quot;; his insisting upon fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then cheerily imploring the same to visit at his house just as before; his going into company with his stockings wrong side out; &amp;c.—with, for a contrast, other tales of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness, in company.

It ought to be remembered, as a comment on the unfavourable description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere&#x27;s chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered that one of the chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine&#x27;s attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon &quot;le bonhomme&quot; or &quot;le bon&quot; (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, &quot;Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n&#x27;effaceront pas le bonhomme.&quot; They have not.

==Works==

The numerous works of La Fontaine fall into three traditional divisions: the Fables, the Tales and the miscellaneous (including dramatic) works. He is best known for the first of these, in which a tradition of fable collecting in French verse reaching back to the Middle Ages was brought to a peak. Although these earlier works refer to Aesop in their title, they collected many fables from more recent sources. Among the foremost were Marie de France&#x27;s &quot;Ysopet&quot; (1190) and Gilles Corrozet’s &quot;Les Fables du très ancien Esope, mises en rithme françoise&quot; (1542).

The publication of the twelve books of La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; extended from 1668 to 1694. The stories in the first six of these derive for the most part from Aesop and Horace and are pithily told in free verse. Those in the later editions are often taken from more recent sources or from translations of Eastern stories and are told at greater length. The deceptively simple verses are easily memorised, yet display deep insights into human nature. Many of the lines have entered the French language as standard phrases, often proverbial. The fables are also distinguished by their occasionally ironical ambivalence. The fable of &quot;The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter&quot; (IX.6), for example, reads like a satire on superstition, but its moralising conclusion that &quot;All men, as far as in them lies,/Create realities of dreams&quot; might equally be applied to religion as a whole.

The second division of his work, the tales (&quot;Contes et nouvelles en vers&quot;), were at one time almost equally as popular and their writing extended over a longer period. The first were published in 1664 and the last appeared posthumously. They were particularly marked by their archly licentious tone.

== Depictions and legacy ==
While the Fables have an international reputation, celebration of their author has largely been confined to France. Even in his own lifetime, such was his renown, he was painted by three leading portraitists. It was at the age of 63, on the occasion of his reception into the Académie française in 1684, that he was portrayed by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Nicolas de Largillière painted him at the age of 73, and a third portrait is attributed to François de Troy (see below).
Two contemporary sculptors made head and shoulders busts of La Fontaine. Jean-Jacques Caffieri’s was exhibited at the 1779 Salon and then given to the Comédie Française; Jean-Antoine Houdon’s dates from 1782. There are in fact two versions by Houdon, one now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and another at the castle of his former patron Fouquet at Vaux-le-Vicomte (see below).

In Paris there is a full-length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was commissioned in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.

Another commemorative monument to La Fontaine was set up at the head of the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumilâtre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, like many others during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia&#x27;s standing statue of the fabulist looking down at the fox and the crow on the steps and plinth below him.
There are more statues in Château-Thierry, the town of the poet&#x27;s birth. The most prominent is the standing statue by Charles-René Laitié, which was ordered by command of Louis XVIII as a gift to the town. It was officially set in place in a square overlooking the Marne in 1824. During the Second Battle of the Marne it was damaged and was then moved about the town. Repaired now, its present position is in the square fronting the poet&#x27;s former house. At his feet the race between the Tortoise and the Hare is taking place. The house itself has now been converted into a museum, outside which stands the life-sized statue created by Bernard Seurre. Inside the museum is Louis-Pierre Deseine’s head and shoulders clay bust of La Fontaine.

Further evidence of La Fontaine&#x27;s enduring popularity is his appearance on a playing card from the second year of the French Revolution. In this pack royalty is displaced by the rationalist free-thinkers known as Philosophes, and the ironical fabulist figures as the King of Spades. He was no less popular at the Bourbon Restoration, as is evidenced by the royal commission of his statue. Besides that, there was the 1816 bronze commemorative medal depicting the poet&#x27;s head, designed by Jacques-Édouard Gatteaux, in the Great Men of France series. More recently there has been a sideways seated view of him in the &quot;Histoire de France series&quot;.
The head of La Fontaine also appeared on a 100 franc coin to commemorate the 300th anniversary of his death, on the reverse of which the fable of the fox and the crow is depicted. Another commemoration that year included the strip of 2.80 euro fable stamps, in the composite folder of which appeared a detachable portrait without currency. In 1995 equally, the asteroid 5780 Lafontaine was named in his honour.

Other appearances on postage stamps include the 55 centimes issue of 1938, with a medallion of the fable of The Wolf and the Lamb below him; and the Monaco 50-cent stamp commemorating the 350th anniversary of La Fontaine&#x27;s birth in 1971, in which the head and shoulders of the fabulist appear below some of the more famous characters about which he wrote. Another coin series on which he appears is the annual &quot;Fables de La Fontaine&quot; celebration of the (Chinese) lunar new year. Issued since 2006, these bullion coins have had his portrait on the reverse and on the face each year&#x27;s particular zodiac animal.

Fictional depictions have followed the fashionable view of La Fontaine at their period. As a minor character in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne&quot;, he appears as a bumbling and scatterbrained courtier of Nicolas Fouquet. In the 2007 film &quot;Jean de La Fontaine – le défi&quot;, however, the poet resists the absolutist rule of Louis XIV after the fall of Fouquet.

<text>Marine mammals are mammals that rely on marine (saltwater) ecosystems for their existence. They include animals such as cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses), sirenians (manatees and dugongs), sea otters and polar bears. They are an informal group, unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding and survival.

Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Pinnipeds are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. Sea otters tend to live in kelp forests and estuaries. In contrast, the polar bear is mostly terrestrial and only go into the water on occasions of necessity, and are thus much less adapted to aquatic living. The diets of marine mammals vary considerably as well; some eat zooplankton, others eat fish, squid, shellfish, or seagrass, and a few eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.

Marine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoples for food and other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting led to the extinction of the Steller&#x27;s sea cow, sea mink, Japanese sea lion and Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than being hunted, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where for example they can become entangled in nets and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade Arctic environments.

The term &quot;marine mammal&quot; encompasses all mammals whose survival depends entirely or almost entirely on the oceans, which have also evolved several specialized aquatic traits. In addition to the above, several other mammals have a great dependency on the sea without having become so anatomically specialized, otherwise known as &quot;quasi-marine mammals&quot;. This term can include: the greater bulldog bat (&quot;Noctilio leporinus&quot;), the fish-eating bat (&quot;Myotis vivesi&quot;), the arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;) which often scavenges polar bear kills, coastal gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) populations which predominantly eat salmon and marine carcasses, the North Ronaldsay sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) which normally eats seaweed outside the lambing season, the Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;) which is usually found in freshwater but can be found along coastal Scotland, and others.

===Evolution===
Marine mammals form a diverse group of 129 species that rely on the ocean for their existence. They are an informal group unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding. Despite the diversity in anatomy seen between groups, improved foraging efficiency has been the main driver in their evolution. The level of dependence on the marine environment varies considerably with species. For example, dolphins and whales are completely dependent on the marine environment for all stages of their life; seals feed in the ocean but breed on land; and polar bears must feed on land.

The cetaceans became aquatic around 50 million years ago (mya). Based on molecular and morphological research, the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). The term &quot;Cetartiodactyla&quot; reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates. The term was coined by merging the name for the two orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla, into a single word. Under this definition, the closest living land relative of the whales and dolphins is thought to be the hippopotamuses.

Sirenians, the sea cows, became aquatic around 40 million years ago. The first appearance of sirenians in the fossil record was during the early Eocene, and by the late Eocene, sirenians had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, they were able to spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, †&quot;Prorastomus&quot;, was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was †&quot;Pezosiren&quot; from the early middle Eocene. The earliest known sea cows, of the families †Prorastomidae and †Protosirenidae, were both confined to the Eocene, and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared by the middle Eocene. At this point, sea cows were fully aquatic.

Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of †&quot;Puijila darwini&quot; in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, †&quot;Puijila&quot; had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. The lineages of Otariidae (eared seals) and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya. Phocids (earless seals) are known to have existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (monk seals) and Phocinae lineages 22 mya.

Fossil evidence indicates the sea otter (&quot;Enhydra&quot;) lineage became isolated in the North Pacific approximately two mya, giving rise to the now-extinct †&quot;Enhydra macrodonta&quot; and the modern sea otter, &quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to marine life. In some respects though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.

Polar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears, &quot;Ursus arctos&quot;, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000-to-110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.

In general, terrestrial amniote invasions of the sea have become more frequent in the Cenozoic than they were in the Mesozoic. Factors contributing to this trend include the increasing productivity of near-shore marine environments, and the role of endothermy in facilitating this transition.

==Distribution and habitat==
Marine mammals are widely distributed throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to the highest levels of primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size is a result of the different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.

Most marine mammals, such as seals and sea otters, inhabit the coast. Seals, however, also use a number of terrestrial habitats, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Seals may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Most cetaceans live in the open ocean, and species like the sperm whale may dive to depths of in search of food. Sirenians live in shallow coastal waters, usually living below sea level. However, they have been known to dive to to forage deep-water seagrasses. Sea otters live in protected areas, such as rocky shores, kelp forests, and barrier reefs, although they may reside among drift ice or in sandy, muddy, or silty areas.

Many marine mammals seasonally migrate. Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes, and seals migrate in response to these changes. In turn, polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as &quot;ice-floe breakup&quot;), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up. In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round. Seals may also migrate to other environmental changes, such as El Niño, and traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including geomagnetic fields, water and wind currents, the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the water. Baleen whales famously migrate very long distances into tropical waters to give birth and raise young, possibly to prevent predation by killer whales. The gray whale has the longest recorded migration of any mammal, with one traveling from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baja Peninsula. During the winter, manatees living at the northern end of their range migrate to warmer waters.

==Adaptations==

Marine mammals have a number of physiological and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species-specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo-shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchange); and reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.

Marine mammals are able to dive for long periods. Both pinnipeds and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems pushing large volumes of blood rich in myoglobin and hemoglobin, which serve to store greater quantities of oxygen. Other important reservoirs include muscles and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted (hypoxia), marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis.

Sound travels differently through water, and therefore marine mammals have developed adaptations to ensure effective communication, prey capture, and predator detection. The most notable adaptation is the development of echolocation in whales and dolphins. Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the &#x27;melon&#x27;. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities.

Marine mammals have evolved a wide variety of features for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and small fish from the water.

Polar bears, otters, and fur seals have long, oily, and waterproof fur in order to trap air to provide insulation. In contrast, other marine mammals—such as whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, dugongs, and walruses—have lost long fur in favor of a thick, dense epidermis and a thickened fat layer (blubber) to prevent drag. Wading and bottom-feeding animals (such as manatees) need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged. Surface-living animals (such as sea otters) need the opposite, and free-swimming animals living in open waters (such as dolphins) need to be neutrally buoyant in order to be able to swim up and down the water column. Typically, thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water. Some marine mammals, such as polar bears and otters, have retained four weight-bearing limbs and can walk on land like fully terrestrial animals.

==Ecology==
===Dietary===
All cetaceans are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Killer whales have been known to paralyze great white sharks and other sharks and rays by flipping them upside down. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora similar to that of terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.

Baleen whales use their baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, out of the water; there are two types of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the original volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale&#x27;s interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.

Otters are the only marine animals that are capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.

Pinnipeds mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, but a few are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.

The polar bear is the most carnivorous species of bear, and its diet primarily consists of ringed (&quot;Pusa hispida&quot;) and bearded (&quot;Erignathus barbatus&quot;) seals. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water. The polar bear&#x27;s most common hunting method is still-hunting: The bear locates a seal breathing hole using its sense of smell, and crouches nearby for a seal to appear. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice. Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within , and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within of the seal and then suddenly rushes to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow. They may also feed on fish.

Sirenians are referred to as &quot;sea cows&quot; because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. When eating, they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce. West Indian manatees eat up to 60 different species of plants, as well as fish and small invertebrates to a lesser extent.

===Keystone species===

Sea otters are a classic example of a keystone species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California. However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.
An apex predator affects prey population dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;) and glaucous gulls (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.

Killer whales are apex predators throughout their global distribution, and can have a profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale&#x27;s preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.

===Whale pump===


A 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a &quot;whale pump&quot;. Whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. This functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. This nitrogen input in the Gulf of Maine is more than the input of all rivers combined emptying into the gulf, some each year.
Whales defecate at the ocean&#x27;s surface; their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale feces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.

Upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep-sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Deterioration of whale carcasses happens through a series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms, such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge soft tissue at a rapid rate over a period of months to as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulphide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.

==Interactions with humans==

===Threats===
Due to the difficulty to survey populations, 38% of marine mammals are data deficient, especially around the Antarctic Polar Front. In particular, declines in the populations of completely marine mammals tend to go unnoticed 70% of the time.

====Exploitation====
Marine mammals were hunted by coastal aboriginal humans historically for food and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;), sea mink (&quot;Neogale macrodon&quot;), Japanese sea lion (&quot;Zalophus japonicus&quot;), and the Caribbean monk seal (&quot;Neomonachus tropicalis&quot;). Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;) and the North Pacific right whale (&quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot;), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.

A number of whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling set under the terms of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.
The most profitable furs in the fur trade were those of sea otters, especially the northern sea otter which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River to the south and Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern sea otter was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.

Commercial sealing was historically just as important as the whaling industry. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and remains only in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.

Polar bears can be hunted for sport in Canada with a special permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an important source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.

====Ocean traffic and fisheries====
By-catch is the incidental capture of non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds are most vulnerable as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.

Vessel strikes cause death for a number of marine mammals, especially whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.

The fishery industry not only threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large-scale fisheries have led to the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated in a number of areas in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.

Shellfish aquaculture takes up space so in effect creates competition for space. However, there is little direct competition for aquaculture shellfish harvest. On the other hand, marine mammals regularly take finfish from farms, which creates significant problems for marine farmers. While there are usually legal mechanisms designed to deter marine mammals, such as anti-predator nets or harassment devices, individuals are often illegally shot.

====Habitat loss and degradation====
Habitat degradation is caused by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are the most likely to be affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.

Contaminants that are discharged into the marine environment accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that are found in the tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.

Noise pollution from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This is a problem because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used for a variety of purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.

Two changes to the global atmosphere due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals. The first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and other areas of the Southern Hemisphere. An increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Raised sea levels, rising sea temperatures and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear&#x27;s habitat. It has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade because the temperature is rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world. By the year 2050, up to two-thirds of the world&#x27;s polar bears may vanish if the sea ice continues to melt at its current rate.

A study by evolutionary biologists at the University of Pittsburgh showed that the ancestors of many marine mammals stopped producing a certain enzyme that today protects against some neurotoxic chemicals called organophosphates, including those found in the widely used pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon. Marine mammals may be increasingly exposed to these compounds due to agricultural runoff reaching the world&#x27;s oceans.

===Protection===

The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) was passed on October 21, 1972, under president Richard Nixon to prevent the further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks. It prohibits the taking (&quot;the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such&quot;) of any marine mammal without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.

The Act was updated on 1 January 2016 with a clause banning &quot;the import of fish from fisheries that cannot prove they meet US standards for protecting marine mammals&quot;. The requirement to show that protection standards are met is hoped to compel countries exporting fish to the US to more strictly control their fisheries that no protected marine mammals are adversely affected by fishing.

The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is the only global organization that conserves a broad range of animals, which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.

The Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS), founded in 1996, specifically protects cetaceans in the Mediterranean area, and &quot;maintains a favorable status&quot;, a direct action against whaling. There are 23 member states.
The Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS) was adopted alongside ACCOBAMS to establish a special protection area for Europe&#x27;s increasingly threatened cetaceans. Other anti-whaling efforts include a ten-year moratorium in 1986 by the IWC on all whaling, and an environmental agreement (a type of international law) the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which controlled commercial, scientific and subsistence whaling.

The Agreement on the Conservation of Seals in the Wadden Sea, enforced in 1991, prohibits the killing or harassment of seals in the Wadden Sea, specifically targeting the harbor seal population.

The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears between Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), the United States and the Soviet Union outlawed the unregulated hunting of polar bears from aircraft and icebreakers, as well as protecting migration, feeding and hibernation sites.

Various non-governmental organizations participate in marine conservation activism, wherein they draw attention to and aid in various problems in marine conservation, such as pollution, whaling, bycatch, and so forth. Notable organizations include the Greenpeace who focus on overfishing and whaling among other things, and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society who are known for taking direct-action tactics to expose illegal activity.

===As food===
For thousands of years, indigenous peoples of the Arctic have depended on whale meat and seal meat. The meat is harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn. The meat is stored and eaten throughout the winter. The skin and blubber (muktuk) taken from the bowhead, beluga, or narwhal is also valued, and is eaten raw or cooked. Whaling has also been practiced in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic since about the time of the first Norse settlements on the islands. Around 1,000 long-finned pilot whales are still killed annually, mainly during the summer. Today, dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as &quot;chancho marino&quot;, or &quot;sea pork&quot;). In some parts of the world, such as Taiji (in Japan) and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.

There have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.

Ringed seals were once the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an important food source for the people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada&#x27;s raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.

===In captivity===
====Aquariums====
;Cetaceans

Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks and dolphinariums, such as SeaWorld. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train and have a long lifespan in captivity. Hundreds of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. The dolphin &quot;smile&quot; makes them popular attractions, as this is a welcoming facial expression in humans; however, the smile is due to a lack of facial muscles and subsequent lack of facial expressions.

Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their twenties. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales&#x27; social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Captive life is also stressful due to the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Dolphins are often trained to do several anthropomorphic behaviors, including waving and kissing—behaviors wild dolphins would rarely do.

;Pinnipeds
The large size and playfulness of pinnipeds make them popular attractions. Some exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out sites and a pool, while others have pens with small rocky, elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the California sea lion as it is abundant and easy to train. These animals are used to perform tricks and entertain visitors. Other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common. Pinnipeds are popular attractions because they are &quot;disneyfied&quot;, and consequently, people often anthropomorphize them with a curious, funny, or playful nature.

Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also oppose using sea lions for entertainment, claiming the tricks performed are &quot;exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors&quot; and distract the audience from the animal&#x27;s unnatural environment.

;Sea otter
Sea otters can do well in captivity, and are featured in over 40 public aquariums and zoos. The Seattle Aquarium became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of Tichuk in 1979, followed by three more pups in the early 1980s. In 2007, a YouTube video of two cute sea otters holding paws drew 1.5 million viewers in two weeks, and had over 20 million views . Filmed five years previously at the Vancouver Aquarium, it was YouTube&#x27;s most popular animal video at the time, although it has since been surpassed. Otters are often viewed as having a &quot;happy family life&quot;, but this is an anthropomorphism.

;Sirenians
The oldest manatee in captivity was Snooty, at the South Florida Museum&#x27;s Parker Manatee Aquarium in Bradenton, Florida. Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948, Snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births. He was raised entirely in captivity, and died at the age of 69. Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the Tierpark in Berlin, the Nuremberg Zoo, in ZooParc de Beauval in France, and in the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy. The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them.

====Military====

Bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions are used in the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they would not be able to discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins) and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.

The use of marine mammals by the Navy, even in accordance with the Navy&#x27;s policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy&#x27;s policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals&#x27; natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers&#x27; control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.

<text>Sea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they make up the family Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean. They have an average lifespan of 20–30 years. A male California sea lion weighs on average about and is about long, while the female sea lion weighs and is long. The largest sea lions are Steller&#x27;s sea lions, which can weigh and grow to a length of . Sea lions consume large quantities of food at a time and are known to eat about 5–8% of their body weight (about ) at a single feeding. Sea lions can move around in water and at their fastest they can reach a speed of about . Three species, the Australian sea lion, the Galápagos sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion, are listed as endangered.

==Taxonomy==

Sea lions are related to walruses and seals. Together with the fur seals, they constitute the family Otariidae, collectively known as eared seals. Until recently, sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae, whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division was based on the most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former. Recent genetic evidence, suggests &quot;Callorhinus&quot;, the genus of the northern fur seal, is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus, &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;. Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies.

Nonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk, and larger prey than fur seals. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. The family Otariidae (Order Carnivora) contains the 15 extant species of fur seals and sea lions. Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (fur seals) and Otariinae (sea lions) is not supported, with the fur seal &quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot; having a basal relationship relative to the rest of the family. This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining fur seals and sea lions about 6 million years ago (mya). Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus fur seal clades, suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other. The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family.

&quot;Arctocephalus&quot; is characterized by ancestral character states such as dense underfur and the presence of double rooted cheek teeth and is thus thought to represent the most &quot;primitive&quot; line. It was from this basal line that both the sea lions and the remaining fur seal genus, &quot;Callorhinus&quot;, are thought to have diverged. The fossil record from the western coast of North America presents evidence for the divergence of &quot;Callorhinus&quot; about 6 mya, whereas fossils in both California and Japan suggest that sea lions did not diverge until years later.

== Physiology ==

===Diving adaptations===

There are many components that make up sea lion physiology and these processes control aspects of their behavior. Physiology dictates thermoregulation, osmoregulation, reproduction, metabolic rate, and many other aspects of sea lion ecology including but not limited to their ability to dive to great depths. The sea lions&#x27; bodies control heart rate, gas exchange, digestion rate, and blood flow to allow individuals to dive for a long period of time and prevent side effects of high pressure at depth.

The high pressures associated with deep dives cause gases such as nitrogen to build up in tissues which are then released upon surfacing, possibly causing death. One of the ways sea lions deal with the extreme pressures is by limiting the amount of gas exchange that occurs when diving. The sea lion allows the alveoli to be compressed by the increasing water pressure thus forcing the surface air into cartilage lined airway just before the gas exchange surface. This process prevents any further oxygen exchange to the blood for muscles, requiring all muscles to be loaded with enough oxygen to last the duration of the dive. However, this shunt reduces the amount of compressed gases from entering tissues therefore reducing the risk of decompression sickness. The collapse of alveoli does not allow for any oxygen storage in the lungs, however. This means that sea lions must mitigate oxygen use in order to extend their dives. Oxygen availability is prolonged by the physiological control of heart rate in sea lions. By reducing heart rate to well below surface rates, oxygen is saved by reducing gas exchange as well as reducing the energy required for a high heart rate. Bradycardia is a control mechanism to allow a switch from pulmonary oxygen to oxygen stored in the muscles which is needed when the sea lions are diving to depth. Another way sea lions mitigate the oxygen obtained at the surface in dives is to reduce digestion rate. Digestion requires metabolic activity and therefore energy and oxygen are consumed during this process; however, sea lions can limit digestion rate and decrease it by at least 54%. This reduction in digestion results in a proportional reduction in oxygen use in the stomach and therefore a correlated oxygen supply for diving. Digestion rate in these sea lions increases back to normal rates immediately upon resurfacing. Oxygen depletion limits dive duration, but carbon dioxide (CO2) build-up also plays a role in the dive capabilities of many marine mammals. After a sea lion returns from a long dive, CO2 is not expired as fast as oxygen is replenished in the blood, due to the unloading complications with CO2. However, having more than normal levels of CO2 in the blood does not seem to adversely affect dive behavior. Compared to terrestrial mammals, sea lions have a higher tolerance to storing CO2 which is what normally tells mammals that they need to breathe. This ability to ignore a response to CO2 is likely brought on by increased carotid bodies which are sensors for oxygen levels that let the animal know its available oxygen supply. Yet, the sea lions cannot avoid the effects of gradual CO2 build-up which eventually causes the sea lions to spend more time at the surface after multiple repeated dives to allow for enough built up CO2 to be expired.

=== Parasites and diseases ===
Galapagos sea lions (&quot;Zalophus wollebaeki&quot;) can be infected with &quot;Philophthalmus zalophi&quot;, an eye fluke. These infections have heavy impacts on the survival of juveniles. The disease appears to be compounded by global warming. The number of infectious stages of different parasites species has a strong correlation with temperature change, therefore it is essential to consider the correlation between the increasing number of parasitic infections and climate changes. The Galapagos Islands go through seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures, which consist of high temperatures from the beginning of January through the month of May and lower temperatures throughout the rest of the year. Parasites surfaced in large numbers when the sea temperature was at its highest. Furthermore, data was collected by capturing sea lions in order to measure and determine their growth rates. Their growth rates were noted along with the citings of parasites which were found under the eyelid. The shocking results were that sea lions are affected by the parasites from the early ages of 3 weeks old up until the age of 4 to 8 months. The parasites found in the eye fluke did serious damage to the eye. From the data collected, 21 of the 91 survived; with a total of 70 deaths in just a span of two years. The parasites are attacking the pups at such young ages and causing the pups to not reach the age of reproduction. The death rates of the pups is surpassing the fertility rate by far. Since most pups are unable to reach the age of reproduction, the population is not growing fast enough to keep the species out of endangerment. Other parasites, like &quot;Anisakis&quot; and heartworm, can also infect sea lions.

Australian sea lions (&quot;Neophoca cinerea&quot;) are also being affected by more frequent parasitic infections. The same method was used for the sea pups as on the Galapagos Islands, but in addition, the researchers in Australia took blood samples. The pups in Australia were being affected by hookworms, but they were also coming out in large numbers with warmer temperatures. New Zealand sea lion pups (&quot;Phocarctos hookeri&quot;) were also affected in really early ages by hookworms (Uncinaria). The difference is that in New Zealand researchers took the necessary steps and began treatment. The treatment seemed to be effective on the pups who have taken it. They found no traces of this infection afterwards. However, the percentage of pups who do have it is still relatively high at about 75%. Those pups who were treated had much better growth rates than those who did not. Overall parasites and hookworms are killing off enough pups to place them in endangerment. Parasites affect sea pups in various areas of the world. Reproductive success reduces immensely, survival methods, changes in health and growth have also been affected.

Similarly, climate change has resulted in increased toxic algae blooms in the oceans. These toxins are ingested by sardines and other fish which are then eaten by the sea lions, causing neurological damage and diseases such as epilepsy.

=== Gene expressions and diet ===
Gene expressions are being used more often to detect the physiological responses to nutrition, as well as other stressors. In a study done with four Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), three of the four sea lions underwent a 70-day trial which consisted of unrestricted food intake, acute nutritional stress, and chronic nutritional stress. Results showed that individuals under nutritional stress down-regulated some cellular processes within their immune response and oxidative stress. Nutritional stress was considered the most proximate cause of population decline in this species. In New Zealand sea lions, north-to south gradients driven by temperature differences were shown to be key factors in the prey mix. Adult California sea lions eat about 5% to 8% of their body weight per day ().

California sea lions feed mainly offshore in coastal areas. They eat a variety of prey—such as squid, anchovies, mackerel, rockfish, and sardines—found in upwelling areas. They also may take fish from commercial fishing gear, sport fishing lines, and fish passage facilities at dams and rivers.

=== Geographic variation ===

Geographic variation for sea lions have been determined by the observations of skulls of several Otariidae species; a general change in size corresponds with a change in latitude and primary productivity. Skulls of Australian sea lions from Western Australia were generally smaller in length whereas the largest skulls are from cool temperate localities. Otariidae are in the process of species divergence, much of which may be driven by local factors, particularly latitude and resources. Populations of a given species tend to be smaller in the tropics, increase in size with increasing latitude, and reach a maximum in sub-polar regions. In a cool climate and cold waters there should be a selective advantage in the relative reduction of body surface area resulting from increased size, since the metabolic rate is related more closely to body surface area than to body weight.

== Breeding and population ==

=== Breeding methods and habits ===

Sea lions, with three groups of pinnipeds, have multiple breeding methods and habits over their families but they remain relatively universal. Otariids, or eared sea lions, raise their young, mate, and rest in more earthly land or ice habitats. Their abundance and haul-out behavior have a direct effect on their on land breeding activity. Their seasonal abundance trend correlates with their breeding period between the austral summer of January to March. Their rookeries populate with newborn pups as well as male and female otariids that remain to defend their territories. At the end of the breeding period males disseminate for food and rest while females remain for nurturing. Other points in the year consist of a mix of ages and genders in the rookeries with haul-out patterns varying monthly.

Steller sea lions, living an average of 15 to 20 years, begin their breeding season when adult males establish territories along the rookeries in early May. Male sea lions reach sexual maturity from ages 5 to 7 and do not become territorial until around 9 to 13 years of age. The females arrive in late May bringing in an increase of territorial defense through fighting and boundary displays. After a week births consist most usually of one pup with a perinatal period of 3 to 13 days.

Steller sea lions have exhibited multiple competitive strategies for reproductive success. Sea lion mating is often polygamous as males usually mate with different females to increase fitness and success, leaving some males to not find a mate at all. Polygamous males rarely provide parental care towards the pup. Strategies used to monopolize females include the resource-defense polygyny, or occupying important female resources. This involves occupying and defending a territory with resources or features attractive to females during sexually receptive periods. Some of these factors may include pupping habitat and access to water. Other techniques include potentially limiting access of other males to females.

=== Population ===
&quot;Otaria flavescens&quot; (South American sea lion) lives along the Chilean coast with a population estimate of 165,000. According to the most recent surveys in northern and southern Chile the sealing period of the middle twentieth century that left a significant decline in sea lion population is recovering. The recovery is associated with less hunting, otariids rapid population growth, legislation on nature reserves, and new food resources. Haul-out patterns change the abundance of sea lions at particular times of the day, month, and year. Patterns in migration relate to temperature, solar radiation, and prey and water resources. Studies of South American sea lions and other otariids document maximum population on land during early afternoon, potentially due to haul-out during high air temperatures. Adult and subadult males do not show clear annual patterns, maximum abundance being found from October to January. Females and their pups hauled-out during austral winter months of June to September.

== Interactions with humans ==
South American sea lions have been greatly impacted by human exploitation. During the late Holocene period to the middle of the twentieth century, hunter-gatherers along the Beagle Channel and northern Patagonia had greatly reduced the number of sea lions due to their hunting of the species and exploitation of the species&#x27; environment. Although sealing has been put to a halt, in many countries, such as Uruguay, the sea lion population continues to decline because of the drastic effects humans have on their ecosystems. As a result, South American sea lions have been foraging at higher tropical latitudes than they did prior to human exploitation. Fishermen play a key role in the endangerment of sea lions. Sea lions rely on fish, like pollock, as a food source and have to compete with fishermen for it. When fishermen are successful at their job, they greatly reduce the sea lion&#x27;s food source, which in turn endangers the species. Also, human presence and human recreational activities can cause sea lions to engage in violent and aggressive actions. When humans come closer than 15 meters of a sea lion, the sea lions&#x27; vigilance increases because of the disturbance of humans. These disturbances can potentially cause sea lions to have psychological stress responses that cause the sea lions to retreat, sometimes even abandon their locations, and decreases the amount of time sea lions spend hauling out. 

New Zealand sea lions were also exploited from hunting and sealing, and as a result were extirpated from New Zealand&#x27;s mainland for over 150 years, with their population being restricted to the subantarctic. In 1993, a female New Zealand sea lion gave birth on the mainland for the first time, and since then, they have slowly been recolonizing. These sea lions are the only pinnipeds that regularly move up to inland into forests. As consequence, they have been hit by cars on roads, deliberately killed, and been disturbed by dogs. Females need to move inland as a way to protect their pups, so roads, fences, residential areas, and private lands can inhibit their dispersal and breeding success. They have also adapted to commercial pine forests, and have given birth or nursed pups in residents&#x27; backyards and on golf courses. As one of the world&#x27;s rarest sea lions, and an endangered and endemic species, efforts are being made to facilitate coexistence between them and humans.

Sea lion attacks on humans are rare, but when humans come within approximately , it can be very unsafe. In a highly unusual attack in 2007 in Western Australia, a sea lion leapt from the water and seriously mauled a 13-year-old girl surfing behind a speedboat. The sea lion appeared to be preparing for a second attack when the girl was rescued. An Australian marine biologist suggested that the sea lion may have viewed the girl &quot;like a rag doll toy&quot; to be played with. In San Francisco, where an increasingly large population of California sea lions crowds docks along San Francisco Bay, incidents have been reported in recent years of swimmers being bitten on the legs by large, aggressive males, possibly as territorial acts. In April 2015, a sea lion attacked a 62-year-old man who was boating with his wife in San Diego. The attack left the man with a punctured bone. In May 2017, a sea lion grabbed and pulled a girl into the water by her dress before retreating. The child was sitting on a pier side in British Columbia while tourists were illegally feeding the sea lions when the incident took place. She was pulled out of the water with minor injuries and received antibiotic prophylactic treatment for seal finger infection from the superficial bite injury.

There have also been documented events of sea lions assisting humans. One such notable instance of this is when Kevin Hines jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in a suicide attempt and was helped to stay afloat by a sea lion until he was rescued by the Coast Guard.

Sea lions have also been a focus of tourism in Australia and New Zealand. One of the main sites to view sea lions is in the Carnac Island Nature Reserve near Perth in Western Australia. This tourist site receives over 100,000 visitors, many of whom are recreational boaters and tourists, who can watch the male sea lions haul out on to the shore. They have sometimes been called &quot;the unofficial welcoming committee of the Galápagos Islands&quot;.

<text>Zalophus is a genus of the family Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals) of the order Carnivora.

==Description==
The seals of the genus &quot;Zalophus&quot; present a striking sexual dimorphism, since the adult males have a pronounced sagittal crest, and weigh, in the Californian species, between 300 and 380 kg with 240 cm long, and the females 80 to 120 kg with between 180 and 200 cm. As with all ear seals, the males are significantly larger and heavier than the females. The males are dark brown in color, the females are lighter. In contrast to the other ear seals, the males do not have a clearly defined mane. In the Galapagos species the males weigh about 250 kg with a length of 250 to 270 cm, while the females weigh from 60 to 100 kg with a length of between 150 and 170 cm.

They have a streamlined body, with a layer of fat under the skin, to provide warmth and buoyancy. The coat is brown. They have large eyes that help compensate for low light levels in the underwater environment, while their whiskers increase their sense of touch. The nostrils close automatically once they touch the water. Their long front fins rotate outward for better movement on land, and propel them forward in the water, where they stay as long as possible.

==Systematics==
For a long time, specialists debated whether the 3 taxa that make up this genus were three full, monotypic species, or instead a single species with three subspecies; in the latter case, by priority, this species would be &quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;.

As early as 1953, the zoologist Erling Sivertsen created a new indicative classification, after he investigated and catalogued again, in the Oslo Museum, skulls and archaeological remains, collected by the Norwegian expedition ship MK Norvegia between 1928 and 1929. Traditionally, the three populations were listed as subspecies of a common species, but this was controversial. Wilson &amp; Reeder classified the three populations as separate species. A molecular genetic study by Wolf et al. (2007) came to the same conclusion based on mitochondrial DNA and cell nucleus DNA SNPs. Furthermore, according to a molecular clock reconstruction, the Californian and Galápagos sea lions separated around 2.3 (± 0.5) million years ago.

===Species===
It includes these species, of which one became recently extinct:

==Ecology==
These seals go to rest on the coasts. When looking for food, they dive up to 40 meters deep and prey on fish and octopus. During the breeding season, the males establish strictly guarded territories on the coasts and try to gain a harem from several females.

They feed on fish and mollusks. They are very sociable and are found in large groups, on cliffs, coasts, and even on human constructions, such as piers and navigation bowls.

===Reproduction===
Unlike fur seals (&quot;Arctocephalus&quot;) which live in well-structured social groups, the species of the genus &quot;Zalophus&quot; form variable groups lacking in organization, although the males are also territorial and usually form harems of about fifteen females each. Males make loud sounds to mark territory. They usually mate between May and January depending on the species. Females give birth to only one young, which is born on land or water after a gestation that lasts between 342 and 365 days. They are the only mammals whose milk does not contain lactose. Females wean their young after 11 to 12 months, but some nurse their one-year-old pups alongside their newborns.

<doc id="60260" wikidata="Q147276" url="?curid=60260" title="Proper noun">
<text>A proper noun is a noun that identifies a single entity and is used to refer to that entity (&quot;Africa&quot;; &quot;Jupiter&quot;; &quot;Sarah&quot;; &quot;Walmart)&quot; as distinguished from a common noun, which is a noun that refers to a class of entities (&quot;continent, planet, person, corporation&quot;) and may be used when referring to instances of a specific class (a &quot;continent&quot;, another &quot;planet&quot;, these &quot;persons&quot;, our &quot;corporation&quot;). Some proper nouns occur in plural form (optionally or exclusively), and then they refer to &quot;groups&quot; of entities considered as unique (the &quot;Hendersons&quot;, the &quot;Everglades&quot;, &quot;the Azores&quot;, the &quot;Pleiades&quot;). Proper nouns can also occur in secondary applications, for example modifying nouns (the &quot;Mozart&quot; experience; his &quot;Azores&quot; adventure), or in the role of common nouns (he&#x27;s no &quot;Pavarotti&quot;; a few would-be &quot;Napoleons&quot;). The detailed definition of the term is problematic and, to an extent, governed by convention.

A distinction is normally made in current linguistics between &quot;proper nouns&quot; and &quot;proper names&quot;. By this strict distinction, because the term &quot;noun&quot; is used for a class of single words (&quot;tree&quot;, &quot;beauty&quot;), only single-word proper names are proper nouns: &quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot; are both proper names and proper nouns; but &quot;Peter the Great&quot; and &quot;South Africa&quot;, while they are proper names, are not proper nouns (though they could be said to function as proper noun phrases). The term &quot;common name&quot; is not much used to contrast with &quot;proper name&quot;, but some linguists have used the term for that purpose. Sometimes proper names are called simply &quot;names&quot;, but that term is often used more broadly. Words derived from proper names are sometimes called &quot;proper adjectives&quot; (or &quot;proper adverbs&quot;, and so on), but not in mainstream linguistic theory. Not every noun or a noun phrase that refers to a unique entity is a proper name. &quot;Chastity,&quot; for instance, is a common noun, even if chastity is considered a unique abstract entity.

Few proper names have only one possible referent: there are many places named &quot;New Haven&quot;; &quot;Jupiter&quot; may refer to a planet, a god, a ship, a city in Florida, or a symphony; at least one person has been named &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, as well as a racehorse, several songs, several films, and other objects; there are towns and people named &quot;Toyota&quot;, as well as the company. In English, proper names in their primary application cannot normally be modified by articles or another determiner, although some may be taken to include the article &quot;the&quot;, as in &quot;the Netherlands&quot;, &quot;the Roaring Forties&quot;, or &quot;the Rolling Stones&quot;. A proper name may appear to have a descriptive meaning, even though it does not (the Rolling Stones are not stones and do not roll; a woman named &quot;Rose&quot; is not a flower). If it once had a descriptive meaning, it may no longer be descriptive. For example, a location previously referred to as &quot;the new town&quot; may now have the proper name &quot;Newtown&quot; though it is no longer new and is now a city rather than a town.

In English and many other languages, proper names and words derived from them are associated with capitalization, but the details are complex and vary from language to language (French &quot;lundi&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;un homme canadien&quot;, &quot;un Canadien&quot;; English &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;a Canadian man&quot;, &quot;a Canadian&quot;; Italian &quot;lunedì&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;un uomo canadese&quot;, &quot;un canadese&quot;). The study of proper names is sometimes called &quot;onomastics&quot; or &quot;onomatology&quot;, while a rigorous analysis of the semantics of proper names is a matter for philosophy of language.

Occasionally, what would otherwise be regarded as a proper noun is used as a common noun, in which case a plural form and a determiner are possible. Examples are in cases of ellipsis (for instance, &quot;the three Kennedys&quot; = &quot;the three members of the Kennedy family&quot;) and metaphor (for instance, &quot;the new Gandhi&quot;, likening a person to Mahatma Gandhi).

== Proper names ==
Current linguistics makes a distinction between &quot;proper nouns&quot; and &quot;proper names&quot; but this distinction is not universally observed and sometimes it is observed but not rigorously. When the distinction is made, proper nouns are limited to single words only (possibly with &quot;the&quot;), while proper names include all proper nouns (in their primary applications) as well as noun phrases such as &quot;the United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;Royal Air Force&quot;, and &quot;the White House&quot;. Proper names can have a common noun or a proper noun as their head; &quot;the United Kingdom&quot;, for example, is a proper name with the common noun &quot;kingdom&quot; as its head, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; is headed by the proper noun &quot;Carolina&quot;. Especially as titles of works, but also as nicknames and the like, some proper names contain no noun and are not formed as noun phrases (the film &quot;Being There&quot;; &quot;Hi De Ho&quot; as a nickname for Cab Calloway and as the title of a film about him).

Proper names are also referred to (by linguists) as &quot;naming expressions&quot;. Sometimes they are called simply &quot;names&quot;; but that term is also used more broadly (as in &quot;&quot;chair&quot; is the name for something we sit on&quot;); the latter type of name is called a &quot;common name&quot; to distinguish it from a &quot;proper name&quot;.

Common nouns are frequently used as components of proper names. Some examples are &quot;agency&quot;, &quot;boulevard&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;day,&quot; and &quot;edition&quot;. In such cases the common noun may determine the kind of entity, and a modifier determines the unique entity itself. For example:

* The 16th robotic probe to land on the planet was assigned to study the north pole, and the 17th probe the south pole.
:(common-noun senses throughout)
* When Probe 17 overflew the South Pole, it passed directly over the place where Captain Scott&#x27;s expedition ended.
:(in this sentence, &quot;Probe 17&quot; is the proper name of a vessel, and &quot;South Pole&quot; is a proper name referring to Earth&#x27;s south pole)
* Sanjay lives on the beach road.
:(the road that runs along the beach)
* Sanjay lives on Beach Road.
:(as a proper name, Beach Road may have nothing to do with the beach; it may be any distance from the waterfront)
* My university has a school of medicine.
:(no indication of the name of the university or its medical school)
* The John A. Burns School of Medicine is located at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Proper nouns, and all proper names, differ from common nouns grammatically in English. They may take titles, such as &quot;Mr Harris&quot; or &quot;Senator Harris&quot;. Otherwise, they normally only take modifiers that add emotive coloring, such as &quot;old Mrs Fletcher, poor Charles&quot;, or &quot;historic York&quot;; in a formal style, this may include &quot;the&quot;, as in &quot;the inimitable Henry Higgins&quot;. They may also take &quot;the&quot; in the manner of common nouns in order to establish the context in which they are unique: &quot;the young Mr Hamilton&quot; (not the old one), &quot;the Dr Brown I know&quot;; or as proper nouns to define an aspect of the referent: &quot;the young Einstein&quot; (Einstein when he was young). The indefinite article &quot;a&quot; may similarly be used to establish a new referent: &quot;the column was written by a [&quot;or&quot; one] Mary Price&quot;. Proper names based on noun phrases differ grammatically from common noun phrases. They are fixed expressions, and cannot be modified internally: &quot;beautiful King&#x27;s College&quot; is acceptable, but not &quot;King&#x27;s famous College&quot;.

As with proper nouns, so with proper names more generally: they may only be unique within the appropriate context. For instance, India has a ministry of home affairs (a common-noun phrase) called the Ministry of Home Affairs (its proper name). Within the context of India, this identifies a unique organization. However, other countries may also have ministries of home affairs called &quot;the Ministry of Home Affairs&quot;, but each refers to a unique object, so each is a proper name. Similarly, &quot;Beach Road&quot; is a unique road, though other towns may have their own roads named &quot;Beach Road&quot; as well. This is simply a matter of the pragmatics of naming, and of whether a naming convention provides identifiers that are unique; and this depends on the scope given by context.

===Proper names and the definite article ===
Because they are used to refer to an individual entity, proper names are, by their nature, definite; so many regard a definite article as redundant, and personal names (like &quot;John&quot;) are used without an article or other determiner. However, some proper names are usually used with the definite article. Grammarians divide over whether the definite article becomes part of the proper name in these cases, or is preceding the proper name. &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; terms these &quot;weak proper names&quot;, in contrast with the more typical &quot;strong proper names&quot;, which are normally used without an article.

Entities with proper names that use the definite article include geographical features (e.g., &quot;the Mediterranean&quot;, &quot;the Thames&quot;), buildings (e.g., &quot;the Parthenon&quot;), institutions (e.g., &quot;the House of Commons&quot;), cities and districts (e.g., &quot;The Hague&quot;, &quot;the Bronx&quot;), works of literature (e.g., &quot; the Bible&quot;), newspapers and magazines (e.g., &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;the New Statesman&quot;), and events (e.g., &quot;the &#x27;45&quot;, &quot;the Holocaust&quot;). Plural proper names take the definite article. Such plural proper names include mountain ranges (e.g., &quot;the Himalayas&quot;), and collections of islands (e.g., &quot;the Hebrides&quot;).

However, if adjectives are used, they are placed after the definite article (e.g., &quot;the &quot;mighty&quot; Yangtze&quot;). When such proper nouns are grouped together, sometimes only a single definite article will be used at the head (e.g., &quot;&quot;the&quot; Nile, Congo, and Niger&quot;). And in certain contexts, it is grammatically permissible or even mandatory to drop the article.

The definite article is not used in the presence of preceding possessives (e.g., &quot;&quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s&quot; Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;&quot;our&quot; United Kingdom&quot;), demonstratives (e.g., &quot;life in &quot;these&quot; United States&quot;, &quot;&quot;that&quot; spectacular Alhambra&quot;), interrogatives (e.g., &quot;&quot;whose&quot; Mediterranean: Rome&#x27;s or Carthage&#x27;s&quot;), or words like &quot;no&quot; or &quot;another&quot; (e.g., &quot;that dump is &quot;no&quot; Taj Mahal&quot;, &quot;neo-Nazis want &quot;another&quot; Holocaust&quot;).

An indefinite article phrase voids the use of the definite article (e.g., &quot;&quot;a&quot; restored Sistine Chapel&quot;, &quot;&quot;a&quot; Philippines free from colonial masters&quot;).

The definite article is omitted when such a proper noun is used attributively (e.g., &quot;&quot;Hague&quot; residents are concerned ...&quot;, &quot;... eight pints of &quot;Thames&quot; water ...&quot;). If a definite article is present, it is for the noun, not the attributive (e.g., &quot;&quot;the&quot; Amazon &quot;jungle&quot;, &quot;the&quot; Bay of Pigs &quot;debacle&quot;).

Vocative phrases that address a proper noun also cause the article to be dropped (e.g., &quot;jump&quot; that shark, Fonz!&quot;, &quot;&quot;O&quot; Pacific, be so on our voyage&quot;, &quot;Go Bears!&quot;, &quot;U-S-A! U-S-A!&quot;).

In grammatical constructs where a definite article would be used even with a proper noun that normally does not use it, only a single article is used (e.g., &quot;&quot;the&quot; Matterhorn at Disneyland is not the Matterhorn&quot;). In a grouping, a single definite article at the head may be understood to cover for the others (e.g., &quot;&quot;the&quot; Germany of Hitler, British Empire of Churchill, United States of Roosevelt, and Soviet Union of Stalin&quot;).

Headlines, which often simplify grammar for space or punchiness, frequently omit both definite and indefinite articles. 

Maps will typically include definite articles in the title, but omit them from the map image itself (e.g., Maldives, Sahara, Arctic Ocean, Andes, Elbe); however, exceptions may be made (e.g., The Wash, The Gambia). It is also customary to drop the definite article in tables (e.g., a table of nations or territories with population, area, and economy, or a table of rivers by length).

===Variants ===
Proper names often have a number of variants, for instance a formal variant (&quot;David&quot;, &quot;the United States of America&quot;) and an informal variant (&quot;Dave&quot;, &quot;the United States&quot;).

== Capitalization ==

In languages that use alphabetic scripts and that distinguish lower and upper case, there is usually an association between proper names and capitalization. In German, all nouns are capitalized, but other words are also capitalized in proper names (not including composition titles), for instance: (the Great Bear, Ursa Major). For proper names, as for several other kinds of words and phrases, the details are complex, and vary sharply from language to language. For example, expressions for days of the week and months of the year are capitalized in English, but not in Spanish, French, Swedish, or Finnish, though they may be understood as proper names in all of these. Languages differ in whether most elements of multiword proper names are capitalized (American English has &quot;House of Representatives&quot;, in which lexical words are capitalized) or only the initial element (as in Slovenian , &quot;National Assembly&quot;). In Czech, multiword settlement names are capitalized throughout, but non-settlement names are only capitalized in the initial element, though with many exceptions.

=== History of capitalization ===

European alphabetic scripts only developed a distinction between upper case and lower case in medieval times so in the alphabetic scripts of ancient Greek and Latin proper names were not systematically marked. They are marked with modern capitalization, however, in many modern editions of ancient texts.

In past centuries, orthographic practices in English varied widely. Capitalization was much less standardized than today. Documents from the 18th century show some writers capitalizing all nouns, and others capitalizing certain nouns based on varying ideas of their importance in the discussion. Historical documents from the early United States show some examples of this process: the end (but not the beginning) of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and all of the Constitution (1787) show nearly all nouns capitalized; the Bill of Rights (1789) capitalizes a few common nouns but not most of them; and the Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment (1865) capitalizes only proper nouns.

In Danish, from the 17th century until the orthographic reform of 1948, all nouns were capitalized.

=== Modern English capitalization of proper nouns ===

In modern English orthography, it is the norm for recognized proper names to be capitalized. The few clear exceptions include &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;winter&quot; (contrast &quot;July&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot;). It is also standard that most capitalizing of common nouns is considered incorrect, except of course when the capitalization is simply a matter of text styling, as at the start of a sentence or in titles and other headings. See Letter case § Title case.

Although these rules have been standardized, there are enough gray areas that it can often be unclear both whether an item qualifies as a proper name and whether it should be capitalized: &quot;the Cuban missile crisis&quot; is often capitalized (&quot;Cuban Missile Crisis&quot;) and often not, regardless of its syntactic status or its function in discourse. Most style guides give decisive recommendations on capitalization, but not all of them go into detail on how to decide in these gray areas if words are proper nouns or not and should be capitalized or not.

Words or phrases that are neither proper nouns nor derived from proper nouns are often capitalized in present-day English: &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;Baptist&quot;, &quot;Congregationalism&quot;, &quot;His&quot; and &quot;He&quot; in reference to the Abrahamic deity (God). For some such words, capitalization is optional or dependent on context: &quot;northerner&quot; or &quot;Northerner&quot;; &quot;aboriginal trees&quot; but &quot;Aboriginal land rights in Australia&quot;. When &quot;the&quot; comes at the start of a proper name, as in &quot;the White House&quot;, it is not normally capitalized unless it is a formal part of a title (of a book, film, or other artistic creation, as in &quot;The Keys to the Kingdom&quot;).

Nouns and noun phrases that are not proper may be uniformly capitalized to indicate that they are definitive and regimented in their application (compare brand names, discussed below). For example, &quot;Mountain Bluebird&quot; does not identify a unique individual, and it is not a proper name but a so-called common name (somewhat misleadingly, because this is not intended as a contrast with the term &quot;proper name&quot;). Such capitalization indicates that the term is a conventional designation for exactly that species (&quot;Sialia currucoides&quot;), not for just any bluebird that happens to live in the mountains.

Words or phrases derived from proper names are generally capitalized, even when they are not themselves proper names. For example, &quot;Londoner&quot; is capitalized because it derives from the proper name &quot;London&quot;, but it is not itself a proper name (it can be limited: &quot;the Londoner&quot;, &quot;some Londoners&quot;). Similarly, &quot;African&quot;, &quot;Africanize&quot;, and &quot;Africanism&quot; are not proper names, but are capitalized because &quot;Africa&quot; is a proper name. Adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and derived common nouns that are capitalized (&quot;Swiss&quot; in &quot;Swiss cheese&quot;; &quot;Anglicize&quot;; &quot;Calvinistically&quot;; &quot;Petrarchism&quot;) are sometimes loosely called &quot;proper adjectives&quot; (and so on), but not in mainstream linguistics. Which of these items are capitalized may be merely conventional. &quot;Abrahamic&quot;, &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;Hollywoodize&quot;, &quot;Freudianism&quot;, and &quot;Reagonomics&quot; are capitalized; &quot;quixotic&quot;, &quot;bowdlerize&quot;, &quot;mesmerism&quot;, and &quot;pasteurization&quot; are not; &quot;aeolian&quot; and &quot;alpinism&quot; may be capitalized or not.

Some words or some homonyms (depending on how a body of study defines &quot;word&quot;) have one meaning when capitalized and another when not. Sometimes the capitalized variant is a proper noun (the &quot;Moon&quot;; dedicated to &quot;God&quot;; &quot;Smith&quot;&#x27;s apprentice) and the other variant is not (the third &quot;moon&quot; of Saturn; a Greek &quot;god&quot;; the &quot;smith&quot;&#x27;s apprentice). Sometimes neither is a proper noun (a &quot;swede&quot; in the soup; a &quot;Swede&quot; who came to see me). Such words that vary according to case are sometimes called capitonyms (although only rarely: this term is scarcely used in linguistic theory and does not appear in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;).

=== Brand names ===

In most alphabetic languages, brand names and other commercial terms that are nouns or noun phrases are capitalized whether or not they count as proper names. Not all brand names are proper names, and not all proper names are brand names.

* &quot;Microsoft&quot; is a proper name, referring to a specific company. But if &quot;Microsoft&quot; is given a non-standard secondary application, in the role of a common noun, these usages are accepted: &quot;The &quot;Microsofts&quot; of this world&quot;; &quot;That&#x27;s not the &quot;Microsoft&quot; I know!&quot;; &quot;The company aspired to be another &quot;Microsoft&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Chevrolet&quot; is similarly a proper name referring to a specific company. But unlike &quot;Microsoft&quot;, it is also used in the role of a common noun to refer to products of the named company: &quot;He drove a &quot;Chevrolet&quot;&quot; (a particular vehicle); &quot;The &quot;Chevrolets&quot; of the 1960s&quot; (classes of vehicles). In these uses, &quot;Chevrolet&quot; does not function as a proper name.
* &quot;Corvette&quot; (referring to a car produced by the company Chevrolet) is not a proper name: it can be pluralized (French and English &quot;Corvettes&quot;); and it can take a definite article or other determiner or modifier: &quot;the &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;, &quot;la &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;; &quot;my &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;, &quot;ma &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;; &quot;another new &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;, &quot;une autre nouvelle &quot;Corvette&quot;&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Chevrolet Corvette&quot; is not a proper name: &quot;We owned three &quot;Chevrolet Corvettes&quot;.&quot; It contrasts with the uncapitalized &quot;corvette&quot;, a kind of warship.

== Alternative marking of proper names ==

In non-alphabetic scripts, proper names are sometimes marked by other means.

In Egyptian hieroglyphs, parts of a royal name were enclosed in a cartouche: an oval with a line at one end.

In Chinese script, a proper name mark (a kind of underline) has sometimes been used to indicate a proper name. In the standard Pinyin system of romanization for Mandarin Chinese, capitalization is used to mark proper names, with some complexities because of different Chinese classifications of nominal types, and even different notions of such broad categories as &quot;word&quot; and &quot;phrase&quot;.

Sanskrit and other languages written in the Devanagari script, along with many other languages using alphabetic or syllabic scripts, do not distinguish upper and lower case and do not mark proper names systematically.

==Acquisition and cognition==
There is evidence from brain disorders such as aphasia that proper names and common names are processed differently by the brain.

There also appear to be differences in language acquisition.
Although Japanese does not distinguish overtly between common and proper nouns, two-year-old children learning Japanese distinguished between names for categories of object (equivalent to common names) and names of individuals (equivalent to proper names): When a previously unknown label was applied to an unfamiliar object, the children assumed that the label designated the class of object (i.e. they treated the label as the common name of that object), regardless of whether the object was inanimate or not. However, &quot;if the object already had an established name&quot;, there was a difference between inanimate objects and animals: 
* for inanimate objects, the children tended to interpret the new label as a sub-class, but
* for animals they tended to interpret the label as a name for the individual animal (i.e. a proper name).

In English, children employ different strategies depending on the type of referent but also rely on syntactic cues, such as the presence or absence of the determiner &quot;the&quot; to differentiate between common and proper nouns when first learned.

<text>Pinnipeds (pronounced ), commonly known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals), with 34 extant species and more than 50 extinct species described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic group (descended from one ancestor). Pinnipeds belong to the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.

Seals range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and southern elephant seal. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids primarily use their front limbs to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses primarily use their hind limbs for this purpose. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.

Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or to avoid ocean predators, such as sharks and orcas. Seals mainly live in marine environments but can also be found in fresh water. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), though the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.

The meat, blubber and skin of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, climate change and conflicts with local people.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;pinniped&quot; derives from the Latin words and . The common name &quot;seal&quot; originates from the Old English word , which is in turn derived from the Proto-Germanic .

==Taxonomy==


The German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a family and an order. American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world&#x27;s pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, &quot;History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America&quot;. In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species in other parts of the world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus &quot;Enaliarctos&quot; and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Of the three extant families, the Otariidae and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea. There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 fossil species of pinnipedimorphs.

Otariids are also known as eared seals due to their pinnae. These animals swim mainly using their well-developed fore-flippers. They can also &quot;walk&quot; on land by shifting their hind-flippers forward under the body. The front end of an otariid&#x27;s frontal bone protrudes between the nasal bones, with a large and flattened supraorbital foramen. An extra spine splits the supraspinatous fossa and bronchi that are divided in the front. Otariids consist of two types: sea lions and fur seals; the latter typically being smaller, with pointier snouts, longer fore-flippers and heavier fur coats. Five genera and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist, while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), genetic and molecular evidence has refuted this, indicating that the northern fur seal is basal to other otariids and the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; than to other sea lions.

Odobenidae has only one living member: the walrus. This animal is noticeable from its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin, flattened snout and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses can walk on land with their hind limbs. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind limbs for locomotion, while its forelimbs are used for steering. Also, it has no outer ears. The epipterygoid of the jaw is well developed and the back of the nasal bones are horizontal. In the feet, the calcaneuses protrude in the middle.

Phocids are known as true or &quot;earless&quot; seals. These animals lack outer ears and cannot position their hind-flippers to move on land, making them more cumbersome. This is because of their massive ankle bones and flatter heels. In water, true seals rely on the side-to-side motion of their hind-flippers and lower body to move forward. The phocid&#x27;s skull has thickened mastoids, puffed up entotympanic bones, nasal bones with a pointed tip in the back and a non-existent supraorbital foramen. The hip has a more converse ilium. A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of elephant seals, monk seals and Antarctic seals; and Phocinae, which consists of all the rest.

===Evolution===
One popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears; and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. A 2021 genetic study found that pinnipeds are more closely related to musteloids. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. The earliest fossils of pinnipeds date back to the Late Oligocene. Fossil animals representing basal lineages include &quot;Puijila&quot;, of the Early Miocene in Arctic Canada. It resembled a modern otter, but shows evidence of quadrupedal swimming—retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that led to those employed by modern pinnipeds. &quot;Potamotherium&quot;, which lived in the same period in Europe, was similar to &quot;Puijila&quot; but more aquatic. The braincase of &quot;Potamotherium&quot; shows evidence that it used its whiskers to hunt, like modern seals. Both &quot;Puijila&quot; and &quot;Potamotherium&quot; fossils have been found in lake deposits, suggesting that seal ancestors were originally adapted for fresh water.
&quot;Enaliarctos&quot;, a fossil species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic life with flippers and a flexible spine. Its teeth were more like land predators in that they were more adapted for shearing. Its hind-flippers may have allowed it to walk on land, and it probably did not leave coastal areas as much as its modern relatives. &quot;Enaliarctos&quot; was likely more of a fore-flipper swimmer, but could probably swim with either pair. One species, &quot;Enaliarctos emlongi&quot;, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was &quot;Pteronarctos&quot;, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, the maxilla or upper jaw bone of &quot;Pteroarctos&quot; intersects with the orbital wall. The extinct family Desmatophocidae lived 23–10 mya in the North Pacific. They had long skulls that with large orbits, interlocked zygomatic bones and rounded molars and premolars. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of swimming with both or either pair of flippers. They are grouped with modern pinnipeds, but there is debate as to whether they are more closely related to phocids or to otariids and walruses.
The ancestors of the Otarioidea and Phocidea diverged around 25 mya. Phocids are known to have existed for at least 15 million years, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages around this time. The fossil genera &quot;Monotherium&quot; and &quot;Leptophoca&quot; of southeastern North America represent the earliest members of Monachinae and Phocinae respectively. Both lineages may have originated in the North Atlantic, and likely reached the Pacific via the Central American Seaway. Phocines mainly stayed in the Northern Hemisphere, while the monachines diversified southward. The lineages of Otariidae and Odobenidae split around 20 mya. The earliest fossil records of otariids are in North Pacific and dated to around 11 mya. Early fossil genera include &quot;Pithanotaria&quot; and &quot;Thalassoleon&quot;. The &quot;Callorhinus&quot; lineage split the earliest, followed by the &quot;Eumetopias&quot;/&quot;Zalophus&quot; lineage and then the rest, which colonized the Southern Hemisphere. The earliest fossils of Odobenidae—&quot;Prototaria&quot; of Japan and &quot;Proneotherium&quot; of Oregon—date to 18–16 mya. These primitive walruses had normal sized canines and fed on fish instead of mollusks. Later taxa like &quot;Gomphotaria&quot;, &quot;Pontolis&quot; and &quot;Dusignathus&quot; had longer canines on both the upper and lower jaw. The familiar long upper tusks developed in the genera &quot;Valenictus&quot; and &quot;Odobenus&quot;. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic through the Caribbean and Central American Seaway 8–5 mya, and then back to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1 mya, or to the Arctic and subsequently the North Atlantic during the Pleistocene.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Pinnipeds have streamlined, spindle-shaped bodies with small or non-existent ear flaps, rounded heads, short muzzles, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers and small tails. The mammary glands and genitals can withdraw into the body. Seals are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are mostly shaped by the maxilla and are not contained by certain facial bones. Compared to land carnivores, pinnipeds have fewer teeth, which are pointed and cone-shaped. They are adapted for holding onto slippery prey rather than shearing meat like the carnassials of other carnivorans. The walrus has unique tusks which are long upper canines.

Pinnipeds range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and southern elephant seal. Overall, they tend to be larger than other carnivores. Several species have male-biased sexual dimorphism that depends on how polygynous a species is: highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic, while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size, or, in the case of Antarctic seals, females are moderately bigger. Males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have secondary sex characteristics, such as larger or more prominent heads, necks, chests, crests, noses/proboscises and canine teeth as well as thicker fur and manes. Though more polygynous species tend to be sexually dimorphic, some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences, with polygyny developing later.

Almost all pinnipeds have fur coats, the exception being the walrus, which is only sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less furry than land mammals. Fur seals have lush coats consisting of an undercoat and guard hairs. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to counter the effects of self-shadowing caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Several species have clashing patterns of light and dark pigmentation. All fully furred species molt; the process of which may be quick or gradual depending on the species. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat, known as blubber, that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped&#x27;s mass. Newborn pups have a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.

The simple stomach of pinnipeds is typical of carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the small intestine. Small intestine lengths range from 8 times (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, allowing for more room in the digestive tract for partially digested food. An appendix is absent in seals. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into lobes and filter out excess salt.

===Locomotion===

Pinnipeds have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. Their elbows and ankles are not externally visible. Pinnipeds are not as fast as cetaceans, typically swimming at compared to around for several species of dolphin. Seals are more agile and flexible, and some otariids, such as the California sea lion, can make dorsal turns as the back of their heads can touch their hind flippers. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and cut through the water. The hair erector muscles are absent, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim.

When swimming, otariids rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limb bones of otariids are reduced in length, giving them less resistance at the elbow joint as the flippers flap; the hind-flippers maneuver them. Phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for maneuvering. Some species leap out of the water, and &quot;ride&quot; waves.

Pinnipeds can move around on land, though not as well as terrestrial animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can &quot;walk&quot; on all fours. The fore-flippers move along a transverse plane, rather than the sagittal plane like the limbs of land mammals. Otariids create momentum by laterally swaying their heads and necks. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids lack the ability to walk on their hind-flippers, and must flop and wriggle their bodies forward as their fore-flippers keep them stable. In some species, the fore-flippers may act like oars pushing against the ground. Phocids can move faster on ice, as they are able to slide.

===Senses===

The eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head. Only the smaller eyes of the walruses are located on each side of the head; since they forage at the bottom for sedentary mollusks. A seal&#x27;s eye is suited for seeing both underwater and in air. Most of retina is equidistant around the spherical lens. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction does not change between air and water. The vascular iris has a strong dilator muscle. A contracted pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal&#x27;s is more horizontal. Compared to deep-diving elephant seals, the iris of shallower species, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, does not change much in size between contraction and expansion. Seals are able to see in relative darkness with a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. 

On land, pinnipeds are near-sighted in dim light. This is reduced in bright light as the contracted pupil decreases the ability of the lens and the cornea to refract (bend) light. Polar living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can withstand the bright light that reflects off snow and ice, which would otherwise cause snow blindness. Because color vision requires at least two types of visual pigments with different spectral sensitivities but pinnipeds lack short-wavelength-sensitive cone cells, they are generally considered to be color-blind. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The walrus can project its eyes out from its sockets in both a forward and upward direction due to its advanced extraocular muscles and absence of an orbital roof. The seal eye is durable as the corneal epithelium is hardened by keratin, and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. Seals also secrete mucus from the lacrimal gland to protect their eyes. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.

The pinniped ear is adapted for hearing underwater, where it can hear sound frequencies of up to 70,000 Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While their airborne hearing sensitivity is generally weaker than humans&#x27;, they still have a wide frequency range. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the elephant seal for underwater hearing and the harbor seal was equally adapted for both. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless under water as their nostrils are closed.

Pinnipeds have well-developed tactile senses. Compared to terrestrial mammals, the moustache-like whiskers or vibrissae of pinnipeds have ten times more nerve connections, allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the water. These vibrations are generated, for example, when a fish swims through water. Detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging, and may add to or even replace vision, particularly in darkness. Harbor seals can follow hydrodynamic paths made by other animals minutes earlier, similar to a dog following a scent trail, and even to discriminate the size and type of object responsible for the trail.

Unlike terrestrial mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do not sweep their whiskers over an object when examining it, but can protract the hairs forward while holding them steady, maximizing their detection. The vibrissa&#x27;s angle relative to the flow seems to be the most important contributor to detection ability. The whiskers of some otariids grow quite long—those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach . Walruses have the most vibrissae, at 600–700 individual hairs. These are important when searching for prey along the bottom. In addition to foraging, whiskers may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.

===Diving adaptations===
To dive, a pinniped must first exhale much of the air out of its lungs and shut its nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. The airways are supported by cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and the chest muscles and alveoli can completely deflate during deeper dives. While land mammals generally cannot empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after alveolar collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their lungs is shifted to the bronchioles and trachea, which stops gas exchange with the blood, and thereby prevents them from developing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.

The circulatory system of pinnipeds is large and elaborate; retia mirabilia line the inside of the trunk and limbs, allowing for greater oxygen storage during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have large amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles respectively. This provides enough oxygen storage for them to stay submerged for long periods. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that represent up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate, and blood flow is mostly restricted to the heart, brain and lungs. Pinnipeds have bulb-shaped ascending aortas which are largest in deeper and longer diving species, allowing them to better maintain their blood pressure.

===Thermoregulation===

Pinnipeds keep warm by having large, thick bodies, insulating blubber and fur, and fast metabolism. Their idle body temperature is around against the ocean water. Metabolic rates of different species vary between 1.5 and 3 times that of land mammals. Also, the blood vessels in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange; small veins surround arteries transporting blood from the body core, capturing heat from them. While blubber and fur keep the seal warm in water, they can also overheat the animal when it is on land. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by covering themselves in sand. Monk seals may even dig up the cooler layers. The northern fur seal cools off by .

===Sleep===
Pinnipeds spend many months at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have recorded them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators, as well as surface for air without fully waking. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.

==Distribution and habitat==
Living pinnipeds are widespread in cold oceanic waters; particularly in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific and the Southern Ocean. By contrast, the consistently warm Indomalayan waters have no seals. Monk seals and some otariids live in tropical and subtropical waters. Seals usually require cool, nutrient-rich waters with temperatures lower than . Even in more tropical climates, lower temperatures and biological productivity may be provided by currents. Only monk seals live in waters that generally lack these features. The Caspian seal and Baikal seal are found in large landlocked bodies of water (the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal respectively).

As a whole, pinnipeds can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats, mostly coastal water, but also open ocean, deep waters near offshore islands, brackish waters and even freshwater lakes and rivers. The Baikal seal is the only exclusively freshwater species. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In non-polar regions, they haul out on to rocky shores, sandy and pebble beaches, sandbanks, tidal flats or pools, and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures built along the coast or offshore. Pinnipeds may move further from the water using sand dunes or vegetation, or even rocky cliffs. New Zealand sea lions may travel to forests from the ocean. In polar regions, seals haul out on to both fast ice and drift ice. Some even den underneath the ice, particularly in pressure ridges and crevasses.

==Behavior and life history==

Pinnipeds have an lifestyle; they are mostly aquatic, but haul out to breed, molt, rest, sun or to avoid aquatic predators. Several species are known to migrate over vast distances, particularly in response to environmental changes. Elephant seals are at sea for most of the year and there are vast distances between their breeding and molting sites. The northern elephant seal is one of farthest mammalian migraters, traveling . Otariids tend to migrate less than phocids, especially tropical species. Traveling seals may reach their destination using geomagnetic fields, water and wind currents, solar and lunar positions and the temperature and chemical makeup of the water.

Pinnipeds may dive during foraging or to avoid predators. When foraging, for example, the Weddell seal typically dives for no more than 15 minutes and deep, but can dive for as long as 73 minutes and reach deep. Northern elephant seals often dive for as long as 20 minutes. They can also dive and for over an hour. The dives of otariids tend to be shorter and less deep. They typically last 5–7 minutes with average depths to . However, the New Zealand sea lion has been recorded diving to a maximum of and have submerged for as long as 12 minutes. The diet of walruses does not require them to dive very deep or very long. Pinnipeds generally live 25–30 years.

===Foraging and predation===

All pinnipeds are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, they mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, but also consume crustaceans, bivalves, zooplankton and endothermic (warm-blooded) prey like sea birds. While most species have generalist diets, a few are specialists. Examples are krill-eating crabeater seals, crustacean-eating ringed seals, squid specialists like the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, and the bearded seal and walrus, which specialize on benthic invertebrates.

Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, immobile or sluggish invertebrates and endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually hunt in coastal or shallow water. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which hunts deep in the open ocean for fish. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups. For large schools of fish or squid, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, will hunt alongside sea birds and cetaceans.

Seals typically swallow their food whole, and will rip apart prey that is too big. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently shake its prey to death. Complex serrations in the teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow water to leak out as they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from their food.

Pinnipeds themselves are subject to predation. Most species are preyed on by the orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas strike them with their heads or tails—the latter causing them to fly in the air—or simply bite into them and rip them apart. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. All age classes may be targeted, but pups most of all. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. Injured seals that escape are usually able to recover from their wounds. Otariids that have been targeted in the hindquarters are more likely to survive, while phocids are more likely to survive with forequarters injures. Pinnipeds are also preyed on by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is a major predator of Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears may seek out seals, or simply wait for them to come by. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. 
Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines. Adult walruses are particularly risky prey for polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts.

Interspecific predation among pinnipeds does occur. The leopard seal is known to prey on many other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, particularly from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions, particularly pups and small adults. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.

===Reproductive behavior===

The mating system of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Species that breed on land are usually more polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals. These species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds prefer to mate on islands where there are fewer land predators. Suitable islands are in short supply and tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land to monopolize females; and may fast for months as they would lose their position if they went to feed at sea. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that equip males for combat. Larger males have more blubber and thus more energy reserves for fasting.

Other seals, like the walrus and most phocids, breed on ice and copulate in the water—a few land-breeding species also mate in water. Females of these species tend to be more spaced out and there is less site fidelity, since ice is less stable than solid land. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, whose distribution of food forces females closer together. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on drift ice. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In Antarctic seals, there is some size bias in favor of females. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.

Adult male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariid males gain access to females by establishing territories where females can bask and give birth and contain valuable resources such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territories are usually marked by natural barriers, and some may be fully or partially underwater. Males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually not very violent, and are mostly limited to early in the season. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce females who are intent on leaving, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males keep females in their territories with threatening displays and even violence. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males establish &quot;maritories&quot; and patrol and defend the waters bordering female haul-out areas, waiting for a female to enter. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males include entries to female breathing holes in the ice.

Lek systems are known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males gather near female herds and try to attract them with elaborate courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals, grey seals and non-lekking walruses, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males, in particular, establish dominance hierarchies via displays and fights, with the highest ranking males having a near monopoly on reproductive success. An alpha male can have a harem of 100 females. Grey seal males usually place themselves among a cluster of females whose members may change over time, while males of some walrus populations guard female herds. Male ringed, crabeater, spotted and hooded seals follow and defend nearby females and mate with them when they reach estrus. These may be lone females or small groups. South American sea lions are considered to be both a territory-defending and female-defending species. Males start the season establishing and defending territories but then claim and defend females when they arrive.

Younger or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways including sneakiness, harassment of females or even coordinated disruption of the colony. Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate with. When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to resist and get away. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will take over and mate with female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay in the center of the colony where they in the domain of a more dominant male, while marginal females are left with subordinates. Female Steller sea lions may solicit their territorial males for mating.

===Birth and parenting===

Except for the walrus, which has five- to six-year gaps between births, female pinnipeds enter estrus shortly after they give birth, and can thus produce pups every year. All species have delayed implantation, in which the embryo does not enter the uterus for weeks or months. Delayed implantation allows the female to wait until conditions are right for birthing. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place in spring and summer. Usually, single pups are born; twins are rare and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born relatively developed and precocial.

Pinniped milk has &quot;little to no lactose&quot;. Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals have a lactation period that lasts days or weeks, during which they fast and nurse their pups on land or ice. The milk of these species consists of up to 60% fat, allowing the young to grow quickly. Each day until they are weaned, northern elephant seal pups gain . Some pups gain weight more quickly than others by stealing extra milk from other mothers. Alloparenting occurs in these fasting species; while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.

For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females forage at sea while the young stay behind onshore. If there is enough food close to shore, a female can be gone for as little as a day, but otherwise may be at sea for as long as three weeks. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last up to three years. Pups of these species are weaned at heavier weights than their phocid counterparts, but the latter grow quicker. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. Young pinnipeds typically start swimming on their own and some species can even swim as newborns. Young may wait days or weeks before entering the water; elephant seals start swimming weeks after weaning.

Male pinnipeds generally play little role in raising the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young as they learn to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. When a group is threatened, all the adults may protect the young. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats to the safety of pups, particularly during fights. Pups of some species may be abducted, assaulted and killed by males, possibly due to sexual frustration.

===Communication===

Pinnipeds can produce a number of vocalizations. While most vocals are audible to the human ear, Weddell seals have been recorded in Antarctica making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Vocals are produced both in air and underwater; the former are more common among otariids and the latter among phocids. Antarctic seals are noisier on land or ice than Arctic seals due to the absence of polar bears. Male vocals are usually deeper than those of the females. Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals display their status and power with &quot;clap-threats&quot; and loud drum-like calls that may be modified by the proboscis. Male otariids have strong barks, growls and roars. Male walruses are known to produce gong-like calls when attempting to attract females, these are amplified underwater with inflatable throat sacs.

The Weddell seal has perhaps the most extensive vocal repertoire, producing both airborne and underwater sounds. Trilling, gluping, chirping, chugging and knocking are some examples of the calls produced underwater. When warning other seals, the calls may be pronounced by &quot;prefixes&quot; and &quot;suffixes&quot;. The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have about seven rhythm patterns and could be categorized as &quot;songs&quot;. Similar calls have been recorded in other Antarctic seals and in bearded seals. In some pinniped species, there appear to be regional dialects or even individual variations in vocalizations. These differences are likely important for territorial males becoming accustomed to their neighbors (dear enemy effect) and mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Female seals emit a &quot;pulsed, bawling&quot; contact call, while pups respond by squawking. Contact calls are particularly important for otariid mothers returning from sea. Other vocalizations produced by seals include grunts, rasps, rattles, creaks, warbles, clicks and whistles.

Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when they feel threatened, hauled-out harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap themselves with their flippers to create a warning sound. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings by pinnipeds. Visual displays also occur: Ross seals resting on the ice will show the stripes on their chests and bare their teeth to a perceived threat, while swimming Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture to intimidate rivals under the ice. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.

===Intelligence===
In a match-to-sample task study, a single California sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry, transitivity and equivalence; a second seal was unable to complete the tasks. They demonstrate the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language, though they only rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a captive California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms. This &quot;rhythmic entrainment&quot; was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry. Adult male elephant seals can recognize each other&#x27;s vocalizations by remembering the rhythm and timbre. In the 1970s, a captive harbor seal named Hoover was trained to imitate human speech and laughter.

For sea lions used in entertainment, trainers toss a ball at the animal or simply place the object on its nose, so it will eventually understand the behavior desired. A sea lion may need a year of training before it can publicly perform. Its long-term memory allows it to perform a trick after as much as three months of non-performance.

==Human relations==
===In culture===
Various human cultures have for millennia depicted pinnipeds. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the sea god Proteus shepherds a colony of seals. In northern Scotland, Celts of Orkney and the Hebrides believed in selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. In Inuit mythology, they are associated with the goddess Sedna, who sometimes transformed into a seal. It was believed that marine mammals, including seals, came from her severed fingers. In modern culture, pinnipeds are thought of as cute, playful and comical figures.

===In captivity===
Pinnipeds can be found in facilities around the world, as their size and playfulness make them popular attractions. Seals have been kept in captivity since at least ancient Rome and their trainability was noticed by Pliny the Elder. Zoologist Georges Cuvier noted during the 19th century that wild seals show considerable affection for humans and stated that they are second only to some monkeys among wild animals in their easy tamability. Francis Galton noted in his seminal work on domestication that seals were a spectacular example of an animal that would most likely never be domesticated, despite their friendliness, survivability and &quot;desire for comfort&quot;, because they serve no practical use for humans.

Some modern exhibits have a pool with artificial haul-out sites and a rocky background, while others have seals housed in shelters located above a pool which they can jump into. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most popular captive pinniped is the California sea lion, due to its trainability and adaptability. Other commonly kept species include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to keeping marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also state that the tricks performed for audiences are &quot;exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors&quot; and distract the people from the animal&#x27;s unnatural environment.

California sea lions are used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals have been trained to swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver&#x27;s leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their job is done.

===Hunting===
Humans have hunted seals since the Stone Age. Originally, seals were merely hit with clubs during haul-out. Eventually, more lethal weapons were used, like spears and harpoons. They were also trapped in nets. The use of firearms in seal hunting during the modern era drastically increased the number of killings. Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber. The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into coats, and the tusks of walruses have been used as ivory. There is a distinction made between the subsistence hunting of seals by indigenous peoples of the Arctic and commercial hunting: subsistence hunters depend on seal products for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as more sustainable and smaller in scope. However indigenous people have recently used more modern technology and are profiting more from seal products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term &quot;subsistence&quot; should also apply to these activities, as long as they are local in scale. More than 100,000 phocids (especially ringed seals) as well as around 10,000 walruses are harvested annually by native hunters.
Commercial sealing rivaled whaling as an important industry throughout history. Harvested species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. After the 1960s, the harvesting of seals decreased substantially as an industry after the Canadian government implemented measures to protect female seals and restrict the hunting season. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may have reached their pre-harvesting numbers. The northern elephant seal nearly went extinct in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of the Mediterranean and its current range is still limited.

Several species of pinniped continue to be exploited. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals protects species within the Antarctic and surrounding waters, but allows restricted hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. Weddell seal hunting is forbidden between September and February if the animal is older than a year, to ensure healthy population growth. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.

The Caribbean monk seal has been killed and exploited by European settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with Christopher Columbus himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, turtle hunters and buccaneers because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus &quot;genetically tame&quot;. In the Bahamas, as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. The species was considered to be already extinct by the mid-nineteenth century until a small colony was found near the Yucatán Peninsula in 1866. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996. The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands, but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s. The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974.

==Conservation issues==

As of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 36 pinniped species. With the Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal recently extinct, ten more are considered at risk. They are ranked as:

*&quot;Endangered&quot;: Hawaiian monk seal, Mediterranean monk seal, Galápagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, New Zealand sea lion, Caspian seal, and Galápagos sea lion.
*&quot;Vulnerable&quot;: northern fur seal, hooded seal, and walrus.

Pinnipeds face various threats. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. Organic chemicals tend to accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, and decreased fertility and immunity to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.
Species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of climate change on oceans, particularly declines in sea ice. In 2010 and 2011, sea ice in the Northwest Atlantic was at or near an all-time low and harp seals as well as ringed seals that bred on thin ice saw increased death rates. In the Antarctic, the decreased duration and extent of the sea ice and nutrient availability could potentially reduce the survival of Weddell seal pups and may have important implications for population growth rates. Antarctic fur seals in South Georgia in the South Atlantic saw major decreases over a 20-year study, during which scientists measured increased sea surface temperature anomalies.

Some species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better resist sea lion use. Inland-living New Zealand sea lions face unique human conflicts such as road mortality and run-ins with human infrastructure. Seals also conflict with fisherman. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fishermen demanded that brown fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.

<text>Mephitidae is a family of mammals comprising the skunks and stink badgers. They are noted for the great development of their anal scent glands, which they use to deter predators. Skunks were formerly classified as a subfamily of the Mustelidae (the weasel family); however, in the 1990s, genetic evidence caused skunks to be treated as a separate family. Similarly, the stink badgers had been classified with badgers, but genetic evidence shows they share a more recent common ancestor with skunks, so they are now included in the skunk family. A 2017 study using retroposon markers indicated that they are most closely related to the Ailuridae (red pandas and allies) and Procyonidae (raccoons and allies).

There are twelve extant species of mephitids in four genera: &quot;Conepatus&quot; (hog-nosed skunks, four species); &quot;Mephitis&quot; (the hooded and striped skunks, two species); &quot;Mydaus&quot; (stink badgers, two species); and &quot;Spilogale&quot; (spotted skunks, four species). The two stink badgers in the genus &quot;Mydaus&quot; inhabit Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines; the other members of the family inhabit the Americas, ranging from Canada to central South America. All other mephitids are extinct, known through fossils, including those from Eurasia. 

In taxonomic order, the living species of Mephitidae are:

<text>Self is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language based on the concept of &quot;prototypes&quot;. Self began as a dialect of Smalltalk, being dynamically typed and using just-in-time compilation (JIT) with the prototype-based approach to objects: it was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006, Self was still being developed as part of the Klein project, which was a Self virtual machine written fully in Self. The latest version, 2024.1 was released in August 2024.

Several just-in-time compilation techniques were pioneered and improved in Self research as they were required to allow a very high level object oriented language to perform at up to half the speed of optimized C. Much of the development of Self took place at Sun Microsystems, and the techniques they developed were later deployed for Java&#x27;s HotSpot virtual machine.

At one point a version of Smalltalk was implemented in Self. Because it was able to use the JIT, this also gave extremely good performance.

== History ==
Self was designed mostly by David Ungar and Randall Smith in 1986 while working at Xerox PARC. Their objective was to advance the state of the art in object-oriented programming language research, once Smalltalk-80 was released by the labs and began to be taken seriously by the industry. They moved to Stanford University and continued work on the language, building the first working Self compiler in 1987. Then, focus changed to working to build a full system for Self, in contrast to only the language.

The first public release was in 1990, and the next year the team moved to Sun Microsystems where they continued work on the language. Several new releases followed until falling largely dormant in 1995 with version 4.0. In 2006, version 4.3 was released, for Mac OS X and Solaris. in 2010, a new release, version 4.4, was developed by a group comprising some of the original team and independent programmers, for Mac OS X and Linux, as are all later versions. In January 2014, a follow-up, 4.5 was released, and three years later, version 2017.1 was released in May 2017.

The Morphic user interface construction environment was originally developed by Randy Smith and John Maloney for the Self programming language. Morphic has been ported to other notable programming languages including Squeak, JavaScript, Python, and Objective-C.

Self also inspired a number of languages based on its concepts. Most notable, perhaps, were NewtonScript for the Apple Newton and JavaScript used in all modern browsers. Other examples include Io, Lisaac and Agora. The IBM Tivoli Framework&#x27;s distributed object system, developed in 1990, was, at the lowest level, a prototype based object system inspired by Self.

== Prototype-based programming languages ==

Traditional class-based OO languages are based on a deep-rooted duality:
#Classes define the basic qualities and behaviours of objects.
#Object instances are particular manifestations of a class.

For example, suppose objects of the codice_1 class have a &quot;name&quot; and the ability to perform various actions, such as &quot;drive to work&quot; and &quot;deliver construction materials&quot;. codice_2 is a particular object (instance) of the class codice_1, with the name &quot;Bob&#x27;s car&quot;. In theory one can then send a message to codice_2, telling it to &quot;deliver construction materials&quot;.

This example shows one of the problems with this approach: Bob&#x27;s car, which happens to be a sports car, is not able to carry and deliver construction materials (in any meaningful sense), but this is a capability that codice_1s are modelled to have. A more useful model arises from the use of subclassing to create specializations of codice_1; for example codice_7 and codice_8. Only objects of the class codice_8 need provide a mechanism to &quot;deliver construction materials&quot;; sports cars, which are ill-suited to that sort of work, need only &quot;drive fast&quot;. However, this deeper model requires more insight during design, insight that may only come to light as problems arise.

This issue is one of the motivating factors behind prototypes. Unless one can predict with certainty what qualities a set of objects and classes will have in the distant future, one cannot design a class hierarchy properly. All too often the program would eventually need added behaviours, and sections of the system would need to be re-designed (or refactored) to break out the objects in a different way. Experience with early OO languages like Smalltalk showed that this sort of issue came up again and again. Systems would tend to grow to a point and then become very rigid, as the basic classes deep below the programmer&#x27;s code grew to be simply &quot;wrong&quot;. Without some way to easily change the original class, serious problems could arise.

Dynamic languages such as Smalltalk allowed for this sort of change via well-known methods in the classes; by changing the class, the objects based on it would change their behaviour. However, such changes had to be done very carefully, as other objects based on the same class might be expecting this &quot;wrong&quot; behavior: &quot;wrong&quot; is often dependent on the context. (This is one form of the fragile base class problem.) Further, in languages like C++, where subclasses can be compiled separately from superclasses, a change to a superclass can actually break precompiled subclass methods. (This is another form of the fragile base class problem, and also one form of the fragile binary interface problem.)

In Self, and other prototype-based languages, the duality between classes and object instances is eliminated.

Instead of having an &quot;instance&quot; of an object that is based on some &quot;class&quot;, in Self one makes a copy of an existing object, and changes it. So codice_2 would be created by making a copy of an existing &quot;Vehicle&quot; object, and then adding the &quot;drive fast&quot; method, modelling the fact that it happens to be a Porsche 911. Basic objects that are used primarily to make copies are known as &quot;prototypes&quot;. This technique is claimed to greatly simplify dynamism. If an existing object (or set of objects) proves to be an inadequate model, a programmer may simply create a modified object with the correct behavior, and use that instead. Code which uses the existing objects is not changed.

== Description ==
Self objects are a collection of &quot;slots&quot;. Slots are accessor methods that return values, and placing a colon after the name of a slot sets the value. For example, for a slot called &quot;name&quot;,
myPerson name
returns the value in name, and
myPerson name:&#x27;foo&#x27;
sets it.

Self, like Smalltalk, uses &quot;blocks&quot; for flow control and other duties. Methods are objects containing code in addition to slots (which they use for arguments and temporary values), and can be placed in a Self slot just like any other object: a number for example. The syntax remains the same in either case.

Note that there is no distinction in Self between fields and methods: everything is a slot. Since accessing slots via messages forms the majority of the syntax in Self, many messages are sent to &quot;self&quot;, and the &quot;self&quot; can be left off (hence the name).

=== Basic syntax ===
The syntax for accessing slots is similar to that of Smalltalk. Three kinds of messages are available:
;unary : codice_11
;binary : codice_12
;keyword : codice_13

All messages return results, so the receiver (if present) and arguments can be themselves the result of other messages. Following a message by a period means Self will discard the returned value. For example:

&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27; print.

This is the Self version of the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program. The codice_14 syntax indicates a literal string object. Other literals include numbers, blocks and general objects.

Grouping can be forced by using parentheses. In the absence of explicit grouping, the unary messages are considered to have the highest precedence followed by binary (grouping left to right) and the keywords having the lowest. The use of keywords for assignment would lead to some extra parenthesis where expressions also had keyword messages, so to avoid that Self requires that the first part of a keyword message selector start with a lowercase letter, and subsequent parts start with an uppercase letter.

valid: base bottom
 between: ligature bottom + height
 And: base top / scale factor.

can be parsed unambiguously, and means the same as:

valid: ((base bottom)
 between: ((ligature bottom) + height)
 And: ((base top) / (scale factor))).

In Smalltalk-80, the same expression would be written as:

valid := self base bottom
 between: self ligature bottom + self height
 and: self base top / self scale factor.

assuming codice_15, codice_16, codice_17 and codice_18 were not instance variables of codice_19 but were, in fact, methods.

=== Making new objects ===
Consider a slightly more complex example:

labelWidget copy label: &#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;.

makes a copy of the &quot;labelWidget&quot; object with the copy message (no shortcut this time), then sends it a message to put &quot;Hello, World&quot; into the slot called &quot;label&quot;. Now to do something with it:

(desktop activeWindow) draw: (labelWidget copy label: &#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;).

In this case the codice_20 is performed first, returning the active window from the list of windows that the desktop object knows about. Next (read inner to outer, left to right) the code we examined earlier returns the labelWidget. Finally the widget is sent into the draw slot of the active window.

=== Delegation ===

In theory, every Self object is a stand-alone entity. Self has neither classes nor meta-classes. Changes to a particular object do not affect any other, but in some cases it is desirable if they did. Normally an object can understand only messages corresponding to its local slots, but by having one or more slots indicating &quot;parent&quot; objects, an object can delegate any message it does not understand itself to the parent object. Any slot can be made a parent pointer by adding an asterisk as a suffix. In this way Self handles duties that would use inheritance in class-based languages. Delegation can also be used to implement features such as namespaces and lexical scoping.

For example, suppose an object is defined called &quot;bank account&quot;, that is used in a simple bookkeeping application. Usually, this object would be created with the methods inside, perhaps &quot;deposit&quot; and &quot;withdraw&quot;, and any data slots needed by them. This is a prototype, which is only special in the way it is used since it also happens to be a fully functional bank account.

===Traits===
Making a clone of this object for &quot;Bob&#x27;s account&quot; will create a new object which starts out exactly like the prototype. In this case we have copied the slots including the methods and any data. However a more common solution is to first make a more simple object called a traits object which contains the items that one would normally associate with a class.

In this example the &quot;bank account&quot; object would not have the deposit and withdraw method, but would have as a parent an object that did. In this way many copies of the bank account object can be made, but we can still change the behaviour of them all by changing the slots in that root object.

How is this any different from a traditional class? Well consider the meaning of:

myObject parent: someOtherObject.

This excerpt changes the &quot;class&quot; of myObject at runtime by changing the value associated with the &#x27;parent*&#x27; slot (the asterisk is part of the slot name, but not the corresponding messages). Unlike with inheritance or lexical scoping, the delegate object can be modified at runtime.

=== Adding slots ===
Objects in Self can be modified to include additional slots. This can be done using the graphical programming environment, or with the primitive &#x27;_AddSlots:&#x27;. A primitive has the same syntax as a normal keyword message, but its name starts with the underscore character. The _AddSlots primitive should be avoided because it is a left over from early implementations. However, we will show it in the example below because it makes the code shorter.

An earlier example was about refactoring a simple class called Vehicle in order to be able to differentiate the behaviour between cars and trucks. In Self one would accomplish this with something like this:

_AddSlots: (| vehicle &lt;- (|parent* = traits clonable|) |).

Since the receiver of the &#x27;_AddSlots:&#x27; primitive isn&#x27;t indicated, it is &quot;self&quot;. In the case of expressions typed at the prompt, that is an object called the &quot;lobby&quot;. The argument for &#x27;_AddSlots:&#x27; is the object whose slots will be copied over to the receiver. In this case it is a literal object with exactly one slot. The slot&#x27;s name is &#x27;vehicle&#x27; and its value is another literal object. The &quot;&lt;-&quot; notation implies a second slot called &#x27;vehicle:&#x27; which can be used to change the first slot&#x27;s value.

The &quot;=&quot; indicates a constant slot, so there is no corresponding &#x27;parent:&#x27;. The literal object that is the initial value of &#x27;vehicle&#x27; includes a single slot so it can understand messages related to cloning. A truly empty object, indicated as (| |) or more simply as (), cannot receive any messages at all.

vehicle _AddSlots: (| name &lt;- &#x27;automobile&#x27;|).

Here the receiver is the previous object, which now will include &#x27;name&#x27; and &#x27;name:&#x27; slots in addition to &#x27;parent*&#x27;.

_AddSlots: (| sportsCar &lt;- vehicle copy |).
sportsCar _AddSlots: (| driveToWork = (&quot;some code, this is a method&quot;) |).

Though previously &#x27;vehicle&#x27; and &#x27;sportsCar&#x27; were exactly alike, now the latter includes a new slot with a method that the original doesn&#x27;t have. Methods can only be included in constant slots.

_AddSlots: (| porsche911 &lt;- sportsCar copy |).
porsche911 name:&#x27;Bobs Porsche&#x27;.

The new object &#x27;porsche911&#x27; started out exactly like &#x27;sportsCar&#x27;, but the last message changed the value of its &#x27;name&#x27; slot. Note that both still have exactly the same slots even though one of them has a different value.

== Environment ==
One feature of Self is that it is based on the same sort of virtual machine system that earlier Smalltalk systems used. That is, programs are not stand-alone entities as they are in languages such as C, but need their entire memory environment in order to run. This requires that applications be shipped in chunks of saved memory known as &quot;snapshots&quot; or &quot;images&quot;. One disadvantage of this approach is that images are sometimes large and unwieldy; however, debugging an image is often simpler than debugging traditional programs because the runtime state is easier to inspect and modify. (The difference between source-based and image-based development is analogous to the difference between class-based and prototypical object-oriented programming.)

In addition, the environment is tailored to the rapid and continual change of the objects in the system. Refactoring a &quot;class&quot; design is as simple as dragging methods out of the existing ancestors into new ones. Simple tasks like test methods can be handled by making a copy, dragging the method into the copy, then changing it. Unlike traditional systems, only the changed object has the new code, and nothing has to be rebuilt in order to test it. If the method works, it can simply be dragged back into the ancestor.

===Performance===
Self VMs achieved performance of approximately half the speed of optimised C on some benchmarks.

This was achieved by just-in-time compilation techniques which were pioneered and improved in Self research to make a high level language perform this well.

===Garbage collection===
The garbage collector for Self uses generational garbage collection which segregates objects by age. By using the memory management system to record page writes a write-barrier can be maintained. This technique gives excellent performance, although after running for some time a full garbage collection can occur, taking considerable time.

===Optimizations===
The run time system selectively flattens call structures. This gives modest speedups in itself, but allows extensive caching of type information and multiple versions of code for different caller types. This removes the need to do many method lookups and permits conditional branch statements and hard-coded calls to be inserted- often giving C-like performance with no loss of generality at the language level, but on a fully garbage collected system.

<doc id="60266" wikidata="Q4117102" url="?curid=60266" title="Funeral in Berlin">
<text>Funeral in Berlin is a 1964 spy novel by Len Deighton set between Saturday 5 October and Sunday 10 November 1963. It was the third of Deighton&#x27;s novels about an unnamed British agent. It was preceded by &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; (1962) and &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; (1963), and followed by &quot;Billion-Dollar Brain&quot; (1966).

==Plot==
The protagonist, who is unnamed, travels to Berlin to arrange the defection of a Soviet scientist named Semitsa, this being brokered by Johnny Vulkan of the Berlin intelligence community. Despite the protagonist&#x27;s scepticism, the deal seems to have the support of Russian security-chief Colonel Stok and Hallam at the Home Office. The fake documentation for Semitsa needs to be precisely specified. An Israeli intelligence agent named Samantha Steel is involved in the case but it soon becomes apparent that behind the façade of an elaborate mock funeral lies a game of deadly manoeuvres and ruthless tactics.

==Legal dispute==

The UK publication of &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; brought on a lawsuit: At the novel&#x27;s climax, the protagonist and Hallam meet at a fireworks party where they discuss the hazards of fireworks. The dialogue went on to say the Home Office was hampered from taking action by vested interests, and mentioned Brock&#x27;s Fireworks, a UK company, by name. Brock&#x27;s objected to this, and sued for libel. The complaint was upheld, and the 1972 Penguin edition had the dialogue deleted. This ruling did not affect books published elsewhere, which continued to contain the offending material.

==Adaptation==
A film version of &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; was made in 1966, starring Michael Caine and directed by Guy Hamilton. In 1973, the TV series &quot;Jason King&quot; (starring Peter Wyngarde), used the plot from &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; to smuggle an individual out of East Germany. The book is shown at the end of the episode. (Ostensibly, they had been using a plot from a book written by eponymous hero Jason King but it turns out at the end that it was a double bluff. King ostentatiously throws the Deighton book into the fireplace.)

<doc id="60267" wikidata="Q4911990" url="?curid=60267" title="Billion-Dollar Brain">
<text>Billion-Dollar Brain is a 1966 Cold War spy novel by Len Deighton. It was the fourth to feature an unnamed secret agent working for the British WOOC(P) intelligence agency. It follows &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; (1962), &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; (1963), and &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1964). As in most of Deighton&#x27;s novels, the plot of &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967) is intricate, with many dead ends.

==Plot==
The unnamed protagonist is ordered to Helsinki by Dawlish, his boss, to suppress a newspaper article, potentially embarrassing to the U.K. government, about to be published by a Finnish journalist. He finds the journalist murdered and coincidentally meets a young woman who attempts to recruit him into the British Intelligence. This woman, Signe Laine, is both romantically connected to and working for the protagonist&#x27;s old American friend Harvey Newbegin (who also appeared in &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot;). Newbegin in turn attempts to recruit him into a private intelligence outfit, whose network is operated by &#x27;The Brain&#x27;, a billion dollar super-computer owned by eccentric Texan billionaire General Midwinter.

Midwinter is using his agency and private army to start an uprising in Latvia, at the time a part of the USSR, to end Communism in the Eastern bloc and tip the balance of the Cold War in favour of the West. After discovering this and also the fact that a package Newbegin wants delivered from England to Finland contains virus-contaminated eggs, stolen from a British research institute, the protagonist treks from Finland through Riga, Leningrad, New York City, Texas and back to London. He infiltrates Midwinter&#x27;s organization, braving unforgiving environments, violence and shifting loyalties, eventually to return to the Baltic to stop the virus from falling into the hands of the Soviets and the madman billionaire and protect British reputations in the process.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was filmed as &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; in 1967, the third instalment of the Harry Palmer series of films based on Deighton&#x27;s novels, featuring Michael Caine; it was a commercial flop.

<text>Kim is a picaresque novel by Nobel Prize-winning English author Rudyard Kipling. It was first published serially in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from December 1900 to October 1901 as well as in &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from January to November 1901, and first published in book form by Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd in October 1901. The novel is notable for its detailed portrait of the people, culture, and varied religions of India. &quot;The book presents a vivid picture of India, its teeming populations, religions, and superstitions, and the life of the bazaars and the road.&quot; The story unfolds against the backdrop of the Great Game, the political conflict between Russia and Britain in Central Asia. The novel popularized the phrase and idea of the Great Game.

==Synopsis==
The story is set after the Second Anglo-Afghan War (which ended in 1881), but before the Third (fought in 1919), probably in the period of 1893 to 1898.

Kim (Kimball O&#x27;Hara) is the orphaned son of an Irish soldier (Kimball O&#x27;Hara Sr., a former colour sergeant) and a poor Irish mother (a former nanny in a colonel&#x27;s household) who have both died in poverty. Living a vagabond existence in India under British rule in the late 19th century, Kim lives by begging and running small errands on the streets of Lahore. He occasionally works for Mahbub Ali, a Pashtun horse trader who is one of the native operatives of the British secret service. Kim is so tanned and immersed in the local culture that few realise he is white.

Kim befriends an aged Tibetan lama on a quest to free himself from the Wheel of Things by finding the legendary &quot;River of the Arrow&quot;. Kim becomes his &quot;chela&quot; (disciple) and accompanies him on his journey, initially walking along the Grand Trunk Road. On the way, Kim learns about the Great Game and is recruited by Mahbub Ali to carry a message to the head of the British Secret Service in Umballa.

Kim encounters and recognises his father&#x27;s regiment on the march. Curious, he sneaks in when the soldiers camp for the night. He is caught and mistaken for a thief, but the regimental chaplain identifies Kim by his Masonic certificate, which is sewn into an amulet that he wears around his neck. Upon learning of Kim&#x27;s connection to the regiment, the lama insists that the boy comply with the chaplain&#x27;s plan to send him to an English school in Lucknow. The lama, a former abbot, pays for Kim&#x27;s education.

Throughout his years at school, Kim remains in contact with the holy man he has come to love. He is also trained in espionage (to be a surveyor) while on vacation from school by Lurgan Sahib, a sort of benevolent Fagin, at his jewellery shop in Simla. As part of his training, Kim is given brief looks at a tray full of mixed objects and notes which have been added or taken away, a pastime still called Kim&#x27;s Game, also called the Jewel Game. Other parts of this training are disguise and the careful study of the Indian population, and the characteristic dress, behaviour and &quot;even how they spit&quot; in order to go undercover or to uncover those in disguise. He also accompanies Mahbub Ali on one school break; when he proves apt at spying on and evaluating how to capture the city of Bikanir, Mahbub Ali persuades his superior, a skeptical Colonel Creighton, that the boy is ready.

After three years of schooling, Kim begins to take part in the Great Game, joining the Secret Service at 20 rupees a month. Kim rejoins the lama and at the behest of Kim&#x27;s superior, Hurree Chunder Mookherjee, they make a trip to the Himalayas so they can try to find out what a couple of Russian intelligence agents, one Russian and one Frenchman, are doing there. Kim obtains maps, papers and other important items from the Russian agents, who are working to undermine British control of the region. Mookherjee persuades the Russian agents to hire him as a guide. When the Russian strikes the lama in the face, Kim attacks the man, then flees when shot at, while the outraged porters abandon the party and take the lama away to safety.

The lama realises that he has gone astray. His search for the River of the Arrow should be taking place in the plains, not in the mountains, and he orders the porters to take them back. Here Kim and the lama are nursed back to health after their arduous journey. Kim delivers the Russian documents to Hurree, and a concerned Mahbub Ali comes to check on Kim.

The lama finds his river and is convinced he has achieved Enlightenment, and wants to share it with Kim.

==Critical assessment==
Considered by many to be Kipling&#x27;s masterpiece, opinion is varied about its consideration as children&#x27;s literature or not. Roger Sale, in his history of children&#x27;s literature, concludes &quot;&quot;Kim&quot; is the apotheosis of the Victorian cult of childhood, but it shines now as bright as ever, long after the Empire&#x27;s collapse...&quot;

About a reissue of the novel in 1959 by Macmillan, the reviewer writes &quot;&quot;Kim&quot; is a book worked at three levels. It is a tale of adventure...It is the drama of a boy having entirely his boy&#x27;s own way...and it is the mystical exegesis of this pattern of behaviour...&quot; This reviewer concludes &quot;&quot;Kim&quot; will endure because it is a beginning like all masterly ends...&quot;

Nirad C. Chaudhuri considered it the best story (in English) about India – noting Kipling&#x27;s appreciation of the ecological force of &quot;the twin setting of the mountains and the plain...an unbreakable articulation between the Himalayas and the Indo-Gangetic plain&quot;.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Kim&quot; No. 78 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novel&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
* An MGM film adaptation of the novel, directed by Victor Saville and produced by Leon Gordon, was released in 1950. It was adapted by Helen Deutsch and Leon Gordon, and starred Errol Flynn, Dean Stockwell, Paul Lukas, Robert Douglas, Thomas Gomez and Cecil Kellaway.
*In 1960, a one-hour color adaptation of &quot;Kim&quot; was televised as part of NBC&#x27;s series &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;. Tony Haig portrayed Kim, Michael Rennie played Captain Creighton, and Alan Napier played Colonel Devlin.
* A London Films television film version of &quot;Kim&quot; was made in 1984. It was directed by John Davies and starred Peter O&#x27;Toole, Bryan Brown, John Rhys-Davies, Julian Glover and Ravi Sheth as Kim.

===Games===
* A 2016 computer game, named after the novel, adapted the book.

==Homages to and works inspired by &quot;Kim&quot;==
* The first part of Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; depicts a clever boy of mysterious parentage living in a feudal planet and guided by an interstellar spy. Peopled with fakirs, street vendors and wealthy elites, the beginning of the novel parallels &quot;Kim&quot; in many ways.
*Paul Scott&#x27;s four-novel sequence &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; (1966–1975) contains a subplot which mirrors &quot;Kim&quot;: an Indian boy (Hari Kumar/Harry Coomer) is sent to England by his wealthy father to be raised in such a manner that when he returns, Englishmen will not be able to tell that he&#x27;s Indian.
* Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Game of Empire&quot;, the last of his Dominic Flandry series, is loosely modeled on &quot;Kim&quot;. Like others in the series, the novel takes place in a future galactic empire setting.
* T.N. Murari&#x27;s &quot;The Imperial Agent&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Last Victory&quot; (1989) are sequels to &quot;Kim&quot;.
* Tim Powers&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;Declare&quot; uses &quot;Kim&quot; for inspiration and epigraphs.
* In Laurie R. King&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Game&quot; (book 7 of the Mary Russell series), the protagonist and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, travel to India in search of Kimball O&#x27;Hara, who Holmes has encountered after the events of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.
* Steven Gould&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;7th Sigma&quot; is based on the novel. Gould&#x27;s work features a young boy (named Kim) who is raised by a martial arts teacher and becomes involved in intelligence work. Quotes from &quot;Kim&quot; are used as chapter headers.

==Real-life tributes==
The town of Kim, Colorado, is named in honour of the book.

British spy and defector Kim Philby was born Harold Philby in Ambala, then in British India. His father, a member of the Indian Civil Service, gave him the nickname &#x27;Kim&#x27; on account of his fraternisation with the servants.

<doc id="60280" wikidata="Q183492" url="?curid=60280" title="Margaret Atwood">
<text>Margaret Eleanor Atwood (born November 18, 1939) is a Canadian novelist, poet, and literary critic. Since 1961, she has published 18 books of poetry, 18 novels, 11 books of nonfiction, nine collections of short fiction, eight children&#x27;s books, two graphic novels, and a number of small press editions of both poetry and fiction. Her best-known work is the 1985 dystopian novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale.&quot; Atwood has won numerous awards and honors for her writing, including two Booker Prizes, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Franz Kafka Prize, Princess of Asturias Awards, and the National Book Critics and PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Awards. A number of her works have been adapted for film and television.

Atwood&#x27;s works encompass a variety of themes including gender and identity, religion and myth, the power of language, climate change, and &quot;power politics&quot;. Many of her poems are inspired by myths and fairy tales which interested her from a very early age.

Atwood is a founder of the Griffin Poetry Prize and the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada. She is also a Senior Fellow of Massey College, Toronto. She is the inventor of the LongPen device and associated technologies that facilitate remote robotic writing of documents.

== Early life and education ==
Atwood was born on November 18, 1939, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the second of three children of Carl Edmund Atwood, an entomologist, and Margaret Dorothy (née Killam), a former dietitian and nutritionist from Woodville, Nova Scotia. Because of her father&#x27;s research in forest entomology, Atwood spent much of her childhood in the backwoods of northern Quebec, and traveling back and forth between Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie and Toronto.

She did not attend school full-time until she was 12 years old. She became a voracious reader of literature, Dell pocketbook mysteries, &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, Canadian animal stories, and comic books. She attended Leaside High School in Leaside, Toronto, and graduated in 1957. Atwood began writing plays and poems at the age of 6.

As a child, she also participated in the Brownie program of Girl Guides of Canada. Atwood has written about her experiences in Girl Guides in several of her publications.

Atwood realized she wanted to write professionally when she was 16. In 1957, she began studying at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, where she published poems and articles in &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot;, the college literary journal, and participated in the sophomore theatrical tradition of &quot;The Bob Comedy Revue&quot;. Her professors included Jay Macpherson and Northrop Frye. She graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts in English (honours) and minors in philosophy and French.

In 1961, Atwood began graduate studies at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, with a Woodrow Wilson fellowship. She obtained a master&#x27;s degree (MA) from Radcliffe in 1962 and pursued doctoral studies for two years, but did not finish her dissertation, &quot;The English Metaphysical Romance&quot;.

==Personal life==

Atwood has a sister, Ruth Atwood, born in 1951, and a brother who is two years older, Harold Leslie Atwood. She has claimed that, according to her grandmother (maiden name Webster), the 17th-century witchcraft-lynching survivor Mary Webster might have been an ancestor: &quot;On Monday, my grandmother would say Mary was her ancestor, and on Wednesday she would say she wasn&#x27;t ... So take your pick.&quot; Webster is the subject of Atwood&#x27;s poem &quot;Half-Hanged Mary&quot;, as well as the subject of Atwood&#x27;s dedication in her novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985). At the beginning &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; was named after its main character, &quot;Offred&quot;. 

Atwood married Jim Polk, an American writer, in 1968, but they divorced in 1973. She formed a relationship with fellow novelist Graeme Gibson soon afterward and moved to a farm near Alliston, Ontario, where their daughter, Eleanor Jess Atwood Gibson, was born in 1976.

The family returned to Toronto in 1980. Atwood and Gibson were together until September 18, 2019, when Gibson died after suffering from dementia. She wrote about Gibson in the poem &quot;Dearly&quot; and in an accompanying essay on grief and poetry published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2020. Atwood said about Gibson &quot;He wasn&#x27;t an egotist, so he wasn&#x27;t threatened by anything I was doing. He said to our daughter towards the end of his life, &#x27;Your mum would still have been a writer if she hadn&#x27;t met me, but she wouldn&#x27;t have had as much fun&#x27;&quot;.

Although she is an accomplished writer, Atwood says that she is &quot;a terrible speller&quot; who writes both on a computer and by hand.

Atwood maintains a summer home on Pelee Island in Lake Erie.

==Career==

=== 1960s ===
Atwood&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Double Persephone&quot;, was published as a pamphlet by Hawkshead Press in 1961, and won the E. J. Pratt Medal. While continuing to write, Atwood was a lecturer in English at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, from 1964 to 1965, Instructor in English at the Sir George Williams University in Montreal from 1967 to 1968, and taught at the University of Alberta from 1969 to 1970. In 1966, &quot;The Circle Game&quot; was published, winning the Governor General&#x27;s Award. This collection was followed by three other small press collections of poetry: &quot;Kaleidoscopes Baroque: a poem&quot;, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); &quot;Talismans for Children&quot;, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); and &quot;Speeches for Doctor Frankenstein&quot;, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1966); as well as &quot;The Animals in That Country&quot; (1968). Atwood&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Edible Woman&quot;, was published in 1969. As a social satire of North American consumerism, many critics have often cited the novel as an early example of the feminist concerns found in many of Atwood&#x27;s works.

=== 1970s ===
Atwood taught at York University in Toronto from 1971 to 1972 and was a writer in residence at the University of Toronto during the 1972/1973 academic year. Atwood published six collections of poetry over the course of the decade: &quot;The Journals of Susanna Moodie&quot; (1970), &quot;Procedures for Underground&quot; (1970), &quot;Power Politics&quot; (1971), &quot;You Are Happy&quot; (1974), &quot;Selected Poems 1965–1975&quot; (1976), and &quot;Two-Headed Poems&quot; (1978). Atwood also published three novels during this time: &quot;Surfacing&quot; (1972); &quot;Lady Oracle&quot; (1976); and &quot;Life Before Man&quot; (1979), which was a finalist for the Governor General&#x27;s Award. &quot;Surfacing&quot;, &quot;Lady Oracle&quot;, and &quot;Life Before Man&quot;, like &quot;The Edible Woman&quot;, explore identity and social constructions of gender as they relate to topics such as nationhood and sexual politics. In particular, &quot;Surfacing&quot;, along with her first non-fiction monograph, &quot;&quot; (1972), helped establish Atwood as an important and emerging voice in Canadian literature. In 1977 Atwood published her first short story collection, &quot;Dancing Girls&quot;, which was the winner of the St. Lawrence Award for Fiction and the award of The Periodical Distributors of Canada for Short Fiction.

By 1976, there was such interest in Atwood, her works, and her life that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; declared her to be &quot;Canada&#x27;s most gossiped-about writer.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
Atwood&#x27;s literary reputation continued to rise in the 1980s with the publication of &quot;Bodily Harm&quot; (1981); &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985), winner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award and 1985 Governor General&#x27;s Award and finalist for the 1986 Booker Prize; and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1988), finalist for both the 1988 Governor General&#x27;s Award and the 1989 Booker Prize. Despite her distaste for literary labels, Atwood has since conceded to referring to &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; as a work of science fiction or, more precisely, speculative fiction. As she has repeatedly noted, &quot;There&#x27;s a precedent in real life for everything in the book. I decided not to put anything in that somebody somewhere hadn&#x27;t already done.&quot;

While reviewers and critics have been tempted to read autobiographical elements of Atwood&#x27;s life in her work, particularly &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;, in general Atwood resists the desire of critics to read too closely for an author&#x27;s life in their writing. Filmmaker Michael Rubbo&#x27;s &quot;Margaret Atwood: Once in August&quot; (1984) details the filmmaker&#x27;s frustration in uncovering autobiographical evidence and inspiration in Atwood&#x27;s works.

During the 1980s, Atwood continued to teach, serving as the MFA Honorary Chair at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, 1985; the Berg Professor of English, New York University, 1986; Writer-in-Residence, Macquarie University, Australia, 1987; and Writer-in-Residence, Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, 1989. Regarding her stints with teaching, she has noted, &quot;Success for me meant no longer having to teach at university.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
Atwood&#x27;s reputation as a writer continued to grow with the publication of the novels &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; (1993), finalist for the 1994 Governor General&#x27;s Award and shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Award, and &quot;Alias Grace&quot; (1996), winner of the 1996 Giller Prize, finalist for the 1996 Booker Prize, finalist for the 1996 Governor General&#x27;s Award, and shortlisted for the 1997 Orange Prize for Fiction. Although vastly different in context and form, both novels use female characters to question good and evil and morality through their portrayal of female villains. As Atwood noted about &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m not making a case for evil behavior, but unless you have some women characters portrayed as evil characters, you&#x27;re not playing with a full range.&quot; &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; takes place in contemporary Toronto, while &quot;Alias Grace&quot; is a work of historical fiction detailing the 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery. Atwood had previously written the 1974 CBC made-for-TV film &quot;The Servant Girl&quot;, about the life of Grace Marks, the young servant who, along with James McDermott, was convicted of the crime. Atwood continued her poetry contributions by publishing &quot;Snake Woman&quot; in 1999 for the Women&#x27;s Literature journal Kalliope.

=== 2000s ===
==== Novels ====
In 2000, Atwood published her tenth novel, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, to critical acclaim, winning both the Booker Prize and the Hammett Prize in 2000. &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; was also nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002. In 2001, Atwood was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Atwood followed this success with the publication of &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; in 2003, the first novel in a series that also includes &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot; (2009) and &quot;MaddAddam&quot; (2013), which would collectively come to be known as the MaddAddam Trilogy. The apocalyptic vision in the MaddAddam Trilogy engages themes of genetic modification, pharmaceutical and corporate control, and man-made disaster. As a work of speculative fiction, Atwood notes of the technology in &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, &quot;I think, for the first time in human history, we see where we might go. We can see far enough into the future to know that we can&#x27;t go on the way we&#x27;ve been going forever without inventing, possibly, a lot of new and different things.&quot; She later cautions in the acknowledgements to &quot;MaddAddam&quot;, &quot;Although &quot;MaddAddam&quot; is a work of fiction, it does not include any technologies or bio-beings that do not already exist, are not under construction or are not possible in theory.&quot;

In 2005, Atwood published the novella &quot;The Penelopiad&quot; as part of the Canongate Myth Series. The story is a retelling of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; from the perspective of Penelope and a chorus of the twelve maids murdered at the end of the original tale. &quot;The Penelopiad&quot; was given a theatrical production in 2007.

In 2016, Atwood published the novel &quot;Hag-Seed&quot;, a modern-day retelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, as part of Penguin Random House&#x27;s Hogarth Shakespeare Series.

On November 28, 2018, Atwood announced that she would publish &quot;The Testaments&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, in September 2019. The novel features three female narrators and takes place fifteen years after the character Offred&#x27;s final scene in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The book was the joint winner of the 2019 Booker Prize.

==== Nonfiction ====
In 2008, Atwood published &quot;&quot;, a collection of five lectures delivered as part of the Massey Lectures from October 12 to November 1, 2008. The book was released in anticipation of the lectures, which were also recorded and broadcast on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Ideas&quot;.

====Chamber opera====
In March 2008, Atwood accepted a chamber opera commission. Commissioned by City Opera of Vancouver, &quot;Pauline&quot; is set in Vancouver in March 1913 during the final days of the life of Canadian writer and performer Pauline Johnson. &quot;Pauline&quot;, composed by Tobin Stokes with libretto by Atwood, premiered on May 23, 2014, at Vancouver&#x27;s York Theatre.

==== Graphic fiction ====
In 2016, Atwood began writing the superhero comic book series &quot;Angel Catbird&quot;, with co-creator and illustrator Johnnie Christmas. The series protagonist, scientist Strig Feleedus, is victim of an accidental mutation that leaves him with the body parts and powers of both a cat and a bird. As with her other works, Atwood notes of the series, &quot;The kind of speculative fiction about the future that I write is always based on things that are in process right now. So it&#x27;s not that I imagine them, it&#x27;s that I notice that people are working on them and I take it a few steps further down the road. So it doesn&#x27;t come out of nowhere, it comes out of real life.&quot;

==== Future Library project ====
With her novel &quot;Scribbler Moon&quot;, Atwood is the first contributor to the Future Library project. The work, completed in 2015, was ceremonially handed over to the project on May 27 of the same year. The book will be held by the project until its eventual publishing in 2114. She thinks that readers will probably need a paleo-anthropologist to translate some parts of her story. In an interview with the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, Atwood said, &quot;There&#x27;s something magical about it. It&#x27;s like &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. The texts are going to slumber for 100 years and then they&#x27;ll wake up, come to life again. It&#x27;s a fairytale length of time. She slept for 100 years.&quot;

====Invention of the LongPen====
In early 2004, while on the paperback tour in Denver for her novel &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, Atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the LongPen, that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, the company shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies. In 2013, the company renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. In 2021, it is cloud-based and offers electronic signature technology. As of May 2021, Atwood is still a director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen and related technology.

==== Poetry ====
In November 2020 Atwood published &quot;Dearly,&quot; a collection of poems exploring absences and endings, ageing and retrospection, and gifts and renewals. The central poem, &quot;Dearly&quot;, was also published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper along with an essay exploring the passing of time, grief, and how a poem belongs to the reader; this is accompanied by an audio recording of Atwood reading the poem on the newspaper&#x27;s website.

== Recurring themes and cultural contexts ==

===Theory of Canadian identity===
Atwood&#x27;s contributions to the theorizing of Canadian identity have garnered attention both in Canada and internationally. Her principal work of literary criticism, &quot;&quot;, is considered somewhat outdated, but remains a standard introduction to Canadian literature in Canadian studies programs internationally. Writer and academic Joseph Pivato has criticised the continued reprinting of &quot;Survival&quot; by Anansi Press as a view-narrowing disservice to students of Canadian literature.

In &quot;Survival&quot;, Atwood postulates that Canadian literature, and by extension Canadian identity, is characterized by the symbol of survival. This symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of &quot;victim positions&quot; in Canadian literature. These positions represent a scale of self-consciousness and self-actualization for the victim in the &quot;victor/victim&quot; relationship. The &quot;victor&quot; in these scenarios may be other humans, nature, the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim. Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Survival&quot; bears the influence of Northrop Frye&#x27;s theory of garrison mentality; Atwood uses Frye&#x27;s concept of Canada&#x27;s desire to wall itself off from outside influence as a critical tool to analyze Canadian literature. According to her theories in works such as &quot;Survival&quot; and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction, Atwood considers Canadian literature as the expression of Canadian identity. According to this literature, Canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature, by settler history, and by unquestioned adherence to the community. In an interview with the Scottish critic Bill Findlay in 1979, Atwood discussed the relationship of Canadian writers and writing to the &#x27;Imperial Cultures&#x27; of America and Britain.

Atwood&#x27;s contribution to the theorizing of Canada is not limited to her non-fiction works. Several of her works, including &quot;The Journals of Susanna Moodie&quot;, &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; and &quot;Surfacing&quot;, are examples of what postmodern literary theorist Linda Hutcheon calls &quot;historiographic metafiction&quot;. In such works, Atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history.

Among her contributions to Canadian literature, Atwood is a founding trustee of the Griffin Poetry Prize, as well as a founder of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada&#x27;s writing community. She has called Mona Awad, a Canadian novelist and short-story writer, her &quot;literary heir apparent&quot;.

===Feminism===
Atwood&#x27;s work has been of interest to feminist literary critics, despite Atwood&#x27;s unwillingness at times to apply the label &#x27;feminist&#x27; to her works. Starting with the publication of her first novel, &quot;The Edible Woman&quot;, Atwood asserted, &quot;I don&#x27;t consider it feminism; I just consider it social realism.&quot;

Despite her rejection of the label at times, critics have analyzed the sexual politics, use of myth and fairytale, and gendered relationships in Atwood&#x27;s work through the lens of feminism. Before the 1985 publication of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Atwood gave an interview to feminist theorist Elizabeth Meese in which she defined feminism as a &quot;belief in the rights of women&quot; and averred that &quot;if practical, hardline, anti-male feminists took over and became the government, I would resist them.&quot; In 2017, she clarified her discomfort with the label &quot;feminism&quot; by stating, &quot;I always want to know what people mean by that word [feminism]. Some people mean it quite negatively, other people mean it very positively, some people mean it in a broad sense, other people mean it in a more specific sense. Therefore, in order to answer the question, you have to ask the person what they mean.&quot; Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she said &quot;For instance, some feminists have historically been against lipstick and letting transgender women into women&#x27;s washrooms. Those are not positions I have agreed with&quot;, a position she repeated to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. In an interview with Penguin Books, Atwood stated that the driving question throughout her writing of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; was &quot;If you were going to shove women back into the home and deprive them of all of these gains that they thought they had made, how would you do it?&quot;, but related this question to totalitarianism, not feminism.

In January 2018, Atwood penned the op-ed &quot;Am I a Bad Feminist?&quot; for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The piece was in response to social media backlash related to Atwood&#x27;s signature on a 2016 petition calling for an independent investigation into the firing of Steven Galloway, a former University of British Columbia professor accused of sexual harassment and assault by a student. While feminist critics denounced Atwood for her support of Galloway, Atwood asserted that her signature was in support of due process in the legal system. She has been criticized for her comments surrounding the #MeToo movement, particularly that it is a &quot;symptom of a broken legal system&quot;.

In 2018, following a partnership between Hulu&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and women&#x27;s rights organisation Equality Now, Atwood was honored at their 2018 Make Equality Reality Gala. In her acceptance speech she said:

I am, of course, not a real activist—I&#x27;m simply a writer without a job who is frequently asked to speak about subjects that would get people with jobs fired if they themselves spoke. You, however, at Equality Now are real activists. I hope people will give Equality Now lots and lots of money, today, so they can write equal laws, enact equal laws and see that equal laws are implemented. That way, in time, all girls may be able to grow up believing that there are no avenues that are closed to them simply because they are girls.

In 2019, Atwood partnered with Equality Now for the release of &quot;The Testaments&quot;.

=== Speculative and science fiction ===
Atwood has resisted the suggestion that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; are science fiction, suggesting to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003 that they are speculative fiction: &quot;Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.&quot; She told the Book of the Month Club: &quot;&quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no Martians.&quot; On &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, she explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she herself wrote, was &quot;talking squids in outer space.&quot; The latter phrase particularly rankled advocates of science fiction and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed.

In 2005, Atwood said that she did at times write social science fiction and that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; could be designated as such. She clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction, admitting that others used the terms interchangeably: &quot;For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can&#x27;t yet do ... Speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on Planet Earth.&quot; She said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot.

Atwood further clarified her definitions of terms in 2011, in a discussion with science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin: &quot;What Le Guin means by &#x27;science fiction&#x27; is what I mean by &#x27;speculative fiction&#x27;, and what she means by &#x27;fantasy&#x27; would include what I mean by &#x27;science fiction&#x27;.&quot; She added that genre borders were increasingly fluid, and that all forms of &quot;SF&quot; might be placed under a common umbrella.

===Reception===
In 2024 the Republican-dominated Utah Legislature passed a law mandating the removal of books deemed objectionable from all Utah public schools. On August 2, 2024, the Utah State School Board released its first list of objectionable books. One book on this list was penned by Atwood (&quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;).

=== Animal rights ===
Atwood repeatedly makes observations about the relationships of humans to animals in her works. A large portion of the dystopia Atwood creates in &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; concerns the genetic modification and alteration of animals and humans, resulting in hybrids such as pigoons, rakunks, wolvogs and Crakers, raising questions on the limits and ethics of science and technology, and on what it means to be human.

In &quot;Surfacing&quot;, one character remarks about eating animals: &quot;The animals die that we may live, they are substitute people ... And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life.&quot; Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In &quot;The Edible Woman&quot;, Atwood&#x27;s character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé&#x27;s experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.

In &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;, the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby. She looks at &quot;the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird.&quot; In Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Surfacing&quot;, a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.

Atwood is a pescetarian. In a 2009 interview she stated that &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t use the term vegetarian because I&#x27;m allowing myself gastropods, crustaceans and the occasional fish. Nothing with fur or feathers though&quot;.

=== Political involvement ===
Atwood has indicated in an interview that she considers herself a Red Tory in what she sees as the historical sense of the term, saying that &quot;The Tories were the ones who believed that those in power had a responsibility to the community, that money should not be the measure of all things.&quot; She has also stated on Twitter that she is a monarchist. In the 2008 federal election, she attended a rally for the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec pro-independence party, because of her support for their position on the arts; she said she would vote for the party if she lived in Quebec, and that the choice was between the Bloc and the Conservatives. In an editorial in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, she urged Canadians to vote for any party other than the Conservatives to prevent them gaining a majority.

Atwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and Graeme Gibson were the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within BirdLife International. Atwood celebrated her 70th birthday at a gala dinner at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. She stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of Canada&#x27;s most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: &quot;When people ask if there&#x27;s hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, so can you. Having been a symbol of desolation, it&#x27;s become a symbol of hope.&quot; Atwood has been chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada and helped to found the Canadian English-speaking chapter of PEN International, a group originally started to free politically imprisoned writers. She held the position of PEN Canada president in the mid 1980s and was the 2017 recipient of the PEN Center USA&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite calls for a boycott by Gazan students, Atwood visited Israel and accepted the $1,000,000 Dan David Prize along with Indian author Amitav Ghosh at Tel Aviv University in May 2010. Atwood commented that &quot;we don&#x27;t do cultural boycotts.&quot;

In her dystopian novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985), all the developments take place near Boston in the United States, now known as Gilead, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape. To some this reflects her status of being &quot;in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s&quot;. Critics have seen the mistreated Handmaid as Canada. During the debate in 1987 over a free-trade agreement between Canada and the United States, Atwood spoke out against the deal and wrote an essay opposing it. She said that the 2016 United States presidential election led to an increase in sales of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Amazon reported that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; was the most-read book of 2017. &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; sequel, &quot;The Testaments&quot;, also saw a rapid increase of sales immediately following the 2024 United States presidential election, with &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; reaching third in Amazon&#x27;s bestseller&#x27;s list. Following this election, Atwood wrote on X, &quot;Despair is not an option. It helps no one.&quot;

== TV cameos ==
In 2024, Atwood had a cameo in a season 17 episode of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; as Lorin Quinelle, an amateur ornithologist.

== Activism ==
In 2018, Atwood signed an appeal of the American PEN Center in defense of Ukrainian director Oleg Sentsov, a political prisoner in Russia.

In July 2020, Atwood was one of the 153 signers of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Letter&quot; (also known as &quot;A Letter on Justice and Open Debate&quot;) that expressed concern that &quot;the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.&quot;

On February 24, 2022, Atwood briefly covered the war in Ukraine at the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and published a link to the state aid fund on Twitter. She continues to publish information about the war in Ukraine on the social network.

== Adaptations ==
Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;Surfacing&quot; (1972) was adapted into a 1981 film of the same name written by Bernard Gordon and directed by Claude Jutra. It received poor reviews; one reviewer wrote that it made &quot;little attempt to find cinematic equivalents for the admittedly difficult subjective and poetic dimensions of the novel.&quot;

Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985) has been adapted several times. A 1990 film, directed by Volker Schlöndorff, with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, received mixed reviews. A musical adaptation resulted in the 2000 opera, written by Poul Ruders, with a libretto by Paul Bentley. It premiered at the Royal Danish Opera in 2000, and was staged in 2003 at London&#x27;s English National Opera and the Minnesota Opera. Boston Lyric Opera mounted a production in May 2019, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a triumph&quot;. A television series by Bruce Miller began airing on the streaming service Hulu in 2017. The first season of the show earned eight Emmys in 2017, including Outstanding Drama Series. Season two premiered on April 25, 2018, and it was announced on May 2, 2018, that Hulu had renewed the series for a third season. Atwood appears in a cameo in the first episode as one of the Aunts at the Red Center. In 2019, a graphic novel () based on the book and with the same title was published by Renée Nault.

In 2003, six of Atwood&#x27;s short stories were adapted by Shaftesbury Films for the anthology television series &quot;The Atwood Stories&quot;.

Atwood&#x27;s 2008 Massey Lectures were adapted into the documentary &quot;Payback&quot; (2012), by director Jennifer Baichwal. Commentary by Atwood and others such as economist Raj Patel, ecologist William Reese, and religious scholar Karen Armstrong, are woven into various stories that explore the concepts of debt and payback, including an Armenian blood feud, agricultural working conditions, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

The novel &quot;Alias Grace&quot; (1996) was adapted into a six-part 2017 miniseries directed by Mary Harron and adapted by Sarah Polley. It premiered on CBC on September 25, 2017, and the full series was released on Netflix on November 3, 2017. Atwood makes a cameo in the fourth episode of the series as a disapproving churchgoer.

&quot;In the Wake of the Flood&quot; (released in October 2010), a documentary film by the Canadian director Ron Mann, followed Atwood on the unusual book tour for her novel &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot; (2009). During this innovative book tour, Atwood created a theatrical version of her novel, with performers borrowed from the local areas she was visiting. The documentary is described as &quot;a fly-on-the-wall film vérité&quot;.

Atwood&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Wandering Wenda and Widow Wallop&#x27;s Wunderground Washery&quot; (2011) was adapted into the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Wide World of Wandering Wenda&quot;, broadcast on CBC beginning in the spring of 2017. Aimed at early readers, the animated series follows Wenda and her friends as they navigate different adventures using words, sounds, and language.

Director Darren Aronofsky had been slated to direct an adaptation of the &quot;MaddAddam&quot; trilogy for HBO, but it was revealed in October 2016 that HBO had dropped the plan from its schedule. In January 2018, it was announced that Paramount Television and Anonymous Content had bought the rights to the trilogy and would be producing it without Aronofsky.

== Awards and honours ==
Atwood holds numerous honorary degrees from various institutions, including The Sorbonne, NUI Galway as well as Oxford and Cambridge universities.

<text>A fountain pen is a writing instrument that uses a metal nib to apply water-based ink, or special pigment ink—suitable for fountain pens—to paper. It is distinguished from earlier dip pens by using an internal reservoir to hold ink, eliminating the need to repeatedly dip the pen in an inkwell during use. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits the ink on paper via a combination of gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via the use of an eyedropper or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism that creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) or a vacuum to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.

==History==

===Early prototypes of reservoir pens===
According to Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man al-Tamimi () in his &quot;Kitab al-Majalis wa &#x27;l-musayarat&quot;, the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah in Arab Egypt demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking.

There is compelling evidence that a working fountain pen was constructed and used during the Renaissance by artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo&#x27;s journals contain drawings with cross-sections of what appears to be a reservoir pen that works by both gravity and capillary action. Historians also took note of the fact that the handwriting in the inventor&#x27;s surviving journals is of a consistent contrast throughout, rather than exhibiting the characteristic fading pattern typical of a quill pen caused by expending and re-dipping. While no physical item survives, several working models were reconstructed in 2011 by artist Amerigo Bombara that have since been put on display in museums dedicated to Leonardo.

===European reservoir models===

The fountain pen was available in Europe in the 17th century and is shown by contemporary references. In &quot;Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae&quot; (a 1636 magazine), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1663 Samuel Pepys referred to a metal pen &quot;to carry ink&quot;. Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862–1933) documented a reference to &quot;three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings&quot; in England during the reign of Charles II, c. 1649–1685. By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as &quot;fountain pens&quot;. Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of Robert Morris the younger, who was at the time in Philadelphia, for &quot;one fountain pen&quot;. Perhaps the best-known reference, however, is that of Nicholas Bion (1652–1733), whose illustrated description of a &quot;plume sans fin&quot; was published in 1709 in his treatise published in English in 1723 as &quot;The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments&quot;. The earliest datable pen of the form described by Bion is inscribed 1702, while other examples bear French hallmarks as late as the early 19th century.

===First patents===
Progress in developing a reliable pen was slow until the mid-19th century because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens. Furthermore, most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The first English patent for a fountain pen was issued in May 1809 to Frederick Fölsch, with a patent covering (among other things) an improved fountain pen feed issued to Joseph Bramah in September 1809. John Scheffer&#x27;s patent of 1819 was the first design to see commercial success, with a number of surviving examples of his &quot;Penographic&quot; known. Another noteworthy pioneer design was John Jacob Parker&#x27;s, patented in 1832 – a self-filler with a screw-operated piston. The Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru received a French patent on May 25, 1827, for the invention of a fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill.

===Mass-manufactured nibs===
In 1828, Josiah Mason improved a cheap and efficient slip-in nib in Birmingham, England, which could be added to a fountain pen and in 1830, with the invention of a new machine, William Joseph Gillott, William Mitchell, and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel pen nibs (Perry &amp; Co.). This boosted the Birmingham pen trade and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city&#x27;s factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.

===New patents and inventions===
In 1848, American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with &quot;a combined holder and nib&quot;. In 1849 Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson invented the refillable fountain pen. From the 1850s, there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were in place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the iridium-tipped gold nib, hard rubber, and free-flowing ink.


The first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. In the 1870s Duncan MacKinnon, a Canadian living in New York City, and Alonzo T. Cross of Providence, Rhode Island, created stylographic pens with a hollow, tubular nib and a wire acting as a valve. Stylographic pens are now used mostly for drafting and technical drawing but were very popular in the decade beginning in 1875. In the 1880s the era of the mass-produced fountain pen finally began. The dominant American producers in this pioneer era were Waterman, of New York City, and Wirt, based in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Waterman soon outstripped Wirt, along with many companies that sprang up to fill the new and growing fountain pen market. Waterman remained the market leader until the early 1920s.

At this time, fountain pens were almost all filled by unscrewing a portion of the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of a dropper – a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling. Now that the materials&#x27; problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. Self-fillers began to gain in popularity around the turn of the century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman&#x27;s twist-filler. The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer&#x27;s lever-filler, introduced in 1912, paralleled by Parker&#x27;s roughly contemporary button-filler.

===Pen leakage===
Meanwhile, many inventors turned their attention to the problem of leakage. Some of the earliest solutions to this problem came in the form of a &quot;safety&quot; pen with a retractable point that allowed the ink reservoir to be corked like a bottle. Horton, Moore, and Caw&#x27;s were the earliest makers of such pens, all starting in the 1890s.

In 1898, George Safford Parker released the Parker Jointless, so named because its barrel was single-piece with no section joint to leak and stain the writer&#x27;s fingers. The nib and feed assembly fit into the barrel&#x27;s end like a cork stopper.

In 1908, Waterman began marketing a popular safety pen of its own. For pens with non-retractable nibs, the adoption of screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against the front of the section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as &quot;safety pens&quot;, as with the Parker Jack-Knife Safety and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).

===Further innovation===
In Europe, the German office supplies company Gunther Wagner, founded in 1838, introduced their Pelikan in 1929, the first modern screw piston-filling fountain pen. This was based upon the acquisition of patents for solid-ink fountain pens from the factory of Slavoljub Penkala from Croatia (patented 1907, in mass production since 1911), and the patent of the Hungarian Theodor Kovacs for the modern piston filler by 1925.

The decades that followed saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of fountain pens. Celluloid gradually replaced hard rubber, which enabled production in a much wider range of colors and designs. At the same time, manufacturers experimented with new filling systems. The inter-war period saw the introduction of some of the most notable models, such as the Parker Duofold and Vacumatic, Sheaffer&#x27;s Lifetime Balance series, and the Pelikan 100.

During the 1940s and 1950s, fountain pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued to benefit from the combination of mass production and craftsmanship. (Bíró&#x27;s patent, and other early patents on ball-point pens often used the term &quot;ball-point fountain pen,&quot; because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)
This period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.

===Popular usage===
By the 1960s, refinements in ballpoint pen production gradually ensured its dominance over the fountain pen for casual use. Although cartridge-filler fountain pens are still in common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England, at least one private school in Scotland, and public elementary schools in Germany, a few modern manufacturers (especially Conway Stewart, Montblanc, Graf von Faber-Castell, and Visconti) now depict the fountain pen as a collectible item or a status symbol, rather than an everyday writing tool. However, fountain pens continue to have a growing following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell fountain pens and inks for casual and calligraphic use. During the 2010s, fountain pens have made a resurgence, with some retailers, such as Goulet Pens, saying it is because of renewed consumer interest in analog products. This has led to a new wave of casual use fountain pens and custom ink manufacturers, who utilize online stores to easily sell fountain pens to a wider audience.

==Feed==
The feed of a fountain pen is the component that connects the nib of the pen with its ink reservoir. It not only allows the ink to flow to the nib (in what is often described as a &quot;controlled leak&quot;) but also regulates the amount of air flowing backwards up to the reservoir to replace this lost ink.

The feed uses a series of narrow channels or &quot;fissures&quot; that run down its lower edge. As ink flows down these fissures, air is simultaneously allowed to flow upwards into the reservoir in an even exchange of volumes. The feed allows ink to flow when the pen is being put to paper but ensures ink does not flow when the pen is not in use. The feed makes use of capillary action; this is noticeable when a pen is refilled with a brightly coloured ink. The ink is taken up and into the feed by way of capillary action (and is often visible in clear demonstrator pens), but is not dispensed onto the paper until the nib makes contact.

How the feed is shaped may determine the wetness and flow of a particular pen. For this reason, feed material alone and its surface roughness may have a significant effect on the way two pens of the same nib size write.

Pen feeds are crucial to preventing ink from dripping or leaking. Feeds often feature finned structures intended for buffering fountain pen ink. Buffering is the capacity to catch and temporarily hold an overflow of ink, caused by conditions other than writing. When a fountain pen nib receives such an overflow it will result in ink blobbing or dripping also known as burping. A pen with a misconfigured feed might fail to deposit any ink whatsoever.

=== Fiber feeds ===
Some fountain pens use a fiber wick underneath the nib. They often have a plastic part that looks like a feed that is only used to hold the fiber wick in place and does not assist with ink flow. The mechanism of action is like a felt pen, just with a fountain pen nib on top of it. The fiber feeds offer plenty of ink flow and can stay wet for extended periods. Cleaning fiber feed pens can require longer soaking in water.

==Nibs==

The modern fountain pen nib is a direct descendant of the iridium-tipped gold dip pen nibs of the 19th century. The earliest attempts at adding a hard and long-wearing tipping material to a gold nib utilized materials such as ruby. A more successful approach exploited the discovery of the platinum group of metals, including ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. From the mid-1830s gold dip pen nibs tipped with iridium were produced in rapidly increasing quantities, first in England and soon thereafter in the United States. The first mass-produced fountain pens used gold nibs sourced from established makers of gold dip pen nibs, some of the most prominent being Mabie Todd, Fairchild, and Aikin Lambert. 
Today, nibs are usually made of stainless steel or gold, with the most popular gold alloys being 14 carat (58⅓%) and 18 carat (75%). Titanium is a less common metal used for making nibs. Gold is considered the optimum metal for its flexibility and its resistance to corrosion, although gold&#x27;s corrosion resistance is less of an issue than in the past because of better stainless steel alloys and less corrosive inks.
Palladium alloys have been used occasionally in the past, usually as a money-saving alternative to white gold. As long as palladium remains more valuable than gold, however, it is unlikely to see much use for nib manufacture.

===Nib plating===
Further gold plating provides favorable wettability, which is the ability of a solid surface to reduce the surface tension of a liquid in contact with it such that it spreads over the surface.

===Nib tipping===
Gold and most steel and titanium nibs are tipped with a hard, wear-resistant alloy that typically includes metals from the platinum group. These metals share qualities of extreme hardness and corrosion resistance. The tipping material is often called &quot;iridium&quot;, but few if any nib manufacturers have used tipping alloys containing iridium since the mid-1950s. The metals osmium, rhenium, ruthenium, and tungsten are used instead, generally as an alloy, produced as tiny pellets which are welded onto the nib&#x27;s tip prior to cutting the nib slit and grinding the tip into its final shape. Untipped steel and titanium points will wear more rapidly due to abrasion by the paper.

===Capillary action===
The nib usually has a tapering or parallel slit cut down its centre, to convey the ink down the nib by capillary action, as well as a &quot;breather hole&quot; of varying shape. The breather hole&#x27;s intended function is to allow air exchange with the ink reservoir through the channels of the feed, though some modern authorities believe this is a misconception and such venting is unnecessary. Some fountain pens come without a breather hole such as the Camlin Trinity, Monami Olika, Pelikan Pelikano, and Platinum Preppy. The breather hole&#x27;s other main function is to provide an endpoint to the nib slit and an indexing point for slit cutting. The breather hole also acts as a stress relieving point, preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally from the end of the slit as a result of repeated flexing during use.

The nib narrows to a point where the ink is transferred to the paper. Extremely broad calligraphy pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the point, but such designs are more commonly found on dip pens. Nibs divided into three &#x27;tines&#x27; are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores.

===Types of nibs===
Although the most common nibs end in a round point of various sizes (extra fine, fine, medium, broad), various other nib shapes are available. Examples of this are double broad, music, oblique, reverse oblique, stub, italic, and 360-degree nibs.

Broader nibs are used for less precise emphasis, with the benefit of a greater level of ink shading, a property wherein ink pools in parts of a stroke to cause variations in color or sheen – where dyes in ink crystallize on a page instead of absorbing into the paper, which leads to a different color being seen on less absorbent paper due to thin film interference. Finer nibs (e.g. extra fine and fine) may be used for intricate corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub, and italic nibs may be used for calligraphic purposes or for general handwritten compositions. The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general.

===Nib flexibility===
Flexibility is a function of several factors. One is the nib material&#x27;s resilience; another is its thickness. Finally there is the nib&#x27;s shape, with longer tines offering more flexibility than short tines, while greater curvature increases stiffness. Contrary to common belief, material alone does not determine a nib&#x27;s flexibility. Gold alloys of greater purity (18K, or 750/1000 gold) will on average be softer and less springy than alloys of lower purity (14K, or 585/1000 gold), but whatever the alloy its resilience can be altered considerably in manufacture by means of controlled work-hardening.

Fountain pens dating from the first half of the 20th century are more likely to have flexible nibs, suited to the favored handwriting styles of the period (e.g. Copperplate script and Spencerian script). By the 1940s, writing preferences had shifted towards stiffer nibs that could withstand the greater pressure required for writing through carbon paper to create duplicate documents.

Furthermore, competition between the major pen brands such as Parker and Waterman, and the introduction of lifetime guarantees, meant that flexible nibs could no longer be supported profitably. In countries where this rivalry was not present to the same degree, such as the UK and Germany, flexible nibs are more common.

Nowadays, stiff nibs are the norm as people exchange between fountain pens and other writing modes. These more closely emulate the ballpoint pens most modern writers are experienced with. Despite being rigid and firm, the idea that steel nibs write &quot;horribly&quot; is a misconception. More flexible nibs can be easily damaged if excessive pressure is applied to them. Ideally, a fountain pen&#x27;s nib glides across the paper using the ink as a lubricant, and writing requires no pressure.

Good quality nibs that have been used appropriately are long lasting, often lasting longer than the lifetime of the original owner. Many vintage pens with decades-old nibs can still be used today.


===Different nib styles===
Other styles of fountain pen nibs include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100, Lamy 2000, and Hero 329), inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1, Falcon, and Pilot Myu 701), .

Users are often cautioned not to lend or borrow fountain pens as the nib &quot;wears in&quot; at an angle unique to each individual person. A different user is likely to find that a worn-in nib does not write satisfactorily in their hand and, furthermore, creates a second wear surface, ruining the nib for the original user. This, however, is not a point of concern in pens with modern, durable tipping material, as these pens take many years to develop any significant wear.

==Filling mechanisms==

===Eyedropper filler===
The reservoirs of the earliest fountain pens were mostly filled by eyedropper (&quot;dropper&quot; was the term used at the time). This could be messy, spurring development of so-called &quot;self-filling&quot; pens equipped with internal filling mechanisms. Though self-fillers had largely displaced dropper-fillers by the 1920s, they never went out of production, and there has been a revival of interest in recent years. For some, the simplicity, reliability, and large ink capacity of the dropper-filler provide ample compensation for its inconveniences.

After the eyedropper-filler era came the first generation of mass-produced self-fillers, almost all using a rubber sac to hold the ink. The sac was compressed and then released by various mechanisms to fill the pen.

===Self-filling designs===
The Conklin crescent filler, introduced c. 1901, was one of the first mass-produced self-filling pen designs. The crescent-filling system employs an arch-shaped crescent attached to a rigid metal pressure bar, with the crescent portion protruding from the pen through a slot and the pressure bar inside the barrel. A second component, a C-shaped hard rubber lock ring, is located between the crescent and the barrel. In normal use the ring blocks the crescent from being depressed. To fill the pen, the ring is turned until the gap in the ring is aligned with the crescent, allowing the crescent to be depressed, thus compressing the sac.

Many other variations on the basic sac and pressure bar mechanism were introduced in the first decades of the 20th century, such as the coin-filler (with a slot on the barrel, allowing the pressure bar to be depressed by use of a coin), the matchstick-filler (with a round hole, for a matchstick) and the blow-filler (with a hole at the end of the barrel, through which one blew to compress the sac).

===Piston filling innovation===
In 1908 Walter A. Sheaffer received a patent for an improved lever-filling pen. Introduced in 1912, Sheaffer&#x27;s pens sold in rapidly increasing numbers and by 1920 Sheaffer had become one of the largest fountain pen makers in the United States.

Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.

One of the most complex filling mechanisms was introduced in 1952 with the Sheaffer Snorkel. The Snorkel had an axial tube below the nib that could be extended, allowing the pen to be filled from a bottle without needing to immerse the nib or to wipe it off after filling. With the advent of the modern plastic ink cartridge in the early 1950s most of these filling systems were phased out.

Screw-mechanism piston-fillers were made as early as the 1820s, but the mechanism&#x27;s modern popularity begins with the original Pelikan of 1929, based upon a patent that was initially licensed to a Croatian company Moster-Penkala by inventor Theodore Kovacs. The basic idea is simple and intuitive: turn a knob at the end of the pen and a screw mechanism draws a piston up the barrel, sucking in ink. Pens with this mechanism remain very popular today. Some of the earlier models had to dedicate as much as half of the pen length to the mechanism.
The advent of telescoping pistons has improved this; the Touchdown Filler was introduced by Sheaffer in 1949. It was advertised as an &quot;Exclusive Pneumatic Down-stroke Filler.&quot;

To fill it, a knob at the end of the barrel is unscrewed and the attached plunger is drawn out to its full length. The nib is immersed in ink, the plunger is pushed in, compressing and then releasing the ink sac by means of air pressure. The nib is kept in the ink for approximately 10 seconds to allow the reservoir to fill. This mechanism is very closely modeled after a similar pneumatic filler introduced by Chilton over a decade earlier.

===Modern filling mechanisms===
A capillary filling system was introduced by Parker in the Parker 61 in 1956. There were no moving parts: the ink reservoir within the barrel was open at the upper end, but contained a tightly rolled length of slotted, flexible plastic. To fill, the barrel was unscrewed, the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated capillary action, drawing up and retaining the ink. The outside of the reservoir was coated with Teflon, a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn. Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib. No method of flushing the device was offered, and because of problems from clogging with dried and hardened ink, production was eventually stopped.

Around the year 2000, Pelikan introduced a filling system involving a valve in the blind end of the pen, which mates with a specially designed ink bottle. Thus docked, ink is then squeezed into the pen barrel (which, lacking any mechanism other than the valve itself, has nearly the capacity of an eyedropper-fill pen of the same size). This system had been implemented only in their &quot;Level&quot; line, which was discontinued in 2006.

Most pens today use either a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge. Many pens are also compatible with a &quot;converter&quot;, which has the same fitting as the pen&#x27;s cartridge and has a filling mechanism and a reservoir attached to it. This enables a pen to fill either from cartridges or from a bottle of ink. The most common type of converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today. Piston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing surface tensions that can cause an ink to adhere or &quot;stick&quot; against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a 316L or 904L stainless steel or zirconium dioxide bearing ball, spring or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of surfactant such as Triton X-100 used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However, ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.

Vacuum fillers, such as those used by Pilot in the Custom 823, utilize air pressure to fill the ink chamber. In this case, while the nib is submerged in ink, a plunger is pushed down the empty chamber to create a vacuum in the space behind it. The end of the chamber has a section wider than the rest, and when the plunger passes this point, the difference in air pressure in the area behind the plunger and the area ahead of it is suddenly evened out and ink rushes in behind the plunger to fill the chamber.

Converters are also available in several different types such as piston, plunger, squeeze and push button in rare cases.

==Cartridges==
The first commercially successful ink cartridge system for fountain pens was patented in 1890 by the Eagle Pencil Company, using glass cartridges. In the 1920s the John Hancock pen featured cartridges made from thin copper tubing. From the 1930s on, Waterman sold pens in France that used glass cartridges. Cartridge-filling pens only became truly popular in the 1950s, however, with the advent of plastic cartridges. The first was the Italian LUS Atomica in 1952, but it was the Waterman C/F in 1953 that brought cartridge filling to the attention of the international market. 
Modern plastic cartridges can contain small ridges on the inside to promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Often cartridges are closed with a small ball that gets pressed into the cartridge during insertion into the pen. This ball also aids free movement of the contained ink.

===Standard international===

Most European fountain pen brands (for example Conway Stewart, Caran d&#x27;Ache, Faber-Castell, Michel Perchin, S.T. Dupont, Montegrappa, Stipula, Pelikan, Montblanc, Europen, Sigma, Delta, Italix, and Rotring) and some pen brands of other continents (for example Acura, Bexley, Esterbrook, Retro51, Tombow, and Platinum (with adaptor)) use so called &quot;international cartridges&quot; (AKA &quot;European cartridges&quot; or &quot;standard cartridges&quot; or &quot;universal cartridges&quot;), in short (38 mm in length, about 0.75 ml of capacity) or long (72 mm, 1.50 ml) sizes, or both. It is to some extent a standard, so the international cartridges of any manufacturer can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges.

Also, converters that are meant to replace international cartridges can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges. Some very compact fountain pens (for example Waterman Ici et La and Monteverde Diva) accept only short international cartridges. Converters can not be used in them (except for so-called mini-converters by Monteverde). Some pens (such as the modern Waterman models) have intentional fittings which prevent the usage of short cartridges. Such pens can only take a proprietary cartridge from the same manufacturer, in this case the long Waterman cartridges.

===Proprietary offerings===

Many fountain pen manufacturers have developed their own proprietary cartridges, for example Parker, Lamy, Sheaffer, Cross, Sailor, Platinum, Platignum, Waterman, and Namiki. Fountain pens from Aurora, Hero, Duke, and Uranus accept the same cartridges and converters that Parker uses and vice versa (Lamy cartridges, though not officially, are known to interchange with Parker cartridges also). Cartridges of Aurora are slightly different from cartridges by Parker.

Corresponding converters to be used instead of such proprietary cartridges are usually made by the same company that made the fountain pen itself. Some very compact fountain pens accept only proprietary cartridges made by the same company that made that pen, such as Sheaffer Agio Compact and Sheaffer Prelude Compact. It is not possible to use a converter in them at all. In such pens the only practical way to use another brand of ink is to fill empty cartridges with bottled ink using a syringe.

Standard international cartridges are closed by a small ball, held inside the ink exit hole by glue or by a very thin layer of plastic. When the cartridge is pressed into the pen, a small pin pushes in the ball, which falls inside the cartridge. The Parker and Lamy cartridges do not have such a ball. They are closed by a piece of plastic, which is broken by a sharp pin when inserted in the pen.

===Concerns and alternatives===
Pen manufacturers that produce proprietary cartridges (which in almost all cases are the more expensive ones like the ones mentioned above) tend to discourage the use of cheaper internationally standardised short/long cartridges or adaptations thereof due to their variance in ink quality in the cartridges which may not offer as much performance, or be of lesser quality than the pen&#x27;s ink cartridge that has been designed specifically for the pen itself. Due to potential additive deficits such as glycerides or uneven pigmentation, cheaper ink may also skip or produce uneven colour on the page and &quot;feather&quot; (spread out of the originally written line) more on thinner grades of paper (e.g. 75 gsm).

While cartridges are more convenient to refill than bottle filling, converter and bottle filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems tend to be slightly more economical in the long run since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and refill inks at any time.

==Inks==

Inks intended for use with fountain pens are water-based. These inks are commonly available in bottles. Plastic cartridges came into use in the 1950s, but bottled inks are still the mainstay for many fountain pen enthusiasts. Bottled inks usually cost less than an equivalent amount in cartridges and afford a wider variety of colours and properties.

Fountain pens are not as tightly coupled with their inks as ballpoints or gel pens are, yet some care must be taken when selecting their inks. Contemporary fountain pen inks are almost exclusively dye-based because pigment particles usually clog the narrow passages.

Traditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for fountain pens as they will corrode the pen (a phenomenon known as flash corrosion) and destroy the functionality of the fountain pen. Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens. These modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro gallic compounds that are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still be corrosive if left in the pen for a long period. To avoid corrosion on delicate metal parts and ink clogging, a more thorough than usual cleaning regime – which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water – is sometimes advised by manufacturers or resellers.

Some pigmented inks do exist for fountain pens, such as &quot;Carbon Black&quot; and &quot;Chou Kuro&quot; made by the brand Platinum as well as Rohrer &amp; Klingner and De Atramentis inks from Germany, but these are uncommon. Normal India ink cannot be used in fountain pens because it contains shellac as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.

Inks ideally should be fairly free-flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive, though this generally excludes permanence and prevents large-scale commercial use of some colored dyes. Proper care and selection of ink will prevent most problems.

==Today==


While no longer the primary writing instrument in modern times, fountain pens are used for important official works such as signing valuable documents. Today, fountain pens are often treated as luxury goods and sometimes as status symbols. Fountain pens may serve as an everyday writing instrument, much like the common ballpoint pen. Good quality steel and gold pens are available inexpensively today, particularly in Europe and China, and there are &quot;disposable&quot; fountain pens such as the Pilot Varsity. In France and Germany, in particular, the use of fountain pens is widespread, since in many European countries children still begin to learn writing with this kind of writing device. To avoid mistakes, special ink can be used that can be made invisible by applying an ink eraser.

Fountain pens can serve various artistic purposes such as expressive penmanship and calligraphy, pen and ink artwork, and professional art and design. Many users also favor the perceived elegance, personalization, and sentimentality associated with fountain pens, which computers and ballpoint pens seem to lack, and often state that once they start using fountain pens, ballpoints become awkward to use due to the extra motor effort needed and lack of expressiveness. For ergonomics, fountain pens may relieve physiological stress from writing; alternatives such as the ballpoint pen can induce more pain and damage to those with arthritis. Some also believe they could improve academic performance.

In some countries, fountain pens are usual in lower school grades, believed to teach children better control over writing as many common mistakes of people not used to handwriting (like too much pressure or incorrect hold) feel unnatural or are almost impossible when using traditional pen tips.

Fountain pens are a popular collectable. Fancier pens have been made of precious metals and sometimes even inlaid with jewels. Some are decorated with lacquer, including Japanese maki-e. Avid communities of pen enthusiasts collect and use antique and modern pens and also collect and exchange information about old and modern inks, ink bottles, and inkwells. Collectors may decide to use the antiques in addition to showcasing them in closed spaces such as glass displays.

News outlets report that rather than declining, fountain pen sales have been steadily rising over the last decade. There is a clear resurgence in the appeal and culture of the fountain pen, whether for purposes of collection, enjoyment or as a &quot;lifestyle item&quot;. Many agree that the &quot;personal touch&quot; of a fountain pen has led to such a resurgence with modern consumers looking for an alternative in a world of digital products and services.

Amazon reported &quot;sales so far this year [2012] have doubled compared with the same period in 2011. They are four times higher than 2010.&quot; The popularity of fountain pens continues to show growth. The market-research firm Euromonitor reported that fountain pen retail sales were up 2.1% in 2016 from a year earlier, reaching $1.046 billion.

<text>An inkwell is a small jar or container, often made of glass, porcelain, silver, brass, or pewter, used for holding ink in a place convenient for the person who is writing. The artist or writer dips the brush, quill, or dip pen into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a fountain pen. An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air. A type known as the travelling inkwell was fitted with a secure screw lid so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage.

==Origins==
The inkwell&#x27;s origins may be traced back to Ancient Egypt where scribes would write on papyrus. Knowledge of hieroglyphs was at the time highly restricted. Only scribes knew the full array of hieroglyphs and would write on the behalf of their employers, usually the pharaoh. After Rome invaded Egypt, inkwells became more popular in Italy as a larger percentage of the population were capable of writing.

Inkwells gradually fell out of use in the early part of 20th century as the reservoir fountain pen (which needs to be filled only occasionally) replaced the dip pen, which needed to be dipped in ink after writing a few lines. Old school desks had round holes for inkwells.

<text>Pewter () is a malleable metal alloy consisting of tin (85–99%), antimony (approximately 5–10%), copper (2%), bismuth, and sometimes silver. In the past, it was an alloy of tin and lead, but most modern pewter, in order to prevent lead poisoning, is not made with lead. Pewter has a low melting point, around , depending on the exact mixture of metals. The word &quot;pewter&quot; is possibly a variation of &quot;spelter&quot;, a term for zinc alloys (originally a colloquial name for zinc).

== History ==
Pewter was first used around the beginning of the Bronze Age in the Near East. The earliest known piece of pewter was found in an Egyptian tomb, , but it is unlikely that this was the first use of the material. Pewter was used for decorative metal items and tableware in ancient times by the Egyptians and later the Romans, and came into extensive use in Europe from the Middle Ages until the various developments in pottery and glass-making during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pewter was a leading material for producing plates, cups, and bowls before the wide adoption of porcelain. Mass production of pottery, porcelain and glass products have almost universally replaced pewter in daily life, although pewter artifacts continue to be produced, mainly as decorative or specialty items. Pewter was also used around East Asia. Although some items still exist, ancient Roman pewter is rare.

Lidless mugs and lidded tankards may be the most familiar pewter artifacts from the late 17th and 18th centuries, although the metal was also used for many other items including porringers (shallow bowls), plates, dishes, basins, spoons, measures, flagons, communion cups, teapots, sugar bowls, beer steins (tankards), and cream jugs. In the early 19th century, changes in fashion caused a decline in the use of pewter flatware. At the same time, production increased of both cast and spun pewter tea sets, whale-oil lamps, candlesticks, and so on. Later in the century, pewter alloys were often used as a base metal for silver-plated objects.

In the late 19th century, pewter came back into fashion with the revival of medieval objects for decoration. New replicas of medieval pewter objects were created, and collected for decoration. Today, pewter is used in decorative objects, mainly collectible statuettes and figurines, game figures, aircraft and other models, (replica) coins, pendants, plated jewellery and so on. Certain athletic contests, such as the United States Figure Skating Championships, award pewter medals to fourth-place finishers.

== Types ==
In antiquity, pewter was tin alloyed with lead and sometimes also copper. Older pewters with higher lead content are heavier, tarnish faster, and their oxidation has a darker, silver-gray color. Pewters containing lead are no longer used in items that will come in contact with the human body (such as cups, plates, or jewelry), due to the toxicity of lead. Modern pewters are available that are completely free of lead, although many pewters containing lead are still being produced for other purposes.

A typical European casting alloy contains 94% tin, 1% copper and 5% antimony. A European pewter sheet would contain 92% tin, 2% copper, and 6% antimony. Asian pewter, produced mostly in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, contains a higher percentage of tin, usually 97.5% tin, 1% copper, and 1.5% antimony. This makes the alloy slightly softer.

The term &quot;Mexican pewter&quot; is used for any of various alloys of aluminium that are used for decorative items.

Pewter is also used to imitate platinum in costume jewelry.

== Properties ==
Pewter, being a softer material, can be manipulated in various ways such as being cast, hammered, turned, spun and engraved.

Given that pewter is soft at room temperature, a pewter bell does not ring clearly. Cooling it in liquid nitrogen hardens it and enables it to ring, but also makes it more brittle.

<doc id="60289" wikidata="Q898769" url="?curid=60289" title="Homeobox">
<text>A homeobox is a DNA sequence, around 180 base pairs long, that regulates large-scale anatomical features in the early stages of embryonic development. Mutations in a homeobox may change large-scale anatomical features of the full-grown organism.

Homeoboxes are found within genes that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development (morphogenesis) in animals, fungi, plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes. Homeobox genes encode homeodomain protein products that are transcription factors sharing a characteristic protein fold structure that binds DNA to regulate expression of target genes. Homeodomain proteins regulate gene expression and cell differentiation during early embryonic development, thus mutations in homeobox genes can cause developmental disorders. 

Homeosis is a term coined by William Bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part, e.g. antennapedia—replacement of the antenna on the head of a fruit fly with legs. The &quot;homeo-&quot; prefix in the words &quot;homeobox&quot; and &quot;homeodomain&quot; stems from this mutational phenotype, which is observed when some of these genes are mutated in animals. The homeobox domain was first identified in a number of &quot;Drosophila&quot; homeotic and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including vertebrates.

== Discovery ==

The existence of homeobox genes was first discovered in &quot;Drosophila&quot; by isolating the gene responsible for a homeotic transformation where legs grow from the head instead of the expected antennae. Walter Gehring identified a gene called &quot;antennapedia&quot; that caused this homeotic phenotype. Analysis of &quot;antennapedia&quot; revealed that this gene contained a 180 base pair sequence that encoded a DNA binding domain, which William McGinnis termed the &quot;homeobox&quot;. The existence of additional &quot;Drosophila&quot; genes containing the &quot;antennapedia&quot; homeobox sequence was independently reported by Ernst Hafen, Michael Levine, William McGinnis, and Walter Jakob Gehring of the University of Basel in Switzerland and Matthew P. Scott and Amy Weiner of Indiana University in Bloomington in 1984. Isolation of homologous genes by Edward de Robertis and William McGinnis revealed that numerous genes from a variety of species contained the homeobox. Subsequent phylogenetic studies detailing the evolutionary relationship between homeobox-containing genes showed that these genes are present in all bilaterian animals.

== Homeodomain structure ==
The characteristic homeodomain protein fold consists of a 60-amino acid long domain composed of three alpha helices. The following shows the consensus homeodomain (~60 amino acid chain):

Helix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, where the two alpha helices are connected by a short loop region. The N-terminal two helices of the homeodomain are antiparallel and the longer C-terminal helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes of the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases within the major groove of the DNA.

Homeodomain proteins are found in eukaryotes. Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to prokaryotic transcription factors, such as lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of genes in prokaryotes. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., cro and repressor proteins, homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereochemical requirement for glycine in the turn which is needed to avoid steric interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.

===Sequence specificity===

Homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to B-DNA with the C-terminal recognition helix aligning in the DNA&#x27;s major groove and the unstructured peptide &quot;tail&quot; at the N-terminus aligning in the minor groove. The recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in arginine and lysine residues, which form hydrogen bonds to the DNA backbone. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. Homeodomain proteins show a preference for the DNA sequence 5&#x27;-TAAT-3&#x27;; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity. The specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize specific target gene promoters, making cofactor binding an important mechanism for controlling binding sequence specificity and target gene expression. To achieve higher target specificity, homeodomain proteins form complexes with other transcription factors to recognize the promoter region of a specific target gene.

==Biological function==

Homeodomain proteins function as transcription factors due to the DNA binding properties of the conserved HTH motif. Homeodomain proteins are considered to be master control genes, meaning that a single protein can regulate expression of many target genes. Homeodomain proteins direct the formation of the body axes and body structures during early embryonic development. Many homeodomain proteins induce cellular differentiation by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual tissues and organs. Other proteins in the family, such as NANOG are involved in maintaining pluripotency and preventing cell differentiation. 

== Regulation ==
Hox genes and their associated microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation. The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. Drosophila is known to use the polycomb and trithorax complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. Polycomb-group proteins can silence the Hox genes by modulation of chromatin structure.

== Mutations ==
Mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible phenotypic changes in body segment identity, such as the Antennapedia and Bithorax mutant phenotypes in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the evolution of segmented animals. 

== Evolution ==

Phylogenetic analysis of homeobox gene sequences and homeodomain protein structures suggests that the last common ancestor of plants, fungi, and animals had at least two homeobox genes. Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the Cnidaria since before the earliest true Bilatera, making these genes pre-Paleozoic. It is accepted that the three major animal ANTP-class clusters, Hox, ParaHox, and NK (MetaHox), are the result of segmental duplications. A first duplication created MetaHox and ProtoHox, the latter of which later duplicated into Hox and ParaHox. The clusters themselves were created by tandem duplications of a single ANTP-class homeobox gene. Gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization is responsible for the many homeobox genes found in eukaryotes. Comparison of homeobox genes and gene clusters has been used to understand the evolution of genome structure and body morphology throughout metazoans.

== Types of homeobox genes ==

===Hox genes===

Hox genes are the most commonly known subset of homeobox genes. They are essential metazoan genes that determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterior-posterior axis. The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in &quot;Xenopus&quot; by Edward De Robertis and colleagues in 1984. The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behavior and arrangement in the genome. Hox genes are typically found in an organized cluster. The linear order of Hox genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order in which they are expressed in both time and space during development. This phenomenon is called colinearity. 

Mutations in these homeotic genes cause displacement of body segments during embryonic development. This is called ectopia. For example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. Famous examples are &quot;Antennapedia&quot; and bithorax in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.

In vertebrates, the four paralog clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. For example, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the limb axis. Specific members of the Hox family have been implicated in vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and disease by orchestrating changes in matrix degradation, integrins, and components of the ECM. HoxA5 is implicated in atherosclerosis. HoxD3 and HoxB3 are proinvasive, angiogenic genes that upregulate b3 and a5 integrins and Efna1 in ECs, respectively. HoxA3 induces endothelial cell (EC) migration by upregulating MMP14 and uPAR. Conversely, HoxD10 and HoxA5 have the opposite effect of suppressing EC migration and angiogenesis, and stabilizing adherens junctions by upregulating TIMP1/downregulating uPAR and MMP14, and by upregulating Tsp2/downregulating VEGFR2, Efna1, Hif1alpha and COX-2, respectively. HoxA5 also upregulates the tumor suppressor p53 and Akt1 by downregulation of PTEN. Suppression of HoxA5 has been shown to attenuate hemangioma growth. HoxA5 has far-reaching effects on gene expression, causing ~300 genes to become upregulated upon its induction in breast cancer cell lines. HoxA5 protein transduction domain overexpression prevents inflammation shown by inhibition of TNFalpha-inducible monocyte binding to HUVECs.

=== LIM genes ===

LIM genes (named after the initial letters of the names of three proteins where the characteristic domain was first identified) encode two 60 amino acid cysteine and histidine-rich LIM domains and a homeodomain. The LIM domains function in protein-protein interactions and can bind zinc molecules. LIM domain proteins are found in both the cytosol and the nucleus. They function in cytoskeletal remodeling, at focal adhesion sites, as scaffolds for protein complexes, and as transcription factors.

=== Pax genes ===

Most Pax genes contain a homeobox and a paired domain that also binds DNA to increase binding specificity, though some Pax genes have lost all or part of the homeobox sequence. Pax genes function in embryo segmentation, nervous system development, generation of the frontal eye fields, skeletal development, and formation of face structures. Pax 6 is a master regulator of eye development, such that the gene is necessary for development of the optic vesicle and subsequent eye structures.

=== POU genes ===

Proteins containing a POU region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, structurally homologous POU domain that contains two helix-turn-helix motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with consensus sequence 5&#x27;-ATGCAAAT-3&#x27;. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in bacteriophages, particularly lambda phage.

== Plant homeobox genes ==
As in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long DNA-binding homeodomain or in case of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an atypical homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. According to their conserved intron–exon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: HD-ZIP I to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX, PHD, DDT, NDX, LD, SAWADEE and PINTOX. Conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for TALE and non-TALE homeodomain proteins.

== Human homeobox genes ==
The Hox genes in humans are organized in four chromosomal clusters:

ParaHox genes are analogously found in four areas. They include CDX1, CDX2, CDX4; GSX1, GSX2; and PDX1. Other genes considered Hox-like include EVX1, EVX2; GBX1, GBX2; MEOX1, MEOX2; and MNX1. The NK-like (NKL) genes, some of which are considered &quot;MetaHox&quot;, are grouped with Hox-like genes into a large ANTP-like group.

Humans have a &quot;distal-less homeobox&quot; family: DLX1, DLX2, DLX3, DLX4, DLX5, and DLX6. Dlx genes are involved in the development of the nervous system and of limbs. They are considered a subset of the NK-like genes.

Human TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) homeobox genes for an &quot;atypical&quot; homeodomain consist of 63 rather than 60 amino acids:
IRX1, IRX2, IRX3, IRX4, IRX5, IRX6; MEIS1, MEIS2, MEIS3; MKX; PBX1, PBX2, PBX3, PBX4; PKNOX1, PKNOX2; TGIF1, TGIF2, TGIF2LX, TGIF2LY.

<text>Fisting—also known as fist fucking (FF), handballing, and brachioproctic or brachiovaginal insertion—is a sexual activity that involves inserting one or more hands into the rectum (anal fisting) or the vagina (vaginal fisting). Fisting may be performed on oneself (self-fisting) or performed on one person by another. People who engage in fisting are often called &quot;fisters&quot;.

== History ==
Fisting&#x27;s emergence as a sexual practice is commonly attributed to gay male culture. However, its precise origin is disputed. Some claim fisting began in the twentieth century, whereas others assert the practice dates back to the eighteenth century or earlier. Sex educator Robert Morgan Lawrence, for example, claimed the practice dates back thousands of years.
Fisting became more visible and popular around the time of the gay liberation movement, during which sex clubs partly or entirely dedicated to the practice emerged. The hanky code allowed fisters to surreptitiously solicit partners in public by wearing red handkerchiefs. By 1973, gay bars, bathhouses and clubs such as the Red Star Saloon in South of Market, San Francisco were openly advertising fisting. The most famous fisting club was the Catacombs, a gay and lesbian S/M leather fisting club in San Francisco that operated from 1975 to 1984. Other popular fisting clubs include the Handball Express and Red Hanky Express. Crisco was commonly used as a lubricant—prominently featured in pornographic films like &quot;Erotic Hands&quot; (1980)—before specialized products became available.

During the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, cities such as San Francisco and New York forcibly closed gay establishments that, accurately or not, were believed to permit unsafe sex, including fisting. Consequently, most venues that permitted fisting, namely gay bathhouses and sex clubs, permanently closed. While the closures were supported by some in the gay community (such as Randy Shilts), others—including the gay press, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, and San Francisco Human Rights Commission—criticized the decision as counterproductive and a violation of civil liberties. Many regarded the closures as a product of anti-gay hysteria as well as anti-sex attitudes and disapproval of gay sexual activity in particular. Meanwhile, safe sex advocates launched a public health campaign to promote the use of gloves.

Fisting&#x27;s visibility and popularity has grown in the twenty-first century, likely due in large part to the internet and greater HIV prevention and treatment options. Fisting pornography is now widely available online and fisters can easily meet via social media platforms, some of which are tailored for fisting (e.g. Recon). Gay bathhouses have made a comeback, with some even advertising fisting parties and live demonstrations.

== Techniques ==
=== Hands ===
A common technique, particularly for beginners, is to extend four fingers straight with thumb tucked beneath. Some refer to this technique as the &quot;silent duck&quot; or &quot;duck-billing&quot;, because the hand position resembles a duck beak.
In more vigorous forms of fisting, often referred to as &quot;punching&quot; or &quot;punchfisting&quot;, the hand is partly or fully clenched into a fist before, during, and/or after insertion.

Taking two hands at once is referred to as &quot;double fisting&quot;. In the case of double fisting, pleasure may be derived more from the stretching of the anus or vagina than from the in-and-out movement of hands.

Oftentimes, hands are inserted up to the wrist. Some experienced fisters enjoy deeper penetration, sometimes referred to as &quot;depth play&quot;, in which hands may be inserted as far as the elbow.

Sometimes a penetrative partner may insert their penis or a sex toy at the same time as their hand(s), to masturbate inside the receptive partner&#x27;s rectum or vagina.

While rare, some experienced fisters are capable of taking three hands.

=== Lubricants ===
Lubricants designed specifically for fisting or with fisting as an intended use are widely available in some countries.

=== Sex toys ===
Fisters commonly use dildos to loosen the vagina or anus before or during a fisting session.

== Terminology ==
Common fisting-related terms include:

* Fist; fist fuck: &quot;the practice of inserting the hand (and part of the arm) into a partner&#x27;s anus (or vagina) for the sexual pleasure of all involved.&quot;
* Fister; fist-fucker: a practitioner of fisting; or, depending on context, a penetrative partner in a fisting session involving two or more people.
* Fistee: a receptive partner in a session involving two or more people.
* Punch fisting: fisting in which the hand is partly or fully clenched into a fist before, during, and/or after insertion.
* Double fisting: fisting in which two hands are inserted into the anus or vagina.
* Rosebud or rectal prolapse: when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus. Can be induced by fisting or other ass play (named due to the prolapse&#x27;s resemblance to a rose flower).
* Bloom: &quot;bloom&quot; is used as a verb (e.g. &quot;blooming&quot;) to describe the act of inducing a rosebud or prolapse, or the moment when a rosebud or prolapse becomes visible.
According to &quot;The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English,&quot; &quot;fisting&quot; and &quot;fist fuck&quot; entered the American slang lexicon no later than 1969.

==Risks==
Fisting can cause laceration or perforation of the vagina, perineum, rectum, or colon, resulting in serious injury and even death. As anal fisting may cause damage to the rectal mucosa, it may increase the likelihood of transmission of sexually transmitted infections. In addition, sexual activities that force air into the vagina can lead to a fatal air embolism, predominantly during pregnancy.

A 2021 study found that men who practiced anal fisting were more likely to experience fecal incontinence than men who engaged in other forms of anal sex. 18.1% of men who engaged in fisting experienced some form of fecal incontinence in the last month, compared to 7.2% of men who did not engage in fisting. However, more research is required to establish a causal link, and whether or not this is temporary or has a long-term impact.

A 2022 report published in the journal &quot;Sex Education&quot; found that &quot;clinical and forensic research has over-inflated the ‘dangers’ of fisting without an understanding of contexts in which fisting takes place.&quot; It also found that anal and vaginal fisting present &quot;low to no risk&quot; of sexually transmitted infections.

Gloves, lubricant, and fingernail trimming can help reduce risk.

== In popular culture ==
Fisting has been depicted or referenced in art, music, cinema and other forms of popular culture. Examples include:

=== Art ===
* The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, opened in 2017, is art that honors leather culture and community members including Steve McEachern (owner of the Catacombs, a now defunct gay and lesbian S/M leather fisting club in the South of Market area of San Francisco) and Bert Herrman (a fisting community leader, author, and publisher).
* Erotic photography by Robert Mapplethorpe, including &quot;Double Fist Fuck&quot; (1977) and &quot;Fist Fuck / Full Body&quot; (1978) and “Helmut and Brooks, NYC, 1978”. 
* Erotica by Tom of Finland, Dom Orejudos, Bill Schmeling, Chuck Arnett, Gengoroh Tagame, and Drubskin

=== Music ===
* The album cover for &quot;Slide... Easy In&quot; by Rod McKuen (1977) depicts gay porn star Bruno&#x27;s fist clenching &quot;Disco&quot; shortening. The inscription states &quot;this was a project everyone had to get into; not just on the surface, but deeply—and together. If you don&#x27;t feel &quot;easy in&quot; then perhaps your threshold of pain or pleasure needs looking into.&quot; (The European edition of the album featured a different cover because the original was considered &quot;too outrageous.&quot;)

== Legal status ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, performing fisting and fisting pornography are both legal. However, until 2019, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considered publication of fisting material to be grounds for prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, the latter of which prohibits so-called &quot;extreme pornography.&quot; In 1998, the University of Central England was involved in a controversy when a library book by Robert Mapplethorpe was confiscated from a student by the police, who informed the university that two photographs in the book (including one involving fisting) would have to be removed. If the university agreed to the removal (which it did not) the book would be returned. The two photographs, which were deemed possibly prosecutable as obscenity, included “Helmut and Brooks, NYC, 1978”, which shows anal fisting. However, after a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Peter Knight, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, was informed that no legal action would be taken. The book was returned to the university library without removal of the photos. In &quot;R v Peacock&quot; (2012), the jury found Michael Peacock not guilty of breaching the Obscene Publications Act for selling DVDs containing anal fisting. That same year, a jury took less than 90 minutes to acquit Simon Walsh for possession of images of anal fisting that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleged constituted illegal, extreme pornography. In 2019, the CPS declared it would no longer prosecute pornography produced by consenting adults engaging in legal acts, including fisting.

=== United States ===
Fisting is on the Cambria List, meant to be a list of sex acts that carry risk of prosecution under U.S. obscenity law, created by Paul Cambria in 2001 to help producers avoid obscenity lawsuits. However, as of 2019, the Cambria List is generally regarded as obsolete within the American pornography industry.

<doc id="60293" wikidata="Q40115" url="?curid=60293" title="Chasing Amy">
<text>Chasing Amy is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Kevin Smith and starring Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams and Jason Lee. The third film in Smith&#x27;s View Askewniverse series, the film is about a male comic artist (Affleck) who falls in love with a lesbian (Adams), to the displeasure of his best friend (Lee).

The film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early film by a friend of Smith&#x27;s. In Guinevere Turner&#x27;s &quot;Go Fish&quot;, one of the lesbian characters imagines her friends passing judgment on her for &quot;selling out&quot; by sleeping with a man. Smith was dating Adams at the time he was writing the script, which was also partly inspired by her.

The film received mostly positive reviews which praised the humor, the performances and Kevin Smith&#x27;s direction. The film won two awards at the 1998 Independent Spirit Awards (Best Screenplay for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Lee). Characters from the film would go on to appear in later Askewniverse films &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001) and &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; (2019), direct spin-offs of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, with Affleck, Lee, Adams and Dwight Ewell reprising their roles in cameo appearances; Smith described the characters&#x27; roles in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; as being an &quot;eight-page sequel&quot; to &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

==Plot==
While promoting their comic &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; at a comic book convention, comic book artists and lifelong best friends Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards meet Alyssa Jones. A struggling writer, Alyssa is friends with Hooper, an African-American writer and activist who masks his flamboyantly gay personality with a militant image to promote his comic &quot;White-Hating Coon&quot;. Immediately attracted to her, Holden soon learns she is a lesbian.

Holden and Alyssa begin spending time with each other, and a deep friendship soon develops. This upsets the homophobic Banky, who resents Alyssa for intervening in their affairs. The duo&#x27;s business partnership also suffers, as they had been close to signing a lucrative deal to adapt Bluntman and Chronic into an animated TV series, and Banky feels that Holden no longer cares about their project.

Unable to contain his feelings, Holden confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but they later reconcile, sleep together, and begin a romantic relationship, which worsens things with Banky. An old friend of Banky&#x27;s, who grew up with Alyssa, tells Holden she participated in a threesome with two boys back in high school. Holden is deeply disturbed by the revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with.

Hooper advises Holden to be honest and truthful and ask Alyssa about her past. Hooper also thinks that Banky is jealous and in love with Holden, disguising his true feelings with macho sexual banter. The following night, Holden clumsily attempts to bait Alyssa into confessing, which she eventually does, and storms out of the arena. In the parking lot, Alyssa angrily admits to the threesome but refuses to apologize for her past sexual experiences, wanting to continue their relationship. Holden leaves feeling unsure.

Later, Holden meets Jay and Silent Bob, inspirations for Bluntman and Chronic, at a local diner. He hands them their residual pay for book sales and discusses his troubles. Bob reveals that a couple of years earlier, he had a girlfriend named Amy. Although he loved her, his insecurities about her past promiscuity caused him to break up with her. He regretted it and has spent a long time &quot;chasing Amy.&quot;

Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. He invites them over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend while telling Banky that he realizes that he is in love with Holden. He proposes a threesome, which he believes will both end his envy towards Alyssa&#x27;s broader experiences and resolve Banky&#x27;s issues with them being a couple. The initially shocked Banky agrees to participate, but is relieved when an appalled Alyssa declines. She reasons that the proposal is offensive and will not save their relationship. Alyssa and Banky both leave.

One year later, Banky and Alyssa are busy promoting their own respective comics, &quot;Baby Dave&quot; and &quot;Idiosyncratic Routine&quot;, at a convention. It is revealed that Holden and Banky dissolved their partnership, with Banky now owning the publishing and creative rights to &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;. Banky smiles sadly at Holden, who silently congratulates him for his comic being successful, and gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, encouraging him to speak to her. During their brief emotional conversation, Holden gives her a copy of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, his new comic based on their failed relationship. After he departs, Alyssa&#x27;s girlfriend arrives and asks about him. Smiling and teary-eyed, Alyssa feigns indifference, moves his comic aside, and dismisses him as some guy she knew.

==Cast==
==Production==
Kevin Smith has said over the years that &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; was inspired by his brother being gay, his relationship with Joey Lauren Adams, whom he was dating during the making of the film, and a crush his producing partner Scott Mosier had on lesbian filmmaker Guinevere Turner. Turner met Mosier and Smith at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival where their respective films, &quot;Go Fish&quot; and &quot;Clerks&quot;, had premiered. After the festival, Mosier and Turner kept in touch, with Mosier developing unrequited feelings for Turner. Smith told Mosier to channel his heartbreak into a movie about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian, but the filmmakers felt it was too lean a story, so Smith added his own experiences into the character of Holden. Smith wrote, &quot;The character of Holden is the closest to me I&#x27;ve ever written (casting Ben was aesthetically wishful thinking perhaps).&quot; Smith, who said he &quot;didn&#x27;t really know that much about gay culture, and specifically lesbian culture&quot;, had Turner look at drafts of the script for her input. Turner helped find the location for the bar scenes, which were shot at the since-closed Meow Mix in downtown Manhattan.

Miramax Films initially offered Smith a $2 million budget on the condition that he cast David Schwimmer, Drew Barrymore, and Jon Stewart as the leads. Smith rejected this offer in favor of a $250,000 budget with a cast of his choosing.

==Release==

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 1997.

On a budget of $250,000, the film grossed a total of $12,021,272 in theaters. &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; played at three locations and earned $52,446 upon its opening weekend in the United States. The following week, the film was expanded to a further 22 theaters where it grossed $302,406. During the 18–20 April 1997 weekend, &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; was screened at a further 494 locations, where it earned $1,642,402 and moved into the Top 10.

==Reception==
&quot;Chasing Amy&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 87% based on reviews from 87 critics, with a rating average of 7.30/10. According to the site&#x27;s summary of the critical consensus, “Although &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;″s depiction of queer sexuality is frustratingly clumsy, it handles an array of thorny themes with a mixture of sensitivity, raw honesty, and writer-director Kevin Smith&#x27;s signature raunchy humor.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 28 reviews. Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying: Ebert believed the film was an improvement over Smith&#x27;s previous effort &quot;Mallrats&quot; and he added that Adams was a discovery.

Charles Taylor, writing for &quot;Salon&quot;, quipped &quot;&quot;Chasing Amy&quot; isn&#x27;t going to single-handedly save romantic comedy, but Smith (&quot;Clerks&quot;) has made the only romantic comedy in quite a while that acknowledges, even celebrates, the fact that love and sex are emotional anarchy.&quot; Writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston observed: &quot;&quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; Kevin Smith&#x27;s third feature, does to romantic comedy what Stan Lee and Steve Ditko&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; did to superhero comics in the &#x27;60s: It makes a tired genre newly relevant by giving its characters motivations and problems that seem real.&quot;

Quentin Tarantino considered &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; his favorite movie of 1997.

=== Analysis ===
In the book &quot;Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women&#x27;s Love and Desire&quot;, Lisa M. Diamond cites the film as a notable example of female sexual fluidity in popular culture, writing that &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; &quot;depicts a lesbian becoming involved with a man, contrary to the more widespread depictions of heterosexual women becoming involved in same-sex relationships.&quot;

Though the film has been praised as ahead of its time by some critics in its representation of sexual fluidity and the concept of the bromance, it also received criticism, particularly for its implication that a lesbian can go straight, even if just temporarily, as soon as she meets the right guy. The film was criticized by Judith Kegan Gardiner in the book &quot;Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory&quot;, describing &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; as representative of a &quot;fairly repulsive genre of films&quot; that feature a &quot;heterosexual conversion narrative&quot; that is &quot;set in motion by the desire of a heterosexual person for a seemingly unattainable gay person.&quot; The scene where Alyssa is shamed by her gay friends when they discover she is dating a man also received criticism from the lesbian community.

On the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Smith said, &quot;For anyone who watches the movie now and goes, like, &#x27;Ew, these sexual politics are ... not very subtle&#x27;, you’ve gotta remember: It was made by a 26-year-old, 27-year-old guy, who really didn’t know anything and was learning in that moment. As much as it’s a movie that’s closely identified with the gay community, by virtue of the fact that the main character was gay, I really never think about it as such ... To me, it was about a boy who grows up to become a man but loses everything in the process — very bittersweet.&quot;

In 2023, queer filmmaker Sav Rodgers released the documentary &quot;Chasing Chasing Amy&quot;, which discusses the impact the film had on his life.

It includes audio commentary from cast and crew, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a theatrical trailer. The DVD adds an introduction from Kevin Smith, apologizing for saying &quot;fuck DVD&quot; in the commentary. Later reissues by Lionsgate and Paramount are repressings of the Criterion edition.

&quot;Chasing Amy&quot; was released on Blu-Ray on November 17, 2009. This release includes a new commentary track, a Q&amp;A with the cast recorded at Vulgarthon 2005, a conversation between Kevin Smith and Joey Lauren Adams, and a feature-length documentary titled &quot;Tracing Amy&quot; that details the making of the film and its aftermath.

==Novel==
In Japan, the screenplay of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; was adapted into a novel by Kenichi Eguchi and published by Aoyama Publishing. The unique concept of the book is that it is roughly half-novel, half-manga, with Moyoko Anno providing the art for the comic book pages. In an episode of &quot;SModcast&quot;, Smith revealed that while he was thrilled to have a manga based on his film, he was shocked when he read the novelization, as the characters&#x27; sexual histories, which are just mentioned in conversation in the film, are depicted in the novel&#x27;s manga illustrations as sexually graphic flashbacks.

Smith had the original screenplay published along with his &quot;Clerks&quot; script from Miramax Books.

==Soundtrack==
The film had no soundtrack album released; however, many songs appear in the movie, including &quot;Alive,&quot;; the song written and performed by Joey Lauren Adams in character as Alyssa, cover of The Cars&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; performed by Ernie Isley, &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot; by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot; by Run-DMC and other songs by artists such as Public Enemy, The Hang Ups, Gwen Guthrie and Liz Phair.

Two songs by the band Soul Asylum are featured in the film: &quot;Lucky One&quot; and &quot;We 3&quot;. The band had previously contributed the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Tell&quot; to the soundtrack of Smith&#x27;s 1994 debut film &quot;Clerks&quot;. Frontman Dave Pirner composed the incidental music for the film along with the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Tube of Wonderful,&quot; which plays over the opening credits. The song reappears in Smith&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, as well as its 2019 reboot &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;, both times introducing the character Holden McNeil.

The music video for the song &quot;Have You Seen Mary&quot;, performed by the band Sponge, features several scenes of the film. In &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, the song is played in the scene while Holden and Hooper are at Jack&#x27;s Music Shoppe.

==Cultural references==
In a scene originally written for &quot;Mallrats&quot;, several principal characters share memories of sexual escapades gone awry. This scene reveals the character&#x27;s own emotional &quot;sex scars&quot; and was purposefully created—down to the style of dialogue and set dressing—to mirror a scene from Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; in which Quint and Hooper share the physical scars they&#x27;ve both earned from encounters with sharks. However, in this film it&#x27;s used with Alyssa and Banky.
