<text>Flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek δι- &quot;di-&quot; &quot;two&quot;, and πτερόν &quot;pteron&quot; &quot;wing&quot;. Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics. Diptera is a large order containing more than 150,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies, mosquitoes and others.

Flies have a mobile head, with a pair of large compound eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great manoeuvrability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are often laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. Other species are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching larvae instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.

Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance. Flies are major pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases; and houseflies, commensal with humans all over the world, spread foodborne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait, as food for carnivorous animals, and in medicine in debridement, to clean wounds.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

=== Relationships to other insects ===

Dipterans are holometabolans, insects that undergo radical metamorphosis. They belong to the Mecopterida, alongside the Mecoptera, Siphonaptera, Lepidoptera and Trichoptera. The possession of a single pair of wings distinguishes most true flies from other insects with &quot;fly&quot; in their names. However, some true flies such as Hippoboscidae (louse flies) have become secondarily wingless.

The cladogram represents the current consensus view.

=== Relationships between subgroups and families ===

The first true dipterans known are from the Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became widespread during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans must have had a different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, it has been suggested that they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.

The phylogenetic position of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of holometabolous insects has long been accepted, with the main orders being established as Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, and it is the relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought to be a member of Mecopterida, along with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.

Diptera were traditionally broken down into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are identified by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree has been the subject of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.

===Diversity===

Flies are often abundant and are found in almost all terrestrial habitats in the world apart from Antarctica. They include many familiar insects such as house flies, blow flies, mosquitoes, gnats, black flies, midges and fruit flies. More than 150,000 have been formally described and the actual species diversity is much greater, with the flies from many parts of the world yet to be studied intensively. The suborder Nematocera include generally small, slender insects with long antennae such as mosquitoes, gnats, midges and crane-flies, while the Brachycera includes broader, more robust flies with short antennae. Many nematoceran larvae are aquatic. There are estimated to be a total of about 19,000 species of Diptera in Europe, 22,000 in the Nearctic region, 20,000 in the Afrotropical region, 23,000 in the Oriental region and 19,000 in the Australasian region. While most species have restricted distributions, a few like the housefly (&quot;Musca domestica&quot;) are cosmopolitan. &quot;Gauromydas heros&quot; (Asiloidea), with a length of up to , is generally considered to be the largest fly in the world, while the smallest is &quot;Euryplatea nanaknihali&quot;, which at is smaller than a grain of salt.

Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, with many being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals parasitised include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are the second largest group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as they do not need to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.

The greatest diversity of gall forming insects are found among the flies, principally in the family Cecidomyiidae (gall midges). Many flies (most importantly in the family Agromyzidae) lay their eggs in the mesophyll tissue of leaves with larvae feeding between the surfaces forming blisters and mines. Some families are mycophagous or fungus feeding. These include the cave dwelling Mycetophilidae (fungus gnats) whose larvae are the only diptera with bioluminescence. The Sciaridae are also fungus feeders. Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.
The larvae of &quot;Megaselia scalaris&quot; (Phoridae) are almost omnivorous and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish. The &quot;Exorista mella (Walker)&quot; fly are considered generalists and parasitoids of a variety of hosts. The larvae of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (&quot;Diamesa&quot; sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil (&quot;Helaeomyia petrolei&quot;). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) are well known for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.

== Anatomy and morphology ==

Flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the mouthparts (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla make up the mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; the first and third segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some of which may be fused, and with the three hindmost segments modified for reproduction. Some Dipterans are mimics and can only be distinguished from their models by very careful inspection. An example of this is &quot;Spilomyia longicornis&quot;, which is a fly but mimics a vespid wasp.


Flies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eyes on the sides of the head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host&#x27;s skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.

For visual course control, flies&#x27; optic flow field is analyzed by a set of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.

Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect smell and taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third segments of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females at the tip of the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts. Many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.

Diptera have one pair of fore wings on the mesothorax and a pair of halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some flies such as the ectoparasitic Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are exceptional in having lost their wings and become flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly&#x27;s six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.

The abdomen shows considerable variability among members of the order. It consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh segments having fused. The last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction. Each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite, connected by an elastic membrane. In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.

===Flight===

Flies are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to the presence of the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.

Flies tend to fly in a straight line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.

Flies have rapid reflexes that aid their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid flies in the genus &quot;Condylostylus&quot; respond in less than five milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, &quot;Cephenemyia&quot;, was claimed to be one of the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per hour, was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour.

Although most flies live and fly close to the ground, a few are known to fly at heights and a few like &quot;Oscinella&quot; (Chloropidae) are known to be dispersed by winds at altitudes of up to 2,000 ft and over long distances. Some hover flies like &quot;Metasyrphus corollae&quot; have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts.

Males of fly species such as &quot;Cuterebra&quot;, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) maintain territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species, such as &quot;A. freeborni&quot;, form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.

== Life cycle and development ==

Diptera go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult.

=== Larva ===

In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, in the case of parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax. The spiracles in the larva and pupa do not have any internal mechanical closing device.

Some other anatomical distinction exists between the larvae of the Nematocera and the Brachycera. Especially in the Brachycera, little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen, though the demarcation may be visible in many Nematocera, such as mosquitoes; in the Brachycera, the head of the larva is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body, and few, if any, sclerites are present. Informally, such brachyceran larvae are called maggots, but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general. The eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion, decaying detritus, or host tissues surrounding endoparasites. Nematoceran larvae generally have well-developed eyes and antennae, while those of Brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified.

Dipteran larvae have no jointed, &quot;true legs&quot;, but some dipteran larvae, such as species of Simuliidae, Tabanidae and Vermileonidae, have prolegs adapted to hold onto a substrate in flowing water, host tissues or prey. The majority of dipterans are oviparous and lay batches of eggs, but some species are ovoviviparous, where the larvae starting development inside the eggs before they hatch or viviparous, the larvae hatching and maturing in the body of the mother before being externally deposited. These are found especially in groups that have larvae dependent on food sources that are short-lived or are accessible for brief periods. This is widespread in some families such as the Sarcophagidae. In &quot;Hylemya strigosa&quot; (Anthomyiidae) the larva moults to the second instar before hatching, and in &quot;Termitoxenia&quot; (Phoridae) females have incubation pouches, and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by the adult and it almost immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage. The tsetse fly (as well as other Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Nycteribidae and Streblidae) exhibits adenotrophic viviparity; a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions. When fully grown, the female finds a spot with soft soil and the larva works its way out of the oviduct, buries itself and pupates. Some flies like &quot;Lundstroemia parthenogenetica&quot; (Chironomidae) reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis, and some gall midges have larvae that can produce eggs (paedogenesis).

=== Pupa ===

The pupae take various forms. In some groups, particularly the Nematocera, the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form; these pupae are described as &quot;obtect&quot;, having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body. The outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines, respiratory features or locomotory paddles. In other groups, described as &quot;coarctate&quot;, the appendages are not visible. In these, the outer surface is a puparium, formed from the last larval skin, and the actual pupa is concealed within. When the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough, desiccation-resistant capsule, it inflates a balloon-like structure on its head, and forces its way out.

=== Adult ===

The adult stage is usually short, its function is only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of male flies are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion may lead to the anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season. More primitive groups mates in the air during swarming, but most of the more advanced species with a 360° torsion mate on a substrate.

==Ecology==

As ubiquitous insects, dipterans play an important role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.

Whereas many dipteran larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, the majority of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. Some flies have functional mandibles that may be used for biting. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, with some species having anticoagulant saliva that is regurgitated before absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. The larvae of a few fly groups (Agromyzidae, Anthomyiidae, Cecidomyiidae) are capable of inducing plant galls. Some dipteran larvae are leaf-miners. The larvae of many brachyceran families are predaceous. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.

Most adult diptera have their mouthparts modified to sponge up fluid. The adults of many species of flies (e.g. &quot;Anthomyia&quot; sp., &quot;Steganopsis melanogaster&quot;) that feed on liquid food will regurgitate fluid in a behaviour termed as &quot;bubbling&quot; which has been thought to help the insects evaporate water and concentrate food or possibly to cool by evaporation. Some adult diptera are known for kleptoparasitism such as members of the Sarcophagidae. The miltogramminae are known as &quot;satellite flies&quot; for their habit of following wasps and stealing their stung prey or laying their eggs into them. Phorids, milichids and the genus &quot;Bengalia&quot; are known to steal food carried by ants. Adults of &quot;Ephydra hians&quot; forage underwater, and have special hydrophobic hairs that trap a bubble of air that lets them breathe underwater.

===Anti-predator adaptations===

Flies are eaten by other animals at all stages of their development. The eggs and larvae are parasitised by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume them as part of a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies. Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous—their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as &quot;Bombylius major&quot; are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.

In contrast, &quot;Drosophila subobscura,&quot; a species of fly in the genus &quot;Drosophila&quot;, lacks a category of hemocytes that are present in other studied species of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, leading to an inability to defend against parasitic attacks, a form of innate immunodeficiency.

== Human interaction and cultural depictions ==
===Symbolism===
Flies play a variety of symbolic roles in different cultures. These include both positive and negative roles in religion. In the traditional Navajo religion, Big Fly is an important spirit being. In Christian demonology, Beelzebub is a demonic fly, the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and a god of the Philistines.

Flies have appeared in literature since ancient Sumer. In a Sumerian poem, a fly helps the goddess Inanna when her husband Dumuzid is being chased by &quot;galla&quot; demons. In the Mesopotamian versions of the flood myth, the dead corpses floating on the waters are compared to flies. Later, the gods are said to swarm &quot;like flies&quot; around the hero Utnapishtim&#x27;s offering. Flies appear on Old Babylonian seals as symbols of Nergal, the god of death. Fly-shaped lapis lazuli beads were often worn in ancient Mesopotamia, along with other kinds of fly-jewellery.

In Ancient Egypt, flies appear in amulets and as a military award for bravery and tenacity, due to the fact that they always come back when swatted at. It is thought that flies may have also been associated with the departing spirit of the dead, as they are often found near dead bodies. In modern Egypt, a similar belief persists in some areas to not swat at shiny green flies, as they may be carrying the soul of a recently deceased person.

In a little-known Greek myth, a very chatty and talkative maiden named Myia (meaning &quot;fly&quot;) enraged the moon-goddess Selene by attempting to seduce her lover, the sleeping Endymion, and was thus turned by the angry goddess into a fly, who now always deprives people of their sleep in memory of her past life. In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which is attributed to the Athenian tragic playwright Aeschylus, a gadfly sent by Zeus&#x27;s wife Hera pursues and torments his mistress Io, who has been transformed into a cow and is watched constantly by the hundred eyes of the herdsman Argus: &quot;Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed.&quot; William Shakespeare, inspired by Aeschylus, has Tom o&#x27;Bedlam in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o&#x27;er bog and quagmire&quot;, driven mad by the constant pursuit. In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Shakespeare similarly likens Cleopatra&#x27;s hasty departure from the Actium battlefield to that of a cow chased by a gadfly. More recently, in 1962 the biologist Vincent Dethier wrote &quot;To Know a Fly&quot;, introducing the general reader to the behaviour and physiology of the fly.

&quot;Musca depicta&quot; (&quot;painted fly&quot; in Latin) is a depiction of a fly as an inconspicuous element of various paintings. This feature was widespread in 15th and 16th centuries paintings and its presence may be explained by various reasons.

Flies appear in popular culture in concepts such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; relied on the idea that DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.

===Economic importance===
Dipterans are an important group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment. Some leaf-miner flies (Agromyzidae), fruit flies (Tephritidae and Drosophilidae) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are pests of agricultural crops; others such as tsetse flies, screwworm and botflies (Oestridae) attack livestock, causing wounds, spreading disease, and creating significant economic harm. See article: Parasitic flies of domestic animals. A few can even cause myiasis in humans. Still others such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (Simuliidae) and drain flies (Psychodidae) impact human health, acting as vectors of major tropical diseases.
Among these, &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes transmit malaria, filariasis, and arboviruses; &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes carry dengue fever and the Zika virus; blackflies carry river blindness; sand flies carry leishmaniasis. Other dipterans are a nuisance to humans, especially when present in large numbers; these include houseflies, which contaminate food and spread food-borne illnesses; the biting midges and sandflies (Ceratopogonidae) and the houseflies and stable flies (Muscidae). In tropical regions, eye flies (Chloropidae) which visit the eye in search of fluids can be a nuisance in some seasons.

Many dipterans serve roles that are useful to humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are scavengers and aid in decomposition. Robber flies (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger flies and balloon flies (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of other insects, helping to control a variety of pests. Many dipterans such as bee flies (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.

=== Uses ===
&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, a fruit fly, has long been used as a model organism in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and the fact that many of its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.

Maggots found on corpses are useful to forensic entomologists. Maggot species can be identified by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times after the death of the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, the presence or absence of particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.

Some species of maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and bluebottle larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds. It has been suggested that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union. 

Fly larvae can be used as a biomedical tool for wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.

The Sardinian cheese casu marzu is exposed to flies known as cheese skippers such as &quot;Piophila casei&quot;, members of the family Piophilidae. The digestive activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as part of the process of maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.

== Hazards ==

Flies are a health hazard and are attracted to toilets because of their smell. The &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine suggested a trap for these flies. A pipe acting as a chimney was fitted to the toilet which let in some light to attract these flies up to the end of this pipe where a gauze covering prevented escape to the air outside so that they were trapped and died. Toilets are generally dark inside particularly if the door is closed.

<doc id="63665" wikidata="Q345004" url="?curid=63665" title="Mickey Mantle">
<text>Mickey Charles Mantle (October 20, 1931 – August 13, 1995), nicknamed &quot;the Mick&quot; and &quot;the Commerce Comet&quot;, was an American professional baseball player who played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career (1951–1968) with the New York Yankees, primarily as a center fielder. Mantle is regarded by many as being one of the best players and sluggers of all time. He was an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player three times and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.

Born in Spavinaw, Oklahoma, Mantle was raised by his father to become a baseball player and was trained early on to become a switch hitter. Despite a career plagued with injuries, beginning with his knee injury in the 1951 World Series, he became one of the greatest offensive threats in baseball history, and was able to hit for both average and power. He is the only player to hit 150 home runs from both sides of the plate. Mantle hit 536 career home runs while batting .300 or more ten times; he is 16th all-time in home runs per at-bat and 17th in on-base percentage.

Mantle won the Triple Crown in 1956, when he led the major leagues in batting average (.353), home runs (52), and runs batted in (RBI) (130). He was an All-Star for 16 seasons, playing in 16 of the 20 All-Star Games that he was selected for. He also had a solid .984 fielding percentage when playing center field, winning a Gold Glove in that position. He appeared in 12 World Series, winning seven championships, and holds World Series records for the most home runs (18), RBIs (40), extra-base hits (26), runs (42), walks (43), and total bases (123), and he has the highest World Series on-base and slugging percentages.

After retirement, Mantle worked as sports commentator for NBC for a few years and had a brief stint as first base and hitting coach for the Yankees in the 1970 season. Despite being one of the best-paid athletes of his era, he was a poor businessman and suffered financial setbacks from business failures. His private life was plagued by tumult and tragedy. His marriage fell apart due to his alcoholism and infidelity, and three of his sons became alcoholics, two of them dying from it. Towards the end of his life, Mantle came to regret his hard lifestyle and the damage he had inflicted on his family. Before his final year, he was treated for alcoholism and became sober, afterwards warning others of the dangers of hard drinking. He died from liver cancer brought on by years of alcohol abuse in Dallas, Texas, aged 63.

==Early years==
Mantle was born on October 20, 1931, in Spavinaw, Oklahoma, the son of Lovell Thelma (née Richardson; previously Davis) (1904–1995) and Elvin Charles &quot;Mutt&quot; Mantle (1912–1952). He was of at least partial English ancestry; his great-grandfather George Mantle left Brierley Hill, a small town in England&#x27;s Black Country, and immigrated to the United States in 1848.

Mantle had two older half-siblings, Ted and Anna Bae Davis, from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, and four younger full siblings: twin brothers Ray and Roy, brother Larry, and sister Barbara. When he was four years old, Mantle&#x27;s family moved to the nearby town of Commerce, Oklahoma, where his father worked in lead and zinc mines.

A semi-pro player himself, Mutt Mantle decided that his eldest son would be a baseball player before Mantle was even born. He named his eldest son after Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane and, very early on, began training Mickey to become a switch-hitter: Mantle later recalled batting left-handed against his father, who pitched to him right-handed, and batting right-handed against his grandfather, Charles Mantle, who pitched to him left-handed.

In addition to baseball, Mantle was an all-around athlete at Commerce High School, playing basketball and football. He excelled in football, playing the halfback position. After graduating, Mantle was offered a football scholarship by the University of Oklahoma but declined it at his father&#x27;s behest. However, in his sophomore year, he sustained an injury during a practice football game which nearly ended his athletic career. He was kicked in the left shin and developed osteomyelitis, an infectious disease incurable just a few years earlier, in his left leg. Mantle&#x27;s parents drove him overnight to Oklahoma City, where he was treated at a children&#x27;s hospital with the newly available penicillin. The treatment successfully reduced the infection and saved his leg from amputation.

Later in life, Mantle confided in friends and family about how he suffered from sexual abuse as a child at the hands of his older half-sister Anna Bae, who often babysat her younger half-siblings when Mantle&#x27;s parents were out, as well as by other adults, including Anna Bae&#x27;s friends and older boys in the neighborhood. His wife Merlyn recalled later on that Mantle also had a sexual relationship with one of his high school teachers when he was still a minor. According to Merlyn, the teacher &quot;seduced&quot; him: &quot;She just laid over him.&quot;

The child sexual abuse he endured at the hands of family and adults likely contributed to Mantle&#x27;s self-destructive behavior as an adult, with biographer Jane Leavy speculating that Mantle, like many childhood sexual abuse victims, likely suffered from complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Professional baseball==
===Minor leagues (1948–1950)===
Mantle began his professional baseball career in Kansas with the semi-professional Baxter Springs Whiz Kids. In 1948, Yankees scout Tom Greenwade came to Baxter Springs to watch Mantle&#x27;s teammate, third baseman Willard &quot;Billy&quot; Johnson. During the game, Mantle hit three home runs. Greenwade returned in 1949, after Mantle&#x27;s high school graduation, to sign Mantle to a minor league contract with the Yankees at $140 per month (), with a $1,500 signing bonus ().

Mantle was assigned to the Yankees&#x27; Class-D Independence Yankees of the Kansas–Oklahoma–Missouri League, where he played shortstop and hit .313. He hit his first professional home run on June 30, 1949, at Shulthis Stadium in Independence, Kansas. The ball went over the center field fence, which was 460 feet from home plate. In 1950, Mantle was promoted to the Class-C Joplin Miners of the Western Association, where he won the Western Association batting title with a .383 average. He hit 26 home runs and recorded 136 RBIs, but struggled defensively at shortstop.

In July 1950, after the start of the Korean War, Mantle was drafted for military service. The draft board rejected him as physically unqualified for military service due the osteomyelitic condition of his left leg and gave him a 4-F deferment, the first of three times he was rejected for military service.

===Major leagues (1951–1968)===
====Rookie season: 1951====
Mantle was invited to the Yankees instructional camp before the 1951 season and proceeded to make a big impression during spring training. One famous incident was when he hit two home runs at Bovard Field against the USC Trojans baseball team, when the Yankees were on a thirteen-game spring training tour of the west coast. Both home runs, one from each side of the plate, reportedly traveled a distance of at least 500 feet. Impressed by the 19-year-old&#x27;s power, Yankees manager Casey Stengel decided to promote Mantle to the majors as a right fielder instead of sending him to the minors; his salary for the 1951 season was $7,500. Mantle was assigned uniform No. 6, signifying the expectation from the Yankees front office that he would become the next Yankees star, following Babe Ruth (No. 3), Lou Gehrig (No. 4), and Joe DiMaggio (No. 5).

After a brief slump, Mantle was sent down to the Yankees&#x27; top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. His struggles at the plate continued. Out of frustration, he called his father and told him: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I can play baseball anymore.&quot; Mutt Mantle drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son&#x27;s clothes and, according to Mantle, said: &quot;I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead. You can come back to Oklahoma and work the mines with me.&quot; After his father&#x27;s rebuke, Mantle gradually broke out of his slump and went on to hit .361 with 11 home runs and 50 RBIs during his stay in Kansas City.

Mantle was called up to the Yankees after 40 games with Kansas City, this time wearing uniform No. 7. He hit .267 with 13 home runs and 65 RBI in 96 games as the Yankees reached the World Series against the New York Giants. In the second game of the 1951 World Series, Giants rookie Willie Mays hit a fly ball to right-center field. Mantle, playing right field, raced for the ball together with center fielder DiMaggio. At the last moment, the latter called for the ball. In attempting to stay out of DiMaggio&#x27;s way, Mantle&#x27;s spikes got caught over an exposed drain pipe. His knee twisted awkwardly and he fell instantly, his right knee injured severely. Mantle had to be carried off the field on a stretcher. This was the first of numerous injuries that were to plague his eighteen-year career with the Yankees. He was to play the rest of his career with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Accompanying his son to the hospital after the game, Mantle&#x27;s father collapsed onto the sidewalk while trying to help his son into a taxi. The two were given hospital beds in the same room and watched the remainder of the World Series together. Mutt Mantle was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s disease; he died a few months later at the age of 40, on May 7, 1952. Mantle, at the time away with the Yankees, was informed by manager Stengel of his father&#x27;s death and was inconsolable.

====Rise to stardom: 1952–1960====
Following the 1951 World Series, DiMaggio retired from baseball. As a result, Mantle moved to center field before the start of the 1952 season. He played that position full-time for the Yankees until 1965, when he was moved to left field near the end of his career. That year, Mantle was selected as an All-Star for the first time but did not make an appearance in the rain-shortened All-Star Game. The Yankees won the pennant and faced the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series. Mantle performed well in the series, recording an on-base percentage above .400 and a slugging percentage above .600. In Game 6, he homered in a 3–2 win. In Game 7, he knocked in the winning runs in the 4–2 victory, with a home run in the sixth inning and an RBI single in the seventh.

Mantle&#x27;s emergence as a star center fielder coincided with the Korean War. Due to his previous rejection, he was not amongst the baseball players who joined the Armed Forces, leading baseball fans and sportswriters to question his 4-F deferment. This led to newspapers even calling him a &quot;draft dodger&quot; and Mantle receiving threatening letters. In April 1951, Mantle was re-examined by the draft board and was once again rejected as being physically unfit for military service. A second highly publicized physical, brought on by his All-Star selection, was held in October 1952 and ended in a final rejection, this time due to the knee injury sustained in the 1951 World Series.

Mantle had a strong 1953 season, making the All-Star Game and helping the Yankees to another World Series, which they won against the Brooklyn Dodgers. He missed several weeks due to his previously injured knee which had been left untreated after the initial stay in hospital in 1951. After the season ended, a full two years after the injury he had picked up at the 1951 series, Mantle had surgery performed on his left knee in November 1953. The following season, Mantle recorded his first 100-RBI season while also hitting over .300 and leading the league in runs scored. He had a strong season in 1955 as well, leading the AL in home runs, triples, and walks, and recording a .306 batting average.

The 1956 season was, statistically, Mantle&#x27;s greatest and was later described by him as his &quot;favorite summer.&quot; He led the majors with .353 batting average, 52 home runs, and 130 RBIs, winning the Triple Crown, the only switch hitter to do so. This was the first of three AL MVP Awards. He also hit his second All-Star Game home run that season. That year, the Yankees again faced the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series. In the fifth inning of Game 5, Mantle kept Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game alive by making a running catch of a deep fly ball off the bat of Gil Hodges. The inning before, he had scored the first of the Yankees&#x27; two runs with a home run off Brooklyn starter Sal Maglie. Mantle&#x27;s overall performance in 1956 led to his being named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year, and he was also awarded the Hickok Belt as the top American professional athlete of the year.

Mantle won his second consecutive MVP in 1957, leading the leagues in runs scored and walks and recording a career-high batting average of .365, second best in the AL. That season, Mantle reached base more times than he made outs (319 to 312), one of two seasons in which he achieved the feat. In the 1957 World Series, the Yankees faced the Milwaukee Braves. During Game 5, Mantle suffered a torn tendon in his left shoulder from a collision with Braves second baseman Red Schoendienst. The Braves won the series in seven games and the injury would lead to Mantle having struggles in his uppercut swing from the left side for the remainder of his career.

Still recovering from his shoulder injury, Mantle&#x27;s 1958 season started slowly; during the first half, he was hitting a modest .274. He eventually regained his form, hitting .330 in the second half of the season, finishing with .304 batting average and leading the league in home runs, runs scored, and walks. He led the Yankees back to a World Series rematch against the Braves, this time coming out victorious. Despite his strong season, the Yankees declined Mantle&#x27;s request for a contract raise to $85,000, citing that his batting average was almost 61 points lower than the year before. After briefly holding out, Mantle eventually settled for their lower offer of $70,000.

In the 1959 season, as the Yankees finished third in the AL rankings, Mantle&#x27;s overall numbers declined from the previous season. He recorded only 75 RBIs and also racked up a league-leading 126 strikeouts. Though he led the team in base stealing (23), runs scored (104), on-base percentage (.390), and fielding percentage (.995), Mantle agreed to take a salary cut of $10,000 at the end of the season. The 1959 season was also the first of four consecutive seasons when two All-Star games were played, with Mantle playing in seven of these games. Mantle made the All-Star team as a reserve player in 1959. In the first game, he was used as a pinch runner and as replacement right fielder. In the second game, Mantle was the starting center fielder, recording a single and a walk in four at-bats.

Mantle began the 1960 season slowly, with his batting average dropping as low as .228 in June. However, he regained his form and finished the season leading the AL in home runs and runs scored, as the Yankees won the pennant. That year, Mantle started in both All-Star games, getting two walks in the first and a single in the second. Although his batting average was the lowest since his rookie year, a league-leading 40 home runs and 94 RBIs saw him come a close second to teammate Roger Maris in the MVP race. In the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Mantle turned in his best performance in a single postseason. In seven games, he batted .400 (10-for-25) with 9 walks, hitting three home runs with 11 RBIs and recording an on-base percentage of .545. The Yankees lost the World Series in Game 7 on Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s walk-off home run. Mantle was devastated by the loss, reportedly crying in the clubhouse afterwards. He would later call the loss in the 1960 World Series as one of the biggest disappointments of his career.

====M&amp;M Boys: 1961 home run chase====
During the 1961 season, Mantle and teammate Roger Maris, known as the M&amp;M Boys, pursued Babe Ruth&#x27;s 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs. Five years earlier, Mantle had challenged Ruth&#x27;s record for most of the season, and the New York press had been protective of Ruth on that occasion. When Mantle finally fell short, finishing with 52 home runs, many reporters were relieved. The New York press was harsh in its treatment of Mantle in his early years with the Yankees, emphasizing that he struck out frequently, was injury-prone, was a rube from Oklahoma, and was perceived as inferior to DiMaggio. Over time, however, Mantle had learned to deal with the New York media and had gained the favor of the press, receiving help from teammate Whitey Ford, a native of Queens.

Unlike Mantle, Maris was new to the New York scene, having been traded to the Yankees from the Kansas City Athletics before the 1960 season, and never managed to adjust to demands of the New York press, many of whom began to view him as surly and rude. During the 1961 season, the press pushed the notion of the Yankees being Mantle&#x27;s team, with Maris often belittled and ostracized as an outsider and not a &quot;true Yankee&quot;.

Late in the season, Mantle was hospitalized with a severe abscessing septic infection on his hip, which had resulted from a &quot;miracle shot&quot; that he had received from physician Max Jacobson at the recommendation of Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen. It was discovered years later that Jacobson&#x27;s so-called &quot;miracle shot&quot; was in fact laced with various substances, including amphetamines and methamphetamines, and resulted in at least one death. This revelation exposed Jacobson as a fraud and he was stripped of his medical license in 1975.

While Maris went on to break the record on the last day of the season, Mantle finished with 54 home runs, the single-season record for a switch-hitter. He also led the AL in runs scored and walks. For the second consecutive year, he narrowly missed winning his third MVP award, finishing second to repeat winner Maris. Under new manager Ralph Houk, the Yankees won the World Series that year against the Cincinnati Reds. Neither Mantle nor Maris performed well in the series, recording between them three hits and two RBIs in twenty-five at-bats over five games.

====Final seasons: 1962–1968====

In 1962, Mantle batted .321 in 121 games and was selected as an All-Star for the eleventh consecutive season. He played in the first game but, due to the recurrence of an old injury, sat out the second. Despite missing 41 games, he was selected as MVP for the third time, beating out teammate Bobby Richardson in the voting. With a .978 fielding percentage that season, he also received his only Gold Glove Award. In the 1962 World Series, the Yankees beat the San Francisco Giants in seven games. Mantle fared poorly in the series, hitting .120 with five strikeouts. After the 1962 season, the Yankees gave Mantle a contract of $100,000, making him the fifth player to reach that pinnacle, after Hank Greenberg, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and Stan Musial . Only Willie Mays, with a salary of $105,000, made more than Mantle in 1963. Having reached the $100,000 salary threshold, Mantle never asked for another raise.

On May 22, 1963, Mantle hit a long drive off the top of the right field facade at Yankee Stadium, the closest that anyone came to hitting a home run out of the old stadium. However, on June 5, he broke his foot while trying to prevent a home run by Brooks Robinson in Baltimore; his spikes had been caught in the center field chain-link fence as he came down after leaping against it. As a result, he did not play again until August 4, when he hit a pinch-hit home run against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. Mantle returned to the center field position on September 2 and finished the season batting .314 in 65 games. He was selected as an All-Star but, due to the foot injury, did not make the AL 25-man roster for the first time.

That year, the Yankees made the World Series and were favorites to win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. They were swept in four games for the first time in franchise history. In Game 1, Mantle struck out twice against Cy Young Award winner and National League MVP Sandy Koufax, who finished with a record-setting 15 strikeouts in a World Series game. In Game 4, he hit a home run off Koufax to tie Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 15 in the World Series. With the tying run on base in the ninth inning, he struck out against Koufax for the third time. He finished the series 1-for-15 with five strikeouts.

In 1964, Mantle hit .303 with 35 home runs and 111 RBIs, and played center field in the All-Star game. He finished in second place in the MVP voting. The Yankees faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1964 World Series. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3, Mantle hit a walk-off home run into the right field stands at Yankee Stadium to win the game for his team by a score of 2–1. This was his 16th home run in the World Series, breaking Ruth&#x27;s record of 15. He hit two more home runs in the series to set a new record of 18, including an opposite field shot off Cardinals star Bob Gibson in St. Louis, and hit .333 with 8 RBIs overall. Despite Mantle&#x27;s performance, the Cardinals won the World Series in seven games behind Gibson&#x27;s overall excellent pitching.

On April 9, 1965, the Houston Astros and the Yankees played an exhibition game to inaugurate the Astrodome, the world&#x27;s first multi-purpose, domed sports stadium. In the sixth inning Mantle hit the park&#x27;s first home run. By 1965, he and the aging Yankees were slowed by injuries, finishing sixth in the AL rankings. Mantle hit .255 with 19 home runs and 46 RBI in 361 plate appearances. He was again selected as an All-Star, this time as a reserve player, and did not make an appearance in the game.

In 1966, Mantle&#x27;s batting average increased to .288 with 23 home runs and 56 RBI in 333 at-bats. This improvement was largely due to strong performances in June and July, when he returned to his normal form until sidelined with another injury. After the 1966 season, he was replaced by Joe Pepitone in the outfield, and spent his final two seasons at first base. On May 14, 1967, Mantle became the sixth member of the 500 home run club.

Mantle hit .237 with 18 home runs and 54 RBIs during his final season in 1968. As a result, his lifetime average was to dip below .300, which caused him a lot of anguish. That year, despite his lowly numbers, Mantle was selected as an All-Star and made an appearance as a pinch-hitter at the All-Star Game at the Astrodome.

====Retirement====

Mantle announced his retirement at the age of 37 on March 1, 1969. He delivered a farewell speech on Mickey Mantle Day, June 8, 1969, at Yankee Stadium. Mantle&#x27;s wife, mother, and mother-in-law were in attendance and received recognition at the ceremony held in his honor. When he retired, Mantle was third on the all-time home-run list with 536, and he was the Yankees&#x27; all-time leader in games played with 2,401, a record that would be broken by Derek Jeter on August 29, 2011.

In his career, Mantle batted .298 with an on-base percentage of .421 and an on-base plus slugging percentage of .997. He accumulated 2,415 hits, including 536 home runs, 344 doubles, and 72 triples. While Mantle led the league in strikeouts five times, holding the all-time record at the time of his retirement, he was also adept at drawing walks. He led the majors in walks five times and finished with at least 100 walks in a season ten times. As an outfielder, he recorded a career fielding percentage of .982.

Mantle was selected as an All-Star every season during his 18-year career except for 1951 and 1966. He was a seven-time World Series champion with the Yankees, playing in twelve overall. In the World Series, he hit .257 over 65 games and holds the all-time World Series records for home runs (18), runs scored (42), and RBIs (40).

==Player profile==
===Hitting===
Mantle is considered to be one of the greatest switch hitters in baseball history, hitting for both average and for power from both sides of the plate. In particular, he was known for his power, hitting some of the longest home runs in Major League history. On September 10, 1960, he hit a ball left-handed that cleared the right-field roof at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. Based on where the ball was found, it was estimated years later by historian Mark Gallagher to have traveled 643 feet (196 m).

Another Mantle home run, hit right-handed off Chuck Stobbs at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., on April 17, 1953, was measured by Yankees traveling secretary Red Patterson (hence the term tape-measure home run) to have traveled 565 feet (172 m). Deducting for bounces, there is no doubt that each of the above home runs landed well over 500 feet (152 m) from home plate.

Twice in his career Mantle hit a home run off the third-deck facade at Yankee Stadium, nearly becoming the only player to hit a fair ball out of the stadium during a game. On May 22, 1963, against Kansas City&#x27;s Bill Fischer, Mantle hit a home run against the high facade, before the ball caromed back onto the playing field. It was later estimated that the ball could have traveled had it not been blocked by the ornate and distinctive facade. On August 12, 1964, he hit one whose distance was undoubted: a center-field drive that cleared the batter&#x27;s eye screen, some 75 feet beyond the marker at Yankee Stadium.

Although Mantle was a feared power hitter from either side of the plate and hit more home runs batting left-handed than right, he was a better hitter overall right-handed: roughly 25% of his total at-bats were from the right side, producing a batting average of .330 as opposed to .281 when batting from the left side. His 372 (left) to 164 (right) home run disparity was due to Mantle having batted left-handed much more often, as a large majority of pitchers are right-handed. In spite of short foul pole dimensions of 296 feet (90 m) to left and 301 feet (92 m) to right in the original Yankee Stadium, Mantle gained no advantage there as his stroke both left and right-handed drove balls to power alleys of 344–407 feet (right center) and 402–457 feet (left center) from the plate. Overall, he hit slightly more home runs away (270) than home (266).

Despite being known for power hitting, Mantle was also regarded as one of the best bunters for base hits. He is in 10th place in number of bases-empty bunt singles, with 80 in only 148 at-bats. He was also known for his remarkable ability to avoid grounding into double plays: for every 100 at-bats, Mantle grounded into 1.40 double plays, one of the lowest marks in history. In both 1953 and 1961, he hit into only two double plays over the course of 1,186 plate appearances.

===Fielding===
Though not a flashy fielder, Mantle was an overall solid center fielder, especially considering he did not play the position until after he had reached the Major Leagues. Manager Casey Stengel, unimpressed with him at shortstop, moved him to the outfield before his rookie year. Over time, Mantle developed one of the strongest outfield arms to compensate for weak points in his fielding. His outfield throws discouraged runners from taking an extra base. Possessed of good range in center field, his defensive skill was considered &#x27;the less spectacular equal of his offensive genius&#x27;. Although he considered himself a better hitter than fielder, Mantle felt his running catch during Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game was the best play of his career. He later referred to it as &quot;probably the only good catch I ever made. I wasn&#x27;t that good of a fielder.&quot;

===Injuries===
Mantle&#x27;s career was plagued with injuries. Beginning in high school, he suffered both acute and chronic injuries to bones and cartilage in his legs. By the end of his career simply swinging a bat caused him to fall to one knee in pain. Baseball scholars often ponder &quot;what if&quot; had Mantle not been injured but able to enjoy a healthy career.

In particular, the torn cartilage Mantle sustained to his right knee during the 1951 World Series was a very serious injury. Witnesses say it looked &quot;like he had been shot.&quot; Dr. Stephen Haas, former medical director for the National Football League Players Association, has speculated that Mantle injured his ACL during that incident and played the rest of his career without having it properly treated, since an ACL could not be repaired with the surgical techniques available in that era. Surgery performed in 1953 removed torn cartilage to prevent further erosion to the joint but also left his knee unstable. In order to minimize the effect of that, Yankee trainers would later wrap up his knees tightly with athletic tape. After the injury, teammates noted a change in Mantle&#x27;s gait and a loss of speed as a result. Despite his bad knee, Mantle was still known as the &quot;fastest man to first base&quot;, once reportedly being recorded reaching first base in 3.1 seconds. However, he was forbidden by Yankee managers from base stealing over the worry that his &quot;delicate&quot; knees would break down faster.

Further, the shoulder injury Mantle suffered during the 1957 World Series, while not affecting his numbers, led to increasing difficulty in hitting from the left side over the next decade.

==Later years==
After retiring from baseball, Mantle briefly served as a part-time color commentator for NBC on &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. In 1969, he was the color commentator for the All-Star Game. He also served as a pre-game analyst for the 1969 and 1970 World Series. He was one of four color commentators used by the Expos during the 1972 season.

During the 1970 season, Mantle briefly returned to the Yankees as their first base and hitting coach for a few weeks. He quickly came to dislike the job and left the post at the end of the season. It was his last official appearance in a Major League uniform.

In 1973, at the Old-Timers Game at Yankee Stadium, Mantle, batting right-handed, faced his old teammate Whitey Ford. He hit a long home run over the 402-foot sign by the bullpen, his last at Yankee Stadium.

Although he was among the best-paid players of the pre-free-agency era, Mantle was a poor businessman and did not invest well and struggled financially for a while. Amongst his failed business ventures was his chain of &quot;Mickey Mantle&#x27;s Country Cookin″&quot; restaurants in the early 1970s.

His financial situation improved after the sports memorabilia industry boomed in the 1980s. Mantle was a prized guest at baseball-card shows, and was paid considerable sums for his appearances and autographs. At the same time, he always insisted that the promoters of baseball-card shows include one of the lesser-known Yankees of his era, such as Bill Skowron or Hank Bauer, so that they could also earn money for their appearances.

In 1976, the Mantles were amongst the honorary guests invited to the White House when French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing came on a state visit to celebrate the American Bicentennial.

In 1983, Mantle accepted a position at the Claridge Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a greeter and community representative. His job mostly involved representing the Claridge in golf tournaments and at other charity events. As a result, however, he was suspended from baseball by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who had taken a strong stance against gambling and viewed it as grounds for placement on the &quot;permanently ineligible&quot; list. Kuhn had already suspended Willie Mays, who had taken a position similar to Mantle&#x27;s at Claridge. The commissioner warned Mantle before he accepted the position that he would be placed on the list if he took the job. Despite the warning, he accepted the position because he felt the rule was &quot;stupid.&quot; He and Mays were both reinstated on March 18, 1985, by Kuhn&#x27;s successor Peter Ueberroth.

In 1988, Mantle opened &quot;Mickey Mantle&#x27;s Restaurant &amp; Sports Bar&quot; in New York City, which proved to be a success. His original Yankee Stadium Monument Park plaque is displayed at the front entrance. While he made frequent appearances, he let others run the business.

After the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, Mantle joined with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer to raise money for the victims.

==Personal life==
On December 23, 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson (1932–2009) in Picher, Oklahoma. The couple had four sons together: Mickey Jr. (1953–2000), David (born 1955), Billy (1957–1994; named for Billy Martin, Mantle&#x27;s Yankee teammate and best friend), and Danny (born 1960).

In his autobiography, Mantle said that he had married Merlyn not out of love but because he was told to by his father who was, at the time, terminally ill. While Mantle&#x27;s drinking became public knowledge during his lifetime, the press kept quiet about his marital infidelity and philandering. He was indiscreet about them: at his retirement ceremony in 1969, he brought his mistress along with his wife. In 1980, Mantle separated from his wife, and while the two lived apart for the rest of Mantle&#x27;s life, they never filed for divorce. During his final days, the two made peace and Merlyn was at his bedside when he died.

During the last decade of his life, Mantle lived with his agent and live-in aide Greer Johnson. After Mantle&#x27;s death, his family pursued a federal lawsuit against Johnson to prohibit her from auctioning many of Mantle&#x27;s personal items, including a lock of hair, a neck brace, and expired credit cards. A settlement was reached allowing for the sale of some of Mantle&#x27;s belongings for approximately $500,000.

At that time, Mantle purchased a condominium on Lake Oconee near Greensboro, Georgia, which was near Johnson&#x27;s home, and stayed there for months at a time. He occasionally attended the local Methodist church, and sometimes ate Sunday dinner with members of the congregation. He was well liked by the citizens of Greensboro, who respected Mantle&#x27;s privacy, refusing either to talk about him to outsiders or to direct fans to his home. In one interview, Mantle stated that the people of Greensboro had &quot;gone out of their way to make me feel welcome, and I&#x27;ve found something there I haven&#x27;t enjoyed since I was a kid.&quot;

Mantle was the uncle of actor, musician, and reality television personality Kelly Mantle.

===Alcoholism===
According to Mantle&#x27;s childhood friend Nick Ferguson, Mantle&#x27;s father often took them both out and bought beer for his son while Mantle was still underaged. Additionally, alcoholism ran in his mother&#x27;s family and a number of Mantle&#x27;s maternal relatives died from the condition.

Mantle&#x27;s own trouble with alcohol was aggravated by his lifestyle. Before he sought treatment for alcoholism, he admitted that his hard living had hurt both his playing and his family. His rationale was that the men in his family had all supposedly died young, so he expected to die young as well; his father and uncle both died of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease while still in their forties and he presumed he would too. At the time, Mantle did not know that most of the men in his family had inhaled lead and zinc dust while working in the mines, which can cause Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

Like Mantle, his wife and three of their sons also became alcoholics. Merlyn, Mickey Jr., and David all completed treatment for alcoholism and pleaded with Mantle to do the same. After being examined by a doctor, he was told that his liver was so badly damaged from almost 40 years of drinking that &quot;your next drink could be your last.&quot; As a result, Mantle checked into the Betty Ford Clinic on January 7, 1994. Also helping Mantle decide to enter the clinic was his friend the sportscaster Pat Summerall, by then a recovering alcoholic, who had recently been treated there.

Shortly after Mantle had completed treatment, his son Billy died in police custody on March 12, 1994, at age 36, after years of substance abuse. Despite the fears of those who knew him that this tragedy would send Mantle back to drinking, he remained sober for the remainder of his life. Later on, Mickey Jr., like his father, succumbed to liver cancer brought on after years of alcohol abuse and died December 20, 2000, at age 47.

In a 1994 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover story, Mantle spoke with remorse about his drinking. He said that he was telling the same old stories: realizing how many of them involved being drunk, including at least one drunk-driving crash, he decided they were not funny anymore. He admitted that he had often been cruel and hurtful to family, friends, and fans because of his alcoholism, and sought to make amends. Mantle became a born-again Christian when former teammate Bobby Richardson, a Baptist minister, shared his faith with him.

==Illness and death==
Early in 1995, doctors discovered that Mantle&#x27;s liver had been severely damaged by both alcohol-induced cirrhosis and hepatitis C, and that he had an inoperable liver cancer known as undifferentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, necessitating a liver transplant. He received the transplant at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas on June 8, 1995. Mantle&#x27;s popularity led to controversy over this transplant. Some felt that his fame had permitted him to receive a donor liver in just one day, bypassing patients who had been waiting much longer. His doctors insisted that the transplant was based solely on medical criteria, but acknowledged that the very short wait created the appearance of favoritism.

In July, Mantle had recovered enough to deliver a press conference at Baylor, and addressed fans that had looked to him as a role model: &quot;This is a role model: Don&#x27;t be like me.&quot; He also established the Mickey Mantle Foundation to raise awareness for organ donations. He returned to the hospital in late July, and the cancer was found to have spread throughout his body. Doctors observed that it was among the most aggressive cancers that they had ever treated, and felt that the immunosuppressive drugs administered to Mantle for his liver transplant had helped the cancer spread so quickly.

Mantle died at 2:10 a.m. on August 13, 1995, at Baylor University Medical Center with his wife Merlyn and son David at his side, five months after his mother had died at age 91. He was 63 years old. The Yankees played the Indians that day and honored him with a tribute. The team played the rest of the season with black mourning bands topped by a number 7 on their left sleeves.

Mantle&#x27;s funeral was held in Lovers Lane United Methodist Church in Dallas, with around 1,500 people attending. Bobby Richardson led the funeral service while six other former teammates served as honorary pallbearers: Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Bill Skowron, Hank Bauer, Johnny Blanchard and Bobby Murcer.

Eddie Layton played &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; on the Hammond organ because Mickey had once told him that it was his favorite song. Roy Clark sang and played &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Young&quot;. Sportscaster Bob Costas eulogized Mantle, describing him as &quot;a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic&quot;. He continued:

At Mantle&#x27;s request made prior to his death, Richardson read the same poem he recited at Roger Maris&#x27;s funeral – &quot;God&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot; (written by a baseball fan). He later described it as one of the most difficult things he had ever done.

Mantle was interred in his family mausoleum, in the St. Matthew section of the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas. As per his wishes, the phrase &quot;A Great Teammate&quot; was carved on the plaque marking his resting place.

==Legacy==
Mantle was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1964. In 1969, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

On Mickey Mantle Day at Yankee Stadium, June 8, 1969, Mantle&#x27;s number 7 was retired and he was presented with a bronze plaque to be hung on the center field wall near the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Miller Huggins. The plaque was officially presented to Mantle by Joe DiMaggio. Mantle gave a similar plaque to DiMaggio, telling the crowd: &quot;Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s deserves to be higher.&quot; As per Mantle&#x27;s request, DiMaggio&#x27;s plaque was hung one inch higher than Mantle&#x27;s. When Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976, the plaques and monuments were moved to a newly created Monument Park behind the left-center field fence.

On August 25, 1996, Mantle&#x27;s Monument Park plaque was replaced with a monument bearing the words &quot;A great teammate&quot; and keeping a phrase that had been included on the original plaque: &quot;A magnificent Yankee who left a legacy of unequaled courage.&quot; Since the opening of the current Yankee Stadium in 2009, Mantle&#x27;s monument has stood at the current Monument Park.

In , his first year of eligibility, Mantle was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame alongside his former teammate Whitey Ford.

In 1998, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed Mantle at 17th on its list of baseball&#x27;s 100 greatest players. That same year, he was one of 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Mantle at number 11 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, compiled by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

A school for children with disabilities in Manhattan was renamed for Mantle on June 4, 2002.

In 2006, Mantle was featured on a United States postage stamp, one of a series of four including fellow baseball legends Mel Ott, Roy Campanella, and Hank Greenberg.

A statue of Mantle was unveiled in Oklahoma City in 1998 and is located at Mickey Mantle Plaza at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, the home stadium of the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers, 2 South Mickey Mantle Drive. In 2010, Mantle&#x27;s hometown of Commerce, Oklahoma unveiled a statue called &quot;The Commerce Comet&quot;; it stands outside the centerfield fence of the baseball field at Commerce High School.

In August 2022, a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card in mint condition (SGC Mint+ 9.5) sold for a record $12.6 million. It was originally purchased for $50,000 in 1991. The previous record for a sports card was $7.25 million, made by a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner card designed by the American Tobacco Company. At the time of the 2022 sale, the Mickey Mantle card was considered the most valuable card of the modern era. The Mickey Mantle baseball card was the first ever sports trading card sold at auction for eight figures.

There is a Mickey Mantle Drive in San Antonio, Texas.

===Cultural portrayals===
Mantle portrayed himself a number of times on screen. He appeared as himself in the 1958 film &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; in an uncredited role. He and Roger Maris starred as themselves in the 1962 film &quot;Safe at Home!&quot;, and also appeared, along with Yogi Berra, in a scene in the film &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962), sitting next to Doris Day and Cary Grant. Mantle appeared in Paul Simon&#x27;s 1988 music video for Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard.

In 2001, Mantle was portrayed by Thomas Jane in &quot;61*&quot;, directed by actor and comedian Billy Crystal. The film chronicled Mantle&#x27;s and Maris&#x27;s (played by Barry Pepper) 1961 chase of Ruth&#x27;s single-season home-run record. Mantle&#x27;s son Danny and grandson Will appeared briefly as a father and son watching Mantle hit a home run.

Mantle has been referenced in a number of songs. The most notable song is &quot;I Love Mickey&quot; by Teresa Brewer which came out in 1956; Mantle also took part in the recording, in a speaking role. Another well-known song is &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot; by Terry Cashman, released in 1981; the song refers heavily to the three New York City center fielders of the 1950s: Willie Mays, Mantle, and Duke Snider.

<text>Sharon ( &#x27;plain&#x27;), also spelled Saron, is a given name as well as a Hebrew name.

In English-speaking areas, Sharon is now predominantly a feminine given name. However, historically it was also used as a masculine given name. In Israel, it is used both as a masculine and a feminine given name.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew word simply means &#x27;plain&#x27;, as in a flat area of land, but in the Hebrew Bible, is the name specifically given to the fertile plain between the Samarian Hills and the coast, known (tautologically) as Sharon plain in English. The phrase &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; (חבצלת השרון &quot;ḥăḇaṣṣeleṯ ha-sharon&quot;) occurs in the KJV translation of the Song of Songs (&quot;I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley&quot;), and has since been used in reference to a number of flowering plants.

Unlike other unisex names that have come to be used almost exclusively as feminine (e.g. Evelyn), &quot;Sharon&quot; was never predominantly a masculine name. Usage before 1925 is very rare and was apparently inspired either from the Biblical toponym or one of the numerous places in the United States named after the Biblical plain.

==Usage history==
Use as a feminine name began in the early 20th century, first entering the statistics of the 1,000 most popularly given names in the United States in 1925.
Its inspiration was possibly the heroine of the serial novel &quot;The Skyrocket&quot; by Adela Rogers St. Johns, published in 1925 and made into a romantic drama film starring Peggy Hopkins Joyce in 1926.

The name&#x27;s popularity in the United States took a steep increase only in the mid-1930s, however, and peaked during the 1940s, remaining a top 10 name for most of the decade. The variant &quot;Sharron&quot; is on record during the 1930s to 1970s, with a peak popularity in the US in 1943. The more eccentric spelling &quot;Sharyn&quot; was popular only for a brief time in the 1940s, peaking in 1945.

The name&#x27;s popularity has steadily declined since the 1940s (except for a slight rise in the late 1950s), falling out of the top 100 after 1977, out of the top 500 after 2001, and out of the top 1,000 names for American girls after 2016.

In the United Kingdom, its popularity peaked during the 1960s. It was the 10th most popular female name by 1964 and was still as high as 17th in 1974 (when it was at rank 70 in the United States), but a sharp decline in popularity followed and since the 1980s it has not featured in the top 100. Names that rhymed with Sharon such as Darren and Karen were also popular in the Anglosphere during the same time period.

In the 1980s, the name Sharon was stereotyped as a “chav” name in the United Kingdom, signifying a working class teenage girl who works in a supermarket. By the 2010s, the name Sharon had become associated with memes poking fun at overbearing middle aged women who make complaints to authority figures. The demeaning stereotype has been attributed to sexism and age discrimination and has caused difficulty for women named Sharon.

While appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, contestant Amanda Henderson was asked to name the Swedish teenage climate activist who wrote a book titled &quot;No One&#x27;s Too Small to Make a Difference&quot;. Henderson answered &quot;Sharon.&quot; Following the broadcast, climate activist Greta Thunberg (the correct response to the question) changed her name to Sharon on her Twitter bio (which remained there for the day: 3 January 2020).

<text>Sherman is a surname that originated in the Anglo-Saxon language. It means a &quot;shearer of woolen garments&quot;, being derived from the words &quot;scearra&quot;, or &quot;shears&quot;, and &quot;mann&quot;, or &quot;man&quot;. The name is cognate with Sharman, Shearman and Shurman. Sherman has also been regularly used as a given name in the United States. This was probably originally in honor of Roger Sherman, though after the Civil War William Tecumseh Sherman was also an influence.

<text>(&quot;The Puritans&quot;) is an 1835 opera by Vincenzo Bellini. It was originally written in two acts and later changed to three acts on the advice of Gioachino Rossini, with whom the young composer had become friends. The music was set to a libretto by Count Carlo Pepoli, an Italian émigré poet whom Bellini had met at a salon run by the exile Princess Belgiojoso, which became a meeting place for many Italian revolutionaries. The opera is based on &quot;Têtes Rondes et Cavaliers&quot; (&quot;Roundheads and Cavaliers&quot;), a historical play written by Jacques-François Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine and set in the English Civil War, which some sources state was based on Walter Scott&#x27;s 1816 novel &quot;Old Mortality,&quot; while others state that there is no connection.

When Bellini arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833, he had intended to stay only about three weeks, the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Paris Opéra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier. These negotiations came to nothing, but by October he had decided to spend the winter in that city, especially as both &quot;Il pirata&quot; and &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; were to be given by the Théâtre-Italien that season. The offer from the Théâtre came in January 1834; he accepted because &quot;the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then, though only by a little; then because of so magnificent a company; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others&#x27; expense.&quot;

Taking from April until its premiere the following January, Bellini had time to ensure that the opera was as close to perfection as possible. After the premiere, Bellini reported to his friend Francesco Florimo in Naples that:
The French had all gone mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they themselves were astonished at being so carried away ... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement
It was to be Bellini&#x27;s final work; he died in September 1835 at the age of 33.

==Composition history==

===Search for a suitable source for a libretto===
Upon his arrival in Paris, Bellini quickly entered into the fashionable world of the Parisian salons, including that run by Princess Belgiojoso whom he had met in Milan. In addition to the many writers of the time, among the musical figures which he would have encountered were several Italians such as Michele Carafa and Luigi Cherubini, then in his seventies. Thus, for most of the remainder of 1833, Bellini&#x27;s musical activity was very limited. He pleaded guilty in the letter to Florimo in March 1834 noting that the city&#x27;s attractions were immense.

The contract to write a new opera for the Théâtre-Italien, which was signed in January 1834, called for it to be presented at the end of that year. Once it was signed, Bellini began to look around for a suitable subject and, in a letter to Florimo of 11 March 1834, he expresses some frustrations, noting: &quot;I am about to lose my mind over the plot of the opera for Paris, as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company&quot;.

In the same letter he tells of working towards finding a subject with the Italian émigré, Count Pepoli, who had not written a libretto before. However, on 11 April he is able to say in a letter to Ferlito that he was well and that &quot;I have chosen the story for my Paris opera; it is of the times of Cromvello [Cromwell], after he had King Charles I of England beheaded.&quot; The chosen source of the libretto was identified as a play performed in Paris only six months before in September 1833. When first shown the play and other possible subjects by Pepoli, in the opinion of writer William Weaver, &quot;it was clearly the heroine&#x27;s madness that attracted the composer and determined his choice.

===Working with Pepoli===

In his letter to Ferlito of 11 April, Bellini provides a synopsis of the opera, indicating that his favourite singers, Giulia Grisi, Luigi Lablache, Giovanni Battista Rubini, and Antonio Tamburini, would all be available for the principal roles, and that he would begin to write the music by 15 April if he had received the verses. Before the collaboration had got underway and initially impressed by the quality of Pepoli&#x27;s verses in general, Bellini had prepared the way for his librettist by providing him with a scenario of thirty-nine scenes (thus compressing the original drama into manageable proportions), reducing the number of characters from nine to seven and at the same time, giving them names of a more Italianate, singable quality.

But a month later, he comments to Florimo on what it takes working on the libretto with Pepoli: &quot;keeping [Pepoli] moving ahead costs me a lot of weariness; he lacks practice which is a great thing [to have].&quot; For Bellini, the process of both overseeing the writing of the libretto and working with Pepoli was a struggle, added to by a period of illness. But, to balance the situation, William Weaver comments that &quot;to some extent Bellini could compensate for Pepoli&#x27;s deficiencies with his own first-hand theatrical experience&quot; and suggests that some of that experience had been &quot;acquired from Romani.&quot;

Continuing to work on the yet-unnamed &quot;I puritani&quot;, Bellini moved from central Paris, and at some time in the late Spring (specific date unknown) Bellini wrote to Pepoli to remind him that he should bring his work with him the following day &quot;so that we can finish discussing the first act, which...will be interesting, magnificent, and proper poetry for music in spite of you and all your absurd rules...&quot; At the same time, he laid out one basic rule for the librettist to follow:
Carve into your head in adamantine letters: &quot;The opera must draw tears, terrify people, make them die through singing&quot;

By late June, there had been considerable progress and, in a letter copied into one written to Florimo on 25 July, Bellini writes in reply to , now the director of the Royal Theatres of Naples, telling him that the first act of &quot;Puritani&quot; is finished and that he expects to complete the opera by September, in order that he may then have time to write a new opera for Naples for the following year. Finally, Bellini stated that he did not want &quot;to negotiate with anybody until I see what success my opera will have&quot;. This included a proposal from the Opéra-Comique in Paris for a new opera for that company.

When nothing came of negotiations with Naples for a new opera, Bellini composed an alternative version intended for the famous Maria Malibran, who was to sing Amina (in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;) at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples in 1835. However, she died exactly a year to the day after the composer, and so this version was not performed on stage until 10 April 1986 at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari, with Katia Ricciarelli in the title role.

====Critical reaction to Pepoli&#x27;s work on &quot;Puritani&quot;====

Given Bellini&#x27;s own expressions of frustration at working with a new librettist for the first time, one musicologist, Mary Ann Smart, provides a different point of view in regard to Pepoli&#x27;s approach to writing a libretto. Firstly, she addresses the issue of Pepoli&#x27;s inexperience:
An address that Pepoli delivered to prize-winning students in Bologna in 1830 reveals not only a surprisingly broad grasp of operatic repertoire but also some forceful ideas about how music could provoke political feeling. Pepoli adopts a modern aesthetic agenda, condemning vocal ornamentation as a dilution of dramatic sense and attacking imitation as cheapening music&#x27;s inherent, nonverbal language. After touching on exemplary passages from operas by Francesco Morlacchi, Nicola Vaccai, and Vincenzo Bellini, Pepoli turns to the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;, arguing that it melds music and poetry perfectly to arouse feeling and provoke action.

Quoting Pepoli, Smart continues: &quot;for this song [the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;] the people fight, win, triumph: Europe and the world shouted &quot;Liberty!&quot;&quot;. Smart then examines the relationship between Pepoli&#x27;s 1830 views and how they appear to be manifested in what he wrote for &quot;I puritani&quot;:
The Italian phrase Pepoli uses here, [i.e. in discussing the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;] &quot;gridavano Libertà&quot;, strikingly anticipates the duet &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; in &quot;I puritani&quot;, in which the two basses step outside of the opera&#x27;s dreamy and non teleological plot for an isolated moment of patriotic fervor. For their homeland they will take up arms and gladly face death: &quot;Suoni la tromba, e intrepido/ Io pugnerò da forte/ Bello è affrontar la morte gridando &quot;Libertà&quot;&quot; (&quot;Let the trumpet sound, and fearless I&#x27;ll fight with all my strength. It is beautiful to face death shouting &#x27;liberty&#x27;).&quot;

Then she recounts how Bellini reacted to what she describes as Pepoli’s &quot;hotheaded patriotism&quot; which appears in librettist&#x27;s poetry. When he wrote to Pepoli that his &quot;liberal bent..terrifies me&quot;, Bellini&#x27;s other concern, which proved to be correct, was that words such as &quot;libertà&quot; would have to be removed if the opera was to be performed in Italy.

Nevertheless, the &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; which Bellini described as his &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; and which had initially been placed in the opera&#x27;s first act was enthusiastically received by the composer: &quot;My dear Pepoli, I hasten to express my great satisfaction with the duet I received by post this morning ... the whole is magnificent...&quot;

===Perceived competition from Donizetti===
Around the middle of April 1834, Bellini became concerned when he learned that Gaetano Donizetti would be composing for the Théâtre-Italien during the same season as the one for which he was writing. According to Weinstock, quoting letters sent to Florimo in Italy at around that time (and continuing almost up to &quot;I puritani&quot;″s premiere), Bellini perceived this to be a plot orchestrated by Rossini and, in a long, rambling letter of 2,500 words to Florino of 11 March 1834, he expressed his frustrations. As it transpired, Bellini&#x27;s total success vastly outshone Donizetti&#x27;s moderate one (&quot;Marin Faliero&quot;, given in March 1835, two months after &quot;I puritani&quot;).

===The score is completed===
By September Bellini was writing to Florimo of being able to &quot;polish and re-polish&quot; in the three remaining months before rehearsals and he expresses happiness with Pepoli&#x27;s verses (&quot;a very beautiful trio for the two basses and &quot;La Grisi&quot;&quot;) and by around mid-December he had submitted the score for Rossini&#x27;s approval.

Rossini is known to have recommended one change to the placement of the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, which had initially appeared in the first act but which Bellini had already realised could not remain in its written form if the opera was to be given in Italy. Instead of two acts, with the &quot;Hymn&quot; appearing midway in the second act, Rossini proposed that it be a three-act opera with &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; ending act 2, arguing that the effect would always be likely to create an ovation, something which he rightly foretold.

Throughout his stay in Paris, Bellini had cultivated the older composer and had maintained a friendship with him: &quot;I have always adored Rossini, and I succeeded, and happily ... [having] tamed Rossini&#x27;s [perceived] hatred, I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour&quot;. Later, the successful dress rehearsal, he wrote: &quot;... my very dear Rossini ... now loves me as a son&quot;.

With rehearsals planned for late December/early January, the dress rehearsal took place on 20 January 1835. It was attended by &quot;all of high society, all the great artists, and everyone most distinguished in Paris were in the theatre, enthusiastic.&quot; Bellini&#x27;s ecstatic letter to Florimo which followed the dress rehearsal recounts the enthusiastic reception of many of the numbers throughout the performance, most especially the second act bass duet, so that, by its end:
The French had all gone mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they themselves were astonished at being so carried away ... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement ... I showed myself to the audience, which shouted as if insane ... How satisfied I am! [He concludes by noting the success of the singers]: &quot;Lablache sang like a god, Grisi like a little angel, Rubini and Tamburini the same.&quot;

It was upon Rossini&#x27;s advice and after the dress rehearsal that the opera was changed from two acts to three, the second act ending after the &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; duet for the two basses.

The premiere, postponed by two days, took place on 24 January 1835.

==Performance history==
19th century

The opera became &quot;the rage of Paris&quot; and was given 17 performances to end the season on 31 March.

Herbert Weinstock&#x27;s chapter on &quot;I puritani&quot; devotes four pages to details of performances which followed the premiere in Paris, although the Théâtre-Italien gave it over 200 times up to 1909. In 1835, London saw it in May, La Scala (in what Weinstock thinks as being a &quot;pirate edition&quot;) in December. In Palermo it was given as &quot;Elvira e Arturo&quot; during the following season and La Fenice presented it in April 1836 as &quot;I puritani e i cavalieri&quot; with Giuseppina Strepponi as Elvira. It took until January 1837 before it was seen at the San Carlo in Naples; Messina saw it in 1838. Weinstock recounts details of hundreds more, including being given in Rome in 1836 as &quot;Elvira Walton&quot;, and during that year he details performances in Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, and Bologna (with Giulia Grisi as Elvira). Between 1836 and 1845 (with no details provided before 20th century performances are discussed), the opera was presented every year in different cities.

20th century and beyond

Details from 1906 forward are provided by Weinstock. In that year the opera appeared at the Manhattan Opera House in New York, followed by stagings at the Metropolitan Opera in February 1917, but in New York it was not revived for many years. Various performances are reported to have taken place in 1921, 1933, 1935, and 1949 in different European cities, but it was not until 1955 in Chicago that &quot;Puritani&quot; re-appeared in America with Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano in the major roles. The 1960s saw a variety of performances in the years between 1960 (Glyndebourne Festival with Joan Sutherland which was recorded) and 1969 when Weinstock&#x27;s account ends. However, he does include a section on performances from the 19th century forward at the Royal Opera House in London up to Joan Sutherland&#x27;s 1964 assumption of the role of Elvira. The article&#x27;s &quot;Recordings&quot; section indicates some other performances which may have been recordings of live performances, although the one DVD from the Metropolitan Opera in January 2007 came from a Metropolitan Opera Live in HD presentation.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
:Place: England during the English Civil War
:Time: 1640s

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: A fortress near Plymouth, commanded by Lord Gualtiero Valton&quot;

At daybreak, the Puritan soldiers gather in anticipation of victory over the Royalists. Prayers are heard from within, and then shouts of joy as the ladies and gentlemen of the castle come out announcing news of Elvira&#x27;s wedding. Left alone, Riccardo shares with Bruno his plight: Riccardo had been promised Elvira&#x27;s hand in marriage by her father Lord Valton but, returning to Plymouth the previous evening, he has found that she is in love with Arturo (a Royalist), and will marry him instead. He confides in Bruno. (Aria: &quot;Ah! Per sempre ...Bel sogno beato&quot; / &quot;Ah! Forever have I lost you, flower of love, oh my hope; ah! life from now on will be full of sorrow&quot;.) As he pours out his sorrows to Bruno, Riccardo is called upon by his soldiers to lead them but he declares &quot;I am aflame, but the flame is love, not glory&quot;.

&quot;Scene 2: Elvira&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Elvira welcomes Giorgio, her uncle. He treats her with fatherly love, but when he tells her that she will soon be married, she is horror-struck. (Aria, then extended duet: &quot;Sai com&#x27;arde in petto mio / bella fiamma onnipossente&quot; / &quot;You know that my breast burns with overwhelming passion&quot;.) She continues, stating a determination never to be married. But when Giorgio tells her that her cavalier, Arturo, will be coming, he reveals that it was he who persuaded her father, Lord Valton, to grant Elvira&#x27;s wish. She is overjoyed. Then the sound of trumpets is heard announcing Arturo&#x27;s arrival; he is welcomed by all.

&quot;Scene 3: The Hall of Arms&quot;

Arturo and his squires come into the hall and are joined by Elvira, Valton, Giorgio and the ladies and gentlemen of the castle. After a general welcome from all assembled, Arturo expresses his new-found happiness. (Aria, Arturo; then Giorgio and Valton; then all assembled: &quot;A te, o cara / amore talora&quot; / &quot;In you beloved, love led me in secrecy and tears, now it guides me to your side&quot;.)

Valton tells everyone that he will not be able to attend the wedding ceremony and he provides Arturo with a safe conduct pass. A mysterious lady appears, and Valton tells her that he will be escorting her to London to appear before Parliament. Arturo is curious. Giorgio tells him that she is suspected of being a Royalist spy. As Elvira leaves to prepare herself for the wedding and the others depart in various directions, Arturo hangs back and finds the mysterious lady alone. He discovers that she is Enrichetta (Henrietta Maria), widow of the executed King Charles I. Insisting that she not be concerned about Elvira, Arturo vows to save her: (Aria, Arturo; then Enrichetta; then together: &quot;Non parlar di lei che adoro, / di valor non mi spogliar&quot; / &quot;Do not speak of her whom I adore; do not take away my courage. You shall be saved, oh unhappy woman.&quot;)

Observed by Arturo and Enrichetta, Elvira appears singing a joyful polonaise (&quot;Son vergin vezzosa&quot; / &quot;I am a pretty maiden dressed for her wedding&quot;), but she engages the Queen in conversation asking for help with the ringlets of her hair. To allow that to happen, she removes her wedding veil and places it over Enrichetta&#x27;s head. Both Arturo and Enrichetta realise that this may allow them to escape, and as they proceed, they are challenged by Riccardo who believes the woman to be Elvira. He almost provokes a fight with Arturo until he discovers that she is not Elvira; then, he is content to allow them to pass, swearing not to reveal any information.

When the wedding party enters, they ask for Arturo, then learn, largely from Riccardo, that he has fled with Enrichetta. Pursuit is organised. Becoming increasingly distraught, Elvira believes that she sees Arturo: (Aria; then ensemble: &quot;Oh, vieni al tempio, fedele Arturo&quot; / &quot;Ah! come, ah! come! Oh! come to the church, faithful Arturo&quot;.) It is increasingly clear that she has gone mad.

===Act 2===
&quot;A room in the fortress&quot;

As the ladies and gentlemen of the castle are mournful for Elvira&#x27;s totally downcast state of mind, Giorgio describes her madness: (Aria: &quot;Cinta di fiori&quot; / &quot;Garlanded with flowers and with her lovely hair disheveled, sometimes the beloved maiden wanders about...&quot;) and he describes her flights into madness and her pleas for Arturo to return. Riccardo brings the news that Arturo is now a fugitive who has been condemned to death by Parliament for allowing Enrichetta to escape. Giorgio states that the only hope for Elvira will be a sudden joyous experience. Elvira is heard outside, still deranged but longing for Arturo: &quot;Either give me back hope, let me die&quot; she cries. As she enters, she expresses all her longing in a mad scene: Elvira, aria: &quot;Qui la voce ... Vien, diletto&quot; / &quot;Here his sweet voice called me...and then vanished. Here he swore to be true, here he swore it, and then, cruel man, he fled!&quot;.

Entering, she confronts her uncle and Riccardo, whom she fails to recognise, even in her moments of lucidity. She addresses him as if he were Arturo: (Elvira, cabaletta: &quot;Vien, diletto, è in ciel la luna&quot; / &quot;Come, beloved, the moon is in the sky, Everything is silent, until the dawn breaks in the sky&quot;). The two men encourage Elvira to return to her room.

For Elvira&#x27;s sake, Giorgio encourages Riccardo to help save his rival, advising that he will forever be pursued by their phantoms. Riccardo rejects the request: (Giorgio, then Riccardo, then duet: &quot;Il rival salvar tu déi, / il rival salvar tu puoi&quot; / &quot;You must save your rival, you can save your rival&quot;), but gradually Riccardo comes around to accept that idea. However, he states that if in the following day&#x27;s battle, Arturo appears, he will perish at his hand. The two men now have an agreement: (Finale: Giorgio, then Riccardo, then together: &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; / &quot;Let the battle-cry be: country, victory, victory and honour. Let the trumpets sound, and I shall fight strongly, fearlessly.&quot;

===Act 3===
&quot;A wooded area near the fortress, three months later&quot;

Arturo is still on the run. He is exhausted and has returned seeking Elvira. Suddenly he hears the sounds of singing coming through the woods: (Elvira, aria: &quot;A una fonte afflitto e solo / s&#x27;assideva un trovator&quot; / &quot;A troubadour sat sad and lonely by a fountain&quot;). He calls out, but gets no response and, recalling how the couple used to sing together in the woods, he also sings the troubadour melody until the sound of drumbeats and the shouting of soldiers silences him. He covers himself and hides as a group of soldiers passes, then emerges and decides to continue singing to the same melody: (Arturo, aria: &quot;Corre a valle, corre a monte / l&#x27;esiliato pellegrin&quot; / &quot;Through the valleys, over the mountains, hastens the exiled pilgrim&quot;)

Unseen, Elvira emerges from the trees and stops to listen. She is saddened when the singing stops, and she sorrowfully wonders where Arturo is. Suddenly, he is standing before her and they are reunited in a spirited duet in which they declare that they will always be together after the long months of being apart. Still a little confused, Elvira believes that Arturo has married the woman whom he escorted from the fortress; he assures Elvira that he has always loved her, that the lady who was in great danger was the queen: (Arturo; then Elvira; then together). Having determined that they love each other and that they will always remain together, they enter into an ecstatic duet. (Arturo: &quot;Vieni fra queste braccia&quot; / &quot;Come, come to my arms&quot;; Elvira: &quot;Caro, caro, non ho parole&quot; / &quot;Dearest, dearest, I cannot find the words to express my happiness&quot;; then together).

At the sound of drums being heard, Elvira appears to be returning to a state of madness, fearing that they will again be parted. Then soldiers&#x27; voices are heard close by and Riccardo, Giorgio, and the ladies and gentlemen of the fortress enter announcing Arturo&#x27;s death sentence. With that, she finally comes to her senses.

An ensemble, beginning with Arturo (&quot;Credeasi, misera&quot; / &quot;Unhappy girl, she believed that I had betrayed her&quot;) extends to all assembled, each expressing his or her anguish, with even Riccardo being moved by the plight of the lovers. For this extended piece, Bellini wrote a high F-natural above C5 for Arturo&#x27;s &quot;... crudeli, crudeli! / Ella è tremante, / ella è spirante; / anime perfide, / sorde a pietà!&quot; / &quot;cruel men, cruel men! She is trembling, she is fainting, perfidious souls, deaf to pity!&quot;

The soldiers continue to demand Arturo&#x27;s execution, but the sounds of a herald arriving are heard. He brings letters which are opened by Riccardo and Giorgio. They announce that although the Royalists have been defeated, Oliver Cromwell has pardoned all prisoners. The ensemble expresses its general and its personal joy.

==Music==
Two specific examples of Bellini&#x27;s distinctive musical style appear in this opera.

In act 3, an ensemble (&quot;Credeasi, misera&quot;) develops, during which Bellini writes an in alt F-natural above C5 for Arturo. Most tenors would typically sing a D-flat instead of an F. However some tenors, like Nicolai Gedda, William Matteuzzi, Gregory Kunde, Lawrence Brownlee, Francesco Demuro and Alasdair Kent, did manage to tackle the challenging high F. In the seldom performed Malibran version, it is Elvira (i.e., the soprano) who sings, in a higher octave, the principal part of &quot;Credeasi, misera&quot;.

In regard to the impact of the act 2 finale number and its significance in librettist Carlo Pepoli&#x27;s work as well as in Bellini&#x27;s music so far, Mary Ann Smart provides one explanation for the power of &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; by referring to work of another musicologist, Mark Everist, who, she states &quot;has plausibly suggested that the frenzy was provoked more by the buzzing energy of the two bass voices combined, an unprecedented sonority at the time, than by the duet’s political message&quot;.

But, she continues to analyse other aspects of the duet:
We should also factor in the force of Pepoli&#x27;s verses with their promotion of martyrdom and the utter regularity of the music&#x27;s march-like phrasing, rare in Bellini&#x27;s ethereal style. &quot;Suoni la tromba&quot; is a perplexing historical anomaly: an almost isolated example of an extroverted, overtly political statement heard at the Théâtre-Italien, and an equally rare link between Pepoli&#x27;s political persona and his role as poet-for-hire. But such overt calls for revolution represent just one possible &#x27;political&#x27; style. They are not necessarily the most forceful or influential variety of intervention.

==Recordings==
==Cultural references==
&quot;I puritani&quot;, to which she referred as &quot;dear Puritani&quot;, was Queen Victoria&#x27;s favourite opera and the first which she attended in the company of Prince Albert before their marriage. The 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; includes an episode in which Albert and Victoria discuss the opera, as well as a scene showing Victoria attending a performance.

In the film &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, the cast of &quot;I puritani&quot; are being transported on Fitzcarraldo&#x27;s boat. They perform parts of the opera in full costume and sing &quot;A te, o cara&quot; (from act 1, scene 3) as Fitzcarraldo makes his triumphal return to Iquitos.

<text>Year 336 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Duillius (or, less frequently, year 418 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 336 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

===By place===
====Achaemenid Empire====
* The young king of Persia, Arses, objects to being controlled by Bagoas and attempts to poison him. Instead, Arses and all his children are killed by Bagoas.
* Bagoas then seeks to install a new monarch who will be easier to control. He chooses Codomannus, a distant relative of the royal house, who takes the name Darius III. When Darius tries to assert his independence from Bagoas&#x27; control, Bagoas attempts to poison him, but the king is warned and forces Bagoas to drink the poison himself.

==== Macedonia ====
* Following Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s marriage to Eurydice, Alexander and his mother, Olympias, flee to Epirus, with Alexander later moving to Illyria. However, shortly afterward, father and son are reconciled and Alexander returns; but his position as heir is tenuous.
* Macedonian troops, commanded by Parmenion, trusted lieutenant of Philip II, arrive in Asia Minor, but are driven back by Persian forces under the command of the Greek mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.
* At a grand celebration of his daughter Cleopatra&#x27;s marriage to Alexander I of Epirus (brother of Olympias), Philip II is assassinated at Aegae by Pausanias of Orestis, a young Macedonian bodyguard with a bitter grievance against the young queen&#x27;s uncle Attalus and against Philip for denying him justice. Pausanias is killed on the spot.
* Following his assassination, Philip II of Macedon is succeeded by his son Alexander III. Suspecting the princes of the Lynkestis region of killing Phillip II, Alexander executes them all. The League of Corinth promotes Alexander to general of a unified Greek army for its planned invasion of Asia Minor.
* Alexander immediately has Amyntas IV, son of King Perdiccas III and his cousin, executed.
* Alexander puts down a rebellion in Macedonia and crushes the rebellious Illyrians. He then appears at the gates of Thebes and receives the city&#x27;s submission. After that he advances to the Corinthian isthmus and is elected by the assembled Greeks as their commander against Persia.
* Conscription is introduced in Athens. Young men are required to perform duties which are part military and part civic.
* Aeschines brings a suit against Ctesiphon for illegally proposing the award of a crown to the Athenian leader Demosthenes in recognition of his services to Athens.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="63679" wikidata="Q193468" url="?curid=63679" title="Van">
<text>A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. There is some variation in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, microvans, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities. Mini MPVs, compact MPVs, and MPVs are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.

==Word origin and usage==
Van meaning a type of vehicle arose as a contraction of the word caravan. The earliest records of a van as a vehicle in English are in the mid-19th century, meaning a covered wagon for transporting goods; the earliest reported record of such was in 1829. The word caravan with the same meaning has been used since the 1670s. A caravan, meaning one wagon, had arisen as an extension, or corruption, of a caravan meaning a convoy of multiple wagons.

The word &quot;van&quot; has slightly different, but overlapping, meanings in different forms of English. While the word now applies everywhere to boxy cargo vans, other applications are found to a greater or lesser extent in different English-speaking countries; some examples follow:

===Australia===
In Australian English, the term &quot;van&quot; is commonly used to describe a minivan, a passenger minibus, or an Australian panel van as manufactured by companies such as Holden and Ford at various times.

A full-size van used for commercial purposes is also known as a &quot;van&quot; in Australia; however, a passenger vehicle with more than seven or eight seats is more likely to be called a &quot;minibus&quot;.

The term &quot;van&quot; can also sometimes be used interchangeably with what Australians usually call a &quot;caravan&quot;, which in the U.S. is referred to as a &quot;travel trailer&quot;.

The British term &quot;people mover&quot; is also used in Australian English to describe a passenger van. The American usage of &quot;van&quot; which describes a cargo box trailer or semi-trailer is used rarely, if ever, in Australia.

===India===
In India, the van is one of the most common modes of transportation and is often used for taking children to and from schools, usually when parents, especially working parents, are too busy to pick their children up from school or when school buses are full and unable to accommodate other children. Vans are also used for commercial purposes and office cabs. Some of the popular vans include Maruti Suzuki Omni and the Maruti Suzuki Eeco.

===Japan===
Early Japanese vans include the Kurogane Baby, Mazda Bongo, and the Toyota LiteAce. The Japanese also produced many vans based on the American flat nose model, but also minivans which for the American market have generally evolved to the long-wheelbase front-wheel drive form. The Nissan Prairie and Mitsubishi Chariot as well as microvans that fulfill kei car regulations, are popular for small businesses. The term is also used to describe full-fledged station wagons (passenger car front sheet metal, flat-folding back seats, windows all around) and even hatchbacks with basic trim packages intended for commercial use. These are referred to as &quot;light vans&quot; (), with &quot;light&quot; referring to the glazing rather than the weight of the vehicle.

===United Kingdom===
In British English, the word van refers to vehicles that carry goods only, either on roads or on rails. What would be called a &quot;minivan&quot; in American English is called a &quot;people-carrier&quot;, &quot;MPV&quot; or multi-purpose vehicle, and larger passenger vehicles are called &quot;minibuses&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper introduced the idea of the &quot;White Van Man&quot;, a typical working-class man or small business owner who would have a white Ford Transit, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, or similar panel van. Today the phrase &quot;man and van&quot; or &quot;man with a van&quot; refers to light removal firms normally operated by a sole business owner transporting anything from the contents of a whole house to just a few boxes. The word &quot;van&quot; also refers to railway covered goods wagons, called &quot;boxcars&quot; in the United States.

===United States===

In the United States, a &quot;van&quot; can also refer to a box-shaped trailer or semi-trailer used to carry goods. In this case, there is a differentiation between a &quot;dry van&quot;, used to carry most goods, and a refrigerated van, or &quot;reefer&quot;, used for cold goods. A railway car used to carry baggage is also called a &quot;van&quot;.

A vehicle referred to in the US as a &quot;full-size van&quot; is usually a large, boxy vehicle that has a platform and powertrain similar to their light truck counterparts. These vans may be sold with the space behind the front seats empty for transporting goods (cargo van), furnished for passenger use by either the manufacturer (wagon), or another company for more personal comforts (conversion van). Full-size vans often have short hoods, with the engine placed under the passenger cabin.

A cutaway van chassis is a variation of the full-size van that was developed for use by second stage manufacturers. Such a unit has a van front end and driver controls in a cab body that extends to a point behind the front seats, where the rest of the van body is cut off (leading to the terminology &quot;cutaway&quot;). From that point aft, only the chassis frame rails and running gear extend to the rear when the unit is shipped as an &quot;incomplete vehicle&quot;. A second-stage manufacturer, commonly known as a bodybuilder, will complete the vehicle for uses such as recreational vehicles, small school buses, minibusses, type III ambulances, and delivery trucks. A large proportion of cutaway van chassis are equipped with dual rear wheels. Second-stage manufacturers sometimes add third weight-bearing single wheel &quot;tag axles&quot; for their larger minibus models.

The term &quot;van&quot; in the US may also refer to a minivan. Minivans are usually distinguished by their smaller size and front wheel drive powertrain, although some are equipped with four-wheel drive. Minivans typically offer seven- or eight-passenger seating capacity, and better fuel economy than full-sized vans, at the expense of power, cargo space, and towing capacity. Minivans are often equipped with sliding doors.

==History==
The precursor to American vans would be the sedan deliveries of the 1930s to late-1950s. The first generation of American vans were the 1960s compact vans, which were patterned in size after the Volkswagen Bus. The Corvair-based entry even imitated the rear-mounted, air-cooled engine design. The Ford Falcon-based first-generation Econoline had a flat nose, with the engine mounted between and behind the front seats. The Dodge A100 had a similar layout and could accommodate a V8 engine. Chevrolet also switched to this layout. The Ford, Dodge, and Corvair vans were also produced as pickup trucks.

The &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;full size&quot; vans appeared with Ford&#x27;s innovation of moving the engine forward under a short hood and using pickup truck components. The engine cockpit housing is often called a &quot;dog house&quot;. Over time, they evolved longer noses and sleeker shapes. The Dodge Sportsman was available with an extension to the rear of its long-wheelbase model to create a 15-passenger van. Vehicles have been sold as both cargo and passenger models, as well as in cutaway van chassis versions for second stage manufacturers to make box vans, ambulances, campers, and other vehicles. Second-stage manufacturers also modify the original manufacturer&#x27;s body to create custom vans.

==Use==
In urban areas of the United States, full-size vans have been used as &quot;commuter vans&quot; since 1971, when Dodge introduced a van that could transport up to 15 passengers. Commuter vans are used as an alternative to carpooling and other ride-sharing arrangements.

Many mobile businesses use a van to carry almost their entire business to various places where they work. For example, those who come to homes or places of business to perform various services, installations, or repairs. Vans are also used to shuttle people and their luggage between hotels and airports, to transport commuters between parking lots and their places of work, and along established routes as minibusses. Vans are also used to transport elderly and mobility-impaired worshipers to and from church services or to transport youth groups for outings to amusement parks, picnics, and visiting other churches. Vans are also used by schools to drive sports teams to intramural games. Vans have been used by touring music groups to haul equipment and people to music venues around the country.

=== Full-size van ===
&quot;Full-size van&quot; is a marketing term used in North America for a van larger than a minivan, that is characterized by a large, boxy appearance, a short hood, and heavy cargo and passenger-hauling capability. 

The first full-size van was the 1969 Ford Econoline, which used components from the Ford F-Series pickups. General Motors and the Dodge Ram Van followed with designs with the engines placed further forward, and succeeding generations of the Econoline introduced longer hoods.

===Step van===

Another type of van specific to North America is the &quot;step van,&quot; named because of the design to facilitate users to step in and out of the vehicle. Widely used by delivery services, courier companies, and the parcel division of the US Postal Service and Canada Post, they are often seen driven with the door open. Step vans have more boxy shapes, wider bodies, and higher rooftops than other vans, and are rarely employed for carrying passengers. 

===Minivan===
The Minivan is a van which is smaller in size in length and height than a full-size van. Minivans are often used for personal use, as well as commercial passenger operations such as taxis and shuttles, and cargo operations like delivery of mail and packages. They offer more cargo space than traditional sedans and SUVs. Their lower center of gravity is also useful in handling and rollover prevention.

===Rollover safety===
A van is taller than a typical passenger car, resulting in a higher center of gravity. The suspension is also higher to accommodate the weight of 15 passengers, who can weigh over one ton alone. In the United States, it is common for only the front seat passengers to use their safety belts. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined that belted passengers are about four times more likely to survive in rollover crashes.

Safety can be improved by understanding the unique characteristics of 12- and 15-passenger vans and by following guidelines developed for their drivers, according to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

===Safety equipment===
Many commercial vans are fitted with cargo barriers behind the front seats (or rear seats, if fitted) to prevent injuries caused by unsecured cargo in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a rollover. Cargo barriers in vans are sometimes fitted with doors permitting the driver to pass through to the cargo compartment of the vehicle.

<text>Scottish country dance (SCD) is the distinctively Scottish form of country dance, itself a form of social dance involving groups of couples of dancers tracing progressive patterns. A dance consists of a sequence of figures. These dances are set to musical forms (Jigs, Reels and Strathspey Reels) which come from the Gaelic tradition of Highland Scotland, as do the steps used in performing the dances. Traditionally a figure corresponds to an eight-bar phrase of music.

Country dancing, which is arguably a type of folk dancing, first appears in the historical record in 17th-century England. Scottish country dancing as we know it today has its roots in an 18th-century fusion of (English) country dance formations with Highland music and footwork. It has become the national ballroom dance form of Scotland, partly because &quot;Caledonian Country Dances&quot; became popular in upper-class London society in the decades after the Jacobite rising of 1745. As early as 1724 there was a published collection of Scottish dance tunes by John and William Neal &quot;A collection of the Most celebrated Scotch Tunes&quot;. 

When it first became popular around the 18th century, it was as a shorter, quicker form of dance that was a light relief from the more courtly dances normally danced. Derived from early British forms of country dancing, SCD is related to English country dancing, contra dancing, Cèilidh dancing, Old time dancing and Irish set dancing (although most people in Scotland use the terms &#x27;cèilidh dancing&#x27; or &#x27;country dancing&#x27; interchangeably, with &#x27;country dancing&#x27; often being taught in schools and later used at &#x27;cèilidh&#x27; events). This is due to the combination of some of these dance forms in early country dance forms and later cross-over introduced by their overlapping influences via dancers and dance masters.

Scottish country dancing (a social form of dance with two or more couples of dancers) should not be confused with Scottish Highland dance (a solo form of dance). There is a certain amount of cross-over, in that there are Scottish country dances that include Highland elements as well as Highland-style performance dances which use formations otherwise seen in country dances, but these are relatively few when the two dance forms are considered each as a whole.

==Dances==
===General===

Scottish country dances are categorised as reels (including hornpipes), jigs, and strathspeys according to the type of music to which they are danced. The first two types (also called &quot;quick-time dances&quot;) feature fast tempos, quick movements and a lively feel. The third type (strathspey) has a much slower tempo and a more tempered, stately feel. Although general guidelines are given below almost all elements of SCD have exceptions through the playfulness of the dance writers to the wide variety of influences and interpretations over the years; some exceptions include the Eightsome Reel (has two parts repeated as ABBBBBBBBA and is thus considerably longer than most other dances), The Wee Cooper of Fife (ten bar phrases—with music to match), The Willowtree (often only repeated four times despite having eight couples because the dance is mirrored from both ends of the set).

===Dancers and sets===
Scottish country dancing is generally danced in organised formations referred to as &quot;sets&quot;. Sets consist of three or more couples, usually four but sometimes as many as eight. A couple is formed of two dancers referred to as the &quot;man&quot; and the &quot;lady&quot;; however, this is rarely restricted to the dancer&#x27;s actual gender. Due to the much larger number of women dancing SCD compared to men, women often dance &quot;as the man&quot; (often the more experienced woman will dance as the man or, all else being equal, the taller woman will dance as the man as some figures are easier this way). 

The usual set shape is &quot;longwise&quot; – each dancer opposite their partner with all the women in one line facing a similar line of men. The couple closest to the band (or other music source) are called the &quot;first&quot; or &quot;top&quot; couple. Other shapes of sets include triangular sets (three couples on the sides of a triangle, this is rare), square sets (four couples on the sides of a square) or square sets with extra couple(s) in the centre; these are much less common. However, some of the most popular dances in Scotland use these formations. When the set is not longwise, then the dancers stand beside their partner, with the woman on the right.

===Phrasing and formations===
Scottish country dances are made up of figures of varying length to suit the phrasing of Scottish country dance tunes. For the most part figures are 2, 4, or 8 bars of music long. There are various kinds of figures ranging from the very simple (e.g. a couple changing places across the set giving right hands) to fairly intricate convolutions involving three or four couples at the same time (e.g. three-couple rights and lefts). Dances are generally made up of eight bar phrases with a single &quot;time through&quot; lasting between 24 and 64 bars and repeated as many times as there are couples in the set. Some dances are only performed a single time through however these normally last between 96 and 160 bars (e.g. Bonnie Anne, MacDonald of Sleat).

Dances are described by their music type, length and number of repetitions. A strathspey which has a &quot;time through&quot; of 32 bars and is danced 8 times will be described as &quot;an eight by thirty-two Strathspey&quot;, the written form will often be shortened to 8x32 S to fit on a dance card or programme.

===Steps and technique===
Unlike Cèilidh dancing or English country dancing, which are usually done using walking or running steps, Scottish country dancing uses different steps according to a dance&#x27;s choreography. &quot;Travelling steps&quot; include the &quot;skip-change of step&quot; in quick-time dances and the &quot;Strathspey travelling step&quot; in strathspey time, while &quot;setting steps&quot; include the &quot;pas de basque&quot; in quick time and the &quot;common schottische&quot;/&quot;Strathspey setting step&quot; in strathspey time. Some dances also involve setting steps from Highland dancing, such as the &quot;rocking step&quot;, &quot;high cuts&quot;, or &quot;Highland schottische&quot;. In quick time, there is also the &quot;slip step&quot; for quick sideways movement, e.g. in circles.

In SCD classes there is often a certain focus on &quot;correct technique&quot;, this applies especially to footwork and the positions of the feet at various points during the steps. Well-executed steps improve the look of a dance greatly, however their mastery involves quite some time and dedication and also a certain level of physical fitness. This does not mean a segregation of dancers is necessary, though segregation can emerge due to the social nature of the dance. In many places the main object of SCD is having fun, with or without the requirement for good footwork, in other places there is a preference for only those dancers with better footwork to join the dance. This is most prevalent in demonstration level classes and performances where the goal is to impress the audience.

A much more important aspect of good SCD technique is for a dancer to ensure that they are at the proper location at the proper time. This is important because the figures often require many of the participants to be correctly positioned; it is difficult for the whole set to achieve the dance if some dancers are mislocated. &quot;Phrasing&quot; is the execution of figures appropriately timed to the music. &quot;Covering&quot;, another common term, calls for moving dancers to progress in unison; this briefly forms lines, squares etc. which are clearly visible to the audience watching a dance (and often to the dancers themselves). Many SCD groups like putting on demonstrations to display the best dancing ability of the group.

Principally SCD is a social dance and very much a team effort. Interaction with a partner and the other dancers (e.g. smiling, verbal cues, giving hands, encouragement) is an essential part of SCD. The importance of couples within this framework, the practice for correcting mistakes, the acceptance of embellishments, and the tolerance for differing choreography varies by SCD community and occasion. These differences are largely viewed as generating a healthy dialogue between communities.

===Progression===
Most Scottish country dances are &quot;progressive&quot;, i.e., after one repetition of the figure sequence the couples end up in a different place in the set. This serves to let every couple have a go as &quot;top couple&quot; (normally the active couple), and the number of repetitions is adjusted accordingly. For example, in a four-couple dance the order of couples at the beginning of each turn could be 1234, 2341, 3412, 4123, 1234 at which point the dance would stop. The most common arrangements are dances involving two or three couples dancing in four-couple sets for eight repetitions – this means that during some times through couples may be &quot;standing out&quot; to watch and have a rest. For example, the order of couples in a three-couple dance would be 1234 (top three couples dancing), 2134 (bottom three couples dancing), 2341 (top three couples dancing) etc. eight times through. There are also &quot;set dances&quot; which go through only once that often consist of a sequence of non-repeating figures that last much longer than normal times through (e.g. Bonnie Anne (96 bars), MacDonald of Sleat (128 bars)).

In fact, the figures and arrangement of modern Scottish country dances, while derived from a 300-year tradition, make it difficult to generalise. Many newer dances feature new ideas such as partner changes (you dance with a new partner on each new time through the dance, as in &quot;Nighean Donn&quot; (by Peter Hastings) or &quot;Caddam Wood&quot; (by John Mitchell)), palindromic structure (the sequence of figures is similar seen from the end to the beginning as it is seen from the beginning to the end, as in &quot;The White Heather Jig&quot; by Cosh), fugues (the sequence of figures for each couple is intricately intertwined to resemble the structure of a musical fugue), canons (a new couple begins their time through even though the couple before have not finished theirs yet) and others, such as John Drewry&#x27;s &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;, where the bottom of the set becomes the top for the next time through. Dance devisers seem to enjoy blending new ideas with the traditional though the results vary in popularity.

==History==
===Modern===
During the early 20th century, SCD still had a part in social entertainment especially in rural Scotland, even though the number of dances within the active repertoire was quite small. Scottish country dancing was in danger of dying out when, in 1923, the Scottish Country Dance Society (SCDS) was founded in Glasgow with the goal of preserving &quot;country dances &quot;as danced in Scotland&quot;&quot; (this was only recently changed to read &quot;Scottish country dances&quot;). The SCDS began to collect and publish the dances in the active repertoire as well as reconstruct (or reinterpret) from old sources dances that were no longer being danced. In the process, the dances and technique, which might differ considerably depending on where in Scotland a dance was collected, were strictly standardised. This compromised the strict historical preservation, but paved the way for universal &quot;compatibility&quot; among dancers from (eventually) all over the world. The efforts of the SCDS became quite popular, and its influence on the training of physical education teachers meant that most Scottish children learn at least a minimum of SCD during school. The Society achieved Royal patronage in 1947 and became known as the RSCDS (Royal Scottish Country Dance Society).

Fairly soon after the inception of the SCDS people started inventing new dances in the spirit of the older ones but also introducing new figures not part of the collected canon. Today there are over 11,000 dances catalogued, of which fewer than 1,000 can be considered &quot;traditional&quot;. Many dances are only known regionally, though the most popular in a &quot;traditional&quot; vein are published by the RSCDS. The RSCDS does hold significant influence since they teach the majority of Scottish country dance teachers, administrate the official SCD teaching exam, run the largest number of internally publicised events, and have published the largest number of dances. The RSCDS publications encompass a large part of the repertoire of most dancers.

Modern SCD has evolved considerably from the early 18th century, with the constant devising of new dances, new concepts, informal variations and entirely new ideas appearing. As a pursuit, Scottish country dancing is no longer confined to Scotland. Active communities can be found throughout the world – in the rest of Britain, continental Europe, Canada, and the US as well as Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with occasional groups in places as diverse as Russia, South Africa, Argentina, and Hong Kong.

Gay and lesbian Scottish country dancing groups, first being organised in London and now in Manchester and Edinburgh aptly named The Gay Gordons offer same-sex Scottish country dancing. The London group has adopted the use of the terms &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;follower&quot; instead of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;lady&quot; (terms borrowed from swing dance).

Scottish country dancing is now recognised as a valuable activity for maintaining health and fitness. Researchers at the University of Strathclyde in August 2010 made a study of seventy women between the ages of 60 and 85 years; half were Scottish country dancers and the remainder participated in other physical activities such as swimming, walking, golf and keep fit classes. The women were assessed on their strength, stamina, flexibility and balance. They all compared favourably with average fitness levels for women in their age range, but the Scottish country dancers were shown to have more agility, stronger legs and to be able to walk more briskly than people who took part in other forms of exercise.

In Scotland, SCD is very common at both urban and rural ceilidh events. These are often informal, energetic, noisy events and the dancing is unrefined – also being aimed at beginners or at least those with very limited skills. Ceilidh dance events may present only a very small set of well known dances (particularly in urban settings). In these situations, there may be few other traditionally &#x27;Scottish&#x27; or Gaelic features beyond the music and dance. (In some communities, SCD and other, the &#x27;ceilidh&#x27; is not a dance party, but more of a &#x27;talent show&#x27; or &#x27;slam&#x27; where guests may present poems, songs, or skits for the enjoyment of all.)

<text>Jaén () is a municipality of Spain and the capital of the province of Jaén, in the autonomous community of Andalusia.

The city of Jaén is the administrative and industrial centre for the province. Industrial establishments in the city include chemical works, tanneries, distilleries, cookie factories, textile factories, as well as agricultural and olive oil processing machinery industry.

The layout of Jaén is determined by its position on the foothills of the Cerro de Santa Catalina, with steep, narrow streets, in the historic core.

Its population is 112,757 (2020), about one-sixth of the population of the province. Recently Jaén has had a great increase in cultural tourism, having received 604,523 tourists along the year 2015, 10% more than in 2014.

== Etymology ==
The name is most likely derived from the Roman name &quot;Villa Gaiena&quot; (Villa of Gaius). It was called Jayyān during the time of Al-Andalus.

The inhabitants of the city are known as &quot;Jienenses&quot;.

==History==
The area was populated since ancient times, with remains of city walls in the site in the north of the city reportedly dating back in time to the Chalcolithic, roughly four millennia ago.

Known by Roman sources as &quot;Aurgi&quot; (), similar names such as , , are also identified as referring to the same place. The city was seized by Scipio Africanus away from Carthage by 207 BC, in the context of the Second Punic War. Following the Roman conquest, as former allies of the Punics, the city had the status of (required to pay tribute and under military rule), probably enduring harsh conditions in this period. During the Roman Empire, in the time of the Flavian dynasty, &quot;Aurgi&quot; became a &quot;municipium&quot;, .

Following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the name of &quot;Ŷaīyyān&quot; (of unclear origin) was mentioned in Hispano-Arab sources already in the 8th century. Close to Córdoba, the city became the head of an important in the emiral/caliphal period of Al-Andalus, extending across a territory with some similarities to the current province. During the turbulent 11th century, in the context of the Fitna of al-Andalus, the wider &quot;kūra&quot; was territory in dispute between the most powerful neighbouring taifas, such as Córdoba, Granada or Toledo, splitting up its territory. Jaén was conquered by Habbus al-Muzaffar, leader of the Zirid Taifa of Granada. Decades after the final demise of the caliphate of Córdoba, Jaén was conquered by the Almoravids in 1091.

Taken in 1159 by Ibn Mardanīš (the &quot;Rey Lobo&quot;, ruler of Valencia opposed to the spread of the Almohad Empire), his collaborator (and father-in-law) Ibn Hamušk surrendered and yielded Jaén to the almohads in 1169.

In 1225, Ferdinand III of Castile unsuccessfully laid siege to the city (defended by strong walls built during the Almoravid period) with help from , ruler of the Taifa of Baeza, that had just become a vassal state of the Kingdom of Castile. The city was besieged again in 1230 by Ferdinand, who lifted the siege after the news of the death of his father, Alfonso IX of León. Depleted from its defences and surrounding fields, the city was surrendered by Muhammad I of Granada to Ferdinand III on 28 February 1246. Also in 1246, the city was granted a &quot;fuero&quot; (charter) similar to that of Toledo, becoming in turn the model for the fueros granted to Jódar (1272), Arjona (1284), Alcalá la Real (1341) and Priego (1341). Following the conquest, by 1248–49, the Diocese of Baeza was moved to Jaén.

For the rest of the Middle Ages, the &quot;concejo&quot; or of Jaén controlled a land that ranged from 1000 to 1600 km2, roughly delimited by the Guadalquivir to the North, the Arroyovil to the East, the Arroyo Salado de los Villares to the West, and the Sierra Sur de Jaén and Sierra Mágina mountain ranges to the South. Despite nominally featuring as the head of the Kingdom of Jaén since the conquest, the importance of Jaén within the demarcation was balanced by those of the cities of Baeza and Úbeda. It only began to stand out in relation to its growing strategic importance closer to the border with the Kingdom of Granada, consolidating its military and administrative functions. Unlike those cities, that developed an important textile craftmanship activity, Jaén&#x27;s economic activity remained nonetheless largely agricultural well entered the Early Modern period.

==Intitulation==
The intitulation of the city is: (Spanish) &quot;La Muy Noble y muy Leal Ciudad de Jaén, Guarda y Defendimiento de los Reynos de Castilla&quot;, (English) &quot;The Very Noble and very Loyal City of Jaén, Guard and Defense of the Kingdoms of Castile,&quot; a title that was given to the city by King Enrique II of Castile to the city of Jaén, due to the privileges that the city had, and to the role that the city was playing in the defense of the Kingdom of Castile against the Arabs.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
The city lies at the feet of the Sierra de , one of the subranges of the Subbaetic System, the inner system of the Baetic Mountains which leaves the Guadalquivir Valley to the North. The surroundings of the city are rich in small Mesozoic karstic aquifers. The flows close to the city. Jaén is roughly the antipode of Tauranga, New Zealand.

=== Climate ===
Jaén has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), closely bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with dry, hot summers and mild, moderately wet winters. Jaén has a July high of , and mean low of with a mean temperature of . This is just shy of the daily mean of Seville that has the hottest daily summer mean during summers in Western Europe with . Despite its very inland location at an altitude around Jaén barely gets 1 snowy day and just 3 days with lows under on average during winters. Jaén gets around 2800-3000 sunshine hours on average.

==Culture==
===Landmarks===

&quot;Saint Catherine&#x27;s Castle&quot; (Castillo de Santa Catalina) sits on the top of a hill overlooking the city. Previously there had existed a fortress of Arabic origin (Abrehui&#x27;s castle), of which some remains still exist. The current construction is of Christian origin, raised after the conquest of the city by Ferdinand III of Castile, called the Saint, in 1246.

Jaén Cathedral is one of the most important Renaissance-style cathedrals. Construction began in 1570 and was completed in 1802. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin, and it was built to shelter the relic of the Holy Face, or Veil of Veronica, lodged at the major chapel and exposed to the public every Friday. Due to the length of time in its construction, different artistic styles can be appreciated, the most prominent being Renaissance; Andrés de Vandelvira the most important architect. He is the greatest exponent of the Andalusian Renaissance. It aspires to be listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The Arab Baths (&quot;Baños Arabes&quot;) in Jaén are among the largest Islamic bathhouses preserved in Spain. They can be visited under (another important landmark in the city). These Arab baths had the function in their origins of purifying all the visitors who entered the city of Jaén. However, nowadays they are not in use, being a great tourist and historical attraction.

Other important landmarks are the &quot;Museum of Arts and Popular Customs&quot;, the &quot;International Museum of Naïf Art&quot;, &quot;San Andrés&#x27;s Chapel&quot;, the &quot;Provincial Museum of Jaén&quot; (which shelters an important collection of archaeological Iberian remains), &quot;Saint Ildefonso&#x27;s church&quot;, &quot;La Magdalena&quot; church, etc.

===Music===
The most important event is the International Piano Competition Premio Jaén (in Spanish: Concurso Internacional de Piano Premio Jaén) that is the oldest and most important piano competition in Spain. It started in 1953 with Pablo Castillo García-Negrete, an architect who began to donate the first cash prizes of only some thousands of pesetas. Nowadays the prize consist of €57,000 and the recording of classical music albums in professional studios. The last winner of this significant competition was the Chinese pianist Yin Yu Qin, in 2008, in the fiftieth competition.

There are other events such as the Ciclos de Rock and the Lagarto Rock Festival.

===Language===
The language spoken in Jaén is the official language of Spain, Spanish. The variety of Spanish spoken in this province displays some of the characteristics of Andalusian speech, such as dropping of final -s in plural formation: &quot;gafa&quot; for gafas (and consequent final vowel opening) in the word &quot;glasses&quot;, or dropping of /d/ in intervocalic position in regular participles of verbs: e.g. &quot;acabao&quot; for &quot;acabado&quot;. Some of these variants can be consulted in the &quot;Diccionario de Vocabulario Andaluz&quot; compiled by the local lexicographer Alcalá Venceslada, which was reprinted by the University of Jaén some years ago. This dictionary also compiles some other variants of Andalusian present in other parts of the autonomous community.

There are different expressions typical of the area, namely the interjection &quot;¡ea!&quot; (also present in other dialectal variants) which has no particular exact meaning or &quot;¡lavística!&quot; /la&#x27;vistika/, which is believed to be a contraction of the expression &quot;la Vírgen de Tíscar&quot;, a popular virgin of the province, although there are no exact data to confirm the origin of the last expression which is, nevertheless, widespread among speakers of the province.

<doc id="63685" wikidata="Q83061" url="?curid=63685" title="Van, Turkey">
<text>Van (; ; ) is a city in eastern Turkey&#x27;s Van Province, on the eastern shore of Lake Van. It is the capital and largest city of Van Province.

Van has a long history as a major urban area. It has been a large city since the first millennium BCE, initially as Tushpa, the capital of the kingdom of Urartu from the 9th century BCE to the 6th century BCE, and later as the center of the Armenian kingdom of Vaspurakan. Turkic presence in Van and in the rest of Anatolia started as a result of Seljuk victory at the Battle of Malazgirt (1071) against the Byzantine Empire.

Van was densely populated by Armenians until the Armenian genocide in the 1910s. Today, it is mostly inhabited by Kurds.

==History==

Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in Van Province indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BCE. The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of Van Castle, is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

===Urartu===

Under the ancient name of &quot;Tushpa&quot;, Van was the capital of the Urartian kingdom in the 9th century BCE. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as Van Castle (&quot;Van Kalesi&quot;), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Urartian cuneiform inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE have been found here. The name &#x27;Van&#x27; comes from the Urartian endonym &quot;Biaina&quot;.

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the Orontids in the 7th century BCE and quickly later the Persians in the mid 6th century BCE. Van Fortress, located outside Van city center, holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of Xerxes the Great from the 5th century BCE upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) Old Persian, Babylonian, and Elamite. In 331 BCE, Van was conquered by Alexander the Great and after his death became part of the Seleucid Empire. By the early 2nd century BCE it was part of the Kingdom of Armenia. It became an important center during the reign of the Armenian king, Tigranes II, who founded the city of Tigranakert in the 1st century BCE. In the early centuries BCE, it fell to the emerging Arsacid dynasty of Parthia until the 3rd century CE. However, it also fell once to the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia in this timespan. In the &quot;History of Armenia&quot; attributed to Movses Khorenatsi, the city is called &quot;Tosp&quot;, from Urartian &quot;Tushpa&quot;.

===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===
Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the Sassanian Empire, the town fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years-long Roman-Persian Wars, some of the wars were waged at and around the location of modern-day Van. The Byzantine Empire briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of Arminiya. Decline in Arab power eventually allowed local Armenian rulers to re-emerge, with the Artsruni dynasty soon becoming the most powerful. Initially dependent on the rulers of the Kingdom of Ani, they declared their independence in 908, founding the Armenian Kingdom of Vaspurakan. The kingdom had no specific capital: the court would move as the king transferred his residence from place to place, such as Van city, Vostan, Aghtamar, etc. In 1021 the last king of Vaspurakan, John-Senekerim Artsruni, ceded his entire kingdom to the Byzantine empire, who established the Vaspurakan theme on the former Artsruni territories. Van was called Eua or Eva () during Byzantine rule.

===Seljuk Empire and Rum===
Incursions by the Seljuk Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the battle of Manzikert the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the Ahlatshahs and the Kurdish Ayyubids (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate until the 1240s when it was conquered by the Mongols. In the 14th century, Van was held by the Timurids, followed subsequently by the Turkoman Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===


The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the Ottoman Empire and the neighboring Persian Safavid Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic Battle of Chaldiran and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town was confirmed in the 1555 Peace of Amasya which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a sanjak dependent on the Erzurum eyalet, and later into a separate Van eyalet in about 1570. In 1604, the Safavids under king Abbas the Great recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the Treaty of Zuhab.

During the early 1900s, the city of Van had eleven Armenian schools and ten Turkish schools. Towards the second half of the 19th century Van began to play an increased role in the politics of the Ottoman Empire due to its location near the borders of the Persian, Russian and Ottoman Empire, as well as its proximity to Mosul. During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.

====Ottoman Era demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it has been estimated that it had around 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman census, the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians. The Ottoman census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children, and according to more recent research, an estimate for Van province (including women and children) is that it had 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including Assyrians.

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point also given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority. In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including Syriac Christians) and 95,100 Muslims. The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were Kurds, 32.70% were Armenians and 5.53% were Turks. On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van, 18,000 Assyrians, 72,000 Kurds, 47,000 Turks, 25,000 Yezidis, 5,000 Zazas and 3,000 Gypsies. Both sides have been accused of over-counting the numbers at the time given the Armenian genocide and population statistics became important during the Berlin Conference.

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878===
During this war the Kurdish Sheikh Jelaludin led thousands of soldiers to massacre Armenians of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages. These events are described in &quot;Armenia and the Campaign of 1877&quot; by British war correspondent Charles B. Norman and in the fictional novella &quot;Jalaleddin&quot; by the Armenian novelist Raffi in very similar terms.

===World War I and Armenian genocide===
The Armenian genocide in Van Province started in late 1914 with attacks by the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Special Organization and affiliated paramilitaries. The regional Albanian administrator, Djevdet Bey, was reported to have said that &quot;We have cleansed the Armenians and Syriac Christians from Azarbaijan, and we will do the same in Van&quot;. Numerous reports from Ottoman officials, such as a parliament deputy, the governor of Aleppo as well as the German consul in Van, suggested that deliberate provocations against the Armenians were being orchestrated by the local government. In mid-April 1915, Cevdet Bey ordered the execution of four Armenian leaders, and he demanded that all Armenian males of military age gather before him, which drove the Armenians to take up arms in self-defense. On the other hand, historian and sociologist Taner Akçam acknowledges that in the case of Van, the deportations may have been driven by military necessity and states the resistance in Van should be examined as a separate case.
In April 1915, as slaughter was being inflicted upon the rural populations surrounding Van, the Armenian residents of the city launched a rebellion hoping to avoid the same fate, defending themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks. The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915 and local Armenians gave the keys of the city to Russian general Nikolai Yudenich on May 21. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army again. According to Taner Akçam, citing the &quot;Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920&quot; (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed the Armenian population in the city. Clarence Ussher, an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed. The end of World War I forced the Ottoman army to surrender its claim to Van.

===Turkish War of Independence and Republic===

In the Treaty of Sèvres, the Entente Powers decided to cede the city to the First Republic of Armenia. Turkish revolutionaries, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the Turkish War of Independence. However, the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and İsmet İnönü was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and Bitlis. However, the parliament in Ankara rejected any compromise on this issue. By 1920, Van fell under Turkish control again and its remaining Armenian inhabitants were expelled in a final round of ethnic cleansing. With the Treaty of Lausanne and Treaty of Kars, the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and Van remained de facto under Turkish sovereignty.

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as Van Castle (&quot;Van Kalesi&quot;). The city now lies at about above sea level.

== Tourism ==

The main places with tourism potential in Van are Hoşap Castle, Muradiye Fall, Akdamar Island, Van Castle, Lake Turna, Lake Akgöl and Van Museum.

== Politics ==

In the 2019 municipal elections, Bedia Özgökçe Ertan of the HDP party was elected mayor of Van. In August 2019 she was dismissed and subsequently sentenced to 30 years imprisonment accused of supporting terrorism as part of a government crackdown against politicians of the Kurdish HDP party; the Turkish state appointed an unelected state-trustee, Mehmet Emin Bilmez, in her place. Many other Kurdish mayors in other Kurdish cities across the region also suffered a similar fate. Protests against the decision arose which were suppressed by the Turkish police with the use of water cannons; some protestors were killed.

== Demographics ==
At the end of 2022 the population figure for the city of Van was 525,016, but former Mayor Burhan Yengun is quoted as saying it may be as high as 600,000. The former Van Central (&quot;Merkez&quot;) District stretched over 1,938.14 km2, but has subsequently been split into two new districts (İpekyolu and Tuşba). Today, Van has a Kurdish majority and Turkish minority.

== Geography ==
The city of Van is located at the western foot of Mount Erek.
=== Climate ===
Van has a Mediterranean-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsa,&quot; Trewartha&quot;: Dc&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and very warm, dry summers. Precipitation can be observed for the majority of the year, with a slight peak during spring and autumn, and a brief dry summer from July to September.

===Landmarks===

The modern city is located on the plain extending from the Lake Van, at a distance of from the lake shore. Reports have appeared over the years of a certain Lake Van Monster said to live in the lake. Lake Erçek is the second largest lake in the region and lies just east of Lake Van.

Van has often been called &quot;The Pearl of the East&quot; because of the beauty of its surrounding landscape. An old Armenian proverb in the same sense is &quot;Van in this world, paradise in the next&quot;. This phrase has been slightly modified in Turkish as &quot;Dünyada Van, ahirette iman&quot; or &quot;Van for this world, faith for the next&quot;.

The city is home to Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi (&quot;Van 100th Year University&quot;) and recently came to the headlines for two highly publicized investigations initiated by the Prosecutor of Van, one of which was focused on accusations against the university&#x27;s rector, Hasan Ceylan, who was kept in custody for a time. He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of Agop Vartovyan, an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre. Hasan Ceylan is also the department chairman of Environmental Engineering at Van Yüzüncü Yıl University.
===Earthquakes===

In 1941, Van suffered a destructive 5.9 Mw earthquake. A more severe 7.2 Mw earthquake occurred on 23 October 2011. On the 9 November 2011, another earthquake caused several buildings to collapse.

==Cuisine==
In culinary terms, as some cities in Turkey became renowned for their kebab culture or other types of traditional local dishes, Van has distinguished itself with its breakfast culture.

==Transport==
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100 km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to Tatvan (100 km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a train ferry (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from Ferit Melen Airport.

==Media==
Near Van, there is a longwave broadcasting station with a guyed mast. It went in service in 1990 and operates on 225 kHz with 600 kW. It has also local news outlets like &quot;Van Gazetesi&quot; or &quot;Gazete Van.&quot;

== Notable people ==
* Hanımzer Melet (born 1993), national team wheelchair basketball player.
* Vardan Ajemian (born 1905), Van born, Armenian theatrical director and actor. He was named People&#x27;s Artist of USSR in 1965 and Hero of Socialist Labour in 1975.

==Van cat==

The Van cat is a breed of cat native to this town and named after it. It is noted for its white fur, and for having differently colored eyes.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Van is twinned with:
* Bursa, Turkey
* Odesa, Ukraine
* Karlsruhe, Germany

<text>A tramp is a long-term homeless person who travels from place to place as a vagrant, traditionally walking all year round.

==Etymology==
Tramp is derived from a Middle English verb meaning to &quot;walk with heavy footsteps&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; modern English &quot;trample&quot;) and &quot;to go hiking&quot;.

In Britain, the term was widely used to refer to vagrants in the early Victorian period. The social reporter Henry Mayhew refers to it in his writings of the 1840s and 1850s. By 1850, the word was well established. In that year, Mayhew described &quot;the different kinds of vagrants or tramps&quot; to be found in Britain, along with the &quot;different trampers&#x27; houses in London or the country&quot;. He distinguished several types of tramps, ranging from young people fleeing from abusive families, through to people who made their living as wandering beggars and prostitutes.
In the United States, the word became frequently used during the American Civil War, to describe the widely shared experience of undertaking long marches, often with heavy packs. Use of the word as a noun is thought to have begun shortly after the war. A few veterans had developed a liking for the &quot;call of the road&quot;. Others may have been too traumatised by war time experience to return to settled life.

==History==

Wanderers have existed since ancient times. The modern concept of the &quot;tramp&quot; emerges with the expansion of industrial towns in the early nineteenth century, with the consequent increase in migrant labor and pressure on housing. The common lodging house or &quot;doss house&quot; developed to accommodate transients. Urbanisation also led to an increase in forms of highly marginalized casual labor. Mayhew identifies the problem of &quot;tramping&quot; as a particular product of the economic crisis of the 1840s known as the Hungry Forties. John Burnett argues that in earlier periods of economic stability &quot;tramping&quot; involved a wandering existence, moving from job to job which was a cheap way of experiencing adventures beyond the &quot;boredom and bondage of village life&quot;. 
The number of transient homeless people increased markedly in the U.S. after the industrial recession of the early 1870s. Initially, the term &quot;tramp&quot; had a broad meaning, and was often used to refer to migrant workers who were looking for permanent work and lodgings. Later the term acquired a narrower meaning, to refer only to those who prefer the transient way of life. Writing in 1877 Allan Pinkerton said:

The tramp has always existed in some form or other, and he will continue on his wanderings until the end of time; but there is no question that he has come into public notice, particularly in America, to a greater extent during the present decade than ever before.
From 1896 to the last issue in 1953, the cover page of the British comic &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; featured a comic strip of the tramps Weary Willie and Tired Tim, with its readers including a young Charlie Chaplin (who would become famous as the Tramp).

Author Bart Kennedy, a self-described tramp of 1900 America, once said &quot;I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going.&quot; John Sutherland (1989) said that Kennedy &quot;is one of the early advocates of &#x27;tramping&#x27;, as the source of literary inspiration.&quot;

The tramp became a character trope in vaudeville performance in the late 19th century in the United States. Lew Bloom claimed he was &quot;the first stage tramp in the business&quot;.

==Meaning promiscuous woman==
Perhaps because female tramps were often regarded as prostitutes, in the United States the term &quot;tramp&quot; also came to refer to a promiscuous woman. However, this is not a global usage. According to Australian linguist Kate Burridge, the term shifted towards this meaning in the 1920s, having previously predominantly referred to men, it followed the path of other similar gender neutral words (such as &quot;slag&quot;) to having specific reference to female sexual laxity.

The word is also used, with ambiguous irony, in the classic 1937 Rodgers and Hart song &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;, which is about a wealthy member of New York high society who chooses a vagabond life in &quot;hobohemia&quot;. Other songs with implicit or explicit reference to this usage include &quot;The Son of Hickory Holler&#x27;s Tramp&quot; and &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;.

== Country specific definitions ==
The US State of Mississippi, until 2018, had a specific definition for &quot;tramps&quot;, which was a criminal offense: Any male person over 16 years of age, and not blind, who shall go about from place to place begging and asking subsistence by charity, and all who stroll over the country without lawful occasion, and can give no account of their conduct consistent with good citizenship, shall be held to be tramps.

Every person, on conviction of being a tramp, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $50, or imprisonment in the county jail not more than one month, or both.

==In other languages==

In French, &quot;clochard&quot; is a term for the homeless, especially in French cities. The term is often associated with the romanticizing image of a person who has given up his bourgeois existence for a free life under the Seine bridges in Paris.

<doc id="63688" wikidata="Q1406822" url="?curid=63688" title="Rings of Power">
<text>The Rings of Power are magical artefacts in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, most prominently in his high fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The One Ring first appeared as a plot device, a magic ring in Tolkien&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; Tolkien later gave it a backstory and much greater power. He added nineteen other Great Rings, also conferring powers such as invisibility, that it could control, including the Three Rings of the Elves, Seven Rings for the Dwarves, and Nine for Men. He stated that there were in addition many lesser rings with minor powers. A key story element in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is the addictive power of the One Ring, made secretly by the Dark Lord Sauron; the Nine Rings enslave their bearers as the Nazgûl (Ringwraiths), Sauron&#x27;s most deadly servants.

Proposed sources of inspiration for the Rings of Power range from Germanic legend with the ring Andvaranaut and eventually Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, to fairy tales such as Snow White, which features both a magic ring and seven dwarfs. One experience that may have been pivotal was Tolkien&#x27;s professional work on a Latin inscription at the temple of Nodens; he was a god-hero linked to the Irish hero &quot;Nuada Airgetlám&quot;, whose epithet is &quot;Silver-Hand&quot;, or in Elvish &quot;Celebrimbor&quot;, the name of the Elven-smith who made the Rings of Power. The inscription contained a curse upon a ring, and the site was called Dwarf&#x27;s Hill.

The Rings of Power have been described as symbolising the way that power conflicts with moral behaviour; Tolkien explores the way that different characters, from the humble gardener Sam Gamgee to the powerful Elf ruler Galadriel, the proud warrior Boromir to the Ring-addicted monster Gollum, interact with the One Ring. Tolkien stated that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was an examination of &quot;placing power in external objects&quot;.

== Fictional history ==


The Rings of Power were forged by the Elven-smiths of the Noldorin settlement of Eregion. Best-known were the twenty Great Rings, which conferred powers including invisibility, but many lesser rings with minor powers were also created at that time. The smiths were led by Celebrimbor, the grandson of Fëanor, the greatest craftsman of the Noldor, working with Dwarves from Khazad-dûm (Moria) led by his friend Narvi. Sauron, powerful and ambitious, but humiliated by the fall of his evil master Morgoth at the end of the First Age, had evaded the summons of the godlike Valar to surrender and face judgment; he chose to remain in Middle-earth and seek dominion over its people. In the Second Age, he arrived disguised as a handsome emissary of the Valar named Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, offering the knowledge to transform Middle-earth with the light of Valinor, the home of the Valar. He was shunned by the Elven leaders Gil-galad and Elrond in Lindon, but managed to persuade the Noldorin Elves of Eregion. With Sauron&#x27;s help, they learnt to forge Rings of Power, creating the Seven and the Nine. While Celebrimbor created a set of Three on his own, Sauron left for Mordor and forged the One Ring, a master ring to control all the others, in the fires of Mount Doom.

When the One Ring was made using the Black Speech, the Elves immediately became aware of Sauron&#x27;s true motive to control the other Rings. When Sauron set the completed One Ring upon his finger, the Elves quickly hid their rings. Celebrimbor entrusted one of the Three to Galadriel and sent the other Two to Gil-galad and Círdan. In an attempt to seize all the Rings of Power for himself, Sauron waged an assault upon the Elves. He destroyed Eregion and captured the Nine. Under torture, Celebrimbor revealed where the Seven were, but refused to reveal the Three.

Toward the end of the Second Age, the Númenóreans took Sauron prisoner. Sauron however managed to corrupt the Men of Númenor, leading to their civilisation&#x27;s eventual downfall. The exiled Númenóreans who survived, led by Elendil and his sons Isildur and Anárion, established the realms of Arnor and Gondor. Together with the Elves of Lindon, they formed the last alliance against Sauron and emerged victorious. Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand and kept it, refusing to destroy it; he was later killed in an ambush, and the Ring was lost for centuries. During this time, the Elves were able to use the Three Rings, while the Nine given to the leaders of Men corrupted their wearers and turned them into the Nazgûl. The Seven given to the Dwarves failed to subject them directly to Sauron&#x27;s will but ignited a sense of avarice within them. Over the years, Sauron sought to recapture the Rings, primarily the One, but was only successful in recovering the Nine and three of the Seven. 

During the Third Age, the One Ring is discovered by Bilbo Baggins (in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;). At the start of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Wizard Gandalf explains the One Ring&#x27;s history to Bilbo&#x27;s heir Frodo, and recites the Rhyme of the Rings. A Fellowship is formed to destroy it, led by Frodo. Following the successful destruction of the One Ring and the fall of Sauron, the power of the rings fades. While the Nine are destroyed, the Three are rendered powerless; their bearers leave Middle-earth for Valinor at the end of the Third Age, inaugurating the Dominion of Men.

==Description==


As observed by Saruman, each Ring of Power was adorned with its &quot;proper gem&quot;, except for the One Ring, which was unadorned.

=== The One ===

Unlike the other great rings, the One was created as an unadorned gold band similar in appearance to the lesser rings, though it bore Sauron&#x27;s incantation, the Ring Verse, in the Black Speech; it became visible only when heated, whether by fire or by Sauron&#x27;s hand. As the other Rings were made under the influence of Sauron, the power of all the Rings depended on the One Ring&#x27;s survival. To make the One Ring, Sauron had to put almost all his power into it—when worn, it enhanced his power; unworn, it remained aligned to him unless another seized it and took control of it. A prospective possessor could, if sufficiently strong, overthrow Sauron and usurp his place; but they would become as evil as he. As the One was made in the fires of Mount Doom, it could only be unmade there. Sauron, being evil, never imagined that anyone might try to destroy the One Ring, as he imagined that anyone bearing it would be corrupted by it.

=== The Three ===

Named after the three elements of fire, water, and air, the Three were the last to be made before Sauron&#x27;s solo creation of the One. Although Celebrimbor forged the Three Rings alone in Eregion, they were moulded by Sauron&#x27;s craft and were bound to the One. Only after Sauron&#x27;s defeat, when the One Ring was cut from his finger at the end of the Second Age, did the Elves begin to actively use the Three to ward off the decay brought by time. Even then, the Rings could be worn without being seen. After the One Ring, they are the most powerful of the twenty Rings of Power. They are:

* (the Ring of Fire, the Red Ring), from Quenya &quot;nár&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, was set with a ruby. Its metal is not stated. It gave its wielder resistance to the weariness of time, and evoked hope and courage in others. Its final bearer was the Wizard Gandalf, who received it from Círdan at the Grey Havens during the Third Age. 
* (the Ring of Water, the White Ring, the Ring of Adamant), from Quenya &quot;nén&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, was made of mithril and set with a &quot;shimmering white stone&quot;. Galadriel used it to protect and preserve the realm of Lothlórien. &quot;Adamant&quot; means both a type of stone, usually a diamond, and &quot;stubbornly resolute&quot;, a description that equally well suits the quality of Galadriel&#x27;s resistance to Sauron.
* (the Ring of Air, the Blue Ring), from Quenya &quot;vilya&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, was the mightiest of the Three. It was made of gold and set with a sapphire. Elrond inherited Vilya from Gil-galad and used it to safeguard Rivendell.

=== The Seven ===

Sauron recovered the Seven Rings from information provided by Celebrimbor, and gave them to the leaders of the seven kindreds of the Dwarves: Durin&#x27;s Folk (Longbeards), Firebeards, Broadbeams, Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots, though a tradition of Durin&#x27;s Folk claimed that Durin received his ring from the Elven-smiths. Over the years, Sauron was able to recover only three of the Seven rings from the Dwarves. The last of the three was seized from Thráin II during his captivity in Dol Guldur. Gandalf recounts to Frodo that the remaining four were consumed by dragons. Before the outbreak of the War of the Ring, an envoy from Sauron attempted to bribe Dain II Ironfoot of the Lonely Mountain with the three surviving rings and the lost realm of Moria in exchange for information leading to the recovery of the One Ring, but Dain refused.

=== The Nine ===

Sauron gave Nine of the Rings of Power to leaders of Men, who became &quot;mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old&quot;. They gained unending lifespans, and the ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal Men. One by one, the Men fell to the power of the One Ring; by the end of the Second Age, all nine had become invisible ring-wraiths – the Nazgûl, Sauron&#x27;s most terrible servants. In particular, they helped him search for the One Ring, to which they were powerfully attracted.

== Powers ==

The Rings of Power were made using the craft taught by Sauron to give their wearers &quot;wealth and dominion over others&quot;. Each Ring enhances the &quot;natural power&quot; of its possessor, thus approaching its &quot;magical aspect&quot;, which can be &quot;easily corruptible to evil and lust of domination&quot;. Gandalf explains that a Ring of Power is self-serving and can &quot;look after itself&quot;: the One Ring, in particular, can &quot;slip off treacherously&quot; to return to its master Sauron, betraying its bearer when an opportunity arrives. As the Ruling Ring, the One enables a sufficiently powerful bearer to perceive what is done using the other rings and to govern the thoughts of their bearers. To use the One Ring to its full extent, the bearer needs to be strong and train their will to the domination of others.

A mortal Man or Hobbit who takes possession of a Ring of Power can manifest its power, becoming invisible and able to see things that are normally invisible, as the bearer is partly transported into the spirit world. However, they also &quot;fade&quot;; the Rings unnaturally extend their life-spans, but gradually transform them into permanently invisible wraiths. The Rings affect other beings differently. The Seven are used by their Dwarven bearers to increase their treasure hoards, but they do not gain invisibility, and Sauron was unable to bend the Dwarves to his will, instead only amplifying their greed and anger. Tom Bombadil, the only person unaffected by the power of the One Ring, could both see its wearer and remained visible when he wore it.

Unlike the other Rings, the main purpose of the Three is to &quot;heal and preserve&quot;, as when Galadriel used Nenya to preserve her realm of Lothlórien over long periods. The Elves made the Three Rings to try to halt the passage of time, or as Tolkien had Elrond say, &quot;to preserve all things unstained&quot;. This was seen most clearly in Lothlórien, which was free of both evil and the passage of time.
The Three do not make their wearers invisible. The Three had other powers: Narya could rekindle hearts with its fire and inspire others to resist tyranny, domination, and despair; Nenya had a secret power in its water that protected from evil; while Vilya healed and preserved wisdom in its element of air.

== Inspiration ==

=== Nodens ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought that Tolkien&#x27;s work on a Latin inscription at a Roman temple at Lydney Park was a &quot;pivotal&quot; influence, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand. The god-hero was Nodens, whom Tolkien traced to the Irish hero &quot;Nuada Airgetlám&quot;, &quot;Nuada of the Silver-Hand&quot;, and the inscription carried a curse on a stolen ring. &quot;Silver-Hand&quot; is the English translation of &quot;Celebrimbor&quot;, the Elven-smith who made the Rings of Power, in association with the Dwarven-smith Narvi. The temple was at a place called Dwarf&#x27;s Hill.

=== Ring of Gyges ===

Magical rings occur in classical legend, in the form of the Ring of Gyges in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. It grants the power of invisibility to its wearer, creating a moral dilemma, enabling people to commit injustices without fearing they would be caught. In contrast, Tolkien&#x27;s One Ring actively exerts an evil force that destroys the morality of the wearer.

Scholars including Frederick A. de Armas note parallels between Plato&#x27;s and Tolkien&#x27;s rings. De Armas suggests that both Bilbo and Gyges, going into deep dark places to find hidden treasure, may have &quot;undergone a Catabasis&quot;, a psychological journey to the Underworld.

The Tolkien scholar Eric Katz writes that &quot;Plato &quot;argues&quot; that such [moral] corruption will occur, but Tolkien &quot;shows&quot; us this corruption through the thoughts and actions of his characters&quot;. Plato argues that immoral life is no good as it corrupts one&#x27;s soul. So, Katz states, according to Plato a moral person has peace and happiness, and would not use a Ring of Power. In Katz&#x27;s view, Tolkien&#x27;s story &quot;demonstrate[s] various responses to the question posed by Plato: would a just person be corrupted by the possibility of almost unlimited power?&quot; The question is answered in different ways: the monster Gollum is weak, quickly corrupted, and finally destroyed; Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor, begins virtuous but like Plato&#x27;s Gyges is corrupted &quot;by the temptation of power&quot; from the Ring, even if he wants to use it for good, but redeems himself by defending the hobbits to his own death; the &quot;strong and virtuous&quot; Galadriel, who sees clearly what she would become if she accepted the ring, and rejects it; the immortal Tom Bombadil, exempt from the Ring&#x27;s corrupting power and from its gift of invisibility; Sam who in a moment of need faithfully uses the ring, but is not seduced by its vision of &quot;Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age&quot;; and finally Frodo who is gradually corrupted, but is saved by his earlier mercy to Gollum, and Gollum&#x27;s desperation for the Ring. Katz concludes that Tolkien&#x27;s answer to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Why be moral?&quot; is &quot;to be yourself&quot;.

=== Germanic legend and fairy tale ===

Tolkien was certainly influenced by the Germanic legend: Andvaranaut is a magical ring that can give its wielder wealth, while Draupnir is a self-multiplying ring that holds dominion over all the rings it creates. Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera series &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; adapted Norse mythology to provide a magical but cursed golden ring. Tolkien denied any connection, but scholars agreed that Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; powerfully influenced Tolkien. The scholar of religion Stefan Arvidsson writes that Tolkien&#x27;s ring differs from Wagner&#x27;s in being concerned with power for its own sake and that he turned one ring into many, an echo of the self-multiplying ring.

&quot;Magic rings are a frequent motif in fairy tales; they confer powers such as invisibility or flight; they can summon wish-granting djinns and dwarves&quot;, writes the Tolkien and feminist scholar Melanie Rawls. She adds that they &quot;identify the enchanted princess, hold the tiny golden key to the secret room, give one the power to transform oneself into any form — animal, vegetable, or mineral: duck, lake, rock or tree on a plain, and so escape the ogre.&quot; As Tolkien was well acquainted with fairy tales like The Brothers Grimm&#x27;s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Jeanette White from &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; suggested that his choice &quot;to gift seven rings of power to the Dwarf Lords of the seven kingdoms is probably no accident&quot;. 

The nine rings for Mortal Men match the number of the Nazgûl. Edward Pettit, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, states that nine is &quot;the commonest &#x27;mystic&#x27; number in Germanic lore&quot;. He quotes the &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot; from the &quot;Lacnunga&quot;, an Old English book of spells, suggesting that Tolkien may have made multiple uses of such spells to derive attributes of the Nazgûl:

== Analysis ==

=== Plot device to core element ===

The One Ring first appeared in Tolkien&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1937 as a plot device, a mysterious magic ring that the titular character had stumbled upon, but its origin was left unexplained. Following the novel&#x27;s success, Tolkien was persuaded by his publishers Allen &amp; Unwin to write a sequel. Intending to give Bilbo another adventure, he instead devised a background story around the Ring with its power of invisibility, forming a framework for the new work. He tied the Ring to mythical elements from the unfinished manuscripts for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; to create an impression of depth in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Gollum&#x27;s characterisation in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was revised for the second edition to bring it into line with his portrayal in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a being addicted to the One Ring.

Tolkien&#x27;s conception of Ring-lore was closely linked to his development of the One Ring. He initially made Sauron instrumental in forging the Rings. He then briefly considered having Fëanor, creator of the Silmarils, forge the Rings of Power, under the influence of Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. He settled on Celebrimbor, a descendant of Fëanor, as the Ring&#x27;s principal maker, under the tutelage of Sauron, Morgoth&#x27;s chief servant. While writing the lore behind the One Ring, Tolkien struggled with giving the Elven rings a &quot;special status&quot; – somehow linked to the One, and thus endangered by it, but also &quot;unsullied&quot;, having no direct connection with Sauron. By the time he was writing the chapter &quot;The Mirror of Galadriel&quot;, Tolkien had decided that the Seven and the Nine were made by the Elven-smiths of Eregion under Sauron&#x27;s guidance and that the Three were made by Celebrimbor alone. He considered setting the Three free from the One when it was destroyed but dropped the idea. Tolkien&#x27;s posthumous works, including &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; offer further glimpses of the creation of the Rings.

Jason Fisher, writing in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, notes that Tolkien developed the names, descriptions and powers of the Three Rings late and slowly through many drafts of his narratives. In Fisher&#x27;s view, Tolkien found it difficult to work these Rings both into the existing story of the One Ring, and into the enormous but Ring-free legendarium. Some of the descriptions, such as that Vilya was the mightiest of the Three, and that Narya was called &quot;The Great&quot;, were added at the galley proof stage, just before printing. The Rings had earlier been named Kemen, Ëar, and Menel, meaning the Rings of Earth, Sea, and Heaven.

According to Johann Köberl, Tolkien struggled with the notion of a &quot;special status&quot; for the Elven-Rings, and considered having The Three set free when the One Ring was destroyed. In an unused draft by Tolkien, Galadriel counselled Celebrimbor to destroy all the Rings when Sauron&#x27;s deception was revealed, but when he could not bear to ruin them, she suggested that the Three be hidden. According to &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, at the start of the War of the Elves and Sauron, Celebrimbor gave both Narya and Vilya to Gil-galad, High King of the Noldor. Gil-galad later entrusted Vilya to his lieutenant Elrond, and Narya to Círdan the Shipwright, Lord of the Havens of Mithlond and leader of the Falathrim or &quot;People of the Shore&quot;. Tolkien suggested that Sauron did not discover where the Three were hidden, though he guessed that they were given to Gil-galad and Galadriel. In the published &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Gil-galad received only Vilya, while Círdan was the direct recipient of Narya from Celebrimbor. 

Tolkien noted in his letters that the primary power of the Three was to &quot;the prevention and slowing of &quot;decay&quot;&quot;, which appealed to the Elves in their pursuit of preserving what they loved in Middle-earth. As changeless beings in a changing world, the Elves who remained in Middle-earth relied on the Three to delay the inevitable rise of the Dominion of Men. Tolkien explained that the Elves can only be immortal as long as the world endures, leading them to be concerned with burdens of deathlessness in time and change. Since they wanted the bliss and perfect memory of Valinor, yet to remain in Middle-earth with their prestige as the fairest, as opposed to being at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Undying Lands, they became obsessed with &quot;fading&quot;.

=== Power and morality ===

According to the scholars of philosophy Gregory Bassham and Eric Bronson, the Rings of Power can be seen as a modern representation of the relationship between power and morality, since it portrays an idea that &quot;absolute power is in conflict with behaviour that respects the wishes and needs of others&quot;. They also observed that several of Tolkien&#x27;s characters have responded in different ways when faced with the possibility of possessing the One Ring—characters such as Samwise Gamgee and Galadriel have rejected it; Boromir and Gollum, were seduced by its power; and Frodo Baggins, though in limited use, ultimately succumbs to it; while Tom Bombadil can transcend its power entirely. They also noted that for Tolkien, the crucial moment of each character in the story is the moment in which they are tempted to use a Ring, a choice that will determine their fate. The science fiction author Isaac Asimov described the Rings of Power as symbols of industrial technology. While Tolkien denied that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was an allegory, he stated that it could be applied to situations and described it as an examination of &quot;placing power in external objects&quot;.

=== Catholicism ===

Gwyneth Hood, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, explores two Catholic elements in the story of the Three Rings: the angelic and sacrificial aspects of the Elves in the War of the Ring. To the Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring, the bearers of the Elven-Rings appear as angelic messengers, offering wise counsel. To save Middle-earth, they have to accept the plan to destroy the One Ring, and with it, the power of the Three Rings, which embody much of their own power. Hood notes that while Gandalf, as one of the supernatural Maiar sent from Valinor, is &quot;remarkably unlike an elf&quot;, he is the character who most closely combines the angelic and the sacrificial among the wielders of the Three Rings. The poet W. H. Auden, an early supporter of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, wrote in the &quot;Tolkien Journal&quot; that good triumphs over evil in the War of the Ring, but the Three Rings lose their power, as Galadriel had prophesied: &quot;Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlórien will fade, and the tides of time will sweep it away&quot;. Hood further writes that Tolkien was suggesting technology, such as the making of Rings of Power, is in itself neither good nor evil; both the Elves and Sauron (with his armies of orcs) use that technology, as they also both make and wear swords and mail armour, and shoot with bows.

==In adaptations==
Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; begins with the forging of the Rings of Power and the events of the War of the Last Alliance against Sauron, all of which are animated in a silhouette against a red background using rotoscoping.

The forging of the Rings of Power opens the prologue of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series in the 2001 &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The Three Elven Rings are shown being cast using a cuttlebone mould, an ancient casting technique. These were given to Gil-galad (portrayed by Mark Ferguson), Círdan (Michael Elsworth), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). The Tolkien illustrator Alan Lee, employed as a conceptual designer for the films, had a cameo as one of the nine human Ring-bearers who later became the Nazgûl. Sauron (Sala Baker) is seen forging the One Ring at the chamber of Mount Doom. The One Ring was shown to have the ability to adjust in size to the finger of its wearer, such as when it became smaller to fit Isildur (Harry Sinclair). In the extended version, Galadriel properly introduces Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, to Frodo. In the concluding film, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003), the final wearers of the Three Rings—Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel, appear openly at the Grey Havens wearing the Three, with Galadriel proclaiming the end of its power and the beginning of the Dominion of Men.

Four Rings of Power appeared in Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series. In &quot;An Unexpected Journey&quot; (2012), the One Ring was found by Bilbo Baggins (portrayed by Martin Freeman). In the extended version of the succeeding film &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot; (2013), Gandalf discovers that Sauron took the Ring of Thrór (a Dwarf-Lord) from Thráin (Antony Sher), who revealed in a flashback scene his possession of the Ring during a siege of Moria. In the concluding film &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014), Galadriel (Blanchett) reveals Nenya in rescuing Gandalf (McKellen) from Sauron (Benedict Cumberbatch), aided by Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Elrond (Weaving), who is wearing Vilya, the Ring of Air.

In the 2014 video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot;, the wraith-like spirit of Celebrimbor (fused with the body of the Ranger Talion) recalls how Sauron had deceived him into forging the Rings of Power. In the sequel, &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;, Celebrimbor forges a new Ring of Power unsullied by Sauron&#x27;s influence.

The 2022 television series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; depicts the forging of the Rings of Power.

<text>Patricia Highsmith (born Mary Patricia Plangman; January 19, 1921 – February 4, 1995) was an American novelist and short story writer widely known for her psychological thrillers, including her series of five novels featuring the character Tom Ripley. She wrote 22 novels and numerous short stories in a career spanning nearly five decades, and her work has led to more than two dozen film adaptations. Her writing was influenced by existentialist literature, and questioned notions of identity and popular morality. She was dubbed &quot;the poet of apprehension&quot; by novelist Graham Greene.

Born in Fort Worth, Texas, and mostly raised in her infancy by her maternal grandmother, Highsmith was taken to New York City at the age of six to live with her mother and stepfather. After graduating college in 1942, she worked as a writer for comic books while writing her own short stories and novels in her spare time. Her literary breakthrough came with the publication of her first novel &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1950) which was adapted into a 1951 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Her 1955 novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; was well received in the United States and Europe, cementing her reputation as a major exponent of psychological thrillers.

In 1963, Highsmith moved to England where her critical reputation continued to grow. Following the breakdown of her relationship with a married Englishwoman, she moved to France in 1967 to try to rebuild her life. Her sales were now higher in Europe than in the United States which her agent attributed to her subversion of the conventions of American crime fiction. She moved to Switzerland in 1982 where she continued to publish new work that increasingly divided critics. The last years of her life were marked by ill health and she died of aplastic anemia and lung cancer in Switzerland in 1995.

&quot;The Times&quot; said of Highsmith: &quot;she puts the suspense story in a toweringly high place in the hierarchy of fiction.&quot; Her second novel, &quot;The Price of Salt,&quot; published under a pseudonym in 1952, was ground breaking for its positive depiction of lesbian relationships and optimistic ending. She remains controversial for her antisemitic, racist and misanthropic statements.

==Early life==
Highsmith was born Mary Patricia Plangman in Fort Worth, Texas on January 19, 1921. She was the only child of commercial artists Jay Bernard Plangman (1889–1975) and Mary Plangman (&quot;née&quot; Coates; September 13, 1895 – March 12, 1991). Her father had not wanted a child and had persuaded her mother to have an abortion. Her mother, after a failed attempt to abort her by drinking turpentine, decided to leave Plangman. The couple divorced nine days before their daughter&#x27;s birth.

In 1927 Highsmith moved to New York City to live with her mother and her stepfather, commercial artist Stanley Highsmith, whom her mother had married in 1924. Patricia excelled at school and read widely, including works by Jack London, Louisa May Alcott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, and John Ruskin. At the age of nine, she became fascinated by the case histories of abnormal psychology in &quot;The Human Mind&quot; by Karl Menninger, a popularizer of Freudian analysis.

In the summer of 1933, Highsmith attended a girls&#x27; camp and the letters she wrote home were published as a story two years later in &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; magazine. She received $25 for the story. After returning from camp, she was sent to Fort Worth and lived with her maternal grandmother for a year. She called this the &quot;saddest year&quot; of her life and felt &quot;abandoned&quot; by her mother. In 1934 she returned to New York to live with her mother and stepfather in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. She was unhappy at home. She hated her step father and developed a life-long love–hate relationship with her mother, which she later fictionalized in stories such as &quot;The Terrapin&quot;, about a young boy who stabs his mother to death.

She attended the all-girl Julia Richman High School where she achieved a B minus average grade. She continued to read widelyEdgar Allan Poe was a favoriteand began writing short stories and a journal. Her story &quot;Primroses are Pink&quot; was published in the school literary magazine.

In 1938 Highsmith entered Barnard College where her studies included English literature, playwriting and short story composition. Fellow students considered her a loner who guarded her privacy but she formed a life-long friendship with fellow student Kate Kingsley Skattebol. She continued to read voraciously, kept diaries and notebooks, and developed an interest in eastern philosophy, Marx and Freud. She also read Thomas Wolfe, Marcel Proust and Julien Green with admiration. She published nine stories in the college literary magazine and became its editor in her senior year.

== Apprentice writer ==
After graduating in 1942, Highsmith, despite endorsements from &quot;highly placed professionals,&quot; applied without success for a job at publications such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She eventually found work with FFF Publishers which provided copy for various Jewish publications. The job, which paid $20 per week, lasted only six months but gave her experience in researching stories.

In December 1942 Highsmith found employment with comic book publisher Sangor–Pines where she earned up to $50 per week. She wrote &quot;Sergeant Bill King&quot; stories, contributed to Black Terror and Fighting Yank comics, and wrote profiles such as Catherine the Great, Barney Ross, and Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker for the &quot;Real Life Comics&quot; series. After a year, she realized she could make more money and have more flexibility for travel and serious writing by working freelance for comics and she did so until 1949. From 1943 to 1946, under editor Vincent Fago at Timely Comics, she contributed to its &quot;U.S.A. Comics&quot; wartime series, writing scenarios for characters such as &quot;Jap Buster Johnson&quot; and The Destroyer. For Fawcett Publications she scripted characters including &quot;Crisco and Jasper.&quot; She also wrote for &quot;True Comics&quot;, &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; and &quot;Western Comics&quot;. Working for comics was the only long-term job Highsmith ever held.

Highsmith considered comics boring &quot;hack work&quot; and was determined to become a novelist. In the evenings she wrote short stories which she submitted, unsuccessfully, to publications such as &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; In 1944 she spent five months in Mexico where she worked on an unfinished novel &quot;The Click of the Shutting&quot;. On her return to Manhattan she worked on another unfinished novel &quot;The Dove Descending&quot;.

The following year, &quot;The Heroine,&quot; a story about a pyromaniac nanny that she had written in 1941, was published by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. The publishers Knopf wrote her that they were interested in publishing any novels she might have. Nothing, however, came from their subsequent meeting. Highsmith&#x27;s agents advised her that her stories needed to be more &quot;upbeat&quot; to be marketable but she wanted to write stories that reflected her vision of the world.

In 1946, Highsmith read Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Stranger&quot; and was impressed by his absurdist vision. The following year she commenced writing &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, and her new agent submitted an early draft to a publisher&#x27;s reader who recommended major revisions. Based on the recommendation of Truman Capote, Highsmith was accepted by the Yaddo artist&#x27;s retreat during the summer of 1948, where she worked on the novel.

&quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; was accepted for publication by Harper &amp; Brothers in May 1949. The following month, Highsmith sailed to Europe where she spent three months in England, France and Italy. In Italy, she visited Positano which would later become the major setting for her novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. She read an anthology of Kierkegaard on the trip and declared him her new &quot;master&quot;.

== Established writer ==
Highsmith returned to New York in October 1949 and began writing &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;, a novel about a lesbian relationship. &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; was published in March 1950 and received favorable reviews in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and &quot;New York Times.&quot; The novel was shortlisted for the Edgar Allan Poe Prize and Alfred Hitchcock secured the film rights for $6,000. Sales increased after the release of the film.

In February 1951, she left for Europe for the publication of the novel in England and France. She stayed for two years, traveling and working on an unfinished novel, &quot;The Traffic of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder,&quot; which is now lost. She wrote Skattebol, &quot;I can imagine living mostly in Europe the rest of my life.&quot;

Highsmith was back in New York in May 1953. &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; had been published in hardback under a pseudonym the previous May, and sold well in paperback in 1953. It was praised in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; for &quot;sincerity and good taste&quot; but the reviewer found the characters underdeveloped. The novel made Highsmith a respected figure in the New York lesbian community, but as she did not publicly acknowledge authorship, it did not further her literary reputation.

In September 1953, Highsmith traveled to Fort Worth where she completed a fair copy of &quot;The Blunderer&quot; which was published the following year. In 1954 she worked on a new novel, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; about a young American who kills a rich compatriot in Italy and assumes his identity. She completed the novel in six months in Lenox, Santa Fe, and Mexico.

&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; was published in December 1955 to favorable reviews in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, their critics praising Highsmith&#x27;s convincing portrait of a psychopath. The novel went on to win the Edgar Allan Poe Scroll of the Mystery Writers of America.Highsmith biographer Richard Bradford states that the novel &quot;forged the basis for her long term reputation as a writer.&quot;

Highsmith moved to the affluent hamlet of Palisades, New York State, in 1956 and lived there for over two years. In March 1957, her story &quot;A Perfect Alibi&quot; was published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine,&quot; beginning a long-term association with the publication.She also completed two further novels, &quot;Deep Water&quot; (published in 1957) and &quot;A Game for the Living&quot; (1958), and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Miranda the Panda is on the Veranda&quot; (1958), that she co-authored with Doris Sanders.

In December 1958, Highsmith moved back to Manhattan where she wrote &quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot;. The novel was published in February 1960 to generally favorable reviews. From September 1960, she lived near New Hope, Pennsylvania. There she saw René Clement&#x27;s &quot;Plein Soleil&quot; (1960), the French film adaptation of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; but she was disappointed by its moralistic ending. She also wrote &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot; which she completed in February 1962. Although Highsmith considered it one of her worst novels, novelist Brigid Brophy later rated it, along with &quot;Lolita&quot;, as one of the best since World War II.

Highsmith spent 1962 shuttling between New Hope and Europe and finishing the novel &quot;The Two Faces of January&quot;. She had fallen in love with a married English woman and wanted to live closer to her. In February 1963, she moved permanently to Europe.

Highsmith rented an apartment in Positano where she worked on her prison novel &quot;The Glass Cell.&quot; She then traveled to London where she promoted &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot;, newly published in Britain. In November 1963 she moved to the festival town of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and the following year she bought a home in the nearby village of Earl Soham where she lived for three years.

During this time, Highsmith&#x27;s critical reputation in the United Kingdom grew. Francis Wyndham wrote a long article on Highsmith for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1963 which introduced her work to many readers. Brigid Brophy, also writing in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, praised &quot;The Two Faces of January&quot; (1964) stating that Highsmith had made the crime story literature. Julian Simmons in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; commended Highsmith&#x27;s subtle characterization. The novel won the Silver Dagger Award of the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association for best foreign novel of 1964.

Highsmith was quarreling with her mother and under severe emotional strain due to her difficult relationship with her English lover. She was drinking heavily and her private and public behavior was becoming more eccentric and antisocial. When her love affair ended in late 1966, she decided to move to France.

After a brief visit to Tunisia, Highsmith moved to the Île-de-France in 1967 and eventually settled at Montmachoux in April 1968. Her novels of this period include &quot;The Tremor of Forgery&quot; (1969), which Graham Greene considered her finest work, and &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; (1970) which gained generally positive reviews. Her books, however, were selling poorly in America which her agent suggested was because they were &quot;too subtle&quot;.

In 1970, Highsmith flew to the United States where she visited New York and her family in Fort Worth. She drew on her trip for her novel &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (1972) which is set in Manhattan. In November 1970 she moved to the village of Moncourt, in the Moselle region of France. The novels she wrote there include &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; (1974), &quot;Edith&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot; (1980). In 1977, she saw Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;The American Friend&quot;, a loose adaptation of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game.&quot; She praised the film but was displeased with Dennis Hopper as Ripley. The following year, she was elected chairman of the jury for the Berlin Film Festival.

In 1980 Highsmith underwent bypass surgery to correct uncontrolled bleeding and serious cardiovascular problems. Soon after, the French authorities fined her for taxation irregularities, prompting her to comment, &quot;How appropriate, to be bleeding in two places.&quot; Disillusioned with France, she bought a house in Aurigeno, Switzerland and in 1982 moved there permanently.

== Switzerland and final years ==

In 1981, Highsmith moved into her Swiss home and began writing a new novel, &quot;People who Knock on the Door&quot; (1983), about the influence of Christian fundamentalism in America. This, and her following novel, &quot;Found in the Street&quot; (1986)&quot;,&quot; were partly based on a research trip to America in early 1981. Her biographer Joan Schenkar states that by this time Highsmith had been living in Europe so long she &quot;began to make errors of American fact and understanding in her novels.&quot; Highsmith described &quot;People who Knock on the Door&quot; as &quot;a flat book, but popular in France, Germany and E[ast] Germany.&quot;

In 1986, Highsmith had a successful operation for lung cancer. Shortly after, she commissioned a new home in Tegna, Switzerland. The home was in the brutalist style and her friends called it &quot;the bunker.&quot; There she completed her last two novels, &quot;Ripley Under Water&quot; (1991) and &quot;Small g: A Summer Idyll&quot; (1995). In 1990 she was made an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters of France. In 1993 her health deteriorated and she required the help of a home carer.

Highsmith died on February 4, 1995, at 74, from aplastic anemia and lung cancer at Carita Hospital in Locarno, Switzerland, near Tegna. She was cremated at the cemetery in Bellinzona; a memorial service was conducted in the Chiesa di Tegna in Tegna and her ashes were interred in its columbarium.

She left her estate, worth an estimated $3 million, and the promise of any future royalties, to the Yaddo colony, where she spent two months in 1948 writing the draft of &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;. Highsmith bequeathed her literary estate to the Swiss Literary Archives at the Swiss National Library in Bern, Switzerland. Her Swiss publisher, Diogenes Verlag, which had principal rights to her work, was appointed literary executor of the estate.

Her last novel, &quot;Small g: a Summer Idyll&quot;, was rejected by Knopf (her most recent American publisher) several months before her death. It was published posthumously in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing in March 1995, and nine years later in the United States by W. W. Norton. The novel sold 50,000 copies in France within six weeks of her death.

Highsmith&#x27;s literary estate included eight thousand pages of handwritten notebooks and diaries.

==Personal life==

=== Health ===
Highsmith had anorexia as a teenager and episodes of depression throughout her life. Despite literary success, she wrote in her diary of January 1970: &quot;[I] am now cynical, fairly rich ... lonely, depressed, and totally pessimistic.&quot; She was an alcoholic who by her middle age drank from breakfast until she went to bed at night. She smoked 40 Gauloises cigarettes a day and rarely ate fruit and vegetables. In 1973 her doctor advised her that if she did not change her lifestyle she might not live past 55.

Highsmith underwent surgery in May 1980 for blockages in two arteries of her right leg, and in April 1986 she had successful surgery for lung cancer (of a type not related to smoking). In January 1992 she had a procedure to widen her left femoral artery, and in September the following year she had surgery to remove a non-cancerous tumor in her lower intestine. Later in 1993 she was diagnosed with the aplastic anemia and lung cancer that would kill her.

=== Personality ===
 Highsmith was ambitious and socially active in the 1940s but always preferred smaller gatherings to large crowds and public functions. Despite her reputation as a recluse in her later years, she had a circle of friends, neighbors and admirers who she regularly saw in France and Switzerland, and she frequently corresponded with friends in Europe and America.

Highsmith&#x27;s biographers, friends and acquaintances describe her public and private behavior, especially from the 1960s, as often eccentric, rude, difficult and antisocial. She brought her pet snails to one dinner party in the 1960s and let them wander over the mahogany.At a dinner party in 1968 she deliberately lowered her head to a candle and set her hair on fire. She had two friends as house guests in 1971 and threw a dead rat into their room. She often made racist or insensitive comments which offended and embarrassed those present. Those who knew her suggested that this behavior might have resulted from depression, alcoholism, Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome or a personality disorder. A psychiatrist who observed her at a hotel in 1963 said to the owner, &quot;You do realize you have a psychopath in the hall.&quot;

Many who knew her said she could also be funny and good company, but difficult. Her oldest friend, Kate Skattebol, said that at college she was &quot;fun to be with and her sense of humour was great. She loved to shock people.&quot; British journalist Francis Wyndham, who met her in 1963, said, &quot;I liked her immediately...I could tell that she was shy and reticent, a woman with deep feelings, someone who was affectionate but also difficult.&quot; Gary Fisketjon, her American editor the 1980s, said, &quot;She was very rough, very difficult ... But she was also plainspoken, dryly funny, and great fun to be around.&quot;

Highsmith lived alone for most of her adult life, stating in a 1991 interview, &quot;I choose to live alone because my imagination functions better when I don&#x27;t have to speak with people.&quot; Although she preferred her personal life to remain private, she took no steps to avoid the posthumous availability of her diaries and notebooks in which she recorded the motivations of her behavior.

=== Interests ===
Highsmith began keeping snails as pets in 1946 or 1949 as she was fascinated by their sexuality. Pet snails appear in her 1957 novel &quot;Deep Water,&quot; and her story &quot;The Snail Watcher&quot; is about pet snails who kill their owner. She kept 300 snails at her home in Earl Soham and occasionally took some with her on social outings. She said that when she moved to France she smuggled her snails into the country in her bra. Schenkar, however, believes this is only an amusing story and that she smuggled her snails in cottage cheese cartons.

Her other hobbies included woodworking, painting and gardening. Diogenes Verlag published a book of her drawings in 1995.She was an accomplished gardener, but in her later years her friends and neighbors did most of the work on her gardens.

===Sexuality===
Highsmith&#x27;s sexual relationships were predominantly with women. She occasionally engaged in sex with men without physical desire for them, writing in her diary in 1948: &quot;The male face doesn&#x27;t attract me, isn&#x27;t &quot;beautiful&quot; to me.&quot; In a 1970 letter to her stepfather, Highsmith described sex with men as like &quot;steel wool in the face, a sensation of being raped in the wrong place—leading to a sensation of having to have, pretty soon, a boewl movement.&quot; Phyllis Nagy described Highsmith as &quot;a lesbian who did not very much enjoy being around other women&quot; and her few affairs with men occurred just to &quot;see if she could be into men in that way because she so much more preferred their company.&quot;

Highsmith called herself &quot;basically polygamous&quot; and was consistently unfaithful to her lovers. She noted in her 1949 diary that she couldn&#x27;t sustain any relationship for more than two to three years. In 1943 she wrote, &quot;there is something perverted within me, that I don&#x27;t love a girl anymore if she loves me more than I love her.&quot; According to biographer Andrew Wilson, &quot;She would be forever prone to falling in love but always happiest when alone.&quot;

Highsmith held varying views about her sexuality throughout her life. In 1942 she wrote that lesbians were inferior to homosexual men because they never sought their equals. Later she told author Marijane Meaker: &quot;the only difference between us and heterosexuals is what we do in bed.&quot; In 1970 she wrote to a friend: &quot;We all become reconciled to being queer and prefer life that way.&quot;

Highsmith refused to speak publicly about her sexuality, repeatedly telling interviewers: &quot;I don&#x27;t answer personal questions about myself or other people.&quot; When she finally agreed, in 1990, to have &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; republished under her own name as &quot;Carol&quot; she was still reluctant to discuss her sexuality. In 1978, however, she wrote a friend that after her death a future biographer must discuss her love life and &quot;everyone must know I am queer or gay.&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Schenkar calls Highsmith&#x27;s mother, Mary: &quot;the great love of Pat Highsmith&#x27;s lifeand, certainly, her greatest hate.&quot; In 1967 Highsmith wrote: &quot;I adored my mother, and could see no wrong in her, until I was near 17.&quot; Nevertheless, Highsmith felt her mother had abandoned her at the age of 12, when she had left her in Fort Worth so she could attempt a reconciliation with Stanley Highsmith in New York. She later blamed her mother for her failed relationships, writing: &quot;I never got over it. Thus I seek out women who will hurt me in a similar manner, and avoid the women who aregood eggs.&quot; Highsmith also blamed her mother for her introverted personality, stating that when she was 14 her mother had asked her whether she was a lesbian in a way that made her feel &quot;like a cripple on the street.&quot;

Relations between the two women were often difficult. When Highsmith&#x27;s mother stayed with her in England for six days in 1965 it ended in a physical altercation and Highsmith had to call her doctor, who sedated both women. Highsmith blamed her tense adult relationship with her mother on Mary&#x27;s jealousy over her female friends and lovers. Her mother broke off relations with Highsmith by letter in 1974, and lived in a nursing home from 1975 until her death in 1991. During this time, Highsmith and her mother had no communication with each other.

Bradford argues that Highsmith&#x27;s love life represented a combination of romantic fantasies and a desire for social advancement: &quot;[T]hroughout her life, Highsmith looked for women whom she could worship.&quot;Her partner Ellen Hill told her she was only in love with fantasy figures: &quot;She [Hill] says, I fit the person to my wishes, find they don&#x27;t fit, and proceed to break it off.&quot; According to Bradford, until her middle age: &quot;She only truly desired women who came from the kind of social, cultural and intellectual ranking to which she aspired. More significantly, she seemed particularly attracted to women who had been born into privilege.&quot;

In 1941 Highsmith met Rosalind Constable, a 34-year-old British journalist and literary consultant. Wilson describes Constable as &quot;blond,&quot; &quot;elegant&quot; and a &quot;cultured sophisticate.&quot; Highsmith fell in love with Constable but the relationship was not sexual. Constable promoted her career, giving her introductions to cultural figures and later recommending her to the Yaddo community.

In 1943 Highsmith had a brief affair with artist Allela Cornell who killed herself three years later over another failed relationship. Highsmith, nevertheless, felt guilty over her death and prominently displayed Cornell&#x27;s oil portrait of her in all her homes. Cornell was the inspiration for the artist Derwatt in &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;.

Highsmith began a year-long affair with the rich socialite Virginia Kent Catherwood in June 1946. Catherwood was one of the models for Carol Aird in &quot;The Price of Salt.&quot;

During her stay at Yaddo in 1948, Highsmith met writer Marc Brandel, son of author J. D. Beresford. Even though she told him about her homosexuality, they soon entered into a relationship. In November Highsmith underwent six months of psychoanalysis in an effort &quot;to regularize herself sexually&quot; so she could marry him. They became engaged in May 1949, just before her first trip to Europe. Their relationship ended in the fall of 1950.

Highsmith and Brandel had other sexual partners during their relationship. In 1948 she started an intermittent relationship with Ann Smith, a painter and designer. The relationship ended in 1950 but the two remained friends. While in Europe in 1949, Highsmith had an affair with psychoanalyst Kathryn Hamill Cohen, the wife of British publisher Dennis Cohen and founder of Cresset Press, which later published &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;. Kathryn ended the affair by letter in April 1950.

To help pay for her therapy sessions, Highsmith had taken a sales job in December 1948 in the toy section of Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store. One day she served an elegant blonde woman in a mink coat who left her delivery details. Her name was Kathleen Senn and the encounter inspired Highsmith to begin writing &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;. She twice went to Senn&#x27;s home to secretly observe her and, although they never met, Highsmith wrote that Senn &quot;almost made me love her.&quot;

While in Munich In September 1951, Highsmith met the German sociologist Ellen Hill who, according to Schenkar, &quot;had the longest, strongest influence on Pat&#x27;s life (after mother Mary).&quot;. They lived and traveled together in Europe and America until July 1953 when Hill attempted suicide after Highsmith threatened to end their relationship. They resumed their relationship in September 1954 and it lasted until December 1955. They established a difficult friendship after this, which endured until Highsmith broke with her in 1988.

In March 1956, Highsmith began a relationship with Doris Sanders, an advertising illustrator and copywriter. They lived together in Palisades, New York State, and traveled to Mexico where Highsmith set her novel &quot;A Game for the Living&quot;. Highsmith left Sanders in December 1958 after initiating an affair with another woman.

In the spring of 1959, Highsmith met writer Marijane Meaker. They began a relationship and when Highsmith returned from a publicity tour of Europe in 1960 they lived together near New Hope, Pennsylvania. The relationship was stormy and after six months Highsmith moved to another house in New Hope. When their relationship collapsed in 1961, Meaker included a character based on Highsmith in her novel &quot;Intimate Victims&quot; (1962). Highsmith did likewise in her novel &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot;.

While in Europe in the summer of 1962, Highsmith met an Englishwoman who was married to a wealthy businessman and who had a child. Highsmith had an affair with the woman and fell in love. Highsmith&#x27;s Swiss editor, Anna von Planta, calls the anonymous Englishwoman the &quot;love of her life&quot;. Highsmith moved to England in 1963 to be closer to her lover and she eventually settled in Earl Soham, Suffolk in 1964. Her lover, whose husband knew of the affair, visited Highsmith on weekends and they had occasional holidays in Europe. When it became clear to Highsmith that the woman would not leave her husband for her, she became increasingly jealous of the time her lover spent with her family. Her lover, in turn, was jealous of the time Highsmith spent with former lovers including Ellen Hill. The affair ended in October 1966 and Highsmith called the breakup &quot;the very worst time of my entire life.&quot;

After Highsmith moved to France in 1967 she had several affairs with women who were 20 to 30 years younger. After her permanent move to Switzerland in 1982 she remained celibate for the rest of her life.

==Views==
===Politics===
Highsmith was radicalized by the Spanish Civil War and joined the Young Communist League while at Barnard in 1939. She left the party in November 1941. Over the following decades, she displayed a consistent opposition to war and big business and a concern for environmental issues. She was a swing voter, voting for the Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984, Republican George Bush senior in 1988, and independent Ross Perot in 1992. She described herself as a liberal or social democrat but admired Margaret Thatcher because of her policy of tax cuts and wrote that she would not sacrifice any of her money to help the poor. She believed that people were responsible for their destiny and that society was not to blame for the problems of individuals.

Highsmith supported Palestinian self-determination. As a member of Amnesty International, she felt duty-bound to express publicly her opposition to the displacement of Palestinians. Highsmith prohibited her books from being published in Israel after the election of Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1977. She dedicated her 1983 novel &quot;People Who Knock on the Door&quot; to the Palestinian people:

Highsmith donated money to the Jewish Committee on the Middle East, an organization that represented American Jews who supported Palestinian self-determination. She wrote in an August 1993 letter to Meaker: &quot;USA could save 11 million per day if they would cut the dough to Israel. The Jewish vote is 1%.&quot;

Although Highsmith was an active supporter of Palestinian rights, according to Nagy, her expression of this &quot;often teetered into outright antisemitism.&quot;

Highsmith was an avowed antisemite; she described herself as a &quot;Jew hater&quot; and described The Holocaust as &quot;the semicaust&quot; and &quot;Holocaust, Inc.&quot; When she was living in Switzerland in the 1980s, she used nearly 40 aliases when writing to government bodies and newspapers deploring the Israeli state and the influence of the Jews.

Highsmith also expressed racist and prejudiced views about other social groups, including black Americans. She believed that black people were responsible for a welfare crisis in America and spoke of their &quot;animal-like breeding habits&quot;. Skattebol called her: &quot;An equal opportunity offender...You name the group, she hated them.&quot;

=== Women ===
Highsmith was called a misogynist by some critics and some of those who knew her. In 1942 she wrote: &quot;A woman&#x27;s stupidity, absence of imagination, her childlike, retarded cruelty, cannot be equalled in the animal kingdom. Men&#x27;s energies are naturally more constructive and healthy.&quot; Wilson argues that Highsmith was a misanthrope rather than a misogynist. In 1969, she said she was becoming &quot;increasingly misanthropic.&quot;

In 1984 she said she had suffered no injustices because of her sex and that she disliked feminists because they were always &quot;whining, always complaining about something. Instead of doing something.&quot; However, in a 1992 interview she stated: &quot;I can be in favour of women&#x27;s causes, but I don&#x27;t join them. If it&#x27;s a matter of donating a little money, or signing something, I might, but not extra work.&quot;

===Religion===
When young, Highsmith was influenced by the religious views of her mother, who was a Christian Scientist. She rejected Christian Science at the age of 21 but still retained a belief in God. At 28 she wrote, &quot;A certain calm is essential in order to live. Relief from anxiety. I myself can never have this without belief in the power of God which is greater than man and all the power in the universe.&quot; She discussed God and Jesus frequently in her journals and sang in a church choir up to the age of 37. In 1977 she declared that she no longer believed in God either as an abstract power or as a divine presence within the human soul. In 1985 she said she disliked &quot;people who believe that some god or other really has control over everything but is not exercising that control just now.&quot;Bruno Sager, who was her home carer in 1993, discussed religion with her and said, &quot;[She] was one of these persons searching for some kind of god or soul but she never could stand the cages of Catholicism or any of the other religions. She was not an atheist, not at all.&quot;

===Animals===
Highsmith was outraged at human cruelty to animals, such as battery chicken farming. Her story collection &quot;The Animal Lovers Book of Beastly Murder&quot; (1975) features mistreated animals that take revenge on humans. Skatterbol says that Highsmith saw animals as &quot;individual personalities often better behaved, and endowed with more dignity and honesty than humans.&quot; She was particularly fond of cats, stating that they &quot;provide something for writers that humans cannot: companionship that makes no demands or intrusions.&quot; In 1991 Highsmith said that if she came across a starving kitten and a starving baby she would feed the kitten.

While several of her friends attested to her kindness to animals, some visitors to Highsmith&#x27;s homes in France and Switzerland said that she mistreated her cats, including swinging one around in a towel to make it dizzy for the amusement of her guests. She also disliked dogs and admitted to secretly kicking a neighbor&#x27;s dog that she thought was misbehaving. Bradford argues that her animal stories anthropomorphize them and give them the worst human characteristics.

==Major works==

=== &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; ===
Schenkarand Bradford consider Highsmith&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, to be one of her finest works. Bradford writes that the book &quot;made her name as a writer capable of evoking the horrific and the grotesque.&quot; Her agent, Patricia Schartle, said that the basic idea of two strangers exchanging murders was one of &quot;two almost perfect flashes of brilliance in her career.&quot;

The novel introduces major themes in Highsmith&#x27;s work including the complementary nature of good and evil, an implied homoerotic attraction between male antagonists, and shifting identities. On the novel&#x27;s release, a &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; critic praised it for its suspenseful plotting and perceptive portrayal of a psychopath. A critic for The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, however, criticised it as a confected thriller with a preposterous plot.

=== &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; ===
Highsmith&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;, was published in 1952 under the pen name Claire Morgan. Highsmith partly based the character Therese on herself. The novel broke new ground in American lesbian fiction because of its hopeful ending, and departure from lesbian stereotypes. In what BBC 2&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; presenter Sarah Dunant described as a &quot;literary coming out&quot; after 38 years of disaffirmation, Highsmith finally acknowledged authorship of the novel publicly when she agreed, in 1990, to its republication by Bloomsbury under the title &quot;Carol&quot;. Highsmith wrote in the &quot;Afterword&quot; to the new edition: The paperback version of the novel sold nearly one million copies before its 1990 reissue. &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; is the only Highsmith novel in which no violent crime takes place and, according to Harrison, the only one where sexual relations are portrayed openly and positively.

===The &quot;Ripliad&quot;===

Wilson calls Highsmith&#x27;s first Tom Ripley novel, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, &quot;One of her most powerful and celebrated novels.&quot; She went on to write four sequels (in the series sometimes called the &quot;Ripliad&quot;) and by 1989, according to Bradford, &quot;Ripley had become for her the equivalent of Conan Doyle&#x27;s Holmes, even Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet, the figure who defined her as a writer.&quot; Critic Anthony Hilfer sees Ripley as an exemplar of the &quot;protean or perpetually self-inventing man&quot; who can transform himself into anyone by mimicking their external traits.

Highsmith wrote that in her first Ripley novel she was showing, &quot;the unequivocal triumph of evil over good and rejoicing in it. I shall make my readers rejoice in it too.&quot; Bradford argues that one of the strengths of the first Ripley novel is that it implicates its readers in an amoral world: &quot;There was a general consensus that while the main character was vile and immoral Highsmith had somehow insulated him from the reader&#x27;s inclination to judge.&quot;

Tom Ripley has been variously described by commentators as &quot;repellent and fascinating,&quot; &quot;a cold blooded killer with a taste for the finer things in life,&quot; and &quot;an amoral but charming psychopath.&quot; A critic for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; noted that in the second Ripley novel, &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; (1970), Ripley&#x27;s new wealth had not made him more normal, but had turned him into &quot;a contented psychopath.&quot; Ripley is a serial killer who always gets away with his crimes. Shenkar believes &quot;Ripley becomes more successful (and less interesting) with each new Ripley novel.&quot; Critic Noel Mawer argues that in the later novels Ripley becomes less a &quot;psychotic in his world of delusion&quot; and more an &quot;amoral, unfeeling sociopath who feels that murder is simply a necessity to protect what...[he] feels he has earned and deserved.&quot;

== Reception of work ==
Highsmith&#x27;s critical reputation was divided in her lifetime. Marghanita Laski denounced her work as immoral and lacking human decency. Other commentators, most notably Graham Greene, considered the moral ambiguity of her work a strength. Although her novels were often critically acclaimed in the United States and Britain, they sold poorly in comparison with their sales in Europe, where her critical and popular reputation was higher. Peak sales for her novels in the United States, on initial publication, were under 8,000 each. &quot;The Tremor of Forgery&quot; and &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; (1970) sold just under 7,000 in their first year in Britain. &quot;Found in the Street&quot; (1987) sold 4,000 copies in the United States compared with 40,000 in Germany.

Since Highsmith&#x27;s death, her novels of the 1950s and 1960s have attracted the most critical acclaim. Bradford considers &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; her most accomplished novels and states, &quot;Highsmith has done more than anyone to erode the boundaries between crime writing as a recreational sub-genre and literature as high art.&quot;

== Themes, style and genre ==

=== Themes ===
Highsmith&#x27;s themes were influenced by Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Kafka, and the existentialism of Sartre and Camus. Wilson argues that her work presents an amoral world view in which murderers go unpunished or are only punished by chance. In 1966, Highsmith wrote: &quot;neither life nor nature cares whether justice is ever done or not.&quot;

Irrational behavior, abnormal psychology and extreme emotional states are recurrent themes. Bradford writes, &quot;Issues such as guilt, hatred, self-loathing and unfulfilled longing which Highsmith endlessly contemplated without resolution became the cocktail for her fictional narratives and characters.&quot; Critic Russell Harrison states that Highsmith&#x27;s protagonists often act irrationally because of self-imposed emotional constraints. According to Graham Greene, &quot;Her characters are irrational and they leap to life in the very lack of reason; suddenly we realize how unbelievably rational most fictional characters are.&quot;

Highsmith explored issues of double, splintered and shifting identities. Wilson states that many of her novels involve a struggle between two men who search out an opposite but defining doppelgänger. Critic Fiona Peters points out that &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; and &quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot; involve protagonists who create false identities. Harrison argues: &quot;the theme of an individual transforming himself or herself, of the willed construction of a personality, once again suggest[s] existentialism&#x27;s emphasis on individual choice free of any hint of determinism through history or genetics.&quot;

Critic David Cochran sees Highsmith&#x27;s work as a critique of suburban America: &quot;According to the dominant vision, a family, house in the suburbs and successful job equalled mental health and happiness, whereas the absence of these things led to sickness. But Highsmith consistently worked to break down these oppositions too. Especially in her view of American men, Highsmith subverted many of the ideological bases of the suburban ideal.&quot;

Male homosexual desire was a subtext of many of Highsmith&#x27;s early works. Biographer Joan Schenkar states that the typical Highsmith situation is &quot;two men bound together psychologically by the stalker-like fixation of one upon the other, a fixation that always involves a disturbing, implicitly homoerotic fantasy.&quot; Highsmith explored lesbian relationships in &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;. Homosexuality was an important theme in later novels such as &quot;Found in the Street&quot; (1986) and &quot;Small g: a Summer Idyll&quot; (1995).

=== Style ===
Highsmith mostly wrote in the third-person singular from the point of view of the main character who is usually male. In several novels she alternates the point of view of two leading male characters. In 1966, she explained that a single point of view &quot;increased the intensity of a story&quot; whereas a double point of view brings a &quot;change of pace and mood.&quot;

Wilson calls Highsmith&#x27;s prose style crisp, compact and near transparent. Schenkar describes her narrative tone as a &quot;low, flat compellingly psychotic murmur.&quot; Wilson describes her tone as amoral, adding: &quot;The mundane and the trivial are described in the same pitch as the horrific and the sinister and it is this unsettling juxtaposition that gives her work such power.&quot;

Commentators have variously described the atmosphere evoked by Highsmith&#x27;s work as one of suspense, apprehension or unease. Graham Greene called her &quot;the poet of apprehension.&quot; Peters states: &quot;Highsmith&#x27;s forte is anxiety: rather than merely turning the page to discover what happens next – in other words to be held in a state of suspense – her readers are suspended in a haze of dread, anxiety and apprehension.&quot; Wilson argues that Highsmith disturbs her readers by manipulating them into identifying with unconventional psychologies: &quot;Highsmith&#x27;s world is seen through the distorted perspective of an &#x27;abnormal&#x27; man, but the style of writing is so transparent and flat that by the end the reader aligns himself with a point of view that is clearly unbalanced and disturbed.&quot;

=== Genre ===
Highsmith was usually classified as a crime, suspense or mystery writer in the United States, whereas in Europe she was considered a psychological or literary novelist. Peters argues that she does not fit comfortably within accepted genres. Bradford considers &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; a precursor to gothic realism. Harrison argues that psychological realism is not prominent in her work and judges &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; to be one of her most social realist novels. Some of her short stories, such as &quot;The Snail-Watcher,&quot; have been classified as horror.

<text>A palantír (; ) is one of several indestructible crystal balls from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s epic-fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The word comes from Quenya &#x27;far&#x27;, and &#x27;watch over&#x27;. The palantírs were used for communication and to see events in other parts of Arda, or in the past.

The palantírs were made by the Elves of Valinor in the First Age, as told in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. By the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at the end of the Third Age, a few palantírs remained in use. They are used in some climactic scenes by major characters: Sauron, Saruman, Denethor the Steward of Gondor, and two members of the Company of the Ring: Aragorn and Pippin.

A major theme of palantír usage is that while the stones show real objects or events, those using the stones had to &quot;possess great strength of will and of mind&quot; to direct the stone&#x27;s gaze to its full capability. The stones were an unreliable guide to action, since what was not shown could be more important than what was selectively presented. A risk lay in the fact that users with sufficient power could choose what to show and what to conceal to other stones: in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a palantír has fallen into the Enemy&#x27;s hands, making the usefulness of all other existing stones questionable. 

Commentators such as the Tolkien scholar Paul Kocher note the hand of providence in their usage, while Joseph Pearce compares Sauron&#x27;s use of the stones to broadcast wartime propaganda. Tom Shippey suggests that the message is that &quot;speculation&quot;, looking into any sort of magic mirror (Latin: &quot;speculum&quot;) or stone to see the future, rather than trusting in providence, leads to error.

== Fictional artifact ==

=== Origins ===

In Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the palantírs were made by the Elves of Valinor in the Uttermost West, by the Noldor, apparently by Fëanor himself from &quot;silima&quot;, &quot;that which shines&quot;. The number that he made is not stated, but there were at least eight of them. Seven of the stones given to Amandil of Númenor during the Second Age were saved by his son Elendil; he took them with him to Middle-earth, while at least the Master-stone remained behind.

Four were taken to Gondor, while three stayed in Arnor. Originally, the stones of Arnor were at Elostirion in the Tower Hills, Amon Sul (Weathertop), and Annuminas: the Elostirion stone, Elendil&#x27;s own, looked only Westwards from Middle-earth across the ocean to the Master-stone at the Tower of Avallonë upon Eressëa, an island off Valinor. The stones of Gondor were in Orthanc, Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, and Minas Ithil.

By the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the stone of Orthanc was in the hands of the wizard Saruman, while the stone of Minas Ithil, (by then Minas Morgul, the city of the Nazgûl), had been taken by the dark lord Sauron. That of Minas Tirith remained in the hands of the Steward of Gondor, Denethor. The stone of Osgiliath had been lost in the Anduin when the city was sacked. Gandalf names two of these as the and the .

=== Characteristics ===

A single palantír enabled its user to see places far off, or events in the past. A person could look into a palantír to communicate with anyone looking into another palantír. They could then see &quot;visions of the things in the mind&quot; of the person looking into the other stone.

The stones were made of a dark crystal, indestructible by any normal means, except perhaps the fire of Orodruin. They ranged in size from a diameter of about a foot (30 cm) to much larger stones that could not be lifted by one person. The Stone of Osgiliath had power over other stones including the ability to eavesdrop. The minor stones required one to move around them, thereby changing the viewpoint of its vision, whereas the major stones could be turned on their axis.

A wielder of great power such as Sauron could dominate a weaker user through the stone, which was the experience of Pippin Took and Saruman. Even one as powerful as Sauron could not make the palantírs &quot;lie&quot;, or create false images; the most he could do was to selectively display truthful images to create a false impression in the viewer&#x27;s mind. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, four such uses of the stones are described, and in each case, a true image is shown, but the viewer draws a false conclusion from the facts. This applies to Sauron when he sees Pippin in Saruman&#x27;s stone and assumes that Pippin has the One Ring, and that Saruman has therefore captured it. Denethor, too, is deceived through his use of a palantír, this time by Sauron, who drives Denethor to suicide by truthfully showing him the Black Fleet approaching Gondor, without telling him that the ships are crewed by Aragorn&#x27;s troops, coming to Gondor&#x27;s rescue. Shippey suggests that this consistent pattern is Tolkien&#x27;s way of telling the reader that one should not &quot;speculate&quot; – the word meaning both to try to double-guess the future, and to look into a mirror (Latin: &quot;speculum&quot; &#x27;glass or mirror&#x27;) or crystal ball – but should trust in one&#x27;s luck and make one&#x27;s own mind up, courageously facing one&#x27;s duty in each situation. 

The English literature scholar Paul Kocher similarly noted the hand of providence: Wormtongue&#x27;s throwing of the stone providentially leads to Pippin&#x27;s foolish look into the stone, which deceives Sauron; and it allows Aragorn to claim the stone and use it to deceive Sauron further. This leads him to assume that Aragorn has the One Ring. That in turn provokes Sauron into a whole series of what turn out to be disastrous actions: a premature attack on Minas Tirith; a rushed exit of the army of Minas Morgul, thus letting the hobbits through the pass of Cirith Ungol with the One Ring, and so on until the quest to destroy the ring succeeds against all odds.

The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance writes that Saruman&#x27;s sin, in Christian terms, is to seek Godlike knowledge by gazing in a short-sighted way into the Orthanc palantír in the hope of rivalling Sauron. She quotes Tolkien&#x27;s description in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, which states that Saruman explored &quot;all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his former wisdom&quot;. She explains that he is in this way giving up actual wisdom for &quot;mere knowledge&quot;, imagining the arts were his own but in fact coming from Sauron. This prideful self-aggrandisement leads to his fall. She notes that it is ironic in this context that palantír means &quot;far-sighted&quot;.

Joseph Pearce compares Sauron&#x27;s use of the seeing stones to &quot;broadcast propaganda and sow the seeds of despair among his enemies&quot; with the communications technologies used to spread propaganda in the Second World War and then the Cold War, when Tolkien was writing.

== In film ==

A palantír appears in the film director Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films. The Tolkien critic Allison Harl compares Jackson to Saruman, and his camera to a palantír, writing that &quot;Jackson chooses to look through the perilous lens, putting his camera to use to exert control over the [original Tolkien] text.&quot; Harl cites Laura Mulvey&#x27;s essay &quot;Visual Pleasure and the Narrative Cinema&quot; which describes &quot;scopophilia&quot;, the voyeuristic pleasure of looking, based on Sigmund Freud&#x27;s writings on sexuality. Harl gives as an example the sequence in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; where Jackson&#x27;s camera &quot;like the Evil Eye of Sauron&quot; travels towards Saruman&#x27;s tower, Isengard and &quot;zooms into the dangerous palantír&quot;, in her opinion giving the cinema viewer &quot;an omniscient and privileged perspective&quot; consisting of a Sauron-like power to observe the whole of Middle-earth. The sequence ends fittingly, in her opinion, with Mordor and the Eye of Sauron, bringing the viewer, like Saruman, to meet the Enemy&#x27;s gaze. As a consequence of Jackson&#x27;s exclusion of The Scouring of the Shire, Saruman is killed by Wormtongue much earlier (at the beginning of the extended edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;), while Gandalf acquires the Orthanc palantír after Pippin retrieves it from Saruman&#x27;s corpse, instead of having Wormtongue throw it from a window of the tower. Further, Sauron uses the Palantír to show Aragorn a dying Arwen, (a scene from the future) in the hope of weakening his resolve.

== Influence ==

The software data-collection company Palantir Technologies was named by its founder, Peter Thiel, after Tolkien&#x27;s seeing stones.

An astronomical telescope at the Lowell Observatory, using a main mirror with spherical curvature, has the acronym PALANTIR. This stands for Precision Array of Large-Aperture New Telescopes for Image Reconstruction, and is meant to reference the &quot;far-seeing stones in &quot;[The] Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="63692" wikidata="Q421163" url="?curid=63692" title="Α-Methyltryptamine">
<text>α-Methyltryptamine (αMT, AMT) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine family. It was originally developed as an antidepressant at Upjohn in the 1960s, and was used briefly as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union under the brand name Indopan or Indopane before being discontinued.
Side effects of αMT include agitation, , confusion, lethargy, pupil dilation, jaw clenching, and rapid heart rate, among others. αMT acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as a serotonin receptor agonist, and as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor. αMT is a substituted tryptamine and is closely related to α-ethyltryptamine (αET) and other α-alkylated tryptamines.
αMT appears to have first been described by at least 1929. It started being more studied in the late 1950s and was briefly used as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The drug started being used recreationally in the 1960s, with use increasing in the 1990s, and cases of death have been reported. αMT is a controlled substance in various countries, including the United States.

==Medical uses==
Under the brand name Indopan or Indopane, αMT at doses of 5 to 10mg was used for an antidepressant effect.

==Effects==
With 20 to 30mg, euphoria, empathy, and psychedelic effects become apparent and can last as long as 12hours. A dose exceeding 40mg is generally considered strong. In rare cases or extreme doses, the duration of effects might exceed 24hours. Users report that αMT in freebase form is smoked, with doses between and 2 and 5mg.

==Side effects==
Neurologic side effects of αMT include agitation, , confusion, and lethargy. Physical manifestations including vomiting, mydriasis (pupillary dilation), jaw clenching, tachycardia, salivation, diaphoresis (sweating), and elevations in blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate.

Side effects self-reported by recreational users include anxiety, muscle tension, jaw tightness, pupil dilation, tachycardia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, as well as psychedelic effects including visual hallucinations and an altered state of mind.

αMT is capable of causing life-threatening side effects including hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Fatalities have been reported in association with high doses or concomitant use of other drugs. Fatalities verified with toxicology and autopsy include those of a 22-year-old man in Miami-Dade county and a British teenager, both of whom died after consuming 1g of αMT.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
αMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.

====Monoamine oxidase inhibition====
αMT has been shown as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. In rats, the potency of αMT as an MAO-A inhibitor in the brain was approximately equal to that of harmaline at equimolar doses. Dextroamphetamine did not enhance the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced rise of serotonin at any level. The of αMT for inhibition of MAO-A has been found to be 380nM. This is similar to that of agents like &quot;para&quot;-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA).

====Serotonergic neurotoxicity====
A close analogue of αMT, α-ethyltryptamine (αET), is known to be a serotonergic neurotoxin similarly to MDMA and &quot;para&quot;-chloroamphetamine (PCA).

===Pharmacokinetics===
2-Oxo-αMT, 6-hydroxy-αMT, 7-hydroxy-αMT, and 1′-hydroxy-αMT were detected as metabolites of αMT in male Wistar rats.

==Chemistry==
αMT is a synthetic substituted tryptamine with a methyl substituent at the alpha carbon. This alpha substitution makes it a relatively poor substrate for monoamine oxidase A, thereby prolonging αMT&#x27;s half-life, allowing it to reach the brain and enter the central nervous system. Its chemical relation to tryptamine is analogous to that of amphetamine to phenethylamine, amphetamine being α-methylphenethylamine. αMT is closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) which partially explains its mechanism of action.

Many analogues of αMT are known, including α-ethyltryptamine (αET), 4-methyl-αMT, 5-chloro-αMT (PAL-542), 5-fluoro-αMT (PAL-544), 5-fluoro-αET (PAL-545), 5-methoxy-αMT (5-MeO-αMT), α,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (α,&quot;N&quot;-DMT; &quot;N&quot;-methyl-αMT), α,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-trimethyltryptamine (α,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-TMT; &quot;N&quot;-dimethyl-αMT), α-methylserotonin (α-methyl-5-HT; 5-hydroxy-αMT), and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP; α,&quot;N&quot;-dipropyltryptamine or α,&quot;N&quot;-DPT), among others. Another analogue of αMT is the β-keto and &quot;N&quot;-methylated derivative BK-NM-AMT.

α-Methyltryptophan, a prodrug of α-methylserotonin, also metabolizes into αMT, but only in small amounts.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of αMT can be accomplished through several different routes, the two most widely known being the nitroaldol condensation between indole-3-carboxaldehyde and nitroethane under ammonium acetate catalysis which produces 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1, the product can subsequently be reduced using a reducing agent like lithium aluminum hydride The alternative synthesis is the condensation between indole-3-acetone and hydroxylamine., followed by reduction of the obtained ketoxime with lithium aluminum hydride.

==History==
αMT has been said to have been first synthesized in 1947, alongside α-ethyltryptamine (αET). However, other sources suggest that αMT was first described in the scientific literature by at least 1929. It was specifically described as an antagonist of ergotamine at this time.

αMT started to be more intensively studied, along with αET, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was researched by Upjohn (code name U-14,164E) and Sandoz (code name IT-290) as a possible pharmaceutical drug and was simultaneously marketed in the Soviet Union as an antidepressant under the brand name Indopan or Indopane in the 1960s. However, the drug was used clinically for only a short period of time before being withdrawn.

αMT started being used as a recreational drug in the 1960s and use as a designer drug increased in the 1990s. It became a controlled substance in the United States in 2003.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
αMT never received a formal generic name. In the scientific literature, it has been referred to as &quot;α-methyltryptamine&quot; or &quot;alpha-methyltryptamine&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;α-MT&quot;, &quot;αMT&quot;, or &quot;AMT&quot;). αMT has also been referred to by developmental code names including &quot;IT-290&quot; (Sandoz), &quot;NSC-97069&quot;, &quot;PAL-17&quot;, &quot;Ro 3-0926&quot;, and &quot;U-14,164E&quot; (Upjohn). In the Soviet Union, the drug was merely referred to by its brand name &quot;Indopan&quot; or &quot;Indopane&quot;. Other synonyms of αMT include &quot;3-(2-aminopropyl)indole&quot; and &quot;3-IT&quot;. (+)-αMT has been referred to by the code name &quot;IT-403&quot;.

===Legality===

====Sweden====
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified αMT as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Mar 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as alfa-metyltryptamin (AMT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

====United Kingdom====
αMT was made illegal in the United Kingdom as of 7 January 2015, along with 5-MeO-DALT.
This was following the events of 10 June 2014 when the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that αMT be scheduled as a class A drug by updating the blanket ban clause on tryptamines.

====United States====
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) placed αMT temporarily in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) on April 4, 2003, pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the CSA (68 FR16427). On September 29, 2004, αMT was permanently controlled as a schedule I substance under the CSA (69FR 58050).

==Research==
Besides depression, αMT has been studied in people with schizophrenia and other conditions.

<doc id="63694" wikidata="Q593531" url="?curid=63694" title="Eärendil and Elwing">
<text>Eärendil () the Mariner and his wife Elwing are characters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. They are depicted in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as Half-elven, the children of Men and Elves. He is a great seafarer who, on his brow, carried the Morning Star, a jewel called a Silmaril, across the sky. The jewel had been saved by Elwing from the destruction of the Havens of Sirion. The Morning Star and the Silmarils are elements of the symbolism of light, for divine creativity, continually splintered as history progresses. Tolkien took Eärendil&#x27;s name from the Old English name Earendel, found in the poem &quot;Crist 1&quot;, which hailed him as &quot;brightest of angels&quot;; this was the beginning of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth mythology. Elwing is the granddaughter of Lúthien and Beren, and is descended from Melian the Maia, while Earendil is the son of Tuor and Idril. Through their progeny, Eärendil and Elwing became the ancestors of the Númenorean, and later Dúnedain, royal bloodline.

Eärendil is the subject, too, of the song in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sung and supposedly composed by Bilbo in Rivendell, described by Tom Shippey as exemplifying &quot;an elvish streak... signalled... by barely-precedented intricacies&quot; of poetry.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Eärendil&quot; means &#x27;Lover of the Sea&#x27; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Quenya. However, Tolkien borrowed the name from Old English literature, in particular from the line &quot;&quot; (Hail, Earendel, brightest of angels) of the poem &quot;Crist 1&quot;. Tolkien stated that the name came from the Old English name &quot;Ēarendel&quot;; he was struck by its &quot;great beauty&quot; c. 1913, which he perceived as &quot;entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not &#x27;delectable&#x27; language.&quot;. Elwing means &quot;Star-spray&quot; in the Elvish language Sindarin. &quot;Eärendil&quot; was originally spelled by Tolkien as &quot;Eärendel&quot;, before being modified.

== Fictional history ==

=== Background ===

Middle-earth was peopled in the First Age by immortal Elves, later followed by Men. The Elves became divided on their migrations, some settling in the Northwestern region called Beleriand. Fëanor, son of Finwë, the King of the Noldor, one branch of the Elves, had unique skill in craftsmanship, and forged three brilliant and highly prized jewels, the Silmarils, that shone like bright stars. The Dark Lord Morgoth desired the Silmarils for himself, and managed to seize them to put in his crown. There was enmity between Morgoth and the free peoples, Elves and Men.

=== Eärendil ===

Eärendil was the half-elven son of a Man, Tuor, and an Elf, Idril, daughter of Turgon, the King of the hidden Elvish city of Gondolin. He was raised in Gondolin; when he was seven years old, he escaped the sacking of Gondolin with his parents. Eärendil was almost killed by his mother&#x27;s treacherous cousin Maeglin, who had betrayed Gondolin to Morgoth; he was saved when his father killed Maeglin. Eärendil and his parents lived afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion.

Eärendil became the leader of the people who lived there, and married Elwing, the half-elven daughter of Dior and the Sindar elf-maid Nimloth. Another alliance between Man and Elf, the hero Beren and his Elvish bride Lúthien, were Elwing&#x27;s paternal grandparents. Eärendil and Elwing had two sons, Elrond and Elros.

With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, &quot;Vingilótë&quot; (Quenya for &quot;foam-flower&quot;). He often sailed the seas west of Middle-earth, leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had wrested from Morgoth. When Fëanor&#x27;s sons, who wanted the Silmarils back, heard about this, they attacked Arvernien and killed most of the people living there. Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the Silmaril into the sea. Next, according to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;:

Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after the home of the godlike and immortal Valar, Valinor, aboard the &quot;Vingilot&quot;, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot on Valinor. Eärendil then went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in Middle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; the Valar accepted his plea.

Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manwë, King of the Valar, refrained from dealing out the punishment of death that was due for entering Valinor. Also, because both Eärendil and Elwing descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined. Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves also. His ship, Vingilot (Quenya: &quot;Vingilótë&quot;), was placed in the heavens, and he sailed it &quot;even into the starless voids&quot;, but he returned at sunrise or sunset, glimmering in the sky as the Morning Star.

Eärendil&#x27;s son Elrond too chose elvish immortality, becoming known as Half-elven, and in the Third Age played an important role in The War of the Ring, as narrated in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Elros chose mortality, the gift of Men, founding the line of the Kings of Númenor; his descendant at the time of The War of the Ring was Aragorn, one of the Fellowship of the Ring, who married Elrond&#x27;s daughter, Arwen.

The Valar marched into the north of Middle-earth and attacked the Throne of Morgoth in the War of Wrath. Morgoth set loose a fleet of winged dragons, which drove the Valar back. Eärendil in Vingilot attacked, with Thorondor and his great eagles, and killed Ancalagon the Black, greatest of the dragons. Ancalagon fell on to Thangorodrim and broke its towers. The Valar won the battle, destroying the dragons and the pits of Angband, captured Morgoth, and took the two remaining Silmarils from his crown.

==Concept and creation==

=== The beginning of Tolkien&#x27;s mythology ===



Humphrey Carpenter, in his biography of Tolkien, remarked that Eärendil &quot;was in fact the beginning of Tolkien&#x27;s own mythology&quot;. In 1914, Tolkien wrote a poem &quot;The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Crist I&quot; poem. While studying at Oxford, Tolkien developed a constructed language that later became known as Quenya. Already around 1915 he had the idea that this language needed an internal history and was spoken by Elves whom his invented character Eärendil meets during his journeys. The next step in the creation of the underlying mythology was the &quot;Lay of Earendel&quot;, a work composed of several poems that describes the mariner Earendel and his voyages and how his ship is turned into a star. The mysterious land of Valinor and its Two Trees shining gold and silver across the land were first described in this cycle. The poem was published in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales 2&quot;.

Tolkien was aware of the name&#x27;s Germanic cognates (Old Norse &quot;Aurvandill&quot;, Lombardic &quot;Auriwandalo&quot;); the question why the Old English rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. The Old Norse together with the Old English evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars; the Old English in particular points to the morning star as the herald of the rising Sun, Christianized to refer to John the Baptist. Tolkien stated in a 1967 letter that the Old English uses of &quot;seem plainly to indicate that it was a star presaging the dawn... that is what we now call &quot;Venus&quot;: the morning star as it may be seen shining brilliantly in the dawn, before the actual rising of the sun. That is at any rate how I took it [when creating Eärendil as a mariner and &quot;a herald star&quot;].&quot;

Tolkien was particularly inspired by the &quot;Crist&quot; lines:

The first of the &quot;Crist&quot; lines is parallelled by Frodo Baggins&#x27;s exclamation in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, &quot;Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!&quot;, which in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Quenya means, &quot;Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!&quot; Frodo&#x27;s exclamation was in reference to the &quot;Star-glass&quot; he carried, the Phial of Galadriel, which contained a little of the light of Eärendil&#x27;s star, the Silmaril.

These lines from &quot;Crist&quot; can be taken as the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien&#x27;s work from as early as 1914, but for the term Middle-earth (translating Old English &quot;Middangeard&quot;) for the inhabitable lands (c.f. Midgard). Accordingly, the medievalists Stuart D. Lee and Elizabeth Solopova state that &quot;Crist A&quot; was &quot;the catalyst for Tolkien&#x27;s mythology&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes in her 1983 book &quot;Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien&#x27;s World&quot; that a central theme of Tolkien&#x27;s writing is the progressive fragmentation of the light from the moment of the creation; light symbolises both the divine creation and the author&#x27;s subcreation.

The light begins in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as a unity, and in accordance with the splintering of creation is divided into more and more fragments as the myth progresses. Middle-earth is peopled by the angelic Valar and lit by two great lamps; when these are destroyed by the fallen Vala Melkor, the world is fragmented, and the Valar retreat to Valinor, which is lit by The Two Trees. When these too are destroyed, their last fragment of light is made into the Silmarils, and a sapling too is rescued, leading to the White Tree of Númenor, the living symbol of the Kingdom of Gondor. Wars are fought over the Silmarils, and they are lost to the Earth, the Sea, and the Sky.

The last of the Silmarils, carried by Eärendil the Mariner, becomes the Morning Star as he sails across the sky with the shining jewel in his ship Vingilot. By the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in the Third Age, that is all that is left of the light. Some of the star&#x27;s light is captured in Galadriel&#x27;s Mirror, the magic fountain that allows her to see past, present, and future; and some of that light is, finally, trapped in the Phial of Galadriel, her parting gift to Frodo, the counterbalance to Sauron&#x27;s evil and powerful Ring that Frodo is also carrying. At each stage, the fragmentation increases and the power decreases. Thus the theme of light as Divine power, fragmented and refracted through the works of created beings, is central to the whole mythology.

=== Wade ===

The Tolkien scholar Tibor Tarcsay writes that Eärendil is based not only on Old English but also Indo-European and universal myths. Wade has power over the sea and superhuman strength, while numerous other mythical Indo-European figures share Eärendil&#x27;s conjunction of water, boat or horse, and herald or star, such as Surya, the sun-god of the Vedas, or Apollo with his horse-drawn chariot which pulls the sun across the sky. Vingilot is mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale&quot; as the name of Wade&#x27;s ship; Wade is in turn mentioned in the Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot;, while Sir Gawain&#x27;s horse has a name similar to Vingilot, Gryngolet. 
Christopher Tolkien, too, noted the matching boat-names, Guingelot for Wade and Wingelot for Earendel, and stated that the link between Wade and Tuor was &quot;not casual&quot;, which Flieger takes to mean, certainly intentional. Flieger notes further that in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; 15, Tolkien unambiguously wrote &quot;Wade = Earendel&quot;.

=== Echoes of other legends ===

Tolkien&#x27;s legend of Eärendil has elements resembling the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; or the Christian legend of St. Brendan the Navigator.

=== The long-suffering woman ===

Elwing&#x27;s staying at home waiting for her husband to return from his vain voyages across the ocean echoes the literary motif of the &quot;long-suffering woman&quot;. The choice of fate offered by the Valar to Eärendil and Elwing, resulting in both of them becoming immortal Elves, has been interpreted as a move of Tolkien to solve &quot;several untidy plot points in one fell swoop&quot;: being Half-elven, neither of the two would have been allowed to set foot in the land of the Valar, nor was their eventual fate determined since in Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium Men are mortal, while Elves will live until the world is undone. The metamorphosis of the couple continues as Eärendil&#x27;s ship is transformed into a flying vessel, so he can continue his journeys in the sky rather than at sea. Still now, Elwing will remain at home, but she is granted a white tower to dwell in.

== &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot; ==

The longest poem in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is the &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot; which Bilbo sings, and supposedly composed, at Rivendell. This poem has an extraordinarily complex history, deriving through many versions from his light-hearted poem &quot;Errantry&quot;. The &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot; is described by Tom Shippey as exemplifying &quot;an elvish streak .. signalled .. by barely-precedented intricacies&quot; of poetry, an approach derived from the Middle English poem &quot;Pearl&quot;. The song was recorded by The Tolkien Ensemble on their 2005 CD &quot;Leaving Rivendell&quot;.

<text>The carpal bones are the eight small bones that make up the wrist (carpus) that connects the hand to the forearm. The terms &quot;carpus&quot; and &quot;carpal&quot; are derived from the Latin and the Greek (karpós), meaning &quot;wrist&quot;. In human anatomy, the main role of the carpal bones is to articulate with the radial and ulnar heads to form a highly mobile condyloid joint (i.e. wrist joint), to provide attachments for thenar and hypothenar muscles, and to form part of the rigid carpal tunnel which allows the median nerve and tendons of the anterior forearm muscles to be transmitted to the hand and fingers.

In tetrapods, the carpus is the sole cluster of bones in the wrist between the radius and ulna and the metacarpus. The bones of the carpus do not belong to individual fingers (or toes in quadrupeds), whereas those of the metacarpus do. The corresponding part of the foot is the tarsus. The carpal bones allow the wrist to move and rotate vertically.

==Structure==
===Bones===
The eight carpal bones may be conceptually organized as either two transverse rows, or three longitudinal columns.

When considered as paired rows, each row forms an arch which is convex proximally and concave distally. On the palmar side, the carpus is concave and forms the carpal tunnel, which is covered by the flexor retinaculum. The proximal row comprises the scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, and pisiform bones which articulate with the surfaces of the radius and distal carpal row, and thus constantly adapts to these mobile surfaces. Within the proximal row, each carpal bone has slight independent mobility. For example, the scaphoid contributes to midcarpal stability by articulating distally with the trapezium and the trapezoid. In contrast, the distal row is more rigid as its transverse arch moves with the metacarpals.

Biomechanically and clinically, the carpal bones are better conceptualized as three longitudinal columns:
# Radial scaphoid column: scaphoid, trapezium, and trapezoid
# Lunate column: lunate and capitate
# Ulnar triquetral column: triquetrum and hamate
In this context the pisiform is regarded as a sesamoid bone embedded in the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The ulnar column leaves a gap between the ulna and the triquetrum, and therefore, only the radial or scaphoid and central or capitate columns articulate with the radius. The wrist is more stable in flexion than in extension more because of the strength of various capsules and ligaments than the interlocking parts of the skeleton.

Almost all carpals (except the pisiform) have six surfaces. Of these the &quot;palmar&quot; or &quot;anterior&quot; and the &quot;dorsal&quot; or &quot;posterior surfaces&quot; are rough, for ligamentous attachment; the dorsal surfaces being the broader, except in the lunate.

The &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;proximal,&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;distal surfaces&quot; are articular, the superior generally convex, the inferior concave; the &quot;medial&quot; and &quot;lateral surfaces&quot; are also articular where they are in contact with contiguous bones, otherwise they are rough and tuberculated.

The structure in all is similar: cancellous tissue enclosed in a layer of compact bone.

===Joints===

=== Accessory bones ===
Occasionally accessory bones are found in the carpus, but of more than 20 such described bones, only four (the central, styloid, secondary trapezoid, and secondary pisiform bones) are considered to be proven accessory bones. Sometimes the scaphoid, triquetrum, and pisiform bones are divided into two.
==Development==
The carpal bones are ossified endochondrally (from within the cartilage) and the ossific centers appear only after birth.

The formation of these centers roughly follows a chronological spiral pattern starting in the capitate and hamate during the first year of life. The ulnar bones are then ossified before the radial bones, while the sesamoid pisiform arises in the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris after more than ten years.
 The commencement of ossification for each bone occurs over period like other bones. This is useful in forensic age estimation.

==Function==

=== Ligaments ===

There are four groups of ligaments in the region of the wrist:
# The ligaments of the wrist proper which unite the ulna and radius with the carpus: the ulnar and radial collateral ligaments; the palmar and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments; and the palmar ulnocarpal ligament. (Shown in blue in the figure.)
# The ligaments of the intercarpal articulations which unite the carpal bones with one another: the radiate carpal ligament; the dorsal, palmar, and interosseous intercarpal ligaments; and the pisohamate ligament. (Shown in red in the figure.)
# The ligaments of the carpometacarpal articulations which unite the carpal bones with the metacarpal bones: the pisometacarpal ligament and the palmar and dorsal carpometacarpal ligaments. (Shown in green in the figure.)
# The ligaments of the intermetacarpal articulations which unite the metacarpal bones: the dorsal, interosseous, and palmar metacarpal ligaments. (Shown in yellow in the figure.)

=== Movements ===

The hand is said to be in straight position when the third finger runs over the capitate bone and is in a straight line with the forearm. This should not be confused with the midposition of the hand which corresponds to an ulnar deviation of 12 degrees. From the straight position two pairs of movements of the hand are possible: abduction (movement towards the radius, so called radial deviation or abduction) of 15 degrees and adduction (movement towards the ulna, so called ulnar deviation or adduction) of 40 degrees when the arm is in strict supination and slightly greater in strict pronation.

Flexion (tilting towards the palm, so called palmar flexion) and extension (tilting towards the back of the hand, so called dorsiflexion) is possible with a total range of 170 degrees.
==== Radial abduction/ulnar adduction ====
During radial abduction the scaphoid is tilted towards the palmar side which allows the trapezium and trapezoid to approach the radius. Because the trapezoid is rigidly attached to the second metacarpal bone to which also the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis are attached, radial abduction effectively pulls this combined structure towards the radius. During radial abduction the pisiform traverses the greatest path of all carpal bones.

Radial abduction is produced by (in order of importance) extensor carpi radialis longus, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis longus, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor pollicis longus.
Ulnar adduction causes a tilting or dorsal shifting of the proximal row of carpal bones.
It is produced by extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum, and extensor digiti minimi.

Both radial abduction and ulnar adduction occurs around a dorsopalmar axis running through the head of the capitate bone.
==== Palmar flexion/dorsiflexion ====
During palmar flexion the proximal carpal bones are displaced towards the &quot;dorsal&quot; side and towards the &quot;palmar&quot; side during dorsiflexion. While flexion and extension consist of movements around a pair of transverse axes — passing through the lunate bone for the proximal row and through the capitate bone for the distal row — palmar flexion occurs mainly in the radiocarpal joint and dorsiflexion in the midcarpal joint.
Dorsiflexion is produced by (in order of importance) extensor digitorum, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor indicis, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor digiti minimi. Palmar flexion is produced by (in order of importance) flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor pollicis longus, flexor carpi radialis, and abductor pollicis longus.
==== Combined movements ====
Combined with movements in both the elbow and shoulder joints, intermediate or combined movements in the wrist approximate those of a ball-and-socket joint with some necessary restrictions, such as maximum palmar flexion blocking abduction.

==== Accessory movements ====
Anteroposterior gliding movements between adjacent carpal bones or along the midcarpal joint can be achieved by stabilizing individual bones while moving another (i.e. gripping the bone between the thumb and index finger).
== Other animals==

The structure of the carpus varies widely between different groups of tetrapods, even among those that retain the full set of five digits. In primitive fossil amphibians, such as &quot;Eryops&quot;, the carpus consists of three rows of bones; a proximal row of three carpals, a second row of four bones, and a distal row of five bones. The proximal carpals are referred to as the radiale, intermedium, and ulnare, after their proximal articulations, and are homologous with the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral bones respectively. The remaining bones are simply numbered, as the first to fourth centralia (singular: centrale), and the first to fifth distal carpals. Primitively, each of the distal bones appears to have articulated with a single metacarpal.

However, the vast majority of later vertebrates, including modern amphibians, have undergone varying degrees of loss and fusion of these primitive bones, resulting in a smaller number of carpals. Almost all mammals and reptiles, for example, have lost the fifth distal carpal, and have only a single centrale - and even this is missing in humans. The pisiform bone is somewhat unusual, in that it first appears in primitive reptiles, and is never found in amphibians.

Because many tetrapods have fewer than five digits on the forelimb, even greater degrees of fusion are common, and a huge array of different possible combinations are found. The wing of a modern bird, for example, has only two remaining carpals; the radiale (the scaphoid of mammals) and a bone formed from the fusion of four of the distal carpals.

The carpus and tarsus are both described as podial elements or (clusters of) podial bones.

In some macropods, the scaphoid and lunar bones are fused into the scapholunar bone.

In crustaceans, &quot;carpus&quot; is the scientific term for the claws or &quot;pincers&quot; present on some legs. (See Decapod anatomy)

== Etymology ==
The Latin word &quot;carpus&quot; is derived from Greek meaning &quot;wrist&quot;. The root &quot;carp-&quot; translates to &quot;&quot;, an action performed by the wrist.

<text>William Halse Rivers Rivers (12 March 1864 – 4 June 1922) was an English anthropologist, neurologist, ethnologist and psychiatrist known for treatment of First World War officers suffering shell shock, so they could be returned to combat. Rivers&#x27; most famous patient was the war poet Siegfried Sassoon, with whom he remained close friends until his own sudden death.

During the early years of the 20th century, Rivers developed new lines of psychological research. He was the first to use a double-blind procedure in investigating physical and psychological effects of consumption of tea, coffee, alcohol and drugs. For a time he directed centres for psychological studies at two colleges, and he was made a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He also participated in the Torres Strait Islands expedition of 1898 and his consequent work on the subject of kinship.

==Biography==

===Family background===

W. H. R. Rivers was born in 1864 at Constitution Hill, Chatham, Kent, son of Elizabeth (née Hunt) (16 October 1834 – 13 November 1897) and Henry Frederick Rivers (7 January 1830 – 9 December 1911).

Records from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries show the Rivers family to be solidly middle-class, with many Cambridge, Church of England and Royal Navy associations. Notable members were Gunner William Rivers and his son, Midshipman William Rivers, both of whom served aboard HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, Nelson&#x27;s flagship.

The senior Rivers was the master gunner aboard the &quot;Victory&quot;. He kept a commonplace book (now held in the Royal Naval Museum library in Portsmouth); it has revealed and preserved the thoughts of many of the sailors aboard the &quot;Victory.&quot;

His son Midshipman Rivers, who claimed to be &quot;the man who shot the man who fatally wounded Lord Nelson&quot;, was a model of heroism in the Battle of Trafalgar. The seventeen-year-old midshipman nearly lost his foot when it was struck by a grenade; it was attached to him only &quot;by a Piece of Skin abought 4 inch above the ankle&quot;. Rivers asked first for his shoes, then told the gunner&#x27;s mate to look after the guns, and told Captain Hardy that he was going down to the cockpit. He endured the amputation of his leg four inches below the knee, without anaesthetic. According to legend, he did not cry out once during that nor during the consequent sealing of the wound with hot tar. When Gunner Rivers, anxious about his son&#x27;s welfare, went to the cockpit to ask after him, his son called out, &quot;Here I am, Father, nothing is the matter with me; only lost my leg and that in a good cause.&quot;

After the battle, the senior Rivers wrote a poem about his remarkable son, entitled &quot;Lines on a Young Gentleman that lost his leg onboard the Victory in the Glorious action at Trafalgar&quot;:

Born to Lieutenant William Rivers, R.N., and his wife, stationed at Deptford, Henry Frederick Rivers followed many family traditions in being educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and entering the church. Having earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1857, he was ordained as a Church of England priest in 1858, and had a career that would span almost 50 years. In 1904, he was forced to tender his resignation due to &quot;infirmities of sight and memory&quot;.

In 1863, having obtained a curacy at Chatham in addition to a chaplaincy of the Medway Union, Henry Rivers was sufficiently established to marry Elizabeth Hunt, who was living with her brother James in Hastings, not far from Chatham. He was later appointed to curacies in Kent at St Mary&#x27;s, Chatham (1863–69), Tudeley (1877–80) and Offham (1880–9), and subsequently as Vicar of St Faith&#x27;s, Maidstone from 1889 to 1904.

The Hunts, like the Rivers family, were established with naval and Church of England connections. One of those destined for the pulpit was Thomas (1802–1851), but some quirk of originality set him off into an unusual career. While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Thomas Hunt had a friend who stammered badly and his efforts to aid the affected student led him to leave the university without taking a degree in order to make a thorough study of speech and its defects. He built up a good practice as a speech therapist and was patronised by Sir John Forbes MD FRS. Forbes referred pupils to him for twenty-four years. Hunt&#x27;s most famous case came about in 1842. George Pearson, the chief witness in a case related to an attempted attack on Queen Victoria by John Francis, was brought into court but was incapable of giving his evidence. After a fortnight&#x27;s instruction from Hunt, he spoke easily, a fact certified by the sitting magistrate. Hunt died in 1851, survived by his wife Mary and their two children. His practice was passed on to his son, James.

James Hunt (1833–1869) was an exuberant character, giving to each of his ventures his boundless energy and self-confidence. Taking up his father&#x27;s legacy with great zeal, by the age of 21 Hunt had published his compendious work &quot;Stammering and Stuttering, Their Nature and Treatment&quot;. This went into six editions during his lifetime and was reprinted again in 1870, just after his death, and for an eighth time in 1967 as a landmark in the history of speech therapy. In the introduction to the 1967 edition of the book, Elliot Schaffer notes that in his short lifetime, James Hunt is said to have treated over 1,700 cases of speech impediment, firstly in his father&#x27;s practice and later at his own institute, Ore House near Hastings. He set up the latter with the aid of a doctorate he had purchased in 1856 from the University of Giessen in Germany.

In later, expanded editions, &quot;Stammering and Stuttering&quot; begins to reflect Hunt&#x27;s growing passion for anthropology, exploring the nature of language usage and speech disorders in non-European peoples. In 1856, Hunt had joined the Ethnological Society of London and by 1859 he was its joint secretary. But many of the members disliked his attacks on the religious and humanitarian agencies represented by missionaries and the anti-slavery movement.

As a result of the antagonism, Hunt founded the Anthropological Society and became its president. Nearly 60 years later, his nephew W. He. R. Rivers was selected for this position. Hunt&#x27;s efforts were integral to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) accepting anthropology in 1866 as a discipline.

Even by Victorian standards, Hunt was a decided racist. His paper &quot;On a Negro&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot;, delivered before the BAAS in 1863, was met with hisses and catcalls. What Hunt considered &quot;a statement of the simple facts&quot; was thought by others to be a defence of the subjection and slavery of Africans in the Americas, and support of the belief in the plurality of human species.

In addition to his extremist views, Hunt led the society to incur heavy debts. The controversies surrounding his conduct told on his health and, on 29 August 1869, Hunt died of &quot;inflammation of the brain&quot;. He was survived by his widow, Henrietta Maria, and five children.

His speech therapy practice was passed onto Hunt&#x27;s brother-in-law, Henry Rivers, who had been working with him for some time. Rivers inherited many of Hunt&#x27;s established patients, most notably The Reverend Charles L. Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll), who had been a regular visitor to Ore House.

Hunt left his books to his nephew William Rivers, who refused them, thinking that they would be of no use to him.

===Early life===
William Halse Rivers Rivers was the oldest of four children, with his siblings being brother Charles Hay (29 August 1865 – 8 November 1939) and sisters Ethel Marian (30 October 1867 – 4 February 1943) and Katharine Elizabeth (1871–1939).

William, known as &quot;Willie&quot; throughout his childhood, appears to have been named after his famous uncle of &quot;Victory&quot; fame; there was also a longstanding family tradition whereby the eldest son of every line would be baptised by that name. The origin of &quot;Halse&quot; is unclear. There may be some naval connection, as it has been suggested that it could have been the name of someone serving alongside his uncle. Slobodin states that it is probable that the second &quot;Rivers&quot; entered his name as a result of a clerical error on the baptismal certificate, but since the register is filled in by his father&#x27;s hand, and his father performed the ceremony, this seems unlikely. Slobodin notes a mistake on the registry of his birth, but it is that his name was changed from the mistaken &quot;William False Rivers Rivers&quot; to its later form, with &quot;Halse&quot; as the second name. This suggests that &quot;Rivers&quot; was intended as a given name as well as a surname.

Rivers had a stammer that he never fully conquered. He had no sensory memory, although he was able to visualise to an extent if dreaming, in a half-waking, half-sleeping state, or when feverish. Rivers noted that in his early life- specifically before the age of five- his visual imagery was far more definite than it became in later life. He thought it was perhaps as good as that of the average child.

At first, Rivers had concluded that his loss of visual imagery had resulted from his lack of attention and interest in it. But, as he later came to realise, while images from his later life frequently faded into obscurity, those from his infancy still remained vivid.

As Rivers notes in &quot;Instinct and the Unconscious&quot;, he was unable to visualise any part of the upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. By contrast, Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than he had been able to with any house since. Although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. Given evidence, Rivers came to conclude that something had happened to him on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it &quot;interfered with [his] comfort and happiness&quot;. In addition to that specific memory being inaccessible, his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely disabled from that moment.

If Rivers ever did access the veiled memory, he did not appear to make a note of it. The nature of the experience is open to conjecture. Author Pat Barker, in the second novel of her &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot; related to Rivers and his work, &quot;The Eye in the Door&quot;, suggested through her character Billy Prior, that Rivers&#x27;s experience was traumatic enough to cause him to &quot;put his mind&#x27;s eye out&quot;.

Rivers was a highly able child. Educated first at a Brighton preparatory school and, from the age of thirteen, as a dayboy at the prestigious Tonbridge School, his academic abilities were noted from an early age. At the age of 14, he was placed a year above others of his age at school and even within this older group he was seen to excel, winning prizes for Classics and all around attainment. Rivers&#x27;s younger brother Charles was also a high achiever at the school; he too was awarded with the Good Work prize. He studied and became a civil engineer. After a bad bout of malaria contracted whilst in the Torres Straits with his brother, he was encouraged by the elder Rivers to take up outdoor work.

The teenage Rivers, whilst scholarly, was also involved in other aspects of school life. As the programme for the Tonbridge School sports day notes, on 12 March 1880 – Rivers&#x27;s sixteenth birthday – he ran in the mile race. The year before this he had been elected as a member of the school debating society, no mean feat for a boy who at this time had a speech impediment which was almost paralytic.

Rivers was set to follow family tradition and take his University of Cambridge entrance exam, possibly with the aim of studying classics. But at the age of sixteen, he contracted typhoid fever and was forced to miss his final year of school. Without the scholarship, his family could not afford to send him to Cambridge. With his typical resilience, Rivers did not dwell on the disappointment.

His illness had been severe, entailing long convalescence and leaving him with effects which at times severely disabled him. As L. E. Shore notes: &quot;he was not a strong man, and was often obliged to take a few days rest in bed and subsist on a milk diet&quot;. The severity of the sickness and the shattering of dreams might have broken lesser men but for Rivers in many ways the illness was the making of him. Whilst recovering from the fever, Rivers had formed a friendship with one of his father&#x27;s speech therapy students, a young Army surgeon. His plan was formed: he would study medicine and apply for training in the Army Medical Department, later to become the Royal Army Medical Corps.

Inspired by this new resolve, Rivers studied medicine at the University of London, where he matriculated in 1882, and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. He graduated at age 22, the youngest person to do so until recent times.

===Life as a ship&#x27;s surgeon===
After qualifying, Rivers sought to join the army but was not passed fit. This was a byproduct of typhoid fever. As Elliot Smith was later to write, as quoted in a biography of Rivers: &quot;Rivers always had to fight against ill health: heart and blood vessels.&quot; Along with the health problems noted by Shore and Smith, Rivers struggled with &quot;tiring easily&quot;.

His sister Katharine wrote that when he came to visit the family, he would often sleep for the first day or two. Considering the volume of work that Rivers completed in his relatively short lifetime, Seligman wrote in 1922 that &quot;for many years he seldom worked for more than four hours a day&quot;. Rivers&#x27;s biographer Richard Slobodin says that &quot;among persons of extraordinary achievement, only Descartes seems to have put in as short a working day&quot;.

Rivers did not allow his drawbacks to dishearten him, and he chose to serve several terms as a ship&#x27;s surgeon, travelling to Japan and North America in 1887. This was the first of many voyages; for, besides his great expeditions for work in the Torres Straits Islands, Melanesia, Egypt, India and the Solomon Islands, he took holiday voyages twice to the West Indies, three times to the Canary Islands and Madeira, to the United States, Norway, and Lisbon, as well as making numerous visits to France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, and lengthy ones to visit family in Australia.

Such voyages helped to improve his health, and possibly to prolong his life. He also took a great deal of pleasure from his experiences aboard ship. On one voyage he spent a month in the company of playwright George Bernard Shaw; he later described how he spent &quot;many hours every day talking – the greatest treat of my life&quot;.

==Beginnings of career in psychology==
Back in England, Rivers earned an M.D. (London) and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Soon after, he became house surgeon at the Chichester Infirmary (1887–1889). Although he enjoyed the town and the company of his colleagues, an appointment at Bart&#x27;s and the opportunity to return to working in research in medicine was more appealing. He became house physician at St Bartholomew&#x27;s in 1889 and remained there until 1890.

At Bart&#x27;s, Rivers had been a physician to Samuel Gee. Those under Gee were conscious of his indifference towards, if not outright dislike of, the psychological aspects of medicine. Walter Langdon-Brown surmises that Rivers and his fellow Charles S. Myers devoted themselves to these aspects in reaction to Gee.

Rivers&#x27;s interests in neurology and psychology became evident in this period. Reports and papers given by Rivers at the Abernethian Society of St Bart&#x27;s indicate a growing specialisation in these fields: &quot;Delirium and its allied conditions&quot; (1889), &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1891) and &quot;Neurasthenia&quot; (1893).

Following the direction of his passion for the workings of the mind as it correlates with the workings of the body, in 1891 Rivers became house physician at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic. Here he and Henry Head met and formed a lasting friendship.

Rivers&#x27;s interest in the physiology of the nervous system and in &quot;the mind&quot;, that is, in sensory phenomena and mental states, was further stimulated by work in 1891. He was chosen to be one of Victor Horsley&#x27;s assistants in a series of investigations at University College London that explored the existence and nature of electrical currents in the mammalian brain. His selection for this work demonstrated his growing reputation as a researcher.

In the same year, Rivers joined the Neurological Society of London and presented &quot;A Case of Treadler&#x27;s Cramp&quot; to a meeting of the society. The case demonstrated the ill effects of what is understood as repetitive motion injury. Such injuries sustained by factory workers, against which they had little protection or compensation, were part of the cost for millions of people of Britain&#x27;s industrial supremacy.

Resigning from the National Hospital in 1892, Rivers travelled to Jena to expand his knowledge of experimental psychology. Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures on both psychology and philosophy. He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, picture galleries, church services, and education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement. In this diary he also wrote that: &quot;I have during the last three weeks come to the conclusion that I should go in for insanity when I return to England and work as much as possible at psychology.&quot;

After his return to England, he became a Clinical Assistant at the Bethlem Royal Hospital. In 1893, at the request of G. H Savage, he began assisting with lectures in mental diseases at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, emphasising their psychological aspect. At about the same time, invited by Professor Sully, he began to lecture on experimental psychology at University College, London.

By 1893, when he was unexpectedly invited to lecture in Cambridge on the functions of the sense organs, he was already deeply read in the subject. He had been captivated by Head&#x27;s accounts of the works of Ewald Hering, and had avidly absorbed his views on colour vision and the nature of vital processes in living matter. He also prepared for this project by spending the summer working in Heidelberg with Emil Kraepelin on measuring the effects of fatigue.

The offer of a Cambridge lectureship resulted from continuing evolution within the university&#x27;s Natural Science Tripos. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, had examined subject and reported unfavourably on the scant knowledge of the special senses that was displayed by the candidates; to correct this, Sir Michael Foster appointed Rivers as a lecturer. He became Fellow Commoner at St John&#x27;s College. He was made a Fellow of the college in 1902.

Rivers was stretched in his work, as he still had ongoing teaching commitments at Guy&#x27;s hospital and at University College. In addition to these mounting responsibilities, in 1897 he was put in temporary charge of the new psychological laboratory at University College. That year Foster had assigned him a room in the Physiology Department at Cambridge for use in psychological research. As a result, Rivers is listed in the histories of experimental psychology as simultaneously the director of the first two psychological laboratories in Britain.

Rivers&#x27;s work has been considered to have profound influence on Cambridge and in the scientific world in general. But, at the time, the Cambridge University Senate were wary of his appointment. Bartlett wrote: &quot;how many times have I heard Rivers, spectacles waving in the air, his face lit by his transforming smile, tell how, in Senatorial discussion, an ancient orator described him as a &#x27;Ridiculous Superfluity&#x27;!&quot;

The opposition of the Senate resulted in limited support for Rivers&#x27;s work in its early years. It was not until 1901, eight years after his appointment, that he was allowed the use of a small cottage for the laboratory, and budgeted thirty-five pounds annually (later increased to fifty) for purchase and upkeep of equipment. For several years Rivers continued in this way until the Moral Science Board increased support; in 1903, Rivers and his assistants and students moved to another small building in St Tibbs Row. These working spaces were characterised as &quot;dismal&quot;, &quot;damp, dark and ill-ventilated&quot; but they did not discourage the Cambridge psychologists. Psychology began to thrive: &quot;perhaps, in the early days of scientific progress, a subject often grows all the more surely if its workers have to meet difficulties, improvise their apparatus, and rub very close shoulders one with another.&quot; In 1912 a well-equipped laboratory was finally built under the directorship of Charles S. Myers, one of Rivers&#x27;s earliest and ablest pupils. A wealthy man, he supplemented the university grant with his own funds.
The Cambridge psychologists and Rivers were initially most interested in the special senses: colour vision, optical illusions, sound-reactions, and perceptual processes. In these fields, Rivers was rapidly becoming eminent. He was invited to write a chapter on vision for Schäfer&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Physiology&quot;. According to Bartlett, Rivers&#x27;s chapter &quot;still remains, from a psychological point of view, one of the best in the English Language&quot;. Rivers reviewed the work of previous investigators, incorporated his own, and critically examined the rival theories of colour vision. He noted clearly the significance of psychological factors in, for instance, the phenomena of contrast.

For his own experiments on vision, Rivers worked with graduate medical students Charles S. Myers and William McDougall. They assisted him and developed close friendships in the process of working together. Rivers also collaborated with Sir Horace Darwin, a pioneer instrument maker, to improve apparatus for recording sensations, especially those involved in vision. This collaboration also resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two men.

In this period, Rivers also investigated the influence of stimulants: tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and a number of other drugs, on a person&#x27;s capacity for both physical and mental work. His work under Kraepelin at Heidelberg had prepared him for this work. Rivers conducted some experiments on himself, for instance for two years giving up alcoholic beverages and tobacco, neither of which he liked, but also giving up all tea, coffee and cocoa as well. Initially he intended to explore physiological incentives for consuming these products, but he quickly realized that a strong psychological influence contributed to taking the substances.

Rivers realised that part of the effects – mental and physical – that substances had were caused psychologically by the excitement of knowing that one is indulging. In order, to eliminate &quot;all possible effects of suggestion, sensory stimulation and interest&quot;, Rivers ensured that the substances were disguised so that he could not ascertain, in any instance, whether he was taking a drug or a control substance. This was the first experiment of its kind to use this double-blind procedure. As a result of the importance attached to the study, Rivers was appointed in 1906 as Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians.

In December 1897 Rivers&#x27;s achievements were recognised by the University of Cambridge who honoured him with the degree of M.A. &quot;honoris causa&quot; and, in 1904 with the assistance of Professor James Ward, Rivers made a further mark on the world of psychological sciences, founding and subsequently editing the British Journal of Psychology.

Despite his many successes, Rivers was still a markedly reticent man in mixed company, hampered as he was by his stammer and innate shyness. In 1897, Langdon-Brown invited Rivers to come and address the Abernethian Society. The occasion was not an unqualified success. He chose &quot;Fatigue&quot; as his subject, and before he had finished his title was writ large on the faces of his audience. In the Cambridge physiological laboratory too he had to lecture to a large elementary class. He was rather nervous about it, and did not like it, his hesitation of speech made his style dry and he had not yet acquired the art of expressing his original ideas in an attractive form, except in private conversation.

Among two or three friends, however, the picture of Rivers is quite different. His conversations were full of interest and illumination; &quot;he was always out to elicit the truth, entirely sincere, and disdainful of mere dialect.&quot; His insistence on veracity made him a formidable researcher, as Haddon puts it, &quot;the keynote of Rivers was thoroughness. Keenness of thought and precision marked all his work.&quot; His research was distinguished by a fidelity to the demands of experimental method very rare in the realms which he was exploring and, although often overlooked, the work that Rivers did in this early period is of immense import as it formed the foundation of all that came later.

==Torres Straits expedition==
Rivers recognised in himself &quot;the desire for change and novelty, which is one of the strongest aspects of my mental makeup&quot; and, while fond of St John&#x27;s, the staid lifestyle of his Cambridge existence showed in signs of nervous strain and led him to experience periods of depression.

The turning point came in 1898 when Alfred Cort Haddon seduced &quot;Rivers from the path of virtue... (for psychology then was a chaste science)... into that of anthropology:&quot; He made Rivers first choice to head an expedition to the Torres Straits. Rivers&#x27;s first reaction was to decline, but he soon agreed on learning that C. S. Myers and William McDougall, two of his best former students, would participate. The other members were Sidney Ray, C. G. Seligman, and a young Cambridge graduate named Anthony Wilkin, who was asked to accompany the expedition as photographer. In April 1898, the Europeans were transported with gear and apparatus to the Torres Straits. Rivers was said to pack only a small handbag of personal effects for such field trips.

From Thursday Island, several of the party found passage, soaked by rain and waves, on the deck of a crowded 47-foot ketch. In addition to sea sickness, Rivers had been badly sunburnt on his shins and for many days had been quite ill. On 5 May, in a bad storm nearing their first destination of Murray Island, the ship dragged anchor on the Barrier Reef and the expedition almost met disaster Later Rivers recalled the palliative effect of near shipwreck.

When the ketch dropped anchor, Rivers and Ray were at first too ill to go ashore. However the others set up a surgery to treat the native islanders and Rivers, lying in bed next-door tested the patients for colour vision: Haddon&#x27;s diary noted &quot;He is getting some interesting results.&quot; The warmth shown to the sickly Rivers by the Islanders contributed to strong positive feelings for the work and a deep concern for the welfare of Melanesians during the remainder of his life.

Rivers&#x27;s first task was to examine first hand the colour vision of the islanders and compare it to that of Europeans. In the course of his examinations of the visual acuity of the natives, Rivers showed that colour-blindness did not exist or was very rare, but that the colour vision of Papuans was not the same type as that of Europeans; they possessed no word for blue, and an intelligent native found nothing unnatural in applying the same name to the brilliant blue sea or sky and to the deepest black. &quot;Moreover&quot;, Head goes on to state in Rivers&#x27;s obituary notice, &quot;he was able to explode the old fallacy that the &#x27;noble savage&#x27; was endowed with powers of vision far exceeding that of civilised natives. Errors of refraction are, it is true, less common, especially myopia. But, altogether the feats of the Torres Straits islanders equalled those reported by travellers from other parts of the world, they were due to the power of attending to minute details in familiar and strictly limited surrounding, and not to supernormal visual acuity.&quot;

It was at this point that Rivers began collecting family histories and constructing genealogical tables but his purpose appears to have been more biological than ethnological since such tables seem to have originated as a means of determining whether certain sensory talents or disabilities were hereditary. However, these simple tables soon took on a new prospective.

It was at once evident to Rivers that &quot;the names applied to the various forms of blood relationship did not correspond to those used by Europeans, but belonged to what is known as a &#x27;classificatory system&#x27;; a man&#x27;s &#x27;brothers&#x27; or &#x27;sisters&#x27; might include individuals we should call cousins and the key to this nomenclature is to be found in forms of social organisation especially in varieties of the institution of marriage.&quot; Rivers found that relationship terms were used to imply definite duties, privileges and mutual restrictions in conduct, rather than being biologically based as Europeans&#x27; are. As Head puts it: &quot;all these facts were clearly demonstrable by the genealogical method, a triumphant generalisation which has revolutionised ethnology.&quot;

The Torres Straits expedition was &quot;revolutionary&quot; in many other respects as well. For the first time, British anthropology had been removed from its &quot;armchair&quot; and placed into a sound empirical basis, providing the model for future anthropologists to follow. In 1916, Sir Arthur Keith stated in an address to the Royal Anthropological Institute, that the expedition had engendered &quot;the most progressive and profitable movement in the history of British anthropology.&quot;

While the expedition was clearly productive and, in many ways, arduous for its members, it was also the foundation of lasting friendships. The team would reunite at many points and their paths would frequently converge. Of particular note is the relationship between Rivers and Haddon, the latter of whom regarded the fact he had induced Rivers to come to the Torres Straits as his claim to fame. It cannot be denied that both Rivers and Haddon were serious about their work but at the same time they were imbued with a keen sense of humour and fun. Haddon&#x27;s diary from Tuesday 16 August reads thus: &quot;Our friends and acquaintances would often be very much amused if they could see us at some of our occupations and I am afraid these would sometimes give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme – so trivial would they appear ... for example one week we were mad on cat&#x27;s cradle – at least Rivers, Ray and I were – McDougall soon fell victim and even Myers eventually succumbed.&quot; It may seem to be a bizarre occupation for a group of highly qualified men of science, indeed, as Haddon states: &quot;I can imagine that some people would think we were demented – or at least wasting our time.&quot; However, both Haddon and Rivers were to use the string trick to scientific ends and they are also credited as inventing a system of nomenclature that enabled them to be able to schematise the steps required and teach a variety of string tricks to European audiences.

The expedition ended in October 1898 and Rivers returned to England. In 1900, Rivers joined Myers and Wilkin in Egypt to run tests on the colour vision of the Egyptians; this was the last time he saw Wilkin, who died of dysentery in May 1901, aged 24.

===The Todas===
Rivers had already formed a career in physiology and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where he might be able to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers&#x27;s criteria. And they had specific features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first Rivers looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.

Rivers worked among the Todas for less than six months during 1901–02, communicating with his Toda informants only through interpreters and lodged in an Ootacamund hotel. Yet he assembled a stunning collection of data on the ritual and social lives of the Toda people. Almost all who have subsequently studied the Todas have been amazed at the richness and the accuracy of Rivers&#x27;s data. His book &quot;The Todas&quot;, which came out in 1906, is still an outstanding contribution to Indian ethnography, &quot;indispensable: still only to be supplemented rather than superseded&quot;, as Murray Emeneau wrote in 1971. And it is little wonder that so famous a champion of anthropological fieldwork as Dr Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942) declared Rivers to be his &quot;patron saint of field work&quot;.

In the preface to this book Rivers wrote that his work was &quot;not merely the record of the customs and beliefs of a people, but also the demonstration of anthropological method&quot;. That method is the collection of genealogical materials for the purpose of more fully investigating other aspects of social life, notably ritual. 
The first eleven chapters of &quot;The Todas&quot; represented in 1906 a novel approach to the presentation of ethnographic data, one that, under the influence of Malinowski, would later become a standard practice in British social anthropology. This is the analysis of a people&#x27;s society and culture by presentation of a detailed description of a particularly significant institution. In the Toda case, it is the sacred dairy cult. But Rivers is unable to sustain this focus throughout the work, so after a brilliant opening, the book tails off somewhat. We get a good idea of the Toda dairies and the ideas of ritual purity that protect them; but then the author returns to the ready-made categories of the day: gods, magic, kinship, clanship, crime and so on, and says no more about the dairies. Moreover, he failed to discover the existence of matrilineal clans alongside the patrilineal ones. A second, and more important, limitation of his study is its failure to view Toda society as a local and specialized variant of—as A. L. Kroeber wrote—&quot;higher Indian culture&quot;. Rivers&#x27;s book has been largely responsible for the view (now not infrequently held by educated Todas themselves) that these are a people quite distinct from other South Indians.

When, in 1902, Rivers left the Nilgiri Hills and India too, he would never return. Moreover, after the publication of &quot;The Todas&quot; he wrote very little more about them.

==&quot;A Human Experiment in Nerve Division&quot;==
Upon his return to England from the Torres Strait, Rivers became aware of a series of experiments being conducted by his old friend Henry Head in conjunction with James Sherren, a surgeon at the London Hospital where they both worked. Since 1901, the pair had been forming a systematic study of nerve injuries among patients attending the hospital. Rivers, who had long been interested in the physiological consequences of nerve division, was quick to take on the role of &quot;guide and counsellor&quot;.

It quickly became clear to Rivers, looking in on the experiment from a psycho-physical aspect, that the only way accurate results could be obtained from introspection on behalf of the patient is if the subject under investigation was himself a trained observer, sufficiently discriminative to realise if his introspection was being prejudiced by external irrelevancies or moulded by the form of the experimenter&#x27;s questions, and sufficiently detached to lead a life of detachment throughout the entire course of the tests. It was in the belief that he could fulfil these requirements, that Head himself volunteered to act, as Langham puts it, &quot;as Rivers&#x27;s experimental guinea-pig&quot;.

So it was that, on 25 April 1903, the radial and external cutaneous nerves of Henry Head&#x27;s arm were severed and sutured. Rivers was then to take on the role of examiner and chart the regeneration of the nerves, considering the structure and functions of the nervous system from an evolutionary standpoint through a series of &quot;precise and untiring observations&quot; over a period of five years.

At first observation, the day after the operation, the back of Head&#x27;s hand and the dorsal surface of his thumb were seen to be &quot;completely insensitive to stimulation with cotton wool, to pricking with a pin, and to all degrees of heat and cold.&quot; While cutaneous sensibility had ceased, deep sensibility was maintained so that pressure with a finger, a pencil or with any blunt object was appreciated without hesitation.

So that the distractions of a busy life should not interfere with Head&#x27;s introspective analysis, it was decided that the experimentation should take place in Rivers&#x27;s rooms. Here, as Head states, &quot;for five happy years we worked together on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St John&#x27;s College.&quot; In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers&#x27;s vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations. Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167 days were devoted to the investigation.

Since Head was simultaneously collaborator and experimental subject, extensive precautions were taken to make sure that no outside factors influenced his subjective appreciation of what he was perceiving: &quot;No questions were asked until the termination of a series of events; for we found it was scarcely possible... to ask even simple questions without giving a suggestion either for or against the right answer... The clinking of ice against the glass, the removal of the kettle from the hob, tended to prejudice his answers... [Rivers] was therefore particularly careful to make all his preparations beforehand; the iced tubes were filled and jugs of hot and cold water ranged within easy reach of his hand, so that the water of the temperature required might be mixed silently.&quot;

Moreover, although before each series of tests Head and Rivers would discuss their plan of action, Rivers was careful to vary this order to such an extent during the actual testing that Head would be unable to tell what was coming next.

Gradually during the course of the investigation, certain isolated spots of cutaneous sensibility began to appear; these spots were sensitive to heat, cold and pressure. However, the spaces between these spots remained insensitive at first, unless sensations- such as heat or cold- reached above a certain threshold at which point the feeling evoked was unpleasant and usually perceived as being &quot;more painful&quot; than it was if the same stimulus was applied to Head&#x27;s unaffected arm. Also, although the sensitive spots were quite definitely localised, Head, who sat through the tests with his eyes closed, was unable to gain any exact appreciation of the locus of stimulation. Quite the contrary, the sensations radiated widely, and Head tended to refer them to places remote from the actual point of stimulation.

This was the first stage of the recovery process and Head and Rivers dubbed it the &quot;protopathic&quot;, taking its origins from the Middle Greek word &quot;protopathes&quot;, meaning &quot;first affected&quot;. This protopathic stage seemed to be marked by an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; aspect since there was either an inordinate response to sensation when compared with normal reaction or no reaction whatever if the stimulation was below the threshold.

Finally, when Head was able to distinguish between different temperatures and sensations below the threshold, and when he could recognise when two compass points were applied simultaneously to the skin, Head&#x27;s arm began to enter the second stage of recovery. They named this stage the &quot;epicritic&quot;, from the Greek &quot;epikritikos&quot;, meaning &quot;determinative&quot;.

From an evolutionary perspective, it soon became clear to Rivers that the epicritic nervous reaction was the superior, as it suppressed and abolished all protopathic sensibility. This, Rivers found, was the case in all parts of the skin of the male anatomy except one area where protopathic sensibility is unimpeded by epicritic impulses: the glans penis. As Langham points out, with special references to &quot;Rivers&#x27;s reputed sexual proclivities&quot;, it is at this point that the experiment takes on an almost farcical aspect to the casual reader. It may not seem surprising to us that when Rivers was to apply a needle to a particularly sensitive part of the glans that &quot;pain appeared and was so excessively unpleasant that [Head] cried out and started away&quot;; indeed, such a test could be seen as a futility verging on the masochistic. Nor would we necessarily equate the following passage with what one might normally find in a scientific text:

&quot;The foreskin was drawn back, and the penis allowed to hang downwards. A number of drinking glasses were prepared containing water at different temperatures. [Head] stood with his eyes closed, and [Rivers] gradually approached one of the glasses until the surface of the water covered the glans but did not touch the foreskin. Contact with the fluid was not appreciated; if, therefore, the temperature of the water was such that it did not produce a sensation of heat or cold, Head was unaware that anything had been done.&quot;

However, the investigations, bizarre as they may seem, did have a sound scientific basis since Rivers especially was looking at the protopathic and epicritic from an evolutionary perspective. From this standpoint it is intensely interesting to note that the male anatomy maintains one area which is &quot;unevolved&quot; in so much as it is &quot;associated with a more primitive form of sensibility&quot;. Using this information about the protopathic areas of the human body, Rivers and Head then began to explore elements of man&#x27;s psyche. One way in which they did this was to examine the &quot;pilomotor reflex&quot; (the erection of hairs). Head and Rivers noted that the thrill evoked by aesthetic pleasure is &quot;accompanied by the erection of hairs&quot; and they noted that this reaction was no greater in the area of skin with protopathic sensibility than it was in the area of the more evolved epicritic, making it a purely psychologically based phenomena. As Langham puts it: &quot;The image of a man reading a poem to evoke aesthetic pleasure while a close friend meticulously studies the erection of his hairs may seem ludicrous. However, it provides a neat encapsulation of Rivers&#x27;s desire to subject possibly protopathic phenomena to the discipline of rigorous investigation.&quot;

===Pre-war psychological work===
In 1904, with Professor James Ward and some others, Rivers founded the British Journal of Psychology of which he was at first joint editor.

From 1908 until the outbreak of the war Rivers was mainly preoccupied with ethnological and sociological problems. Already he had relinquished his official post as lecturer in Experimental Psychology in favour of Charles Samuel Myers, and now held only a lectureship on the physiology of the special senses. By degrees he became more absorbed in anthropological research. But though he was now an ethnologist rather than a psychologist he always maintained that what was of value in his work was due directly to his training in the psychological laboratory. In the laboratory he had learnt the importance of exact method; in the field he now gained vigour and vitality by his constant contact with the actual daily behaviour of human beings.

During 1907–8 Rivers travelled to the Solomon Islands, and other areas of Melanesia and Polynesia. His two-volume &quot;History of Melanesian Society&quot; (1914), which he dedicated to St Johns, presented a diffusionist thesis for the development of culture in the south-west Pacific. In the year of publication he made a second journey to Melanesia, returning to England in March 1915, to find that war had broken out.

==The Great War==
When Rivers returned to England in spring 1915, he had trouble at first finding a place for himself in the war effort. Following the footsteps of his former student—the current director of the Cambridge Psychology Laboratory—C. S. Myers, the 51-year-old Rivers signed up to serve as a civilian physician at the Maghull Military Hospital near Liverpool. Upon his arrival in July 1915, Rivers was appointed as a psychiatrist and thus he re-entered into the study of &quot;insanity&quot;.

&quot;Insanity&quot; in this case entailed working with soldiers who had been diagnosed with any of a wide range of symptoms, which were collectively referred to as &quot;shell shock&quot;. These soldiers were known to demonstrate symptoms such as temporary blindness, memory loss, paralysis, and uncontrollable crying. As such, by the time Rivers was assigned to Maghull War Hospital, it was known as the &quot;centre for abnormal psychology&quot;, and many of its physicians were employing techniques such as dream interpretation, psychoanalysis and hypnosis to treat shell shock, also known as the war neuroses.

Rivers himself was a well-read psychologist and so was already quite familiar with Freud, Jung, and other psychoanalysts. In fact, Rivers was quite sympathetic to some of Freud&#x27;s ideas. As such, Rivers joined the band of doctors at Maghull who devoted themselves to understanding the origins and treatment of the &quot;war neuroses&quot; under the guidance of R. G. Rows.

After about a year of service at Maghull War Hospital, Rivers was appointed a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his two youthful dreams—to be an army doctor and to &quot;go in for insanity&quot;—were realized when he was transferred to Craiglockhart War Hospital near Edinburgh, Scotland in order to help &quot;clean house&quot; following a scandal. There, Rivers treated officers who had been diagnosed with &quot;shell shock&quot;, and he also began formulating his theory regarding the origin and treatment of the war neuroses. 

Rivers&#x27;s methodology for treating the war neuroses are often, and somewhat unfairly, said to have stemmed from Sigmund Freud. While it is true that Rivers was aware of and was influenced by Freud&#x27;s theories and by the practice of psychoanalysis, he did not blindly subscribe to all of Freud&#x27;s premises. Most importantly, Rivers saw the instinct of self-preservation rather than the sexual instinct, as the driving force behind war neuroses. (Essays such as Freud and the War Neuroses: Pat Barker&#x27;s &quot;Regeneration&quot; further compare Freud and Rivers&#x27; theories; see also the subsection on Rivers&#x27; &quot;Instinct and the Unconscious&quot; below; see also Rivers&#x27; &quot;Conflict and Dream&quot; for his own opinion on Freudian theory.)

It is on this belief regarding the origins of the war neuroses that he formed his &quot;talking cure&quot;. Rivers&#x27; &quot;talking cure&quot; was primarily based on the ancient belief of catharsis: the idea that bringing repressed memories into the light of consciousness rids memories and thoughts of their power. As a result, Rivers spent most of his days talking with the officers at Craiglockhart, guiding them through a process Rivers referred to as autognosis. Rivers&#x27; autognosis consisted of two parts. The first part included &quot;re-education&quot;, or educating the patient about the basics of psychology and physiology. River&#x27;s method also consisted of helping a soldier comprehend that the illness he was experiencing was not &quot;strange&quot; nor permanent. To Rivers, the war neuroses developed from ingrained ways of reacting, feeling, or thinking: namely, the attempt to wittingly repress all memories of traumatic experiences or unacceptable emotions. Once a patient could understand the source(s) of his troubles (which could be conscious, unconscious, environmental, or a combination), Rivers could then help him contrive ways to overcome these patterns and thus free himself from, or at least adjust to, the illness.

Rivers&#x27; approach to treating the war neuroses made him a pioneer in his day; while he was not the first to advocate humane treatment methods for the war neuroses, he was one of the few to do so in a time when there was much debate over the cause and thus the &quot;correct&quot; treatment for shell shock. (See the Wikipedia article on Lewis Yealland and faradization for an alternative treatment method.) Furthermore, Rivers encouraged his patients to express their emotions in a time when society encouraged men to keep a &quot;stiff upper-lip&quot;. River&#x27;s method, and his deep concern for every individual he treated, made him famous among his clients. Both Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves wrote highly of him during this time.

=== Rivers and Sassoon ===
Sassoon came to Rivers in 1917 after publicly protesting against the war and refusing to return to his regiment, but was treated with sympathy and given much leeway until he voluntarily returned to France. For Rivers, there was a considerable dilemma involved in &quot;curing&quot; his patients simply in order that they could be sent back to the Western Front to die. Rivers&#x27;s feelings of guilt are clearly portrayed both in fiction and in fact. Through Pat Barker&#x27;s novels and in Rivers&#x27;s works (particularly &quot;Conflict and Dream&quot;) we get a sense of the turmoil the doctor went through. As Sassoon wrote in a letter to Robert Graves (24 July 1918):

Rivers did not wish to &quot;break&quot; his patients, but at the same time he knew that it was their duty to return to the front and his duty to send them. There is also an implication (given the pun on Rivers&#x27;s name along with other factors) that Rivers was more to Sassoon than just a friend. Sassoon called him &quot;father confessor&quot;, a point that Jean Moorcroft Wilson picks up on in her biography of Sassoon; however, Rivers&#x27;s tight morals would have probably prevented a closer relationship from progressing:

Not only Sassoon, but his patients as a whole, loved him and his colleague Frederic Bartlett wrote of him 
Sassoon described Rivers&#x27;s bedside manner in his letter to Graves, written as he lay in hospital after being shot (a head wound that he had hoped would kill him – he was bitterly disappointed when it did not):

Rivers was well known for his compassionate, effective and pioneering treatments; as Sassoon&#x27;s testimony reveals, he treated his patients very much as individuals.

=== Instinct and the Unconscious: A Contribution to a Biological Theory of the Psycho-Neuroses ===
Following his appointment at Craiglockhart War Hospital, Rivers published the results of his experimental treatment of patients in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;On the Repression of War Experience&quot;, and began to record interesting cases in his book &quot;Conflict and Dream,&quot; which was published a year after his death by his close friend Grafton Elliot Smith.

In the same year he published his findings in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Rivers also composed an article on the various types of &quot;psycho-therapeutics&quot; in practice at the time. Rivers&#x27; personal and complete theory on the origin of the &quot;psycho-neuroses&quot;, including the war neuroses, was not to be published until 1920 with the publication of &quot;Instinct and the Unconscious: A Contribution to a Biological Theory of the Psycho-Neuroses&quot;.

River&#x27;s theory of the neuroses incorporates everything he had researched up until this point and was designed to &quot;consider the general biological function of the process by which experience passes into the region of the unconscious...&quot; (pp. 5–6). In other words, Rivers&#x27; goal was to outline an umbrella theory which would both explain neuroses and neurological issues as he had encountered them (see the subsection &quot;A Human Experiment in Nerve Division&quot; above).

In attempting to construct such an umbrella theory, Rivers accepted that the unconscious exists and that the contents of the unconscious are entirely inaccessible to a person except through the processes of hypnosis, dreaming, or psychoanalysis. Rivers further defined the unconscious as a repository of instincts and associated experiences (i.e. memories) which are painful or not useful to the organism.

&quot;Instincts&quot;, in this regard, are actions which an organism performs without learning and which are executed without the mediating influence of thought. As such, the action has an &quot;all-or-none&quot; aspect to it: it either does not occur at all or it occurs with all of its force. To this end, Rivers included the protopathic sensations, mass-reflex actions (as observed in spinal-cord injury patients), and basic emotions (i.e. anger, fear) as instincts.

Rivers further asserted that all painful or un-useful instincts are naturally kept out of conscious awareness (i.e. in the unconscious) by suppression. Suppression—in this view—is a natural and &quot;unwitting&quot; (unintentional) method for removing painful instincts from consciousness and confining them in the unconscious. Neuroses, therefore, develop when something in the natural process of suppression is disrupted so that a suppressed instinct and its associated emotion are released from the unconscious. Rivers cites two possible reasons for the &quot;escape&quot; of such instincts from the unconscious: either the instinct became too strong to contain, or the normal reserves which typically suppress it were weakened. It is important to note, however, that the etiology of war neuroses is not simply the escape of instincts from the unconscious and the ensuing conflict. More often than not, Rivers believed that the way in which such conflict is resolved (or is attempted to be resolved) also greatly influences the manifestation of the neuroses.

In regards to the war neuroses, Rivers believed that the disease&#x27;s manifestation stems from the escape of the &quot;self-preservation&quot; or &quot;danger instincts&quot; from the unconscious. These &quot;danger instincts&quot;, as Rivers conceives of them, include at least five types of reflexive reactions to danger: (i) fear as manifested by flight, (ii) aggression as manifested by fighting, (iii) the suppression of all emotion in order to complete complex tasks which leads to safety, (iv) terror as manifested by immobility, and (v) the suppression of all physical resources as manifested by collapsing. Typically, reactions i, ii, iv, and v are suppressed so that humans can remain calm in the face of fear and can complete complex actions which lead to safety. When all five &quot;self-preservation&quot; instincts are repeatedly aroused for long periods of time, such as during exposure to war, the instincts gain power and eventually &quot;escape&quot; from the unconscious. As such, the emotions of fear, aggression, and terror arise into consciousness, as do their associated responses. These emotions and their suggested actions create great conflict in the consciousness, however: &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;terror&quot; are far from socially acceptable in war. In order to deal with the conflict created by the &quot;escaped&quot; instincts, Rivers posited that the mind must do something to provide immediate relief. It is this attempt to achieve relief from mental conflicts that leads to war neuroses.

For example, Rivers proposed that officers and soldiers who have night terrors do so because they are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious. Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert a conscious effort to do so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is night terrors.

In an alternative scenario, wartime hysteria can be explained as the body&#x27;s suppression of normal physiological functioning in order to avoid the scenario which activates the danger instincts and releases the associated emotion of fear into consciousness. Hysterical soldiers often presented with symptoms of paralysis and diminished or lost sensory capacities, even in the absence of anxiety or depression. These physiological symptoms, although distressing in themselves, make it impossible for a soldier to be returned to the front line. Thus, the body compensates for its inability to suppress the danger instincts in the face of war by making it so that the soldier must avoid warfare altogether.

Overall, Rivers attributed the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind&#x27;s unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and their emotions back into the conscious. While Rivers&#x27; theory contains some Freudian elements, it is not simply a restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers&#x27; theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and Henry Head drew from their work on nerve regeneration.

In retrospect, Rivers&#x27; particular method of treating the war neuroses and his theory of the origin of neuroses—while pioneering in their day—have failed to leave a huge mark on the history of psychology. However, the &quot;general&quot; contributions of psychiatrists treating war neuroses, in combination with the overwhelming prevalence of the neuroses during the Great War, led to a revolution in the British perspective of mental illness and its treatment.

==Post war==
After the war, Rivers became &quot;another and far happier man – diffidence gave place to confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a somewhat laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm&quot;. He is quoted as saying &quot;I have finished my serious work and I shall just let myself go.&quot; In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking. Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in imaginative literature. Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.

Rivers had visited his college frequently during the war although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – &quot;Praelector of Natural Science Studies&quot; – and he was given a free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: &quot;when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight.&quot; He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St John&#x27;s, and at other colleges. He would arrange &quot;At Homes&quot; in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called &quot;The Socratics&quot; and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in &quot;Conflict and Dream&quot;) remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. They shared Socialist sympathies.

Having already been made president of the anthropological section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1911, after the war he became president of The Folklore Society (1920), and the Royal Anthropological Institute (1921–1922). He was also awarded honorary degrees from the universities of Manchester, St Andrews and Cambridge in 1919.

Rivers died of a strangulated hernia in the summer of 1922, shortly after being named as a Labour candidate for the 1922 general election. He had agreed to run for parliament, as he said:

He had been taken ill suddenly in his rooms at St John&#x27;s on the evening of Friday 3 June, having sent his servant home to enjoy the summer festivities. By the time he was found in the morning, it was too late and he knew it. Typically for this man who, throughout his life &quot;displayed a complete disregard for personal gain&quot;, he was selfless to the last. There is a document granting approval for the diploma in anthropology to be awarded as of Easter term, 1922, to an undergraduate student from India. It is signed by Haddon and Rivers dated 4 June 1922. At the bottom is a notation in Haddon&#x27;s handwriting:

Rivers signed the papers as he lay dying in the Evelyn Nursing Home following an unsuccessful emergency operation. He had an extravagant funeral at St John&#x27;s in accordance with his wishes as he was an expert on funeral rites and his cremated remains were interred in Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in a grave with a large stone cross. Sassoon was deeply saddened by the death of his father figure and collapsed at his funeral. His loss prompted him to write two poignant poems about the man he had grown to love: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Revisitation&quot;.

==Others&#x27; opinions of Rivers==

===Poetry===
In the poem &quot;The Red Ribbon Dream&quot;, written by Robert Graves not long after Rivers&#x27;s death, he touches on the peace and security he felt in Rivers&#x27;s rooms:

:For that was the place where I longed to be
:And past all hope where the kind lamp shone.

An anonymously written poem &quot;Anthropological Thoughts&quot; can be found in the Rivers collection of the Haddon archives at Cambridge. There is a reference that indicates that these lines were written by Charles Elliot Fox, missionary and ethnographer friend of Rivers.

===Quotations===
In Sassoon&#x27;s autobiography (under the guise of &quot;The Memoirs of George Sherston&quot;) Rivers is one of the few characters to retain their original names. There is a whole chapter devoted to Rivers and he is immortalised by Sassoon as a near demi-god who saved his life and his soul. Sassoon wrote:

Rivers was much loved and admired, not just by Sassoon. Bartlett wrote of his experiences of Rivers in one of his obituaries, as well as in many other articles, as the man had a profound influence on his life:

Rivers&#x27;s legacy continues even today in the form of The Rivers Centre, which treats patients with posttraumatic stress disorder using the same famously humane methods as Rivers had. There is also a Rivers Memorial Medal, founded in 1923, which is rewarded each year to an anthropologist who has made a significant impact in his or her field. Appropriately, Haddon was the first to receive this award in 1924.

==In fiction==
Sassoon writes about Rivers in the third part of &quot;The Memoirs of George Sherston&quot;, &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot;. There is a chapter named after the doctor and Rivers appears in the book as the only character to retain his factual name, giving him a position as a sort of demi-god in Sassoon&#x27;s semi-fictitious memoirs.

The life of W. H. R. Rivers and his encounter with Sassoon was fictionalised by Pat Barker in the &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot;, a series of three books including &quot;Regeneration&quot; (1991), &quot;The Eye in the Door&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Ghost Road&quot; (1995). The trilogy was greeted with considerable acclaim, with &quot;The Ghost Road&quot; being awarded the Booker Prize in the year of its publication. &quot;Regeneration&quot; was filmed in 1997 with Jonathan Pryce in the role of Rivers.

The first book, &quot;Regeneration&quot; deals primarily with Rivers&#x27;s treatment of Sassoon at Craiglockhart. In the novel we are introduced to Rivers as a doctor for whom healing patients comes at price. The dilemmas faced by Rivers are brought to the fore and the strain leads him to become ill; on sick leave he visits his brother and the Heads and we learn more about his relationships outside of hospital life. We are also introduced in the course of the novel to the Canadian doctor Lewis Yealland, another factual figure who used electric shock treatment to &quot;cure&quot; his patients. The juxtaposition of the two very different doctors highlights the unique, or at least unconventional, nature of Rivers&#x27; methods and the humane way in which he treated his patients (even though Yealland&#x27;s words, and his own guilt and modesty lead him to think otherwise).

&quot;The Eye in the Door&quot; concentrates, for the most part, on Rivers&#x27; treatment of the fictional character of Prior. Although Prior&#x27;s character may not have existed, the facts that he makes Rivers face up to did – that something happened to him on the first floor of his house that caused him to block all visual memory and begin to stammer. We also learn of Rivers&#x27; treatment of officers in the airforce and of his work with Head. Sassoon too plays a role in the book- Rivers visits him in hospital where he finds him to be a different, if not broken, man, his attempt at &#x27;suicide&#x27; having failed. This second novel in the trilogy, both implicitly and directly, addresses the issue of Rivers&#x27; possible homosexuality and attraction to Sassoon. From Rivers&#x27; reaction to finding out that Sassoon is in hospital to the song playing in the background (&#x27;You Made Me Love You&#x27;) and Ruth Head&#x27;s question to her husband, &quot;Do you think he&#x27;s in love with him?&quot; we get a strong impression of the author&#x27;s opinions on Rivers&#x27; sexuality.

&quot;The Ghost Road&quot;, the final part of the trilogy, shows a side of Rivers not previously seen in the novels. As well as his relationship with his sisters and father, we also learn of his feelings for Charles Dodgson- or Lewis Carroll. Carroll was the first adult Rivers met who stammered as badly as he did and yet he cruelly rejected him, preferring to lavish attention on his pretty young sisters. In this novel the reader also learns of Rivers&#x27; visit to Melanesia; feverish with Spanish Flu, the doctor is able to recount the expedition and we are provided with insight both into the culture of the island and into Rivers&#x27; very different &quot;field trip persona&quot;.

Rivers appears briefly in &quot;The God of the Hive,&quot; the tenth novel in the Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes series by mystery writer Laurie R. King, in which he is the author of a medical letter, written during the war, concerning one of that novel&#x27;s characters.

Rivers appears in Francois Smith&#x27;s 2014 Afrikaans novel &quot;Kamphoer&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Camp Whore&quot;), based on a true story during the Anglo-Boer War . The protagonist, a teenage Afrikaans girl, is raped by British soldiers; Rivers offers her inspiration, through his humane supportive treatment of soldiers. In adulthood, she becomes a psychiatric nurse to overcome her own trauma. In a twist of events, she treats one of the soldiers who had attacked her years earlier.

Rivers appears in the film &quot;Benediction,&quot; played by Ben Daniels.

<doc id="63714" wikidata="Q670558" url="?curid=63714" title="Denis Gaultier">
<text>Denis Gaultier (&quot;Gautier&quot;, &quot;Gaulthier&quot;; also known as Gaultier le jeune and Gaultier de Paris) (1597 or 1602/3 – 1672) was a French lutenist and composer. He was a cousin of Ennemond Gaultier.

==Life==
Gaultier was born in Paris; two conflicting sources point to either 1597 or 1603 as the year of birth. The former can be deduced from an account by Thorian, who claimed that Gaultier died in 1672 at the age of seventy-five. However, an archival document from the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris hospital states that Gaultier was twenty-three at the time of his convalescence in the hospital, which was from 24 October 1626 to 12 December 1626.

Very little is known about Gaultier&#x27;s career. He may have studied under Charles Racquet, since he commemorated the lutenist&#x27;s death with a tombeau. Until at least 1631 Denis&#x27;s career was closely linked to that of his older cousin, Ennemond; so much that contemporary writers referred to either composer by surname only, making no attempt to distinguish between them. Both lutenists had connections with Blancrocher and Henri de L&#x27;Enclos, and both secured a high reputation comparable to that of François Dufaut, Jacques Gallot, or Charles Mouton. In 1635 Denis married Françoise Daucourt. Their son Philippe Emmanuel would later become advisor to the king, but there is no evidence that Gaultier himself ever held a court position, even though his cousin did. Denis most probably gained fame and income through salon playing.

==Works==
Denis and Ennemond are confused in many contemporary manuscripts and prints, leading to numerous attribution problems. A number of pieces are signed simply with the surname, some are attributed to Denis in one collection and to Ennemond in another, and still others are now known to have been be misattributed. Gaultier&#x27;s output, as is to be expected from a 17th-century French lutenist, consists mainly of dance suites for the lute. In general, Gaultier was a masterful melodist, effortlessly writing graceful melodic lines with clear phrase structures, but his music is less inventive harmonically than that of some other French lutenists of the era, such as René Mesangeau or Pierre Dubut.

Three published collections of Gaultier&#x27;s music have come down to us, all from his late years. &quot;La Rhétorique des dieux&quot; (1652) contains twelve parts, each named after one of the Greek modes, but the actual harmonic procedures of the pieces are not connected to the modes. Many of the pieces reference Greek mythology. The collection, compiled under the patronage of Anne de Chambré, also contains engravings after Le Sueur, Abraham Bosse and Robert de Nanteuil. Two other collections, &quot;Pièces de luth sur trois différens modes nouveaux&quot; (c.1669) and &quot;Livre de tablature [...] de Mr. Gaultier Sr. de Nève et de Mr. Gaultier son cousin&quot; (c.1672) both begin with basic instructions on lute playing. All three manuscripts consist principally of dances. The one other genre Gaultier made an important contribution to is the tombeau.

An adequate assessment of Gaultier&#x27;s music and influence is difficult, owing to attribution problems. According to recent research, &quot;La Rhétorique des dieux&quot; may consist of works not composed by Denis Gaultier, or original works by him changed by unknown scribes. The 1672 collection was completed after Gaultier&#x27;s death by his pupil Montarcis, and contains music by two different Gaultiers. Other pieces, found in various manuscripts, also pose numerous attribution problems. Nevertheless, Gaultier was an important exponent of the French &quot;style brisé&quot;, and as such an influence on harpsichordists such as Johann Jakob Froberger. Around 1680 a few of Gaultier&#x27;s works were included in anthologies by Perrine, a French theorist who experimented with the writing of lute music in staff notation.

<text>Zinf is a free audio player for Unix-like and Windows operating systems. Zinf is released under the GNU General Public License.

Zinf is a continuation of the FreeAmp project and uses the same source code.

==Technical features==
Zinf can play sound files in MP3, Vorbis, and WAV formats, among others. It supports skins and is part of the MusicBrainz network. The player features an optimized version of the Xing MPEG decoder, a powerful music browser and playlist editor, and a built in download manager which supports downloading files from sites using the RMP (RealJukebox) download process. Zinf was also notable for handling all audio files based on their metadata (Author, Album, Song Title), and hiding more-technical details like actual locations and file names (but these features are now standard in many players).

==Naming==
Zinf is a recursive acronym that stands for &quot;Zinf Is Not FreeAmp!&quot; Use of the name FreeAmp had to be discontinued due to trademark issues, as &quot;AMP&quot; is a trademark of PlayMedia Systems, Inc.

==History/Funding==
The FreeAmp project was originally funded by EMusic, who paid the salaries of 3 developers working on the player. Later, Relatable joined EMusic to help support continued development.

In January 2001, after 2 years of funding the project EMusic pulled their support, and subsequently fired the developers. The Zinf project was unable to find another sponsor, and development slowed greatly. The most recent release was made in early 2004. As of 2008, nearly all development of Zinf has ceased.

==Adoption==
Once a popular open-source Linux audio player, it has now been largely surpassed by newcomers such as Audacious, Amarok, Exaile, Banshee and (more recently) Songbird. This is largely because Zinf has not seen an official new release since early 2004, and many new features that are now standard in rival players have not been implemented; such as cover art and lyric support.

In 2010 the zinf.com website was bought by a domain squatter for the purpose of capitalizing on the site&#x27;s traffic for monetary gains. A new link called &quot;QnA&quot; and &quot;Ads&quot; are now visible on the zinf.com website that is a redirect to the squatter&#x27;s site.

<doc id="63726" wikidata="Q747392" url="?curid=63726" title="Hero and Leander">
<text>Hero and Leander (, ) is the Greek myth relating the story of Hero (, &quot;Hērṓ&quot;; ), a priestess of Aphrodite (Venus in Roman mythology) who dwelt in a tower in Sestos on the European side of the Hellespont, and Leander (, &quot;Léandros&quot;; or Λείανδρος), a young man from Abydos on the opposite side of the strait.

== The myth ==
Leander falls in love with Hero and swims every night across the Hellespont to spend time with her. Hero lights a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way. Leander&#x27;s soft words and charms—and his argument that Aphrodite, as the goddess of love and sex, would scorn the worship of a virgin—convince Hero, and they make love. Their secret love affair lasts through a warm summer, but when winter and its rougher weather looms, they agree to part for the season and resume in the spring. One stormy winter night, however, Leander sees the torch at the top of Hero&#x27;s tower. He attempts to go to her, but halfway through his swim, a strong winter wind blows out Hero&#x27;s light, and Leander loses his way and drowns. When Hero sees his dead body, she throws herself off the tower to join him in death. Their bodies wash up on shore together, locked in embrace, and are then subsequently buried in a lovers’ tomb.

==Attestations==
Scholarship indicates that the myth is attested in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;, in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot; and in poet Mousaios&#x27; (or Musaeus&#x27;) epic poem.

The &quot;Double Heroides&quot; (attributed to Ovid) treats the narrative in 18 and 19, an exchange of letters between the lovers. Leander has been unable to swim across to Hero in her tower because of bad weather; her summons to him to make the effort will prove fatal to her lover.

==Cultural references==

The myth of Hero and Leander has been used extensively in literature and the arts:

===In classical antiquity===
* Ancient Roman coins of Abydos (Troas): Septimius Severus, Caracalla

===In music===
*Arrigo Boito composed an opera, &quot;Ero e Leandro&quot;, but destroyed it. His libretto was later set by Giovanni Bottesini (1879) and Luigi Mancinelli (1897).
*Francisco Quevedo mentions Leander in &quot;En crespa tempestad del oro undoso&quot;
*Robert Schumann allegedly perceived his &quot;In der Nacht&quot; from Fantasiestücke as depicting the story of Hero and Leandros.
*Franz Grillparzer&#x27;s 1831 tragedy &quot;Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen&quot; is based on the tale.
*Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805) wrote the ballad &quot;Hero und Leander&quot; based on the tale.
*Franz Liszt&#x27;s Ballade No. 2 in B Minor was most likely inspired by Schiller and other Romanticists adaptation and interest in the myth. 
*Georg Friedrich Handel&#x27;s 1707 solo cantata in Italian, &quot;Ero e Leandro&quot; (HWV 150), is based on the tale.
*Victor Herbert composed a tone-poem, &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; (1901).
* Alfredo Catalani composed a tone-poem, &quot;Ero e Leandro&quot;, based on the tale.
*&quot;The Ballad of the Oysterman&quot;, by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., has a reference to the myth. The titular oysterman comments that &quot;[he] read it in the story-book, that, for to kiss his dear, / Leander swam the Hellespont...&quot;

*Jack Dean &amp; Company played at the Whirligig Festival, Weston-super-Mare, September 12, 2021.

===In painting===
*Peter Paul Rubens painted a picture named &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; in 1604 based on the tale.
*William Etty painted &quot;Hero, Having Thrown herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned, Dies on his Body&quot; in 1829. He later said he considered the painting the &quot;finest of my fine pictures&quot;.
*Cy Twombly completed a painting in Rome in 1985 inspired by the story as told by Christopher Marlowe. The painting is entitled &quot;Hero and Leander (To Christopher Marlowe)&quot;.
*Evelyn De Morgan painted &quot;Hero Holding the Beacon for Leander&quot; in 1885.

===In literature===
* The 6th-century Byzantine poet Musaeus also wrote a poem; Aldus Manutius made it one of his first publications (c. 1493) after he set up his famous printing press in Venice (his humanistic aim was to make Ancient Greek Literature available to scholars). Musaeus&#x27;s poem had early translations into European languages by Bernardo Tasso (Italian), Boscán (Spanish) and Clément Marot (French). This poem was widely believed in the Renaissance to have been pre-Homeric: George Chapman reflects at the end of his completion of Marlowe&#x27;s version that the dead lovers had the honour of being &quot;the first that ever poet sung&quot;. Chapman&#x27;s 1616 translation has the title &quot;The divine poem of Musaeus. First of all bookes. Translated according to the original, by Geo: Chapman&quot;. Staplyton, the mid-17th century translator, had read Scaliger&#x27;s repudiation of this mistaken belief, but still could not resist citing Virgil&#x27;s &#x27;Musaeum ante omnes&#x27; (&quot;Aeneid&quot; VI, 666) on the title page of his translation (Virgil&#x27;s reference was to an earlier Musaeus).

*Renaissance poet Christopher Marlowe (1564–1593) began an expansive version of the narrative. His story does not get as far as Leander&#x27;s nocturnal swim, and the guiding lamp that gets extinguished, but ends after the two have become lovers (Hero and Leander (poem));
*George Chapman completed Marlowe&#x27;s poem after Marlowe&#x27;s death; this version was often reprinted in the first half of the 17th century, with editions in 1598 (Linley); 1600 and 1606 (Flasket); 1609, 1613, 1617, 1622 (Blount); 1629 (Hawkins); and 1637 (Leake).
*Sir Walter Raleigh (–1618) alludes to the story, in his &quot;The Ocean&#x27;s Love to Cynthia&quot;, in which Hero has fallen asleep, and fails to keep alight the lamp that guides Leander on his swim (more kindly versions, like Chapman&#x27;s, have her desperately struggling to keep the lamp burning).
*It is also the subject of a novel by Milorad Pavić, &quot;Inner Side of the Wind&quot; (1991).
* Leander is also the subject of Sonnet XXIX by Spanish poet Garcilaso de la Vega of the 16th century;
*John Donne (1572–1631) has an epigram summing up the story in two lines:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
&quot;Both robbed of air, we both lie in one ground,&quot;
&quot;Both whom one fire had burnt, one water drowned&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

*The myth is central to John Keats&#x27; 1817 sonnet, &quot;On an Engraved Gem of Leander.&quot;
*Myths and Hymns (1998), by Adam Guettel, contains a song entitled after the pair.
*Leigh Hunt&#x27;s 1819 poem &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; is based on the myth.
*Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem &quot;Leander and Hero&quot; first appeared in 1823. Significantly, she reversed the usual order of names and used it as an example of mutual constancy.
*Lord Byron references Leander in &quot;Written After Swimming From Sestos To Abydos&quot;; the myth of Hero and Leander inspired his own swim across the Hellespont (i.e., the Dardanelles) in May, 1810. Byron also alludes to his feat, with further reference to Leander, both in &quot;The Bride of Abydos&quot; (1813) and in &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1819–1824), canto II, stanza 105.
*In Chapter XVII of &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1840), Richard Henry Dana Jr. relates an anecdote of the ship&#x27;s cook, who had so bonded with a sow, &quot;Old Bess&quot;, who had stayed aboard the vessel all the first months of the voyage, that after the sow had been taken ashore in San Diego, the cook &quot;could hardly have been more attentive, for he actually, on several nights, after dark, when he thought he would not be seen, sculled himself ashore in a boat with a bucket of nice swill, and returned like Leander from crossing the Hellespont&quot;.
*&quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1862), by Victor Hugo, has a reference to the myth in Jean Valjean, Book V. Referring to the reaction of a duchess when she heard of the fate of her lover who died by drowning in the quicksand in Paris&#x27; sewers, Hugo comments that &quot;Hero refuses to wash Leander&#x27;s corpse.&quot;

*In the collection of short stories and essays by Lafcadio Hearn, &quot;In Ghostly Japan&quot; (1899), the author is told the popular story of a girl who swims to her lover guided by a lantern, and he comments on the similarities with the western story: &#x27;—&quot;So,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;in the Far East, it is poor Hero that does the swimming. And what, under such circumstances, would have been the Western estimate of Leander?&quot;&#x27;
*Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) started his poem &quot;A Song of Travel&quot; with the words: &quot;Where&#x27;s the lamp that Hero lit / Once to call Leander home?&quot;
*Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Hero to Leander&quot; has Hero begging her lover not to leave until the morning when the sea has calmed &quot;Thou shalt not wander hence to-night, I&#x27;ll stay thee with my kisses&quot;
*Poem XV of A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;More Poems&quot; (1936) is devoted to the myth. It describes how, &quot;[b]y Sestos town, in Hero&#x27;s tower / On Hero&#x27;s heart Leander lies...&quot;
*Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s meta-fantasy novel &quot;Fire and Hemlock&quot; (1984) makes an early reference to Hero and Leander, both to foreshadow the plot and as a namesake for the heroine&#x27;s alter-ego.

===In theatre===
*Shakespeare mentions the story in the opening scene of &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, in a dialogue between Valentine and Proteus (the two gentlemen in the play):
:VALENTINE: And on a love-book pray for my success?
:PROTEUS: Upon some book I love I&#x27;ll pray for thee.
:VALENTINE: That&#x27;s on some shallow story of deep love: How young Leander cross&#x27;d the Hellespont.
:PROTEUS: That&#x27;s a deep story of a deeper love: For he was more than over shoes in love.
:VALENTINE: &#x27;Tis true; for you are over boots in love, And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
* Hero and Leander are again mentioned in &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; in Act III Scene I when Valentine is tutoring the Duke of Milan on how to woo the lady from Milan. Shakespeare also alludes to the story in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, both when Benedick states that Leander was &quot;never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love&quot; and in the name of the character Hero, who, despite accusations to the contrary, remains chaste before her marriage; and in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in the form of a malapropism accidentally using the names Helen and Limander in the place of Hero and Leander, as well as in Edward III (Act II, Scene II), Othello (Act III, Scene III), and Romeo and Juliet (Act II, Scene IV). The most famous Shakespearean allusion is the debunking one by Rosalind, in Act IV scene I of &quot;As You Like It&quot;:
&quot;Leander, he would have lived many a fair year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was &#x27;Hero of Sestos.&#x27; But these are all lies: men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.&quot;
* Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614) features a puppet show of Hero and Leander in Act V, translated to London, with the Thames serving as the Hellespont between the lovers.
* Dion Boucicault mentions Leander in his play &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; (1860). Corrigan refers to Hardress Cregan and his nocturnal boat-rides to his secret wife as being &quot;like Leander, barring the wetting&quot;.
* The song cycle &quot;Myths and Hymns&quot;, composed by Adam Guettel, references the myth in the seventh song of the cycle, &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;.

===In folkloristics===
In folkloristics, the myth of lovers Hero and Leander becomes the Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale type ATU 666*, &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;.

Variants of the tale are also attested in Japan, where they appear as a local legends. In Hiroko Ikeda&#x27;s index of Japanese folktales, the type is known as &quot;Tarai-bune no Momoyo Gayoi&quot;. Philologist and folklorist Julian Krzyżanowski, establisher of the Polish Folktale Catalogue according to the international index, located variants of the lovers&#x27; myth in Poland, which he classified as T 667, &quot;Hero i Leander&quot; (&quot;Hero and Leander&quot;).

The myth seems to have inspired a literary version by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola in his work &quot;The Facetious Nights of Straparola&quot;.

Child ballad number 216 can be read as a variant.

===Contemporary references===

<doc id="63727" wikidata="Q174979" url="?curid=63727" title="Alan Shepard">
<text>Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. (November 18, 1923 – July 21, 1998) was an American astronaut. In 1961, he became the second person and the first American to travel into space and, in 1971, he became the fifth and oldest person to walk on the Moon, at age 47.

A graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1947, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first crewed Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B &quot;Freedom 7 II&quot; in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.

Shepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Project Gemini mission, but was grounded in October 1963 due to Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1968, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module &quot;Antares&quot;. He was the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to walk on the Moon. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface.

Shepard was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to August 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until April 30, 1974. On August 25, 1971, he was promoted to rear admiral, the first astronaut to reach that rank. He retired from the United States Navy and NASA on July 31, 1974.

==Early life==
Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on November 18, 1923, at 64 East Derry Road in Derry, New Hampshire, to Alan Bartlett Shepard Sr. (1891–1973) and Pauline Renza Shepard (; 1900–1993). He had a younger sister, Pauline, who was known as Polly. The two were descendants of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Richard Warren, and were related to Scottish emigrants from Berneray in the Outer Hebrides, through the Shepard line. Their grandmother, Annie Bartlett Shepard, served as the State Regent of the New Hampshire Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Alan Bartlett Shepard Sr., known as Bart, worked in the Derry National Bank, owned by Shepard&#x27;s grandfather. Bart joined the National Guard in 1915 and served in France with the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. He remained in the National Guard between the wars, and was recalled to active duty during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Shepard attended Adams School in Derry, where his academic performance impressed his teachers. He skipped the sixth grade and proceeded to middle school at Oak Street School in Derry, where he also skipped the eighth grade. He achieved the Boy Scouts of America rank of First Class Scout. In 1936, he went to the Pinkerton Academy, a private school in Derry that his father had attended and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed grades 9 to 12 there. Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the academy and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a Douglas DC-3. The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.

Shepard graduated from Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940 but at sixteen was too young to enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy from which he graduated with the Class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145 but his grades were mediocre.

At the Naval Academy, Shepard enjoyed aquatic sports. He was a keen and competitive sailor, winning several races, including a regatta held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He learned to sail all the types of boats the academy owned, up to and including , a schooner. He also participated in swimming and rowed with the eight. During his Christmas break in 1942, he went to Principia College to be with his sister, who was unable to go home owing to wartime travel restrictions. There he met Louise Brewer, whose parents were pensioners on the du Pont family estate and like Renza Shepard, were devout Christian Scientists. Owing to the war, the usual four-year course at Annapolis was cut short by a year. He graduated with the Class of 1945 on June 6, 1944, ranked 463rd out of 915, and was commissioned as an ensign and awarded a Bachelor of Science degree. The following month he became secretly engaged to Louise.

==Naval service==

After a month of classroom instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea &quot;Cogswell&quot; helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.
&quot;Cogswell&quot; returned to the United States for an overhaul in February 1945. Shepard was given three weeks&#x27; leave, in which time he and Louise decided to marry. The ceremony took place on March 3, 1945, in St. Stephen&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Wilmington, Delaware. His father, Bart, served as his best man. The newlyweds had only a brief time together before Shepard rejoined &quot;Cogswell&quot; at the Long Beach Navy Yard on April 5, 1945. After the war, they had two children, both daughters: Laura, born in 1947, and Julie, born in 1951. Following the death of Louise&#x27;s sister in 1956, they raised her five-year-old niece, Judith Williams—whom they renamed Alice to avoid confusion with Julie—as their own, although they never adopted her. They eventually had six grandchildren.

On Shepard&#x27;s second cruise with &quot;Cogswell&quot;, he was appointed a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20 mm and 40 mm antiaircraft guns on the ship&#x27;s bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a radar picket. The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes, but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. &quot;Cogswell&quot; performed this duty from May 27 until June 26, 1945, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.
In November 1945, Shepard arrived at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, where he commenced basic flight training on January 7, 1946. He was an average student, and for a time faced being &quot;bilged&quot; (dropped) from flight training and reassigned to the surface navy. To make up for this, he took private lessons at a local civilian flying school—something the Navy frowned on—earning a civil pilot&#x27;s license. His flying skills gradually improved, and by early 1947 his instructors rated him above average. He was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for advanced training. His final test was six perfect landings on the carrier . The following day, he received his naval aviator wings, which his father pinned on his chest.

Shepard was assigned to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, and in the meantime the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those who were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.

Normally sea duty alternated with periods of duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was selected to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland with class five, graduating in January 1951. As a test pilot he conducted high-altitude tests to obtain information about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; experiments with the Navy&#x27;s new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the angled flight deck. He narrowly avoided being court-martialed by the station commander, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, after looping the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low passes over the beach at Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; but Shepard&#x27;s superiors, John Hyland and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.
Shepard&#x27;s next assignment was to VF-193, a night fighter squadron flying the Banshee, that was based at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. The squadron was part of Commander James D. &quot;Jig Dog&quot; Ramage&#x27;s Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard&#x27;s assignment on the advice of Elder, who commanded VF-193&#x27;s sister squadron, VF-191. Ramage made Shepard his own wingman, a decision that would save Ramage&#x27;s life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing. As squadron operations officer, Shepard&#x27;s most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive. He served two tours on the aircraft carrier in the western Pacific. It set out on a combat tour off Korea in 1953, during the Korean War, but the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting in July 1953, and Shepard did not see combat.

Rear Admiral John P. Whitney requested Shepard&#x27;s services as an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard&#x27;s request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass tended to go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable to break out of the spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy canceled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. He managed to restart the engine and avoid a fatal crash.

Shepard was an instructor at the Test Pilot School, and then entered the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. He graduated in 1957, and became an Aircraft Readiness Officer on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. By this time he had logged more than 3,600 hours of flying time, including 1,700 hours in jets.
==NASA career==
===Mercury Seven===

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.
NASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first astronauts from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards: the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent and to be or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft. The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.

The first group of 35, which included Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day&#x27;s events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.
The briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.

Shepard was informed of his selection on April 1, 1959. Two days later he traveled to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and was able to break the news to his parents and sister. The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m glad they got that out of the way.&quot;

===&quot;Freedom 7&quot;===
Faced with intense competition from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and adopted Glenn&#x27;s habit of taking a morning jog. On January 19, 1961, Gilruth informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American crewed mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise&#x27;s response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: &quot;Who let a Russian in here?&quot; During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although this flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relations officer feared he might have broken his hand.

On May 5, 1961, Shepard piloted the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission and became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space. He named his spacecraft, Mercury Spacecraft 7, &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. He awoke at 01:10, and had breakfast consisting of orange juice, a filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and scrambled eggs with his backup, John Glenn, and flight surgeon William K. Douglas. He was helped into his space suit by suit technician Joseph W. Schmitt, and boarded the transfer van at 03:55. He ascended the gantry at 05:15, and entered the spacecraft five minutes later. It was expected that liftoff would occur in another two hours and five minutes, so Shepard&#x27;s suit did not have any provision for elimination of bodily wastes, but after being strapped into the capsule&#x27;s seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for over four hours. Shepard&#x27;s endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit. Medical sensors attached to it to track the astronaut&#x27;s condition in flight were turned off to avoid shorting them out. The urine pooled in the small of his back, where it was absorbed by his undergarment. After Shepard&#x27;s flight, the space suit was modified, and by the time of Gus Grissom&#x27;s Mercury-Redstone 4 suborbital flight in July, a liquid waste collection feature had been built into the suit.

Unlike Gagarin&#x27;s 108-minute orbital flight in a Vostok spacecraft three times the size of &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, Shepard stayed on a suborbital trajectory for the 15-minute flight, which reached an altitude of , and then fell to a splashdown down the Atlantic Missile Range. Unlike Gagarin, whose flight was strictly automatic, Shepard had some control of &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, spacecraft attitude in particular. Shepard&#x27;s launch was seen live on television by millions. It was launched atop a Redstone rocket. According to Gene Kranz in his 2000 book &quot;Failure Is Not an Option&quot;, &quot;When reporters asked Shepard what he thought about as he sat atop the Redstone rocket, waiting for liftoff, he had replied, &#x27;The fact that every part of this ship was built by the lowest bidder.
After a dramatic Atlantic Ocean recovery, Shepard observed that he &quot;didn&#x27;t really feel the flight was a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It&#x27;s not the fall that hurts; it&#x27;s the sudden stop.&quot; Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and the capsule was lifted partly out of the water to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier . The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Shepard served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for Glenn&#x27;s Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight, which he had also been considered for, and Carpenter&#x27;s Mercury-Atlas 7. He was the backup pilot for Cooper for the Mercury-Atlas 9 mission, nearly replacing Cooper after Cooper flew low over the NASA administration building at Cape Canaveral in an F-102. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B &quot;Freedom 7 II&quot; in honor of his first spacecraft, and had the name painted on it, but on June 12, 1963, NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced that Mercury had accomplished all its goals and no more missions would be flown. Shepard went as far as making a personal appeal to President Kennedy, but to no avail.

===Project Gemini; chief astronaut===

Project Gemini, with a crew of two, followed on from Project Mercury. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was canceled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA&#x27;s doctors.

The doctors diagnosed Ménière&#x27;s disease, a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear. This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea. There was no known cure, but in about 20 percent of cases the condition goes away by itself. They prescribed diuretics in an attempt to drain the fluid from the ear. They also diagnosed glaucoma. An X-ray found a lump on his thyroid, and on January 17, 1964, surgeons at Hermann Hospital made an incision on his throat and removed 20 percent of his thyroid. The condition caused Shepard to be removed from flight status. Grissom and John Young flew Gemini 3 instead.

Shepard was designated Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963, receiving the title of Chief Astronaut. He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary Gaye Alford had two &quot;mood-of-the-day&quot; photographs taken of Shepard, one of a smiling &quot;Al&quot; Shepard, and the other of a grim-looking &quot;Commander&quot; Shepard. To warn visitors of Shepard&#x27;s mood, she would hang the appropriate photograph on the door of her boss&#x27;s private office. Tom Wolfe characterized Shepard&#x27;s dual personalities as &quot;Smilin&#x27; Al&quot; and the &quot;Icy Commander&quot;.

===Apollo program===
In 1968, Stafford went to Shepard&#x27;s office and told him that an otologist in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière&#x27;s disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard&#x27;s mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube (endolymphatic-subarachnoid shunt) was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted on May 14, 1968, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.

Slayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was not given it. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.
When Slayton submitted the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned them down on the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard&#x27;s crew was assigned to Apollo 14.

Neither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.

Shepard made his second space flight as commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America&#x27;s third successful lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the Lunar Module &quot;Antares&quot;. He became the fifth and, at the age of 47, the oldest man to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.

This was the first mission to broadcast extensive color television coverage from the lunar surface, using the Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera. (The same color camera model was used on Apollo 12 and provided about 30 minutes of color telecasting before it was inadvertently pointed at the Sun, ending its usefulness.) While on the Moon, Shepard used a Wilson six-iron head attached to a lunar sample scoop handle to drive golf balls. Despite thick gloves and a stiff space suit, which forced him to swing the club with one hand, Shepard struck two golf balls, driving the second, as he jokingly put it, &quot;miles and miles and miles&quot;. Analysis of high-resolution film scans of the event determined the distance to be about for the first shot and for the second.
For this mission Shepard was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:

Following Apollo 14, Shepard returned to his position as Chief of the Astronaut Office in June 1971. In July 1971 President Richard Nixon appointed him as a delegate to the 26th United Nations General Assembly, a position in which he served from September to December 1971. He was promoted to rear admiral by Nixon on August 26, 1971, the first astronaut to reach this rank. He was succeeded as Chief of the Astronaut Office by John Young on April 30, 1974. Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy on July 31, 1974.

==Later years==

Shepard was devoted to his children. Frequently, Julie, Laura and Alice were the only astronauts&#x27; children at NASA events. He taught them to ski and took them skiing in Colorado. He once rented a small plane to fly them and their friends from Texas to a summer camp in Maine. He doted on his six grandchildren as well. After Apollo 14, he began to spend more time with Louise and started taking her with him on trips to the Paris Air Show every other year and to Asia. Louise heard rumors of his affairs. The publication of Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; made them public knowledge but she never confronted him about it nor did she ever contemplate leaving him.

After Shepard left NASA, he served on the boards of many corporations. He also served as president of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, &quot;Freedom 7&quot; and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the board of directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. In 1984, together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom&#x27;s widow, Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell. As of 2022, daughter Laura Churchley leads the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees.

In 1994, he published a book with two journalists, Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict, called &quot;Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America&#x27;s Race to the Moon&quot;. Fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton is also named as an author. The book included a composite photograph showing Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon. There are no still images of this event, the only record is TV footage. The book was turned into a TV miniseries in 1994.

Shepard was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1996 and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. Following his death, President Bill Clinton issued a statement of condolences stating &quot;he [Shepard] led our country and all humanity beyond the bounds of our planet, across a truly new frontier, into the new era of space exploration&quot; and &quot;his service will always loom large in America&#x27;s history&quot;. Shepard&#x27;s widow Louise had planned to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but before she was able to do that, she died from a heart attack—on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, which, coincidentally, was the same time of day at which he had always phoned her when they were apart. They had been married for 53 years. Their family decided to cremate them both so their ashes were scattered, together, from a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove in front of their Pebble Beach home.

On December 11, 2021, twenty-three years after his death, Shepard&#x27;s daughter, Laura Shepard Churchley, also flew in space (suborbitally, above the Karman line) aboard the non-NASA Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard spacecraft on the NS-19 mission.

==Awards and honors==
Shepard was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter on October 1, 1978. He also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1981; the Langley Gold Medal on May 5, 1964; the John J. Montgomery Award in 1963; the Lambert trophy; the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award; the Cabot Award; the Collier Trophy; and the City of New York City Gold Medal for 1971. He was awarded honorary degrees of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in 1962, D.Sc. from Miami University in 1971, and Doctorate of Humanities from Franklin Pierce College in 1972. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1977, the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981, and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on May 11, 1990.
The Navy named a supply ship, , for him in 2006. The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, New Hampshire, is named after Shepard and Christa McAuliffe. In 1996, the entirety of I-565 (which passes in front of the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center, home to both the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle and a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica) was designated the &quot;Admiral Alan B. Shepard Highway&quot; in his honor. Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, from the Massachusetts border to Hooksett, is designated the Alan B. Shepard Highway, and in Hampton, Virginia, a road is named Commander Shepard Boulevard in his honor. His hometown of Derry has the nickname Space Town in honor of his career as an astronaut. Following an act of Congress, the post office in Derry was designated the Alan B. Shepard Jr. Post Office Building. Alan Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach, Florida, a beach-side park south of Cape Canaveral, is named in his honor. The City of Virginia Beach renamed its convention center, with its integral geodesic dome, the &quot;Alan B. Shepard Convention Center&quot;. The building was later renamed the &quot;Alan B. Shepard Civic Center&quot;, and was razed in 1994. At the time of the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; launch, Shepard lived in Virginia Beach.

Shepard&#x27;s high school alma mater in Derry, Pinkerton Academy, has a building named after him, and the school team is called the Astros after his career as an astronaut. Alan B. Shepard High School, in Palos Heights, Illinois, which opened in 1976, was named in his honor. Framed newspapers throughout the school depict various accomplishments and milestones in Shepard&#x27;s life. Additionally, an autographed plaque commemorates the dedication of the building. The school newspaper is named &quot;Freedom 7&quot; and the yearbook is entitled &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Blue Origin&#x27;s suborbital space tourism rocket, the New Shepard, is named after Shepard.

In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard was ranked as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, consisting of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard&#x27;s honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

Each year, the Space Foundation, in partnership with the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and NASA, present the Alan Shepard Technology in Education Award for outstanding contributions by K–12 educators or district-level administrators to educational technology. The award recognizes excellence in the development and application of technology in the classroom or to the professional development of teachers. The recipient demonstrates exemplary use of technology either to foster lifelong learners or to make the learning process easier.
==In popular culture==
As he was a key figure in the American space program, Shepard&#x27;s life has been depicted in many biographical and historical works of fiction. In film, Shepard&#x27;s selection for the Mercury program was covered in 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (where he was played by Scott Glenn), while 2002&#x27;s &quot;Race to Space&quot; and 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; feature him in a minor role, played by Mark Moses, and Dane Davenport, respectively. The HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; starred Ted Levine as Shepard and covered not only his Mercury training but also his involvement in the Apollo missions. Jake McDorman played Shepard in the 2020 TV adaptation of &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, while Desmond Harrington played him in the 2015 period drama &quot;The Astronaut Wives Club&quot;.

Archive footage of Shepard is used in the opening credits montage of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;,as part of a sequence displaying the history of human exploration, while other science fiction works have named characters in a tribute to Shepard – including both the character of Alan Tracy, in the 1960s British series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, and Commander Shepard, the main protagonist of the 2007–2012 BioWare video game series &quot;Mass Effect&quot;.

British singer-songwriter Darren Hayman&#x27;s concept album &quot;12 Astronauts&quot; includes a song for each man who has walked on the Moon. The lyrics of &quot;Don&#x27;t Clip My Wings (Alan Shepard)&quot;, sung in the first person, reflect on how Shepard &quot;feared he would never fly again&quot; after his Ménière&#x27;s diagnosis.

&quot;Shepard&#x27;s Prayer&quot; is attributed to Shepard, with the phrase supposed to have been uttered by him while he awaited liftoff aboard the &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. It is usually quoted as &quot;Dear Lord, please don&#x27;t let me fuck up&quot;, although Shepard claimed the words to be &quot;Don&#x27;t fuck up, Shepard&quot;.

Alan Shepard was featured in the 1982 EPCOT Center: The Opening Celebration to celebrate the opening of EPCOT Center in the Walt Disney World Resort. He was a guest alongside Danny Kaye and Drew Barrymore.

<text>The Thai script (, , ) is the abugida used to write Thai, Southern Thai and many other languages spoken in Thailand. The Thai script itself (as used to write Thai) has 44 consonant symbols (, ), 16 vowel symbols (, ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms, four tone diacritics ( or , or ), and other diacritics.

Although commonly referred to as the &quot;Thai alphabet&quot;, the script is not a true alphabet but an abugida, a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;o&#x27;. Consonants are written horizontally from left to right, and vowels following a consonant in speech are written above, below, to the left or to the right of it, or a combination of those.

==History==
The Thai script is derived from the Sukhothai script, which itself is derived from the Old Khmer script (, &quot;akson khom&quot;), which is a southern Brahmic style of writing derived from the south Indian Pallava alphabet (). According to tradition it was created in 1283 by King Ram Khamhaeng the Great (). The earliest attestation of the Thai script is the Ram Khamhaeng Inscription dated to 1292, however some scholars question its authenticity. The script was derived from a cursive form of the Old Khmer script of the time. It modified and simplified some of the Old Khmer letters and introduced some new ones to accommodate Thai phonology. It also introduced tone marks.

Thai is considered to be the first script in the world that invented tone markers to indicate distinctive tones, which are lacking in the Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic languages), Dravidian languages and Indo-Aryan languages from which its script is derived or partly influenced. Although Chinese and other Sino-Tibetan languages have distinctive tones in their phonological system, no tone marker is found in their orthographies. Thus, tone markers are an innovation in the Thai language that later influenced other related Tai languages and some Tibeto-Burman languages on the Mainland Southeast Asia. Another addition was consonant clusters that were written horizontally and contiguously, rather than writing the second consonant below the first one. Finally, the script wrote vowel marks on the main line, however this innovation fell out of use not long after.

==Orthography==

There is a fairly complex relationship between spelling and sound. There are various issues:
* For many consonant sounds, there are two different letters that both represent the same sound, but which cause a different tone to be associated. This stems from a major change (a tone split) that occurred historically in the phonology of the Thai language. At the time the Thai script was created, the language had three tones and a full set of contrasts between voiced and unvoiced consonants at the beginning of a syllable (e.g. &quot;z&quot; vs. &quot;s&quot;). At a later time, the voicing distinction disappeared, but in the process, each of the three original tones split in two, with an originally voiced consonant (the modern &quot;low&quot; consonant signs) producing a lower-variant tone, and an originally unvoiced consonant (the modern &quot;mid&quot; and &quot;high&quot; consonant signs) producing a higher-variant tone.
* Thai borrowed a large number of words from Sanskrit and Pali, and the Thai alphabet was created so that the original spelling of these words could be preserved as much as possible. This means that the Thai alphabet has a number of &quot;duplicate&quot; letters that represent separate sounds in Sanskrit and Pali (e.g. the alveolo-palatal fricative &quot;ś&quot;) but which never represented distinct sounds in the Thai language. These are mostly or exclusively used in Sanskrit and Pali borrowings.
* The desire to preserve original Sanskrit and Pali spellings also produces a particularly large number of duplicate ways of spelling sounds at the end of a syllable (where Thai is strictly limited in the sounds that can occur but Sanskrit allowed all possibilities, especially once former final /a/ was deleted), as well as a number of silent letters. Moreover, many consonants from Sanskrit and Pali loanwords are generally silent. The spelling of the words resembles Sanskrit or Pali orthography:
** Thai (spelled &quot;sǎamaarth&quot; but pronounced &quot;sa-mat&quot; with a silent r and a plain t that is represented using an aspirated consonant) &quot;to be able&quot; (Sanskrit समर्थ &quot;samartha&quot;)
** Thai (spelled &quot;chanthr&quot; but pronounced &quot;chan&quot; because the th and the r are silent) &quot;moon&quot; (Sanskrit चन्द्र &quot;chandra&quot;)
* Thai phonology dictates that all syllables must end in a vowel, an approximant, a nasal, or a voiceless plosive. Therefore, the letter written may not have the same pronunciation in the initial position as it does in the final position. See Alphabet listing below for more detail.
* Even though the high class letter &quot;ho hip&quot; is used to write the sound /h/, if the letter comes before a low class letter in a syllable, it becomes the silent &quot;ho nam&quot; and turn the initial consonant into high class. See Tones below for more detail.

Thai letters do not have upper- and lower-case forms like Latin letters do. Spaces between words are not used, except in certain linguistically motivated cases.

===Punctuation===
Minor pauses in sentences &quot;may&quot; be marked by a comma ( or , or ), and major pauses by a period ( or , or ), but most often are marked by a blank space (, ). Thai writing also uses quotation marks (, ) and parentheses (round brackets) (, or , ), but not square brackets or braces.

A () is used for abbreviation. A () is the same as &quot;etc.&quot; in English.

Several obsolete characters indicated the beginning or ending of sections. A bird&#x27;s eye (, , officially called , ) formerly indicated paragraphs. An () was formerly used to mark the end of a chapter. A () was formerly used to mark the end of a document, but is now obsolete.

==Alphabet listing==
Thai (along with its sister system, Lao) lacks conjunct consonants and independent vowels, while both designs are common among Brahmic scripts (e.g., Burmese and Balinese). In scripts with conjunct consonants, each consonant has two forms: base and conjoined. Consonant clusters are represented with the two styles of consonants. The two styles may form typographical ligatures, as in Devanagari. Independent vowels are used when a syllable starts with a vowel sign.

===Consonants===

There are 44 consonant letters representing 21 distinct consonant sounds. Duplicate consonants either correspond to sounds that existed in Old Thai at the time the alphabet was created but no longer exist (in particular, voiced obstruents such as &quot;d&quot;), or different Sanskrit and Pali consonants pronounced identically in Thai. There are in addition four consonant-vowel combination characters not included in the tally of 44.

Consonants are divided into three classes — in alphabetical order these are middle (, ), high (, ), and low (, ) class — as shown in the table below. These class designations reflect phonetic qualities of the sounds to which the letters originally corresponded in Old Thai. In particular, &quot;middle&quot; sounds were voiceless unaspirated stops; &quot;high&quot; sounds, voiceless aspirated stops or voiceless fricatives; &quot;low&quot; sounds, voiced. Subsequent sound changes have obscured the phonetic nature of these classes. Today, the class of a consonant without a tone mark, along with the short or long length of the accompanying vowel, determine the base accent (, ). Middle class consonants with a long vowel spell an additional four tones with one of four tone marks over the controlling consonant: , , , and . High and low class consonants are limited to and , as shown in the . Differing interpretations of the two marks or their absence allow low class consonants to spell tones not allowed for the corresponding high class consonant. In the case of digraphs where a low class follows a higher class consonant, often the higher class rules apply, but the marker, if used, goes over the low class one; accordingly, and may be considered to be digraphs as such, as explained below the Tone table. 
;Notes 
To aid learning, each consonant is traditionally associated with an acrophonic Thai word that either starts with the same sound, or features it prominently. For example, the name of the letter is &quot;kho khai&quot; (), in which &quot;kho&quot; is the sound it represents, and &quot;khai&quot; () is a word which starts with the same sound and means &quot;egg&quot;.

Two of the consonants, (&quot;kho khuat&quot;) and (&quot;kho khon&quot;), are no longer used in written Thai, but still appear on many keyboards and in character sets. When the first Thai typewriter was developed by Edwin Hunter McFarland in 1892, there was simply no space for all characters, thus two had to be left out. Also, neither of these two letters correspond to a Sanskrit or Pali letter, and each of them, being a modified form of the letter that precedes it (compare and ), has the same pronunciation and the same consonant class as the preceding letter, thus making them redundant. They used to represent the sound in Old Thai, but it has merged with in Modern Thai.

Equivalents for romanisation are shown in the table below. Many consonants are pronounced differently at the beginning and at the end of a syllable. The entries in columns &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;final&quot; indicate the pronunciation for that consonant in the corresponding positions in a syllable. Where the entry is &#x27;-&#x27;, the consonant may not be used to close a syllable. Where a combination of consonants ends a written syllable, only the first is pronounced; possible closing consonant sounds are limited to &#x27;k&#x27;, &#x27;m&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;ng&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;t&#x27;.

Although official standards for romanisation are the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) defined by the Royal Thai Institute, and the almost identical defined by the International Organization for Standardization, many publications use different romanisation systems. In daily practice, a bewildering variety of romanisations are used, making it difficult to know how to pronounce a word, or to judge if two words (e.g. on a map and a street sign) are actually the same. For more precise information, an equivalent from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is given as well.

====Alphabetic====
; Notes
====Phonetic====
The consonants can be organised by place and manner of articulation according to principles of the International Phonetic Association.
Thai distinguishes among three voice/aspiration patterns for plosive consonants:
*unvoiced, unaspirated
*unvoiced, aspirated
*voiced, unaspirated

Where English has only a distinction between the voiced, unaspirated and the unvoiced, aspirated , Thai distinguishes a third sound which is neither voiced nor aspirated, which occurs in English only as an allophone of , approximately the sound of the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spin&quot;. There is similarly a laminal denti-alveolar , , triplet. In the velar series there is a , pair and in the postalveolar series the , pair.

In each cell below, the first line indicates (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). The conventional alphabetic order shown in the table above follows roughly the table below, reading the coloured blocks from right to left and top to bottom.

Although the overall 44 Thai consonants provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. The consonant sounds in the table for initials collapse in the table for final sounds. At the end of a syllable, all plosives are unvoiced, unaspirated, and have no audible release. Initial affricates and fricatives become final plosives. The initial trill (), approximant (), and lateral approximants (, ) are realized as a final nasal .

Only 8 ending consonant sounds, as well as no ending consonant sound, are available in Thai pronunciation. Among these consonants, excluding the disused and , six (, , , , , ) cannot be used as a final. The remaining 36 are grouped as following.

===Vowels===
Thai vowel sounds and diphthongs are written using a mixture of vowel symbols on a consonant base. Each vowel is shown in its correct position relative to a base consonant and sometimes a final consonant as well. Vowels can go above, below, left of or right of the consonant, or combinations of these places. If a vowel has parts before and after the initial consonant, and the syllable starts with a consonant cluster, the split will go around the whole cluster.

Twenty-one vowel symbol elements are traditionally named, which may appear alone or in combination to form compound symbols.

The inherent vowels are in open syllables (CV) and in closed syllables (CVC). For example, transcribes &quot;road&quot;. There are a few exceptions in Pali loanwords, where the inherent vowel of an open syllable is . The circumfix vowels, such as , encompass a preceding consonant with an inherent vowel. For example, is written , and &quot;only&quot; is written .

The characters ฤ ฤๅ (plus ฦ ฦๅ, which are obsolete) are usually considered as vowels, the first being a short vowel sound, and the latter, long. The letters are based on vocalic consonants used in Sanskrit, given the one-to-one letter correspondence of Thai to Sanskrit, although the last two letters are quite rare, as their equivalent Sanskrit sounds only occur in a few, ancient words and thus are functionally obsolete in Thai. The first symbol &#x27;ฤ&#x27; is common in many Sanskrit and Pali words and &#x27;ฤๅ&#x27; less so, but does occur as the primary spelling for the Thai adaptation of Sanskrit &#x27;rishi&#x27; and &quot;treu&quot; ( or ), a very rare Khmer loan word for &#x27;fish&#x27; only found in ancient poetry. As alphabetical entries, ฤ ฤๅ follow ร, and themselves can be read as a combination of consonant and vowel, equivalent to รึ (short), and รือ (long) (and the obsolete pair as ลึ, ลือ), respectively. Moreover, ฤ can act as ริ as an integral part in many words mostly borrowed from Sanskrit such as กฤษณะ (&quot;kritsana&quot;, not &quot;kruetsana&quot;), ฤทธิ์ (&quot;rit&quot;, not &quot;ruet&quot;), and กฤษดา (&quot;kritsada&quot;, not &quot;kruetsada&quot;), for example. It is also used to spell อังกฤษ &quot;angkrit&quot; England/English. The word ฤกษ์ (&quot;roek&quot;) is a unique case where ฤ is pronounced like เรอ. In the past, prior to the turn of the twentieth century, it was common for writers to substitute these letters in native vocabulary that contained similar sounds as a shorthand that was acceptable in writing at the time. For example, the conjunction &#x27;or&#x27; ( &quot;rue&quot;, cf. &quot;lu&quot;) was often written . This practice has become obsolete, but can still be seen in Thai literature. 

The pronunciation below is indicated by the International Phonetic Alphabet and the Romanisation according to the Royal Thai Institute as well as several variant Romanisations often encountered. A very approximate equivalent is given for various regions of English speakers and surrounding areas. Dotted circles represent the positions of consonants or consonant clusters. The first one represents the initial consonant and the latter (if it exists) represents the final.

&quot;Ro han&quot; (ร หัน) is not usually considered a vowel and is not included in the following table. It represents the &quot;sara a&quot; vowel in certain Sanskrit loanwords and appears as ◌รร◌. When used without a final consonant (◌รร), is implied as the final consonant, giving .


===Tone===
====Central Thai====
Central Thai is a tonal language, and the script gives full information on the tones. Tones are realised in the vowels, but indicated in the script by a combination of the class of the initial consonant (high, mid or low), vowel length (long or short), closing consonant (plosive or sonorant, called &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;live&quot;) and, if present, one of four tone marks, whose names derive from the names of the digits 1–4 borrowed from Pali or Sanskrit. The rules for denoting tones are shown in the following chart:


&quot;None&quot;, that is, no tone marker, is used with the base accent (พื้นเสียง, ). &quot;Mai tri&quot; and &quot;mai chattawa&quot; are only used with mid-class consonants.

Two consonant characters (not diacritics) are used to modify the tone:
*ห นำ &quot;ho nam&quot;, leading ho. A silent, high-class ห &quot;leads&quot; low-class nasal stops (ง, ญ, น and ม) and non-plosives (ว, ย, ร and ล), which have no corresponding high-class phonetic match, into the tone properties of a high-class consonant. In polysyllabic words, an initial mid- or high-class consonant with an implicit vowel similarly &quot;leads&quot; these same low-class consonants into the higher class tone rules, with the tone marker borne by the low-class consonant.
*อ นำ &quot;o nam&quot;, leading o. In four words only, a silent, mid-class อ &quot;leads&quot; low-class ย into mid-class tone rules: อย่า (&quot;ya&quot;, don&#x27;t) อยาก (&quot;yak&quot;, desire) อย่าง (&quot;yang&quot;, kind, sort, type) อยู่ (&quot;yu&quot;, stay). All four have long-vowel, low-tone &quot;siang ek&quot;; อยาก, a dead syllable, needs no tone marker, but the three live syllables all take &quot;mai ek&quot;.

In some dialects there are words which are spelled with one tone but pronounced with another and often occur in informal conversation (notably the pronouns ฉัน &quot;chan&quot; and เขา &quot;khao&quot;, which are both pronounced with a high tone rather than the rising tone indicated by the script). Generally, when such words are recited or read in public, they are pronounced as spelled.

====Southern Thai====

Although the Southern Thai writing form also gives full information on the tones as does Central Thai, the language itself is pitch-accent language, spoken form can have up to seven tones. When Southern Thai is written in Thai script, there are different rules for indicating spoken tone. 
===Diacritics===
Other diacritics are used to indicate short vowels and silent letters:
* means &quot;climbing stick&quot;. It is a miniature Thai numeral 8 ๘. is often used with &quot;sara e&quot; (เ) and &quot;sara ae&quot; (แ) in closed syllables.
*&quot;Thanthakhat&quot; is an archaic word for &quot;capital punishment&quot;
&quot;Fan nu&quot; means &quot;rat teeth&quot; and is thought as being placed in combination with short &quot;sara i&quot; and &quot;fong man&quot; to form other characters.

===Numerals===

For numerals, mostly the standard Hindu-Arabic numerals (, &quot;lek hindu arabik&quot;) are used, but Thai also has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (, &quot;lek thai&quot;), which are mostly limited to government documents, election posters, license plates of military vehicles, and special entry prices for Thai nationals.

===Other symbols===

&quot;Pai-yan noi&quot; and &quot;angkhan diao&quot; share the same character. &quot;Sara a&quot; (–ะ) used in combination with other characters is called &quot;wisanchani&quot;.

Some of the characters can mark the beginning or end of a sentence, chapter, or episode of a story or of a stanza in a poem. These have changed use over time and are becoming uncommon.

==Sanskrit and Pali==
The Thai script (like all Indic scripts) uses a number of modifications to write Sanskrit and related languages (in particular, Pali). Pali is very closely related to Sanskrit and is the liturgical language of Thai Buddhism. In Thailand, Pali is written and studied using a slightly modified Thai script. The main difference is that each consonant is followed by an implied short a (อะ), not the &#x27;o&#x27;, or &#x27;ə&#x27; of Thai: this short a is never omitted in pronunciation, and if the vowel is not to be pronounced, then a specific symbol must be used, the อฺ (a solid dot under the consonant). This means that &quot;sara a&quot; (อะ) is never used when writing Pali, because it is always implied. For example, &quot;namo&quot; is written นะโม in Thai, but in Pali it is written as นโม, because the อะ is redundant. The Sanskrit word &#x27;mantra&#x27; is written มนตร์ in Thai (and therefore pronounced &quot;mon&quot;), but is written มนฺตฺร in Sanskrit (and therefore pronounced &quot;mantra&quot;). When writing Pali, only 33 consonants and 12 vowels are used.

This is an example of a Pali text written using the Thai Sanskrit orthography: อรหํ สมฺมาสมฺพุทฺโธ ภควา . Written in modern Thai orthography, this becomes อะระหัง สัมมาสัมพุทโธ ภะคะวา &quot;arahang sammasamphuttho phakhawa&quot;.

In Thailand, Sanskrit is read out using the Thai values for all the consonants (so ค is read as &quot;kha&quot; and not [ga]), which makes Thai spoken Sanskrit incomprehensible to sanskritists not trained in Thailand. The Sanskrit values are used in transliteration (without the diacritics), but these values are never actually used when Sanskrit is read out loud in Thailand. The vowels used in Thai are identical to Sanskrit, with the exception of ฤ, ฤๅ, ฦ, and ฦๅ, which are read using their Thai values, not their Sanskrit values. Sanskrit and Pali are not tonal languages, but in Thailand, the Thai tones are used when reading these languages out loud.

In the tables of this section, the Thai value (transliterated according to the Royal Thai system) of each letter is listed first, followed by the IAST value of each letter in square brackets. The IAST values are never used in pronunciation, but sometimes in transcriptions (with the diacritics omitted). This disjoint between transcription and spoken value explains the romanisation for Sanskrit names in Thailand that many foreigners find confusing. For example, สุวรรณภูมิ is romanised as Suvarnabhumi, but pronounced &quot;su-wan-na-phum&quot;. ศรีนครินทร์ is romanised as Srinagarindra but pronounced &quot;si-nakha-rin&quot;.

===Plosives (&quot;)===

Plosives (also called stops) are listed in their traditional Sanskrit order, which corresponds to Thai alphabetical order from ก to ม with three exceptions: in Thai, high-class ข is followed by two obsolete characters with no Sanskrit equivalent, high-class ฃ and low-class ฅ; low-class ช is followed by sibilant ซ (low-class equivalent of high-class sibilant ส that follows ศ and ษ.) The table gives the Thai value first, and then the IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) value in square brackets.
None of the Sanskrit plosives are pronounced as the Thai voiced plosives, so these are not represented in the table. While letters are listed here according to their class in Sanskrit, Thai has lost the distinction between many of the consonants. So, while there is a clear distinction between ช and ฌ in Sanskrit, in Thai these two consonants are pronounced identically (including tone). Likewise, the Thai phonemes do not differentiate between the retroflex and dental classes, since Thai has no retroflex consonants. The equivalents of all the retroflex consonants are pronounced identically to their dental counterparts: thus ฏ is pronounced like ต, ฐ is pronounced like ถ, ฑ is pronounced like ท, ฒ is pronounced like ธ, and ณ is pronounced like น.

The Sanskrit unaspirated unvoiced plosives are pronounced as unaspirated unvoiced, whereas Sanskrit aspirated voiced plosives are pronounced as aspirated unvoiced.

===Non-plosives (&quot;)===

&quot;Semivowels&quot; (กึ่งสระ &quot;kueng sara&quot;) &quot;and liquids&quot; come in Thai alphabetical order after ม, the last of the plosives. The term อวรรค &quot;awak&quot; means &quot;without a break&quot;; that is, without a plosive.
==== Sibilants ====
&quot;Inserted sounds&quot; (เสียดแทรก &quot;siat saek&quot;) follow the semi-vowel ว in alphabetical order.
Like Sanskrit, Thai has no voiced sibilant (so no &#x27;z&#x27; or &#x27;zh&#x27;). In modern Thai, the distinction between the three high-class consonants has been lost and all three are pronounced &#x27;sà&#x27;; however, foreign words with a sh-sound may still be transcribed as if the Sanskrit values still hold (e.g., &quot;ang-grit&quot; อังกฤษ for &quot;English&quot; instead of อังกฤส).
:ศ ศาลา (so sala) leads words, as in its example word, ศาลา. The digraph ศรี (Indic &quot;sri&quot;) is regularly pronounced สี (si), as in Sisaket Province, Thai: ศรีสะเกษ.
:ษ ฤๅษี (so rue-si) may only lead syllables &quot;within&quot; a word, as in its example, ฤๅษี, or to end a syllable as in ศรีสะเกษ &quot;Sisaket&quot; and อังกฤษ &quot;Angkrit&quot; English.
:ส เสือ (so suea) spells native Thai words that require a high-class /s/, as well as naturalized Pali/Sanskrit words, such as สารท (สาท) in Thetsakan Sat: เทศกาลสารท (เทด-สะ-กาน-สาท), formerly ศารท (สาท).
:ซ โซ่ (so so), which follows the similar-appearing ช in Thai alphabetical order, spells words requiring a low-class /s/, as does ทร + vowel.
:ทร, as in the heading of this section, เสียดแทรก (pronounced เสียดแซก &quot;siat saek&quot;), when accompanied by a vowel (implicit in ทรง (ซง &quot;song&quot; an element in forming words used with royalty); a semivowel in ทรวง (ซวง &quot;suang&quot; chest, heart); or explicit in ทราย (ซาย &quot;sai&quot; sand). Exceptions to ทร + vowel = /s/ are the prefix โทร- (equivalent to &quot;tele-&quot; far, pronounced โทระ &quot;to-ra&quot;), and phonetic re-spellings of English tr- (as in the phonetic respelling of &quot;trumpet&quot;: ทรัมเพ็ท.) ทร is otherwise pronounced as two syllables ทอระ-, as in ทรมาน (ทอระมาน &quot;to-ra-man&quot; to torment).

====Voiced h====
ห, a high-class consonant, comes next in alphabetical order, but its low-class equivalent, ฮ, follows similar-appearing อ as the last letter of the Thai alphabet. Like modern Hindi, the voicing has disappeared, and the letter is now pronounced like English &#x27;h&#x27;. Like Sanskrit, this letter may only be used to start a syllable, but may not end it. (A popular beer is romanized as Singha, but in Thai is สิงห์, with a &quot;karan&quot; on the ห; correct pronunciation is &quot;sing&quot;, but foreigners to Thailand typically say &quot;sing-ha&quot;.)

====Retroflex lla====
This represents the retroflex liquid of Pali and Vedic Sanskrit, which does not exist in Classical Sanskrit.

===Vowels===
All consonants have an inherent &#x27;a&#x27; sound, and therefore there is no need to use the ะ symbol when writing Sanskrit. The Thai vowels อื, ใอ, and so forth, are not used in Sanskrit. The zero consonant, อ, is unique to the Indic alphabets descended from Khmer. When it occurs in Sanskrit, it is always the zero consonant and never the vowel &quot;o&quot; . Its use in Sanskrit is therefore to write vowels that cannot be otherwise written alone: e.g., อา or อี. When อ is written on its own, then it is a carrier for the implied vowel, &quot;a&quot; (equivalent to อะ in Thai).

The vowel sign อำ occurs in Sanskrit, but only as the combination of the pure vowels &quot;sara a&quot; อา with &quot;nikkhahit&quot; อํ.

===Other non-Thai symbols===
There are a number of additional symbols only used to write Sanskrit or Pali, and not used in writing Thai.
====Nikkhahit (anusvāra)====

In Sanskrit, the anusvāra indicates a certain kind of nasal sound. In Thai this is written as an open circle above the consonant, known as &quot;nikkhahit&quot; (), from Pali &quot;niggahīta&quot;. Nasalisation does not occur in Thai, therefore, a nasal stop is always substituted: e.g. ตํ , is pronounced as ตัง &quot;tang&quot; by Thai s. If nikkhahit occurs before a consonant, then Thai uses a nasal stop of the same class: e.g. สํสฺกฤตา is read as สันสกฤตา &quot;san-sa-krit-ta&quot; (The ส following the nikkhahit is a dental-class consonant, therefore the dental-class nasal stop น is used). For this reason, it has been suggested that in Thai, nikkhahit should be listed as a consonant. Also, traditional Pali grammars describe nikkhahit as a consonant. &quot;Nikkhahit&quot; นิคหิต occurs as part of the Thai vowels &quot;sara am&quot; อำ and &quot;sara ue&quot; อึ.

====Phinthu (virāma)====
อฺ

Because the Thai script is an abugida, a symbol (equivalent to virāma in devanagari) needs to be added to indicate that the implied vowel is not to be pronounced. This is the , which is a solid dot (also called &#x27;Bindu&#x27; in Sanskrit) below the consonant.

==== Yamakkan ====
อ๎

Yamakkan () is an obsolete symbol used to mark the beginning of consonant clusters: e.g. พ๎ราห๎มณ &quot;phramana&quot; . Without the yamakkan, this word would be pronounced instead. This is a feature unique to the Thai script (other Indic scripts use a combination of ligatures, conjuncts or virāma to convey the same information). The symbol is obsolete because may be used to achieve the same effect: พฺราหฺมณ.

====Visarga====

The means of recording visarga (final voiceless &#x27;h&#x27;) in Thai has reportedly been lost, although the character ◌ะ which is used to transcribe a short /a/ or to add a glottal stop after a vowel is the closest equivalent and can be seen used as a visarga in some Thai-script Sanskrit text.

== Sukhothai ==

The Thai script is derived from the Sukhothai script.

==Unicode==
Thai script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Thai is U+0E00–U+0E7F.
It is a verbatim copy of the older TIS-620 character set which encodes the vowels เ, แ, โ, ใ and ไ before the consonants they follow, and thus Thai, Lao, Tai Viet and New Tai Lue are the only Brahmic scripts in Unicode that use visual order instead of logical order.

==Keyboard layouts==

Thai characters can be typed using the Kedmanee layout and the Pattachote layout.

<doc id="63733" wikidata="Q167458" url="?curid=63733" title="Peter Claver">
<text>Peter Claver (; 26 June 1580 – 8 September 1654) was a Spanish Jesuit priest and missionary born in Verdú, Spain, who, due to his life and work, became the patron saint of slaves, Colombia, and ministry to African Americans. 

During the 40 years of his ministry in the New Kingdom of Granada, it is estimated he personally baptized around 300,000 people and heard the confessions of over 5,000 people per year. He is also patron saint for seafarers. He is considered a heroic example of what should be the Christian praxis of love and of the exercise of human rights. 

The Congress of Colombia declared September 9 as the National Day of Human Rights in his honor.

==Early life==
Claver was born in 1580 into a devoutly Catholic and prosperous farming family in the Spanish village of Verdú, Urgell, located in the Province of Lleida, Spain about from Barcelona. He was born 70 years after King Ferdinand of Spain set the colonial slavery culture into motion by authorizing the purchase of 250 African slaves in Lisbon for his territories in New Spain.

Later, as a student at the University of Barcelona, Claver was noted for his intelligence and piety. After two years of study there, Claver wrote these words in the notebook he kept throughout his life: &quot;I must dedicate myself to the service of God until death, on the understanding that I am like a slave.&quot;

==Formation and Work in the New World==
After he had completed his studies, Claver entered the Society of Jesus in Tarragona at the age of 20. When he had completed the novitiate, he was sent to study philosophy at Palma, Mallorca. While there, he came to know the porter of the college, St. Alphonsus Rodriguez, a laybrother known for his holiness and gift of prophecy. Rodriguez felt that he had been told by God that Claver was to spend his life in service in the colonies of New Spain, and he frequently urged the young student to accept that calling.
Claver volunteered for the Spanish colonies and was sent to the New Kingdom of Granada, where he arrived in the port city of Cartagena in 1610. Required to spend six years studying theology before being ordained a priest, he lived in Jesuit houses at Tunja and Bogotá. During those preparatory years, he was deeply disturbed by the harsh treatment and living conditions of the black slaves who were brought from Africa.

By this time, the slave trade had been established in the Americas for about a century. Local Native Americans were considered physically ill-suited to work in the gold and silver mines. Mine owners met their labor requirements by importing blacks from Angola and Congo, whom they purchased in West Africa for four crowns a head or bartered for goods and sold in America for an average two hundred crowns apiece. Others were captured at random, especially able-bodied males and females deemed suitable for labor.

Cartagena was a slave-trading hub and 10,000 slaves poured into the port yearly, crossing the Atlantic from West Africa under conditions so foul that an estimated one-third died in transit. Although the slave trade was condemned by Pope Paul III and Urban VIII had issued a papal decree prohibiting slavery, (later called &quot;supreme villainy&quot; by Pope Pius IX), it was a lucrative business and continued to flourish.

Claver&#x27;s predecessor in his eventual lifelong mission, Alonso de Sandoval, was his mentor and inspiration. Sandoval devoted himself to serving the slaves for 40 years before Claver arrived to continue his work. Sandoval attempted to learn about their customs and languages; he was so successful that, when he returned to Seville, he wrote a book in 1627 about the nature, customs, rites and beliefs of the Africans. Sandoval found Claver an apt pupil. When he was solemnly professed in 1622, Claver signed his final profession document in Latin as: &quot;Petrus Claver, aethiopum semper servus&quot; (Peter Claver, servant of the Ethiopians [i.e. Africans] forever).

==Ministry to the enslaved==
Whereas Sandoval had visited the slaves where they worked, Claver preferred to head for the wharf as soon as a slave ship entered the port. Boarding the ship, he entered the filthy and diseased holds to treat and minister to their badly treated, terrified human cargo, who had survived a voyage of several months under miserable conditions. It was difficult to move around on the ships, because those trafficking in slaves filled them to capacity. The slaves were often told they were being taken to a land where they would be eaten. Claver wore a cloak, which he would lend to anyone in need. A legend arose that whoever wore the cloak received lifetime health and was cured of all disease. After the slaves were herded from the ship and penned in nearby yards to be scrutinized by crowds of buyers, Claver joined them with medicine, food, bread, and lemons. With the help of interpreters and pictures which he carried with him, he gave basic instructions.

Once baptized, Claver saw the slaves as fellow Christians, and encouraged others to treat them as such. During the season when slavers were not accustomed to arrive, he traveled the country, visiting plantation after plantation, to give spiritual consolation to the slaves. During his 40 years of ministry it is estimated that he personally catechized and baptized 300,000 slaves. He would then follow up on them to ensure that as Christians they received their Christian and civil rights. His mission extended beyond caring for the slaves, however. He preached in the city square, to sailors and traders and conducted country missions, returning every spring to visit those he had baptized, ensuring that they were treated humanely. During these missions, whenever possible he avoided the hospitality of planters and overseers; instead, he would lodge in the same quarters as the slaves.

Claver&#x27;s work on behalf of the enslaved did not prevent him from ministering to the souls of well-to-do members of society, traders and visitors to Cartagena (including Muslims and English Protestants) and condemned criminals, many of whom he spiritually prepared for death; he was also a frequent visitor at the city&#x27;s hospitals. Through years of unremitting toil and the force of his own unique personality, the slaves&#x27; condition slowly improved. In time he became a moral force, the Apostle of Cartagena.

==Illness, and death==
In the last years of his life Peter was too ill to leave his room. He lingered for four years, largely forgotten and neglected, physically abused and starved by an ex-slave who had been hired by the Superior of the house to care for him. He never complained about his treatment, accepting it as a just punishment for his sins. He died on 8 September 1654.

When the news of his death spread throughout Cartagena many came to his room to pay their last respects. Such was his reputation for holiness that the room was stripped bare of anything that might serve as a relic.

The city magistrates, who had previously considered him a nuisance for his persistent advocacy on behalf of the slaves, ordered a public funeral and he was buried with pomp and ceremony. The scope of Claver&#x27;s ministry, which was prodigious even before considering the astronomical number of people he baptized, was realized only after his death.

==Legacy==
Claver was canonized in 1888 by Pope Leo XIII, along with the Jesuit porter, Alphonsus Rodriguez. In 1896, Pope Leo also declared Claver the patron of missionary work among all African peoples. His body is preserved and venerated in the church of the Jesuit residence, now renamed in his honor as &quot;Iglesia de San Pedro Claver&quot;.
Many organizations, missions, parishes, religious congregations, schools and hospitals bear the name of St. Peter Claver and also claim to continue the Mission of Claver as the following:

*The Knights of Peter Claver, Inc., is the largest African-American Catholic fraternal organization in the United States. In 2006, a unit was established in San Andres, Colombia. The Order was founded in Mobile, Alabama, and is presently headquartered in New Orleans.
*Claver&#x27;s mission continues today in the work of the Apostleship of the Sea (AoS) and his inspiration remains among port chaplains and those who visit ships in the name of the church, through the AoS.
*The Missionary Sisters of St. Peter Claver are a religious congregation of women dedicated to serving the spiritual and social needs of the poor around the world, particularly in Africa. They were founded in Austria by the Blessed Mary Theresa Ledóchowska in 1894.
*Among the many parishes dedicated to St. Peter Claver are those in Lexington, Kentucky, West Hartford, Connecticut, Macon, Georgia, New Orleans, Louisiana, Simi Valley, California, St. Paul, Minnesota, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Montclair, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland, Huntington, West Virginia, and Nairobi, Kenya.
*Among the many schools dedicated to St. Peter Claver are those in Decatur, Georgia, and Pimville, South Africa. The oldest African American school in the Diocese of St. Petersburg, and the oldest African American school still functioning in the State of Florida, is the St. Peter Claver Catholic School.

The Congress of the Republic of Colombia declared September 9 as the Human Rights national Day in his honor.

==Controversy==
His canonization has caused angst among some due to his own slaveholding and treatment of slaves (including corporal punishment), and it is alleged that these matters may have initially stalled his canonization. Dr. Katie Grimes has gone so far as to call Claver a &quot;White Supremacist&quot; and has accused the Catholic Church of &quot;White supremacism&quot; for championing him.

That said, the sources cited by Grimes&#x27; in her criticism stated that Claver allowed uncommon freedom for the slaves he purchased (using them in his ministry rather than for hard labor), and resorted to physical punishment solely to prevent what he saw as immoral behavior.

Northampton is one of the largest towns in England; the population of its overall urban area was recorded as 249,093 in the 2021 census. The parish of Northampton alone had 137,387.

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates to the Bronze Age, Romans and Anglo-Saxons. In the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton Castle, an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a town charter by Richard I in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by King John in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in 1264 and 1460.

The town largely supported the Parliamentary Roundheads during the English Civil War, which prompted Charles II to order the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The Great Fire of Northampton in 1675 also destroyed much of the historic town. Northampton was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. The town continued to expand with the arrival of the Grand Union Canal and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.

Growth was limited following the World Wars until it was designated a New Town in 1968, accelerating development which has continued into the 21st century. Northampton unsuccessfully applied for city status four times; in 1992, 2000, 2002 and 2022.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The earliest reference to Northampton in writing occurred in 914 under the name &quot;Ham tune&quot;. The prefix &quot;North&quot; was added later to distinguish it from other towns called Hampton, most prominently Southampton. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086) records the town as &quot;Northantone&quot;, which evolved into &quot;Norhamptone&quot; by the 13th century and later &quot;Northampton&quot; by the 17th century.

=== Ancient ===

Present-day Northampton is the latest in a series of settlements that began in the Bronze Age. Remains found in the Briar Hill district show evidence of a Neolithic encampment within a large circular earthwork where local farmers assembled for tribal ceremonies and seasonal events from approximately 3500 BC to 2000 BC.

During the British Iron Age, people typically lived in protected hill forts. Present-day Hunsbury Hill is an example of this settlement; a circular ditch and a bank faced with a wall of timber and enclosing an area of which dates to around 400 BC. In the Roman period, a small rural settlement is thought to have existed in the present-day district of Duston; remains of Roman pottery were found there.

Following a Danish invasion, the central area of the town was turned into a stronghold called a &quot;burh&quot; probably by the Anglo-Saxons. By the time of the Peace of Wedmore in 878 the Burgh was in possession of the Danes and became the base for one of the Danish armies. A ditch was dug around the settlement and it was fortified with earth ramparts. Having conquered Mercia, the Danes turned the settlement into a centre for military and administrative purposes, which was part of the Danelaw. The Danish army of Northampton however submitted to Edward the Elder, Saxon King of Wessex (who controlled the southern and western part of the English Kingdom of Mercia) in 921

In the 9th century &quot;Regenhere of Northampton&quot;, an East Anglian Saint with localised veneration, was buried in Northampton. By 918, Northampton had an earl and an army dependent upon it, whose territory extended to the River Welland.

Edward the Elder turned Northampton into the centre of one of the new shires, and it prospered as a river port and trading centre. In 940, it resisted the invading forces of Danish opposition in Northumbria when the Mercians successfully defended the town in a siege by King Olaf of York, but was burnt in 1010 by a Danish army, and again in 1065 by the rebellious northern earls Edwin and Morcar. Despite this, the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records &quot;Northantone&quot; as possessing 316 houses with a population of 2000 people, ranking between Warwick and Leicester in size.

=== Medieval ===

With the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the town rose to national significance: its geographical location in the centre of England made Northampton a valuable strategical point for government and as a convenient meeting place for political, social, ecclesiastical and military events.

Northampton Castle is thought to have been built by Simon de Senlis, who became the first Earl of Northampton, circa 1084. It was originally an earth and timber stockaded construction which was later rebuilt in stone. The castle became an occasional royal residence from the reign of King Henry I in 1130 until that of King Richard II. King John regularly stayed at the castle and moved The Treasury there in 1205. Some 32 Parliaments were held there. The last Parliament at Northampton was held in 1380. Significant events in the castle&#x27;s history include the trial of Thomas Becket in 1164, the publication of the Assize of Northampton in 1176, the declaration of peace with Scotland in the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton, the passage of the Statute of Northampton in 1328 and the imposition of poll tax in 1380. Royal tournaments and feasts were also held at the castle.

Simon de Senlis is also thought to have built the medieval town walls, which enclosed about and had four main gates. Though demolished now, the circular pattern of the main roads surrounding the town centre marks the original position of the walls. de Senlis founded the Cluniac Priory of St Andrew&#x27;s in the area of Semilong, and built The Church of the Holy Sepulchre – one of four remaining round churches in England – and All Hallows&#x27; Church on the current site of All Saints&#x27; Church. His son, Simon II de Senlis, built St Peter&#x27;s Church on a site between a former Anglo-Saxon palace and Northampton Castle. Simon II de Senlis also founded Delapré Abbey – another Cluniac priory – which still stands today. Other priories in medieval Northampton include St James&#x27; Abbey, Graye Friers, Blackfriars and Whitefriars. St. John&#x27;s, a medieval hospital, was situated east of Bridge Street. A network of medieval tunnels remains under the centre of Northampton around All Saints&#x27; Church and the Market Square but their purpose, extent and significance have been disputed.

The town was originally controlled by officials acting for the King who collected taxes and upheld the law. This changed on 18 November 1189 when King Richard I granted the town its first charter in exchange for money to fund his crusades. The charter allowed the townspeople certain rights and independence in legal and administrative matters. In 1215, King John authorised the appointment of William Tilly as the town&#x27;s first Mayor and ordered that &quot;twelve of the better and more discreet [residents] of your town&quot; join him as a council to assist him. The importance of Northampton at this time is underlined by the fact that only London, York and King&#x27;s Lynn had mayors by this date. The mayor later ruled with 24 councillors and 48 freemen in a closed body until 1835.

In 1261, the medieval University of Northampton was established by royal charter from King Henry III. Had it survived, it would be the third oldest university founded in England after Oxford and Cambridge. However, after members of the university sided with supporters of Simon de Montfort (who was rebelling against the King) and advisors to The Crown said that Northampton was a threat to Oxford&#x27;s scholastic hegemony, Henry III dissolved the university in 1265.

Markets and fairs were a key element in the town&#x27;s economy in medieval times. The Market Square came to prominence in 1235 when Henry III ordered that the selling of goods in the churchyard of All Saints should be relocated to the Market Square. Street names in the town give an indication of trades and market centres; Corn Hill, Malt Hill, Mercer Row, Gold Street, Sheep Street and Horse Market. Cloth and wool were very important but these industries declined. In the 13th century, Northampton had a large Jewish population centred on Gold Street. In 1277 – two years after Edward I passed the Statute of the Jewry – some Jewish residents were executed while the remainder were driven out of town. Archaeological sites include a medieval Jewish cemetery and the Northampton Medieval Synagogue.

The First Barons&#x27; War caused significant destruction to Northampton. The barons besieged Northampton Castle in protest at King John&#x27;s oppression of his subjects. In retaliation, royalist forces destroyed a large part of the town. When the forces of King Henry III overran the supporters of Simon de Montfort, the Second Barons&#x27; War broke out. The First Battle of Northampton took place in 1264 at the site of Northampton Castle where King Henry III and his son Prince Edward attacked with a large army, pillaged the town and took prisoners.

In 1349, the Black Death pandemic killed more than half the population of Northampton. In 1377, the population was 2,200. The town was rapidly losing its wealth and its importance as a national centre. In 1460, the Second Battle of Northampton took place during the War of the Roses in the meadows between the River Nene and Delapré Abbey. The Yorkists defeated the Lancastrians and King Henry VI was taken prisoner. In 1484, the Mayor declared that Northampton was &quot;in great desolation and ruin&quot;. The Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 led to further destruction of what remained of the medieval town. Northampton was severely affected by Plague between March and September 1638 when 665 people died.

=== Early modern ===

The royal connection to Northampton Castle became less significant, and by the time of the English Civil War, Northampton was decidedly pro-Parliament. Though Spencer Compton, Earl of Northampton, was a royalist (Cavalier) and backed King Charles I, the people of Northampton supported Parliament and Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s republican Roundhead army. The town had a long history of religious dissent from the Lollards and Puritanism gained a strong hold on the town. The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious ship money tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against papists and bishops.

When war broke out in 1642, the town willingly became the main Parliamentarian garrison for the south-east Midlands area with the former royal castle as its headquarters. In 1643, Prince Rupert attacked Northampton with approximately 2,000 men, but was beaten back at the North Gate of the town. Oliver Cromwell visited in 1645 and General Fairfax marched from the town to Naseby, where Charles I&#x27;s Royalist army was decisively defeated. Over 4,000 pairs of leather shoes and 600 pairs of cavalry jack-boots for the Parliamentary armies were manufactured in Northampton during the Civil War, and a further 2,000 for Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army in 1648. Until well into the 19th century, the shoe industry boomed in and around the town with small manufacturing workshops set up in the surrounding areas.

The War ended with a Parliamentary victory, resulting in England becoming a Commonwealth, which lasted a decade. Following the restoration of King Charles II in 1660, he took revenge on the town by ordering the destruction of its walls and partial demolition of its castle in 1662, since it did not support his father Charles I and his cavaliers. From then on, the castle was used as a court and a jail, but its physical condition worsened. The new council of the town had to pay £200 to have its charter renewed and also required all officials to swear the oath of allegiance and some confirmed by the Crown.
The town centre was further destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675, caused by sparks from an open fire in a thatched cottage by the castle. The fire spread eastwards by strong westerly winds and consumed three-quarters of the town centre in 24 hours. Matters were worsened because most buildings were chiefly made of wood and covered with thatch. An estimated 600 buildings were destroyed, amounting to £150,000 lost. Very little survived the fire, apart from buildings made of stone, like the Welsh House on Market Square, built in 1595, and Hazelrigg House in Mare Fair, built in 1662.

The devastation led to an Act of Parliament for the rebuilding the town. Local people and businesses helped to raise around £25,000 towards the rebuilding of the town centre based around the Market Square. Streets were widened and buildings made of brick and stone and tiled to prevent such devastation again. In an act of reconciliation, King Charles II donated timber from the royal forests of Salcey and Whittlebury to help with the rebuild. In 1678, the Sessions House and what is now County Hall were amongst the first buildings to be completed. A Georgian town with new houses, shops and workshops eventually grew out of the old medieval town destroyed by the fire. In 1742 Edward Cave opened Marvel&#x27;s Mill, the world&#x27;s first cotton mill to be driven by a water wheel, on the River Nene.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Gibraltar Barracks in 1797.

By the end of the 18th century, Northampton had become a major centre of footwear and leather manufacture. In 1801, the population was 7,020; it more than doubled to 15,351 in 1831, attributed to the fact that there was great demand for footwear caused by the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A third of the adult males alone were shoemakers at the time. Northampton grew beyond the old town walls and industry grew rapidly with the mechanisation of factories by the middle of the 19th century.
The Nene Navigation Company had previously made the River Nene navigable from King&#x27;s Lynn as far up as Northampton in 1762, allowing cheap transportation of coal and other goods to the town, but in 1815, the Grand Union Canal reached the town, joining the River Nene, giving the town a direct link to the Midlands coalfields and to Birmingham, Manchester and London.

The first railway to be built into Northampton was the Northampton and Peterborough Railway, a branch from the main London and Birmingham Railway from Blisworth to Peterborough through Northampton which opened in 1845 along with the town&#x27;s first railway station, Bridge Street station. This was followed by the opening of Castle station in 1859 on the site of part of the historic Northampton Castle, and later St. John&#x27;s Street station in 1872. The Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line was built in the late 1870s. Castle station was rebuilt and expanded over the site of Northampton Castle, the remains of which were purchased and demolished in 1880 to make way for the goods shed. Bridge Street Station closed in 1964 and St John&#x27;s Street closed in 1939, leaving only Castle station serving the town. It is now known simply as Northampton railway station.

Tram lines were also laid down in the town in 1881 and electrified in 1903. An early omnibus service ran to Wellingborough, and since 1919 motor omnibus services ran to villages around the town which brought buyers and sellers to the market.

There were iron ore quarries in the countryside around the town during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which have left their mark on the landscape. Some of the quarries were in what is now the town area in an arc from Kingsthorpe through Duston and Hunsbury round to Hardingstone beginning in about 1860. Some have now been built over and not all lasted very long. The town area quarries that lasted the longest and closed last were at Hunsbury which began working in 1877 and closed in 1920. There are remains of some of these quarries at Hunsbury Hill. There was an iron works by the river to the west of the town next to the railway that then operated between Northampton and Blisworth. This was called the Hunsbury Ironworks and operated between about 1874 and January 1921 using ore from these quarries and elsewhere.

=== Contemporary ===
Following World War I, the shoe industry was increasingly in decline, despite the town&#x27;s factories supplying over 23 million pairs of boots to the armed forces. A total of 1,700 men from the town were lost of the 6,000 killed from the Northamptonshire Regiment. The town expanded further during the 1920s and saw the erection of Northampton Power Station, which supplied electricity to areas as far away as Wolverton, until its closure in 1975. Much council housing was also built largely to the east, north and south of the town, including Abington, Far Cotton, Kingsley, Kingsthorpe and Dallington – areas which had been incorporated within the borough&#x27;s boundaries in 1901. However, the population growth slowed down as people moved beyond its boundaries. In 1901, the population had expanded to 90,923; in 1931, the population was 92,341.
After World War II, Northampton vastly changed. In 1959, the M1 motorway was opened to the south-west of the town; in 1968, Northampton was designated a New Town. Both these events and the rail link helped Northampton&#x27;s growth as a commuter town for London. The Northampton Development Corporation (NDC) was set up in 1968 to substantially redevelop the town in partnership with the local council, spending £205 million to build new housing and industrial estates, initially in Lumbertubs, Moulton Park and Round Spinney to the east, followed by Briar Hill, Camp Hill and East and West Hunsbury in the south of the town, mainly to accommodate the overflow population of new residents from the London area. In the town centre, older buildings were demolished and replaced or redeveloped for other buildings, including the former Greyfriars bus station, the Grosvenor Centre, Peacock Place (now Market Walk), shops, flats and hotels.

Although growth was slower than planned, the population grew from 105,421 in 1961 to 157,217 by 1981, with 15,655 new homes added to the town between 1970 and 1985. The borough boundaries also changed following a split of the Northampton parliamentary constituency into Northampton North and Northampton South in 1974. Northampton was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district which also covered areas outside the former borough boundaries but inside the designated New Town. The town tried for unitary status during the 1990s UK local government reform, but failed and it remained a non-metropolitan district until its abolition in 2021. On Good Friday 1998, Northampton suffered severe flooding, particularly in the areas of Far Cotton and St James; two people were killed and thousands of homes were affected.

Since the turn of the Millennium, the town has continued to expand. Northampton applied for city status in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium, in 2002 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II and most recently in 2022 to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, but failed on all three occasions and remains a town. In 2006, Northampton became a government expansion zone with new growth promoted by West Northamptonshire Development Corporation (WNDC), an unelected quango, which has provoked a series of regeneration schemes across the town. Some have been completed, including the opening of the Radlands Plaza Skatepark and the development of Becket&#x27;s Park Marina just south of Northampton&#x27;s town centre, as well as the improvement of the town&#x27;s Market Square, the building of the new North Gate bus station, the rebuilding of the railway station, the designation of a Cultural Quarter, the building of a new Council headquarters, the restoration of Delapré Abbey, the expansion of Northampton Museum, the resiting and rebuilding of the university on one new campus in town centre and the renovation of both the Grosvenor Shopping Centre and Weston Favell Centre. In 2015, St Giles Street in the town centre was named the &quot;Best British High Street&quot; in a national competition run by the Department for Communities and Local Government. and in 2024 the market square was excavated and redesigned.

== Administration ==

=== Politics ===
Northampton was inaugurated as a constituency in 1295; for many centuries it returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. Spencer Perceval was elected as one of these in 1796 and became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1809, the only Solicitor General and only Attorney General to have done so, but also the only Prime Minister to be assassinated. The murder was by a highly disgruntled business owner John Bellingham in the House of Commons lobby in 1812. By the late 19th century, Northampton had acquired a reputation for political vanguardism. In 1880, radical non-conformist Charles Bradlaugh was elected as one of the MPs. During one of his election cross-candidate hustings a riot broke out in the Market Square. Local figures of authority called military to disperse it. For some decades following the 1918 general election, representation was reduced to one MP.

In 1974, the original Northampton seat was replaced by the new constituencies of Northampton North and Northampton South, which both elected one MP each, beginning in the February 1974 general election. For the 2010 general election, the new South Northamptonshire constituency took a southern sector of the borough. The southern sectors transferred to Northampton South for the 2024 general election.

Northampton is currently represented by two Labour MPs:

*Lucy Rigby (Northampton North)
*Mike Reader (Northampton South)

=== Local government ===

The town existed as an ancient borough in the medieval period before being one of the 178 boroughs to be reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act in 1835, with a democratically elected council replacing the corporation before it. Town government alternated between the Liberals and Conservatives, and the town achieved independence from Northamptonshire in 1888 when it became a county borough. It had six electoral wards from 1898, nine wards from 1900 and 12 wards from 1911. From 1931, until it was abolished in 1974, the district contained only the parish of Northampton.

On 1 April 1974, the district and parish were abolished and became part of Northampton district in the non-metropolitan county of Northamptonshire.

The new Northampton district was formed from:
* The County Borough of Northampton
* In Northampton Rural District the parishes of Billing and Hardingstone and the parts of the parishes of Brafield-on-the-Green, Collingtree, Courteenhall, Great Houghton, Kislingbury, Little Houghton, Milton Malsor, Rothersthorpe, Upton and Wootton in the designated area of Northampton New Town
* In Brixworth Rural District the part of the parish of Overstone in the designated new town 
* In Wellingborough Rural District the part of the parish of Ecton in the designated new town

No successor parish was formed so the former county borough became unparished.

The new district was granted modern borough status in 1974. From 1974 until 2021, the town had a two-tier structure of local government: the non-metropolitan district of Northampton was administered by both Northampton Borough Council and Northamptonshire County Council.

Propositions for the borough to become a unitary authority failed during the 1990s local government reform and again, in 2011, when the motion was voted down by the council. However, in 2016, the borough council and all seven Northamptonshire MPs called for the existing eight Northamptonshire councils be scrapped for new unitary authorities.

In March 2018, following suspension of the County Council arising from its becoming insolvent, due to financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but these were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and took place in May 2021.

A year prior to these changes, three new civil parishes were created in Northampton&#x27;s urban area: a large parish covering the majority of the Northampton urban area was created, allowing Northampton to have a Town (parish) Council. Northampton Town Council is the largest parish level authority in England. In addition, two smaller parishes were created for the suburbs of Far Cotton &amp; Delapre and Kingsthorpe.

Policing in the town remains the responsibility of Northamptonshire Police; and firefighting, the responsibility of Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service. The Royal Anglian Regiment serves as the county regiment for Northamptonshire, with former county regiments being the Northamptonshire Regiment and the Northamptonshire Yeomanry

====Civil parishes====

The Northampton urban area is covered by 13 civil parishes. The parish councils of these form a local tier of government below West Northamptonshire Council. The largest by far of these is the area covered by Northampton Town Council, which was created in 2020, ten more, covering several outer suburbs were pre-existing, and two (Kingsthorpe and Far Cotton and Delapre) were created concurrently with the town council, these are:
=== Health services ===
NHS Northampton guides primary care services (general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) in the town, directly provides adult social care and services in the community such as health visiting and physiotherapy and also funds hospital care and other specialist treatments. Northampton General Hospital is an NHS trust hospital which founded in 1744 and moved to its present site in 1793, and has continued to provide healthcare to the local community for more than 200 years. The East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust is responsible for the provision of statutory emergency medical services in Northampton.

St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, the flagship mental health facility of the private company St Andrew&#x27;s Healthcare, is also based in Northampton. Originally opened in 1838 to serve Northampton, St Andrew&#x27;s became a charity and private healthcare provider when the Berrywood Asylum (later the Northampton County Lunatic Asylum, then St Crispin Hospital in 1948, and since 2010 Berrywood Hospital) opened in 1876.

== Geography ==
Northampton is formally in the East Midlands region but is also referred to in Government planning as being part of the South Midlands &quot;growth area&quot;. The town is south-southeast of Leicester, north-northwest of Milton Keynes, west of Cambridge, northeast of Oxford and southwest of Peterborough.

=== Areas and suburbs ===

Northampton is subdivided into suburbs, council wards, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas.

Suburbs and districts of Northampton include:

Concurrent with the abolition of the borough of Northampton in 2021, the unparished area of Northampton became parished with three new parish councils being established: A new Town Council covering the majority of the urban area of Northampton was established, whilst the areas of Kingsthorpe, and Far Cotton and Delapré also gained parish councils. In addition, there are nine registered parish councils which predate the abolition of the borough of Northampton. These are Billing, Collingtree, Duston, Great Houghton, Hardingstone, Hunsbury Meadow, Upton, West Hunsbury and Wootton &amp; East Hunsbury.

Other settlements that the Office for National Statistics considers part of the Northampton urban area include Boughton, Ecton, Moulton, Overstone and Rothersthorpe. At the 2011 census, Harpole, Cogenhoe, Grange Park, Little and Great Houghton, Overstone and Sywell were just outside the Northampton built up area; this may change when the 2021 boundaries are released.

=== Compass ===
Northampton&#x27;s nearest towns are Wellingborough, Daventry and Towcester. The nearest cities are Milton Keynes, Leicester, Coventry and Peterborough.

=== Climate ===

As with the rest of the British Isles, Northampton experiences an oceanic climate with cool summers and mild winters. The official Met Office weather station for Northampton is the Moulton Park Weather Station at the University of Northampton. Situated at an elevation of around above sea level compared to Northampton town centre at , it is one of the highest points in the town, and so may not be a perfect representation of Northampton as a whole. Its hilltop location means less pooling of cold air on calm clear nights, and lower maxima during summer. The absolute maximum recorded is on 3 August 1990. A high of was recorded on 19 July 2006, However, a maximum temperature of was recorded on 19 July 2022 at Pitsford, located from the town centre. The absolute minimum is , recorded during February 1986. It is likely the absolute maximum in the town centre is a degree or so higher owing to the lower elevation, and absolute minimum on the eastern and western edges of the urban area around the Nene valley a couple of degrees colder due to katabatic drainage of cold air allowing a frost hollow effect. Most recently, the temperature fell to on 20 December 2010.

Rainfall, at around per year is not high, though is often unpredictable, giving rise to flooding events such as 1998, but also short term droughts. Desborough Weather Station also supplies the public with a local weather service.


== Demography ==

The town&#x27;s population recorded at each census since 1801 was as follows:

Since 1991, the population of the town has increased 17.41% from 180,617 to 212,069 in 2011, with a mean age in 2011 of 37.1 years, younger than the English average of 39.3 years. The population breaks down into 104,168 males, and 107,901 females, with a population density of 2,630 per km2.

At the 2011 census, there were 91,484 dwellings, 88,731 of which are occupied households. Some 30.5% (27,048) of these were one person households, 61.1% (54,125) contained families, and 8.5% (7,558) fell into the other household type category. Home tenure was reported as 37.5% of 88,731 households mortgaged, 25.1% owned outright, 16.5% privately rented, 12.8% rented from council, 4.3% social rented, 1.3% private (other) rented, 1.3% shared ownership and 1.2% rent free.

75.6% of households had at least one car or van, 22.5% of residents over the age of 16 had no formal qualifications, and 15.8% have at least 5 GCSEs of grade C or above.
The median income for all workers (in 2012) was £21,193, slightly below both the county average of £21,560, and the England average of £21,794.

Between 2001 and 2011, the greatest nominal population increase was in the White, Other group from 3,780 to 13,825 – an increase of 10,045 – likely due to migration from Eastern Europe. The largest growth relative to their 2001 numbers was in the Black, African group, recording a 376% increase from 1,361 to 6,473. The largest nominal fall in population was in respondents reporting as White, British, there being 8,146 fewer such residents in 2011 than 10 years previous. The largest fall relative to their 2001 numbers was in the White, Irish group, their count falling 20.3% from 3,838 down to 3,060.

=== Ethnicity ===
In the 2011 census, Northampton was 84.5% White, 6.5% Asian, 5.1% Black, and 3.2% Mixed/multiple.
=== Religion ===
In terms of religion, 48.7% of residents described themselves as Christian, 35.7% as irreligious, 5.6% as Muslim, 1.9% as Hindu, 0.6% as other religions, 0.5% as Sikh, 0.4% as Buddhist and 0.1% as Jewish. 6.5% failed to report any affiliation.
== Economy ==

Northampton was a major centre of shoemaking and other leather industries, although only specialist shoemaking companies such as Barker Shoes, Church&#x27;s, Crockett &amp; Jones, Edward Green, Tricker&#x27;s, (formerly located in nearby Earls Barton), and Wildsmith, survive. A large number of old shoe factories remain, mostly now converted to offices or accommodation, some of which are surrounded by terraced houses built for factory workers.

Engineering became a major employer in Northampton during the post-war years following the establishment of the British Timken tapered roller bearing factory at Duston in 1941 as a &quot;shadow factory&quot; for the main site in Birmingham during the Second World War. The factory which closed in 2002 employed over 4,000 employees at its peak and was a major engineering apprentice training employer.

Northampton&#x27;s main private-sector employers are now in distribution and finance rather than manufacturing, and include Avon Products, Barclaycard, Blacks Leisure Group, Nationwide Building Society (Anglia Building Society was formed by amalgamation of Northampton Town and County Building Society with Leicestershire Building Society in 1966 and subsequently merged with the Nationwide in 1987), Panasonic, Travis Perkins, Coca-Cola, Schweppes, Simply Business, National Grid, Texas Instruments and Carlsberg. In 1974, Princess Benedikte of Denmark opened Northampton&#x27;s Carlsberg brewery, the first outside Denmark. The University of Northampton is also a major employer, as is St Andrew&#x27;s Healthcare, a national mental health charity. St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, its flagship hospital and the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest psychiatric hospital, is based in Northampton. In 2014, Experian named Northampton as &quot;the best place in the UK to start and run a business.&quot; In 2017, the town&#x27;s annual economic output, as measured by gross value added, was worth £7.31 billion.

Northampton was expected to be affected by the insolvency of Northamptonshire County Council in 2018, as the council implemented significant budget cuts for two years. That was expected to include maintenance of only the &quot;bare legal minimum of service, focused only on the most vulnerable residents&quot;.

Health inequality in Northampton is high, with the life expectancy gap between the least deprived and most deprived men reaching over a decade. Additionally, the constituency is &#x27;considerably worse than [the] England average&#x27; in violent crime, self harm, under 18 conception and GCSE achievement.

Northampton&#x27;s market square is one of Britain&#x27;s largest and dates back to 1235. The market square is linked to Abington Street, a major shopping area of Northampton. The western part of the street was pedestrianised in 1984. Further east, part was pedestrianised in 1995 and de-pedestrianised in 2014. The east end (beyond York Road) has never been pedestrianised. There are also two indoor shopping centres in the town centre: the Grosvenor Centre, which was built in the 1970s, and Market Walk (previously Peacock Place), which was constructed in 1988. St James Retail Park is also a large shopping precinct just south of the town centre. Other out-of-town retail parks exist: Weston Favell Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s, and Riverside Retail Park in the east of the town, as well as Sixfields in the west. Each precinct has a range of high street shops, department stores and many smaller individual speciality shops.

Billing Aquadrome leisure park is on the eastern outskirts. It has a caravan site, marina, funfair, bar, riverside restaurant and converted water mill with original workings. The Northampton Leisure Trust (branded Trilogy Leisure) has four leisure centres across Northampton: Danes Camp, Lings Forum, Mounts Baths and Duston Sports Centre. King’s Park Sports, operated by Action Centres UK, has sports facilities that include tennis courts, badminton courts, a climbing wall, trampolining, archery and more. There is also a public golf course at Delapré. Radlands Plaza is a new skatepark that opened in 2012.

According to the website of the (former) Northampton Borough Council, there are a total of 170 parks and open spaces around Northampton, which altogether span around . Popular parks include Abington Park, which is the town&#x27;s oldest, and the Racecourse, which was used for horseracing (until 1904) and as a cricket ground (between 1844 and 1885) in addition to being the original home of Northampton Balloon Festival. Other parks include Becket&#x27;s Park (which is named after Thomas Becket as are nearby Becket&#x27;s Well and Thomas á Becket pub), Bradlaugh Fields (named after the Northampton MP Charles Bradlaugh), Dallington Park, Delapré Park, Eastfield Park, Hunsbury Hill (which is built around an Iron Age hillfort), Kingsthorpe Park and Victoria Park.

Popular annual events include Northampton Carnival, the Beer Festival, the Dragonboat Race, the Umbrella Fair, Diwali celebrations and St Crispins Fair. Northampton Balloon Festival used to be a major event in Northampton, but since being scaled down, it has been poorly attended. Northampton Music Festival has been celebrated every year since 2007 in the town centre.

=== Entertainment ===

The Royal &amp; Derngate theatre complex, on Guildhall Road in the Cultural Quarter of the town centre, is one of the main venues for arts and entertainment in Northampton. The Deco, situated in Abington Square in the town centre, is a 900-seat theatre and conference centre, which shares its Art Deco building with the Northampton Jesus Centre. It was restored by the Jesus Army as part of their Jesus Centre project. The Deco used to be a cinema in the 1960s; The Beatles appeared there twice on stage in 1963: firstly as unknowns as part of the Tommy Roe/Chris Montez tour; secondly as part of their own tour in their own right. Smaller theatres include the Northampton Playhouse and the Cripps Theatre, which is part of Northampton School for Boys.

The two commercial cinemas in Northampton are Vue at Sol Central in the centre and Cineworld at Sixfields. There is also the subsidised Forum Cinema at Lings Forum, whose film programme is widely varied and includes art-house and non-mainstream films. The Northampton Filmhouse, an independent cinema joined to the side of the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre complex, opened in June 2013.

There are also many local entertainment venues which provide events. The Roadmender, which used to be run and funded by the council and later bought by The Purplehaus group, hosts mainstream touring bands and one off-gigs. There are other popular late-night entertainment venues, pubs, bars and clubs in the town centre, and along the Wellingborough and Kettering Roads on the way into the town centre. Northampton also has ten-pin bowling alleys and late night casinos.

=== Libraries, museums and galleries ===

The Northamptonshire Central Library in town centre is a Grade II listed building which was erected in 1910. There are seven other public libraries that are dotted across Northampton—in Abington, Duston, Far Cotton, Hunsbury, Kingsthorpe, St James, Wootton—all run by Northamptonshire County Council.
Northampton Museum and Art Gallery on Guildhall Road in the Cultural Quarter has a collection of historical footwear (one of the world&#x27;s largest at 13,000), Italian art, glass and ceramics, plus visiting exhibitions and local history. There is also a smaller Grade I listed historical museum in the former Abington Park house which mainly has history on domestic life in the town and the Northamptonshire Regiment. 78 Derngate, the only house in England designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, includes a museum celebrating Mackintosh, an art gallery and a restaurant.

The Northampton Arts Collective is homed on a four-storey building entitled NN in the Cultural Quarter, opposite the Northampton Museum and next to the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre complex. They relocated from the Old Fishmarket which was demolished to make way for the North Gate bus station. The Avenue Gallery, is at the Avenue campus of the University of Northampton. The university also spent £3m on its Portfolio Innovation Centre in early 2011, which houses around 60 creative freelancers, digital media developers, and designers.

The town is home to Premiership rugby union champions Northampton Saints, who play at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens in the St James End area to the west of town. The Saints have won 3 major titles so far: the Heineken Cup in 2000, and the English Premiership twice in 2014 and 2024 respectively, and have the highest average attendance of any professional sports team in the town.

Rugby Union also maintains itself as a very popular amateur sport in the town, with it being played by nearly every secondary school in the area, as well as by around 10 amateur clubs within Northampton itself, most of which field multiple teams on weekends. Northampton is also home to Northampton Outlaws, its first inclusive rugby team and the 9th gay-friendly team in the United Kingdom. Due to its introduction to the town as a sport for all, it has maintained a considerably more working class character than elsewhere in the UK.

====Association Football====
 football club Northampton Town, known as &quot;The Cobblers&quot; from the town&#x27;s shoemaking background, are based at Sixfields Stadium. Established in 1897, in their centenary season of 1997 they reached Wembley through the play-offs and beat Swansea City 1–0 with an injury time winning free kick from John Frain. It was the first club to set up a trust for supporters to work with the club as many have done. Sixfields was also briefly the home of Coventry City for just over one season between August 2013 and August 2014.

There are also three non-league clubs in the United Counties Football League: Northampton Spencer; Northampton Sileby Rangers; and Northampton Old Northamptonian Chenecks.

====Cricket====

Northamptonshire County Cricket Club, known in limited overs cricket as &quot;The Steelbacks&quot; (a reference to the Northamptonshire Regiment which was formed in 1881), is one of the 18 major county clubs which make up the English and Welsh domestic cricket structure. The club was promoted from Division 2 of the County Championship in 2019, and play in Group C of the Clydesdale Bank 40 League and the Midlands/Wales/West group of the revamped Friends Provident T20. They are based at the County Ground, in the Abington area.

=== Media ===
The &quot;Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo&quot; (established 1931) is the town&#x27;s newspaper, published on Thursdays (before 2012, it was published Monday to Saturday) with jobs, property, motors and entertainment supplements. There are other free newspapers circulated within the town. These include &quot;The Mercury&quot; (on Thursdays) and &quot;Northants on Sunday&quot;, both from the publishers of the &quot;Chronicle &amp; Echo&quot;, and the &quot;Northampton Herald &amp; Post&quot; (on Thursdays). These free papers mostly consist of advertising and have limited news. &quot;The Mercury&quot; was one of the oldest newspapers still in circulation first published in 1720, founded by William Dicey, an ancestor of the public law commentator, A.V. Dicey. It was the fifth-oldest such newspaper in the United Kingdom and the tenth-oldest such in the world.

Heart FM and BBC Radio Northampton are the major stations that serve the town. There are four community radio stations: Inspiration FM, NLive Radio (Formerly NNBC), Revolution Radio and Embrace Radio. Revolution Radio was awarded a 5 year licence on 16 July 2020. Inspiration FM was officially launched in July 2010. The station broadcasts on 107.8 FM NNBC was originally launched in September 2016 as a joint venture with the University of Northampton. As of 30 September 2017, the station was re-branded as NLive Radio. The station marked the re-branding with a live broadcast from Market Square on 30 September. Later that same evening, the station ran a live evening of music from a music venue in Northampton. The evening of music was headlined by Hana Brooks and broadcast live on the station under the banner &#x27;Shoetown Sounds&#x27;. The station broadcasts on 106.9 FM. Embrace Radio, was launched on 5 March 2022. It serves the town on 104.7 FM.

Regional TV news is provided by &quot;BBC Look East&quot; and &quot;ITV News Anglia&quot;. Northampton has also been used as a location for television, film and theatre. Northampton Castle is featured in William Shakespeare&#x27;s history play &quot;King John&quot; and in &quot;Becket&quot;, a play by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The town was the location for the BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; from 1990 until 1995. Parts of the 2005 film &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; were also made in Northampton and featured shots of the statue outside the Grosvenor Centre in the town centre and inside RE Tricker&#x27;s shoe factory in St. Michaels Road representing the original factory in Earls Barton. The film was turned into a musical &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;, maintaining its Northampton backdrop, which premiered on Broadway in 2013 and won 6 Tony Awards. It transferred to the West End in London in 2015 and won 3 Olivier Awards. In addition, BBC Three shows &quot;Bizarre ER&quot; and &quot;Junior Paramedics&quot; were filmed in Northampton. &quot;Changing Ends&quot; (2023), a semi-autobiographical sitcom based on Alan Carr&#x27;s childhood, was set in 1980s Northampton.

== Notable buildings ==

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, is one of the largest and best-preserved round churches in England. It was built in 1100 on the orders of the first Earl of Northampton, Simon de Senlis and based on a plan of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

Simon de Senlis also built Northampton Castle c. 1084, which was for many years one of the country&#x27;s most important castles. It was a royal residence, held The Parliament of England many times, and was the site of royal tournaments and feasts. Thomas Becket was imprisoned there until he escaped. The castle suffered many fates and was eventually demolished to make way for the railway station in 1879. A postern, dismantled from its original position and rebuilt into a wall by the station, and a part of the keep mound are all that remains.

The current All Saints&#x27; Church was built on the site of a great Norman church, All Hallows, which was almost completely destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675. All that remained was the medieval tower and the fine vaulted crypt, but by 1680 All Saints&#x27; had been rebuilt, with the help of donations from all over England, including 1,000 tons of timber from King Charles II, whose statue can be seen above the portico. Famously, the poet John Clare liked to sit beneath the portico of the church. It is home to a choral foundation.
Other notable church buildings include Northampton Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton and seat of the Bishop of Northampton; St Peter&#x27;s (mostly built in Norman times); St Giles&#x27; Church; St Matthew&#x27;s in Phippsville, which was built between 1891 and 1894, has a Henry Moore sculpture of the Madonna. St Edmund&#x27;s Church (built in 1850) closed in 1978 and was demolished in 1980 (its bells are now in Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Wellington).

Just south of the town centre Delapré Abbey, a former Cluniac nunnery, the County Records Office and site of the second Battle of Northampton, which was founded by Simon II de Senlis, the son of first Earl of Northampton, in 1145. At the edge of the Abbey, one of the three standing Eleanor crosses still remains, in memory of Eleanor of Castile, whose body rested here on its way to London. The original top of the monument has been knocked off and replaced several times from as early as 1460.

St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, which opened 1838, and its new building William Wake House, is one of the largest neo-classical structures in England. Northampton &amp; County Club, which was established in 1873, was also the old county hospital before becoming a private members&#x27; club; the cellars are medieval. Northampton Guildhall, which is Grade II* listed, was constructed mostly in the 1860s in Victorian Gothic architecture designed by Edward William Godwin, and extended in 1889–92 and in the 1990s. The Clare Street drill hall was completed in 1859.

78 Derngate is a Grade II* listed Georgian Town House remodelled by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke in 1916–17. It contains notable Mackintosh interiors (which have been restored) and is his only major domestic commission outside Scotland. It is open to the public. One of these Derngate buildings was previously home to Northampton High School, an independent Northampton girls&#x27; school.

The tall National Lift Tower is a dominant feature and visible from most of the town. A Terry Wogan radio phone-in during the 1980s came up with the name &quot;Northampton Lighthouse&quot; as Northampton is one of the furthest places from the sea. It is also known as the &quot;Cobblers&#x27; Needle&quot;. It was built for testing new lifts at the Express Lifts factory, now closed. Though now redundant, it is a listed building.

The former Greyfriars bus station served the town from 1976 until 2014. In the 2000s, it was featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Demolition&quot; programme as the ugliest transport station in the United Kingdom and worthy of demolition. Demolition work began in March 2014, following the move of bus services to North Gate bus station. The Greyfriars was completely destroyed on 15 March 2015 by way of a controlled explosion.

=== Memorials ===

Northampton contains several significant war memorials. The Town and County War Memorial, unveiled in 1926, commemorates casualties of the First World War from all of Northamptonshire; it replaced a temporary cenotaph which stood in Abington Square from 1919. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it consists of two large obelisks and an altar-like stone sited in a small garden behind All Saints&#x27; Church. The Town and County memorial is a grade I listed building and part of a national collection of Lutyens&#x27; war memorials. As the Town and County memorial does not contain a list of names of the fallen, the Royal British Legion launched a campaign which resulted in the construction of a second memorial, dedicated solely to the town; this memorial, in Abington Square, takes the form of a garden of remembrance with the names of the dead inscribed on the garden walls. A bust of Edgar Mobbs was later moved into the garden; Mobbs was a rugby player for Northampton Saints who was killed while serving in the First World War.
A memorial to Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who was born in Northampton, was installed on Abington street in 2005. The sculpture, &quot;Discovery&quot; by artist Lucy Glendinning, was funded by the Wilson Foundation.

== Transport ==

Northampton is served by junctions 15, 15a and 16 of the M1 motorway which connects the town with London at its most southern point and Leeds at its most northern. Both the A45 and A43 link Northampton with the other major towns in Northamptonshire and beyond, and can be accessed by a partially completed ring road. The A14 is close by to the north of Northampton, providing links to East Anglia and a secondary route to the areas of the Midlands which are situated to the north of the town.

Northampton railway station is on the Northampton Loop of the West Coast Main Line, and has services southbound to London Euston and northbound to Birmingham and Crewe provided by West Midlands Trains. Avanti West Coast also provide two daily services to London, although these are set-down only.

Sywell Aerodrome is the nearest airfield which has recently been upgraded with a concrete runway, however it only caters for private flying, flight training and corporate flights. For international links, the East Midlands Airport and Luton Airport are quickly accessible by the M1 around north-west and south-east, respectively; Birmingham Airport is also around to the north-west of the town via the M1 and M6 motorways, as well as by train.

In the town, buses are mainly operated by Stagecoach Midlands from the North Gate bus station with some services from Uno but it was announced in November 2023 that routes operated by Uno will be taken over by Stagecoach from March 2024. Stagecoach serves areas within the town and also provides travel to outlying villages and towns within the county, making links to Corby, Daventry, Kettering, Rushden and Wellingborough. They also go as far afield as Bedford, Leicester, Market Harborough, Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Rugby. Uno serve the university and Kingsthorpe area as well as Rectory Farm, Abington and Sixfields. National Express also operates in Northampton, covering routes between major towns and cities in the United Kingdom. Buses used to be operated by Northampton Corporation Transport and then, since the privatization of buses in the 1980s. FirstGroup operated them until the 2010s and Arriva operate 2 services around the town (33 and 33x)

Northampton is the terminus of an arm of the Grand Union Canal, which connects to the River Nene and from that to the River Great Ouse and the North Sea. No longer used for freight, the waterway is now popular with anglers and narrowboaters. Principal outlying villages on the canal include Gayton, Blisworth, Braunston and Stoke Bruerne.

Northampton once had a horse-drawn tramway which opened in 1881. The system was extended in stages and taken over by the council in 1897 and named Northampton Corporation Tramways. It was electrified in 1904, but closed in 1934 mainly as a result of competition from motor buses which were introduced in 1929. Two of the original tram shelters are preserved: one at the Racecourse park and another in Kingsthorpe opposite the Cock Hotel.

== Education ==
The first University of Northampton was established by royal charter by King Henry III in 1261, and started to rival the universities in Cambridge and Oxford, with their students migrating to the Northampton establishment. This university was dissolved by King Henry III in 1265, in revenge of its students siding with the rebellious barons in the Battle of Northampton (1264). Henry III was also advised by bishops and magnates that it posed a threat to Oxford, and signed a Royal Decree which banned the establishment of a university in Northampton.

This was eventually repealed and the university&#x27;s name was revived in 2005 when the unconnected University College Northampton, which was founded in 1924, was upgraded to full university status and renamed the University of Northampton. This is the only higher education (HE) establishment in the town and offers courses from foundation and undergraduate levels to postgraduate, professional and doctoral qualifications. The university is made of up six schools: Business, Education, Health, Science and Technology, Social Sciences and The Arts. The university was originally spread over two campuses across the town, but moved to its new £330 million waterside campus by the River Nene in the town centre in 2018.

Northampton&#x27;s only further education (FE) college is Northampton College, one of the largest FE colleges in the South Midlands, which has two campuses across the town, offering vocational courses, GCSEs and A Levels. Moulton College is another FE college just north of Northampton which provides many vocational courses, specialising in land-based subjects, sports and construction. In collaboration with the University of Northampton, both colleges also offer some HE programmes.

There are 50 primary schools and 8 secondary schools in the town. Until 2004, Northamptonshire operated a three-tier system in education of lower, middle and upper schools. In 2001, the move to a two-tier system to primary and secondary schools began, aimed at improving educational standards. Some of its successful secondary schools include Northampton School for Boys, which became the top performing comprehensive school in the country in 2007, and Northampton School for Girls, the first school in England to gain Specialist Music College status. An average of 55% of students in Northampton achieved five A*-C grades at GCSE in 2015, above the government&#x27;s benchmark of 40%. There are also 5 special schools in the town. Northampton High School is an independent school for girls.
