<text>Gentiana acaulis, the stemless gentian, or trumpet gentian, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gentianaceae, native to central and southern Europe, from Spain east to the Balkans, growing especially in mountainous regions, such as the Alps and Pyrenees, at heights of .

==Description==
It is a perennial plant, growing up to a height of tall and forming a mat up to wide. The leaves, which can be lanceolate, elliptical or obovate, are evergreen, 2–3.5 cm long, in a basal rosette, forming clumps. The trumpet-shaped terminal flowers are blue with olive-green spotted longitudinal throats. They grow on a very short peduncle, 3–6 cm long. The flower stem is often without leaves, or has 1 or 2 pairs of leaves. It likes full sun, is fully hardy and flowers in late spring and summer.

==Horticulture==
This plant, like others of its genus, is valued in cultivation for the unusually pure intense blue of its blooms. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Etymology==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;acaulis&quot; means &quot;short-stemmed&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The closely related &quot;Gentiana clusii&quot;, often called by the same common name as this species, differs in its preference for limy (alkaline) soils. It also has shorter leaves and the flowers have no olive-green stripes.

===Phylogeny===
Phylogenetic research suggests &quot;G. acaulis&quot; is sister to a clade containing 4 other &quot;Gentiana&quot; species: &quot;G. verna&quot;, &quot;G. bavarica&quot;, &quot;G. nivalis&quot;, and &quot;G. utriculosa&quot;.

==Culture==
A depiction of a gentian flower can be seen on the obverse side of Austrian € 0.01 euro coins.

<text>An airship, dirigible balloon or dirigible is a type of aerostat (lighter-than-air) aircraft that can navigate through the air flying under its own power. Aerostats use buoyancy from a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air to achieve the lift needed to stay airborne.

In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability, but the inherent flammability led to several fatal accidents that rendered hydrogen airships obsolete. The alternative lifting gas, helium gas is not flammable, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only available for airship usage in North America. Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.

The envelope of an airship may form the gasbag, or it may contain a number of gas-filled cells. An airship also has engines, crew, and optionally also payload accommodation, typically housed in one or more gondolas suspended below the envelope.

The main types of airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid and rigid airships. Non-rigid airships, often called &quot;blimps&quot;, rely solely on internal gas pressure to maintain the envelope shape. Semi-rigid airships maintain their shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer structural framework that maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gasbags or cells. Rigid airships were first flown by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin and the vast majority of rigid airships built were manufactured by the firm he founded, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. As a result, rigid airships are often called zeppelins.

Airships were the first aircraft capable of controlled powered flight, and were most commonly used before the 1940s; their use decreased as their capabilities were surpassed by those of aeroplanes. Their decline was accelerated by a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1930 crash and burning of the British R101 in France, the 1933 and 1935 storm-related crashes of the twin airborne aircraft carrier U.S. Navy helium-filled rigids, the and USS &quot;Macon&quot; respectively, and the 1937 burning of the German hydrogen-filled &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. From the 1960s, helium airships have been used where the ability to hover for a long time outweighs the need for speed and manoeuvrability, such as advertising, tourism, camera platforms, geological surveys and aerial observation.

==Terminology==
===Airship===
During the pioneer years of aeronautics, terms such as &quot;airship&quot;, &quot;air-ship&quot;, &quot;air ship&quot; and &quot;ship of the air&quot; meant any kind of navigable or dirigible flying machine. In 1919 Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to &quot;ships of the air&quot;, with smaller passenger types as &quot;air yachts&quot;. In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as &quot;ships of the air&quot; or &quot;flying-ships&quot;. Nowadays the term &quot;airship&quot; is used only for powered, dirigible balloons, with sub-types being classified as rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid. Semi-rigid architecture is the more recent, following advances in deformable structures and the exigency of reducing weight and volume of the airships. They have a minimal structure that keeps the shape jointly with overpressure of the gas envelope.

===Aerostat===
An aerostat is an aircraft that remains aloft using buoyancy or static lift, as opposed to the aerodyne, which obtains lift by moving through the air. Airships are a type of aerostat. The term &quot;aerostat&quot; has also been used to indicate a tethered or moored balloon as opposed to a free-floating balloon. Aerostats today are capable of lifting a payload of to an altitude of more than above sea level. They can also stay in the air for extended periods of time, particularly when powered by an on-board generator or if the tether contains electrical conductors. Due to this capability, aerostats can be used as platforms for telecommunication services. For instance, Platform Wireless International Corporation announced in 2001 that it would use a tethered airborne payload to deliver cellular phone service to a region in Brazil. The European Union&#x27;s ABSOLUTE project was also reportedly exploring the use of tethered aerostat stations to provide telecommunications during disaster response.

===Blimp===

A blimp is a non-rigid aerostat. In British usage it refers to any non-rigid aerostat, including barrage balloons and other kite balloons, having a streamlined shape and stabilising tail fins. Some blimps may be powered dirigibles, as in early versions of the Goodyear Blimp. Later Goodyear dirigibles, though technically &quot;semi-rigid airships,&quot; have still been called &quot;blimps&quot; by the company.

===Zeppelin===
The term zeppelin originally referred to airships manufactured by the German Zeppelin Company, which built and operated the first rigid airships in the early years of the twentieth century. The initials LZ, for (German for &quot;Zeppelin airship&quot;), usually prefixed their craft&#x27;s serial identifiers.

Streamlined rigid (or semi-rigid) airships are often referred to as &quot;Zeppelins&quot;, because of the fame that this company acquired due to the number of airships it produced, although its early rival was the Parseval semi-rigid design.

===Hybrid airship===

Hybrid airships fly with a positive aerostatic contribution, usually equal to the empty weight of the system, and the variable payload is sustained by propulsion or aerodynamic contribution.

==Classification==
Airships are classified according to their method of construction into rigid, semi-rigid and non-rigid types.

===Rigid===

A rigid airship has a rigid framework covered by an outer skin or envelope. The interior contains one or more gasbags, cells or balloons to provide lift. Rigid airships are typically unpressurised and can be made to virtually any size. Most, but not all, of the German Zeppelin airships have been of this type.

===Semi-rigid===

A semi-rigid airship has some kind of supporting structure but the main envelope is held in shape by the internal pressure of the lifting gas. Typically the airship has an extended, usually articulated keel running along the bottom of the envelope to stop it kinking in the middle by distributing suspension loads into the envelope, while also allowing lower envelope pressures.

===Non-rigid===

Non-rigid airships are often called &quot;blimps&quot;. Most, but not all, of the American Goodyear airships have been blimps.

A non-rigid airship relies entirely on internal gas pressure to retain its shape during flight. Unlike the rigid design, the non-rigid airship&#x27;s gas envelope has no compartments. However, it still typically has smaller internal bags containing air (ballonets). As altitude is increased, the lifting gas expands and air from the ballonets is expelled through valves to maintain the hull&#x27;s shape. To return to sea level, the process is reversed: air is forced back into the ballonets by scooping air from the engine exhaust and using auxiliary blowers.

==Construction==
===Envelope===
The envelope is the structure which contains the buoyant gas. Envelopes in the early 19th century were made from goldbeater&#x27;s skin, selected for its low weight, relatively high strength, and impermeability compared to paper or linen. By the 1920s, natural rubber treated with cotton became the predominant elastomer used in envelope construction. The natural rubber was succeeded by neoprene in the 1930s and Nylon and PET in the 1950s. A few airships have been metal-clad. The most successful of which is the Detroit ZMC-2, which logged 2265 hours of flight time from 1929 to 1941 before being scrapped, as it was considered too small for operational use on anti-submarine patrols.

The problem of the exact determination of the pressure on an airship envelope is still problematic and has fascinated major scientists such as Theodor Von Karman.

The envelope may contain ballonets (see below), allowing adjustment of the density of the buoyant gas by adding or subtracting envelope volume.

===Ballonet===

A ballonet is an air bag inside the outer envelope of an airship which, when inflated, reduces the volume available for the lifting gas, making it more dense. Because air is also denser than the lifting gas, inflating the ballonet reduces the overall lift, while deflating it increases lift. In this way, the ballonet can be used to adjust the lift as required by controlling the buoyancy. By inflating or deflating ballonets strategically, the pilot can control the airship&#x27;s altitude and attitude.

Ballonets may typically be used in non-rigid or semi-rigid airships, commonly with multiple ballonets located both fore and aft to maintain balance and to control the pitch of the airship.

===Lifting gas===

Lifting gas is generally hydrogen, helium or hot air.

Hydrogen gives the highest lift and is inexpensive and easily obtained, but is highly flammable and can detonate if mixed with air. Helium is completely non flammable, but gives lower performance- and is a rare element and much more expensive.

Thermal airships use a heated lifting gas, usually air, in a fashion similar to hot air balloons. The first to do so was flown in 1973 by the British company Cameron Balloons.

===Gondola===
===Propulsion and control===

Small airships carry their engine(s) in their gondola. Where there were multiple engines on larger airships, these were placed in separate nacelles, termed &quot;power cars&quot; or &quot;engine cars&quot;. To allow asymmetric thrust to be applied for maneuvering, these power cars were mounted towards the sides of the envelope, away from the centre line gondola. This also raised them above the ground, reducing the risk of a propeller strike when landing. Widely spaced power cars were also termed &quot;wing cars&quot;, from the use of &quot;wing&quot; to mean being on the side of something, as in a theater, rather than the aerodynamic device. These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine. Instructions were relayed to them from the pilot&#x27;s station by a telegraph system, as on a ship.

If fuel is burnt for propulsion, then progressive reduction in the airship&#x27;s overall weight occurs. In hydrogen airships, this is usually dealt with by simply venting cheap hydrogen lifting gas. In helium airships water is often condensed from the exhaust and stored as ballast.

===Fins and rudders===
To control the airship&#x27;s direction and stability, it is equipped with fins and rudders. Fins are typically located on the tail section and provide stability and resistance to rolling. Rudders are movable surfaces on the tail that allow the pilot to steer the airship left or right.

===Empennage===

The empennage refers to the tail section of the airship, which includes the fins, rudders, and other aerodynamic surfaces. It plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and controlling the airship&#x27;s attitude.

===Fuel and power systems===
Airships require a source of power to operate their propulsion systems. This includes engines, generators, or batteries, depending on the type of airship and its design. Fuel tanks or batteries are typically located within the envelope or gondola.

===Navigation and communication equipment===
To navigate safely and communicate with ground control or other aircraft, airships are equipped with a range of instruments, including GPS systems, radios, radar, and navigation lights.

===Landing gear===
Some airships have landing gear that allows them to land on runways or other surfaces. This landing gear may include wheels, skids, or landing pads.

==Performance==
===Efficiency===
The main advantage of airships with respect to any other vehicle is that they require less energy to remain in flight, compared to other air vehicles. The proposed Varialift airship, powered by a mixture of solar-powered engines and conventional jet engines, would use only an estimated 8 percent of the fuel required by jet aircraft. Furthermore, utilizing the jet stream could allow for a faster and more energy-efficient cargo transport alternative to maritime shipping. This is one of the reasons why China has embraced their use recently.

==History==

===Early pioneers===


====17th–18th century====
In 1670, the Jesuit Father Francesco Lana de Terzi, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Father of Aeronautics&quot;, published a description of an &quot;Aerial Ship&quot; supported by four copper spheres from which the air was evacuated. Although the basic principle is sound, such a craft was unrealizable then and remains so to the present day, since external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant. A hypothetical craft constructed using this principle is known as a &quot;vacuum airship&quot;.

In 1709, the Brazilian-Portuguese Jesuit priest Bartolomeu de Gusmão made a hot air balloon, the Passarola, ascend to the skies, before an astonished Portuguese court. It would have been on August 8, 1709, when Father Bartolomeu de Gusmão held, in the courtyard of the Casa da Índia, in the city of Lisbon, the first Passarola demonstration. The balloon caught fire without leaving the ground, but, in a second demonstration, it rose to 95 meters in height. It was a small balloon of thick brown paper, filled with hot air, produced by the &quot;fire of material contained in a clay bowl embedded in the base of a waxed wooden tray&quot;. The event was witnessed by King John V of Portugal and the future Pope Innocent XIII.

A more practical dirigible airship was described by Lieutenant Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier in a paper entitled &quot;&quot; (Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines) presented to the French Academy on 3 December 1783. The 16 water-color drawings published the following year depict a streamlined envelope with internal ballonets that could be used for regulating lift: this was attached to a long carriage that could be used as a boat if the vehicle was forced to land in water. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers and steered with a sail-like aft rudder. In 1784, Jean-Pierre Blanchard fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft. In 1785, he crossed the English Channel in a balloon equipped with flapping wings for propulsion and a birdlike tail for steering.

====19th century====
The 19th century saw continued attempts to add methods of propulsion to balloons. Rufus Porter built and flew scale models of his &quot;Aerial Locomotive&quot;, but never a successful full-size implementation. The Australian William Bland sent designs for his &quot;Atmotic airship&quot; to the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851, where a model was displayed. This was an elongated balloon with a steam engine driving twin propellers suspended underneath. The lift of the balloon was estimated as 5 tons and the car with the fuel as weighing 3.5 tons, giving a payload of 1.5 tons. Bland believed that the machine could be driven at and could fly from Sydney to London in less than a week.

In 1852, Henri Giffard became the first person to make an engine-powered flight when he flew in a steam-powered airship. Airships would develop considerably over the next two decades. In 1863, Solomon Andrews flew his aereon design, an unpowered, controllable dirigible in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and offered the device to the U.S. Military during the Civil War. He flew a later design in 1866 around New York City and as far as Oyster Bay, New York. This concept used changes in lift to provide propulsive force, and did not need a powerplant. In 1872, the French naval architect Dupuy de Lome launched a large navigable balloon, which was driven by a large propeller turned by eight men. It was developed during the Franco-Prussian war and was intended as an improvement to the balloons used for communications between Paris and the countryside during the siege of Paris, but was completed only after the end of the war.

In 1872, Paul Haenlein flew an airship with an internal combustion engine running on the coal gas used to inflate the envelope, the first use of such an engine to power an aircraft. Charles F. Ritchel made a public demonstration flight in 1878 of his hand-powered one-man rigid airship, and went on to build and sell five of his aircraft.
In 1874, Micajah Clark Dyer filed U.S. Patent 154,654 &quot;Apparatus for Navigating the Air&quot;. It is believed successful trial flights were made between 1872 and 1874, but detailed dates are not available. The apparatus used a combination of wings and paddle wheels for navigation and propulsion.

More details can be found in the book about his life.

In 1883, the first electric-powered flight was made by Gaston Tissandier, who fitted a Siemens electric motor to an airship.

The first fully controllable free flight was made in 1884 by Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs in the French Army airship &quot;La France&quot;. La France made the first flight of an airship that landed where it took off; the long, airship covered in 23 minutes with the aid of an electric motor, and a battery. It made seven flights in 1884 and 1885.

In 1888, the design of the Campbell Air Ship, designed by Professor Peter C. Campbell, was built by the Novelty Air Ship Company. It was lost at sea in 1889 while being flown by Professor Hogan during an exhibition flight.

From 1888 to 1897, Friedrich Wölfert built three airships powered by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft-built petrol engines, the last of which, &quot;Deutschland&quot;, caught fire in flight and killed both occupants in 1897. The 1888 version used a single cylinder Daimler engine and flew from Canstatt to Kornwestheim.

In 1897, an airship with an aluminum envelope was built by the Hungarian-Croatian engineer David Schwarz. It made its first flight at Tempelhof field in Berlin after Schwarz had died. His widow, Melanie Schwarz, was paid 15,000 marks by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin to release the industrialist Carl Berg from his exclusive contract to supply Schwartz with aluminium.

From 1897 to 1899, Konstantin Danilewsky, medical doctor and inventor from Kharkiv (now Ukraine, then Russian Empire), built four muscle-powered airships, of gas volume . About 200 ascents were made within a framework of experimental flight program, at two locations, with no significant incidents.

===Early 20th century===

In July 1900, the Luftschiff Zeppelin LZ1 made its first flight. This led to the most successful airships of all time: the Zeppelins, named after Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who began working on rigid airship designs in the 1890s, leading to the flawed LZ1 in 1900 and the more successful LZ2 in 1906. The Zeppelin airships had a framework composed of triangular lattice girders covered with fabric that contained separate gas cells. At first multiplane tail surfaces were used for control and stability: later designs had simpler cruciform tail surfaces. The engines and crew were accommodated in &quot;gondolas&quot; hung beneath the hull driving propellers attached to the sides of the frame by means of long drive shafts. Additionally, there was a passenger compartment (later a bomb bay) located halfway between the two engine compartments.

Alberto Santos-Dumont was a wealthy young Brazilian who lived in France and had a passion for flying. He designed 18 balloons and dirigibles before turning his attention to fixed-winged aircraft.
On 19 October 1901 he flew his airship &quot;Number 6&quot;, from the Parc Saint Cloud to and around the Eiffel Tower and back in under thirty minutes. This feat earned him the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize of 100,000 francs. Many inventors were inspired by Santos-Dumont&#x27;s small airships. Many airship pioneers, such as the American Thomas Scott Baldwin, financed their activities through passenger flights and public demonstration flights. Stanley Spencer built the first British airship with funds from advertising baby food on the sides of the envelope. Others, such as Walter Wellman and Melvin Vaniman, set their sights on loftier goals, attempting two polar flights in 1907 and 1909, and two trans-Atlantic flights in 1910 and 1912.
In 1902 the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published details of an innovative airship design in Spain and France titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Improvements in dirigible aerostats&quot;). With a non-rigid body and internal bracing wires, it overcame the flaws of these types of aircraft as regards both rigid structure (zeppelin type) and flexibility, providing the airships with more stability during flight, and the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load. A system called &quot;auto-rigid&quot;. In 1905, helped by Captain A. Kindelán, he built the airship &quot;Torres Quevedo&quot; at the Guadalajara military base. In 1909 he patented an improved design that he offered to the French Astra company, who started mass-producing it in 1911 as the Astra-Torres airship. This type of envelope was employed in the United Kingdom in the Coastal, C Star, and North Sea airships. The distinctive three-lobed design was widely used during the Great War by the Entente powers for diverse tasks, principally convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare. The success during the war even drew the attention of the Imperial Japanese Navy, who acquired a model in 1922. Torres also drew up designs of a &#x27;docking station&#x27; and made alterations to airship designs, to find a resolution to the slew of problems faced by airship engineers to dock dirigibles. In 1910, he proposed the idea of attaching an airships nose to a mooring mast and allowing the airship to weathervane with changes of wind direction. The use of a metal column erected on the ground, the top of which the bow or stem would be directly attached to (by a cable) would allow a dirigible to be moored at any time, in the open, regardless of wind speeds. Additionally, Torres&#x27; design called for the improvement and accessibility of temporary landing sites, where airships were to be moored for the purpose of disembarkation of passengers. The final patent was presented in February 1911 in Belgium, and later to France and the United Kingdom in 1912, under the title &quot;Improvements in Mooring Arrengements for Airships&quot;.

Other airship builders were also active before the war: from 1902 the French company Lebaudy Frères specialized in semirigid airships such as the &quot;Patrie&quot; and the &quot;République&quot;, designed by their engineer Henri Julliot, who later worked for the American company Goodrich; the German firm Schütte-Lanz built the wooden-framed SL series from 1911, introducing important technical innovations; another German firm Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft built the &quot;Parseval-Luftschiff&quot; (PL) series from 1909, and Italian Enrico Forlanini&#x27;s firm had built and flown the first two Forlanini airships.

On May 12, 1902, the inventor and Brazilian aeronaut Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhao and his French mechanic, Georges Saché, died when they were flying over Paris in the airship called Pax. A marble plaque at number 81 of the Avenue du Maine in Paris, commemorates the location of Augusto Severo accident. &quot;The Catastrophe of the Balloon &quot;Le Pax&quot;&quot; is a 1902 short silent film recreation of the catastrophe, directed by Georges Méliès.

In Britain, the Army built their first dirigible, the &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;, in 1907. The Navy ordered the construction of an experimental rigid in 1908. Officially known as His Majesty&#x27;s Airship No. 1 and nicknamed the &quot;Mayfly&quot;, it broke its back in 1911 before making a single flight. Work on a successor did not start until 1913.

German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts AG) was established in 1910.

In 1910 Walter Wellman unsuccessfully attempted an aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the airship &quot;America&quot;.

===World War I===


The prospect of airships as bombers had been recognized in Europe well before the airships were up to the task. H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1908) described the obliteration of entire fleets and cities by airship attack. The Italian forces became the first to use dirigibles for a military purpose during the Italo–Turkish War, the first bombing mission being flown on 10 March 1912. World War I marked the airship&#x27;s real debut as a weapon. The Germans, French, and Italians all used airships for scouting and tactical bombing roles early in the war, and all learned that the airship was too vulnerable for operations over the front. The decision to end operations in direct support of armies was made by all in 1917.

Many in the German military believed they had found the ideal weapon with which to counteract British naval superiority and strike at Britain itself, while more realistic airship advocates believed the zeppelin&#x27;s value was as a long range scout/attack craft for naval operations. Raids on England began in January 1915 and peaked in 1916: following losses to the British defenses only a few raids were made in 1917–18, the last in August 1918. Zeppelins proved to be terrifying but inaccurate weapons. Navigation, target selection and bomb-aiming proved to be difficult under the best of conditions, and the cloud cover that was frequently encountered by the airships reduced accuracy even further. The physical damage done by airships over the course of the war was insignificant, and the deaths that they caused amounted to a few hundred. Nevertheless, the raid caused a significant diversion of British resources to defense efforts. The airships were initially immune to attack by aircraft and anti-aircraft guns: as the pressure in their envelopes was only just higher than ambient air, holes had little effect. But following the introduction of a combination of incendiary and explosive ammunition in 1916, their flammable hydrogen lifting gas made them vulnerable to the defending aeroplanes. Several were shot down in flames by British defenders, and many others destroyed in accidents. New designs capable of reaching greater altitude were developed, but although this made them immune from attack it made their bombing accuracy even worse.

Countermeasures by the British included sound detection equipment, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery, followed by night fighters in 1915. One tactic used early in the war, when their limited range meant the airships had to fly from forward bases and the only zeppelin production facilities were in Friedrichshafen, was the bombing of airship sheds by the British Royal Naval Air Service. Later in the war, the development of the aircraft carrier led to the first successful carrier-based air strike in history: on the morning of 19 July 1918, seven Sopwith 2F.1 Camels were launched from and struck the airship base at Tønder, destroying zeppelins L 54 and L 60.


The British Army had abandoned airship development in favour of aeroplanes before the start of the war, but the Royal Navy had recognized the need for small airships to counteract the submarine and mine threat in coastal waters. Beginning in February 1915, they began to develop the SS (Sea Scout) class of blimp. These had a small envelope of and at first used aircraft fuselages without the wing and tail surfaces as control cars. Later, more advanced blimps with purpose-built gondolas were used. The NS class (North Sea) were the largest and most effective non-rigid airships in British service, with a gas capacity of , a crew of 10 and an endurance of 24 hours. Six bombs were carried, as well as three to five machine guns. British blimps were used for scouting, mine clearance, and convoy patrol duties. During the war, the British operated over 200 non-rigid airships. Several were sold to Russia, France, the United States, and Italy. The large number of trained crews, low attrition rate and constant experimentation in handling techniques meant that at the war&#x27;s end Britain was the world leader in non-rigid airship technology.

The Royal Navy continued development of rigid airships until the end of the war. Eight rigid airships had been completed by the armistice, (No. 9r, four 23 Class, two R23X Class and one R31 Class), although several more were in an advanced state of completion by the war&#x27;s end. Both France and Italy continued to use airships throughout the war. France preferred the non-rigid type, whereas Italy flew 49 semi-rigid airships in both the scouting and bombing roles.

Aeroplanes had almost entirely replaced airships as bombers by the end of the war, and Germany&#x27;s remaining zeppelins were destroyed by their crews, scrapped or handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations. The British rigid airship program, which had mainly been a reaction to the potential threat of the German airships, was wound down.

===The interwar period===

Britain, the United States and Germany built rigid airships between the two world wars. Italy and France made limited use of Zeppelins handed over as war reparations. Italy, the Soviet Union, the United States and Japan mainly operated semi-rigid airships.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed to build airships of greater capacity than a million cubic feet. Two small passenger airships, LZ 120 &quot;Bodensee&quot; and its sister ship LZ 121 &quot;Nordstern&quot;, were built immediately after the war but were confiscated following the sabotage of the wartime Zeppelins that were to have been handed over as war reparations: &quot;Bodensee&quot; was given to Italy and &quot;Nordstern&quot; to France. On May 12, 1926, the Italian built semi-rigid airship &quot;Norge&quot; was the first aircraft to fly over the North Pole.

The British R33 and R34 were near-identical copies of the German L 33, which had come down almost intact in Yorkshire on 24 September 1916. Despite being almost three years out of date by the time they were launched in 1919, they became two of the most successful airships in British service. The creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in early 1918 created a hybrid British airship program. The RAF was not interested in airships while the Admiralty was, so a deal was made where the Admiralty would design any future military airships and the RAF would handle manpower, facilities and operations. On 2 July 1919, R34 began the first double crossing of the Atlantic by an aircraft. It landed at Mineola, Long Island on 6 July after 108 hours in the air; the return crossing began on 8 July and took 75 hours. This feat failed to generate enthusiasm for continued airship development, and the British airship program was rapidly wound down.

During World War I, the U.S. Navy acquired its first airship, the DH-1, but it was destroyed while being inflated shortly after delivery to the Navy. After the war, the U.S. Navy contracted to buy the R 38, which was being built in Britain, but before it was handed over it was destroyed because of a structural failure during a test flight.
America then started constructing the , designed by the Bureau of Aeronautics and based on the Zeppelin L 49. Assembled in Hangar No. 1 and first flown on 4 September 1923 at Lakehurst, New Jersey, it was the first airship to be inflated with the noble gas helium, which was then so scarce that the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; contained most of the world&#x27;s supply. A second airship, , was built by the Zeppelin company as compensation for the airships that should have been handed over as war reparations according to the terms of the Versailles Treaty but had been sabotaged by their crews. This construction order saved the Zeppelin works from the threat of closure. The success of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, which was flown successfully for eight years, encouraged the U.S. Navy to invest in its own, larger airships. When the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was delivered, the two airships had to share the limited supply of helium, and thus alternated operating and overhauls.

In 1922, Sir Dennistoun Burney suggested a plan for a subsidised air service throughout the British Empire using airships (the Burney Scheme). Following the coming to power of Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government in 1924, the scheme was transformed into the Imperial Airship Scheme, under which two airships were built, one by a private company and the other by the Royal Airship Works under Air Ministry control. The two designs were radically different. The &quot;capitalist&quot; ship, the &quot;R100&quot;, was more conventional, while the &quot;socialist&quot; ship, the R101, had many innovative design features. Construction of both took longer than expected, and the airships did not fly until 1929. Neither airship was capable of the service intended, though the R100 did complete a proving flight to Canada and back in 1930. On 5 October 1930, the R101, which had not been thoroughly tested after major modifications, crashed on its maiden voyage to India at Beauvais in France killing 48 of the 54 people aboard. Among the dead were the craft&#x27;s chief designer and the Secretary of State for Air. The disaster ended British interest in airships.

In 1925 the Zeppelin company started construction of the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; (LZ 127), the largest airship that could be built in the company&#x27;s existing shed, and intended to stimulate interest in passenger airships. The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; burned &quot;blau gas&quot;, similar to propane, stored in large gas bags below the hydrogen cells, as fuel. Since its density was similar to that of air, it avoided the weight change as fuel was used, and thus the need to valve hydrogen. The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; had an impressive safety record, flying over (including the first circumnavigation of the globe by airship) without a single passenger injury. 
The U.S. Navy experimented with the use of airships as airborne aircraft carriers, developing an idea pioneered by the British. The USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was used for initial experiments, and the and , the world&#x27;s largest at the time, were used to test the principle in naval operations. Each carried four F9C Sparrowhawk fighters in its hangar, and could carry a fifth on the trapeze. The idea had mixed results. By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS &quot;Macon&quot;, had been wrecked. Meanwhile, the seaplane had become more capable, and was considered a better investment.

Eventually, the U.S. Navy lost all three U.S.-built rigid airships to accidents. USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; flew into a severe thunderstorm over Noble County, Ohio while on a poorly planned publicity flight on 3 September 1925. It broke into pieces, killing 14 of its crew. USS &quot;Akron&quot; was caught in a severe storm and flown into the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey on 3 April 1933. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia. USS &quot;Macon&quot; was lost after suffering a structural failure offshore near Point Sur Lighthouse on 12 February 1935. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight. Only two of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the &quot;Akron&quot; disaster.

The Empire State Building was completed in 1931 with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of future passenger airship service, but no airship ever used the mast. Various entrepreneurs experimented with commuting and shipping freight via airship.

In the 1930s, the German Zeppelins successfully competed with other means of transport. They could carry significantly more passengers than other contemporary aircraft while providing amenities similar to those on ocean liners, such as private cabins, observation decks, and dining rooms. Less importantly, the technology was potentially more energy-efficient than heavier-than-air designs. Zeppelins were also faster than ocean liners. On the other hand, operating airships was quite involved. Often the crew would outnumber passengers, and on the ground large teams were necessary to assist mooring and very large hangars were required at airports.
By the mid-1930s, only Germany still pursued airship development. The Zeppelin company continued to operate the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; on passenger service between Frankfurt and Recife in Brazil, taking 68 hours. Even with the small &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, the operation was almost profitable. In the mid-1930s, work began on an airship designed specifically to operate a passenger service across the Atlantic. The &quot;Hindenburg&quot; (LZ 129) completed a successful 1936 season, carrying passengers between Lakehurst, New Jersey and Germany. The year 1937 started with the most spectacular and widely remembered airship accident. Approaching the Lakehurst mooring mast minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; suddenly burst into flames and crashed to the ground. Of the 97 people aboard, 35 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, along with one American ground-crewman. The disaster happened before a large crowd, was filmed and a radio news reporter was recording the arrival. This was a disaster that theater goers could see and hear in newsreels. The &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster shattered public confidence in airships, and brought a definitive end to their &quot;golden age&quot;. The day after the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; landed safely in Germany after its return flight from Brazil. This was the last international passenger airship flight.

&quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s identical sister ship, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; (LZ 130), could not carry commercial passengers without helium, which the United States refused to sell to Germany. The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; made several test flights and conducted some electronic espionage until 1939 when it was grounded due to the beginning of the war. The two &quot;Graf Zeppelins&quot; were scrapped in April, 1940.

Development of airships continued only in the United States, and to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had several semi-rigid and non-rigid airships. The semi-rigid dirigible SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM was among the largest of these craft, and it set the longest endurance flight at the time of over 130 hours. It crashed into a mountain in 1938, killing 13 of the 19 people on board. While this was a severe blow to the Soviet airship program, they continued to operate non-rigid airships until 1950.

===World War II===
While Germany determined that airships were obsolete for military purposes in the coming war and concentrated on the development of aeroplanes, the United States pursued a program of military airship construction even though it had not developed a clear military doctrine for airship use. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, bringing the United States into World War II, the U.S. Navy had 10 nonrigid airships:
*4 &quot;K&quot;-class: &quot;K-2&quot;, &quot;K-3&quot;, &quot;K-4&quot; and &quot;K-5&quot; designed as patrol ships, all built in 1938.
*3 &quot;L&quot;-class: &quot;L-1&quot;, &quot;L-2&quot; and &quot;L-3&quot; as small training ships, produced in 1938.
*1 &quot;G&quot;-class, built in 1936 for training.
*2 &quot;TC&quot;-class that were older patrol airships designed for land forces, built in 1933. The U.S. Navy acquired both from the United States Army in 1938.
Only &quot;K&quot;- and &quot;TC&quot;-class airships were suitable for combat and they were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German submarines, which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast. U.S. Navy command, remembering airship&#x27;s anti-submarine success in World War I, immediately requested new modern antisubmarine airships and on 2 January 1942 formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in Lakehurst from the four &quot;K&quot; airships. The ZP-32 patrol unit was formed from two &quot;TC&quot; and two &quot;L&quot; airships a month later, based at NAS Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California. An airship training base was created there as well. The status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of World War II has created significant confusion. Although various accounts refer to airships &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Volunteer&quot; as operating as &quot;privateers&quot; under a Letter of Marque, Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.

In the years 1942–44, approximately 1,400 airship pilots and 3,000 support crew members were trained in the military airship crew training program and the airship military personnel grew from 430 to 12,400. The U.S. airships were produced by the Goodyear factory in Akron, Ohio. From 1942 till 1945, 154 airships were built for the U.S. Navy (133 &quot;K&quot;-class, 10 &quot;L&quot;-class, seven &quot;G&quot;-class, four &quot;M&quot;-class) and five &quot;L&quot;-class for civilian customers (serial numbers &quot;L-4&quot; to &quot;L-8&quot;).

The primary airship tasks were patrol and convoy escort near the American coastline. They also served as an organization centre for the convoys to direct ship movements, and were used in naval search and rescue operations. Rarer duties of the airships included aerophoto reconnaissance, naval mine-laying and mine-sweeping, parachute unit transport and deployment, cargo and personnel transportation. They were deemed quite successful in their duties with the highest combat readiness factor in the entire U.S. air force (87%).

During the war, some 532 ships without airship escort were sunk near the U.S. coast by enemy submarines. Only one ship, the tanker &quot;Persephone&quot;, of the 89,000 or so in convoys escorted by blimps was sunk by the enemy. Airships engaged submarines with depth charges and, less frequently, with other on-board weapons. They were excellent at driving submarines down, where their limited speed and range prevented them from attacking convoys. The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the homing torpedo they had little chance of sinking a submarine.

Only one airship was ever destroyed by U-boat: on the night of 18/19 July 1943, the &quot;K-74&quot; from ZP-21 division was patrolling the coastline near Florida. Using radar, the airship located a surfaced German submarine. The &quot;K-74&quot; made her attack run but the U-boat opened fire first. &quot;K-74&quot;″s depth charges did not release as she crossed the U-boat and the &quot;K-74&quot; received serious damage, losing gas pressure and an engine but landing in the water without loss of life. The crew was rescued by patrol boats in the morning, but one crewman, Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate Second Class Isadore Stessel, died from a shark attack. The U-boat, , was slightly damaged and the next day or so was attacked by aircraft, sustaining damage that forced it to return to base. It was finally sunk on 24 August 1943 by a British Vickers Wellington near Vigo, Spain.

Fleet Airship Wing One operated from Lakehurst, New Jersey, Glynco, Georgia, Weeksville, North Carolina, South Weymouth NAS Massachusetts, Brunswick NAS and Bar Harbor Maine, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland.

Some Navy blimps saw action in the European war theater. In 1944–45, the U.S. Navy moved an entire squadron of eight Goodyear K class blimps (K-89, K-101, K-109, K-112, K-114, K-123, K-130, &amp; K-134) with flight and maintenance crews from Weeksville Naval Air Station in North Carolina to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, French Morocco. Their mission was to locate and destroy German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar where magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) was viable. PBY aircraft had been searching these waters but MAD required low altitude flying that was dangerous at night for these aircraft. The blimps were considered a perfect solution to establish a 24/7 MAD barrier (fence) at the Straits of Gibraltar with the PBYs flying the day shift and the blimps flying the night shift. The first two blimps (K-123 &amp; K-130) left South Weymouth NAS on 28 May 1944 and flew to Argentia, Newfoundland, the Azores, and finally to Port Lyautey where they completed the first transatlantic crossing by nonrigid airships on 1 June 1944. The blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14, aka &quot;The Africa Squadron&quot;) also conducted mine-spotting and mine-sweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escorts including the convoy carrying United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in 1945. Airships from the ZP-12 unit took part in the sinking of the last U-boat before German capitulation, sinking the &quot;U-881&quot; on 6 May 1945 together with destroyers USS Atherton and USS Moberly.

Other airships patrolled the Caribbean, Fleet Airship Wing Two, Headquartered at Naval Air Station Richmond, covered the Gulf of Mexico from Richmond and Key West, Florida, Houma, Louisiana, as well as Hitchcock and Brownsville, Texas. FAW 2 also patrolled the northern Caribbean from San Julian, the Isle of Pines (now called Isla de la Juventud) and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba as well as Vernam Field, Jamaica.

Navy blimps of Fleet Airship Wing Five, (ZP-51) operated from bases in Trinidad, British Guiana and Paramaribo, Suriname. Fleet Airship Wing Four operated along the coast of Brazil. Two squadrons, VP-41 and VP-42 flew from bases at Amapá, Igarapé-Açu, São Luís Fortaleza, Fernando de Noronha, Recife, Maceió, Ipitanga (near Salvador, Bahia), Caravelas, Vitória and the hangar built for the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; at Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro.

Fleet Airship Wing Three operated squadrons, ZP-32 from Moffett Field, ZP-31 at NAS Santa Ana, and ZP-33 at NAS Tillamook, Oregon. Auxiliary fields were at Del Mar, Lompoc, Watsonville and Eureka, California, North Bend and Astoria, Oregon, as well as Shelton and Quillayute in Washington.

From 2 January 1942 until the end of war airship operations in the Atlantic, the blimps of the Atlantic fleet made 37,554 flights and flew 378,237 hours. Of the over 70,000 ships in convoys protected by blimps, only one was sunk by a submarine while under blimp escort.

The Soviet Union flew a single airship during the war. The &quot;W-12&quot;, built in 1939, entered service in 1942 for paratrooper training and equipment transport. It made 1432 flights with 300 metric tons of cargo until 1945. On 1 February 1945, the Soviets constructed a second airship, a &quot;Pobeda&quot;-class (&quot;Victory&quot;-class) unit (used for mine-sweeping and wreckage clearing in the Black Sea) that crashed on 21 January 1947. Another &quot;W&quot;-class – W-12bis &quot;Patriot&quot; – was commissioned in 1947 and was mostly used until the mid-1950s for crew training, parades and propaganda.

===Postwar period===

Although airships are no longer used for major cargo and passenger transport, they are still used for other purposes such as advertising, sightseeing, surveillance, research and advocacy.

There were several studies and proposals for nuclear-powered airships, starting with a 1954 study by F.W. Locke Jr for US Navy. In 1957 Edwin J. Kirschner published the book &quot;The Zeppelin in the Atomic Age&quot;, which promoted the use of atomic airships. In 1959 Goodyear presented a plan for nuclear-powered airship for both military and commercial use. Several other proposals and papers were published during the next decades.

In the 1980s, Per Lindstrand and his team introduced the &quot;GA-42&quot; airship, the first airship to use fly-by-wire flight control, which considerably reduced the pilot&#x27;s workload.

An airship was prominently featured in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, released in 1985. The Skyship 500 had the livery of Zorin Industries.

The world&#x27;s largest thermal airship () was constructed by the Per Lindstrand company for French botanists in 1993. The &quot;AS-300&quot; carried an underslung raft, which was positioned by the airship on top of tree canopies in the rain forest, allowing the botanists to carry out their treetop research without significant damage to the rainforest. When research was finished at a given location, the airship returned to pick up and relocate the raft.

In June 1987, the U.S. Navy awarded a US$168.9 million contract to Westinghouse Electric and Airship Industries of the UK to find out whether an airship could be used as an airborne platform to detect the threat of sea-skimming missiles, such as the Exocet. At 2.5 million cubic feet, the Westinghouse/Airship Industries Sentinel 5000 (Redesignated YEZ-2A by the U.S. Navy) prototype design was to have been the largest blimp ever constructed. Additional funding for the Naval Airship Program was killed in 1995 and development was discontinued.

The SVAM CA-80 airship, which was produced in 2000 by Shanghai Vantage Airship Manufacture Co., Ltd., had a successful trial flight in September 2001. This was designed for advertisement and propagation, air-photo, scientific test, tour and surveillance duties. It was certified as a grade-A Hi-Tech introduction program (No. 20000186) in Shanghai. The CAAC authority granted a type design approval and certificate of airworthiness for the airship.

In the 1990s the Zeppelin company returned to the airship business. Their new model, designated the Zeppelin NT, made its maiden flight on 18 September 1997. there were four NT aircraft flying, a fifth was completed in March 2009 and an expanded NT-14 (14,000 cubic meters of helium, capable of carrying 19 passengers) was under construction. One was sold to a Japanese company, and was planned to be flown to Japan in the summer of 2004. Due to delays getting permission from the Russian government, the company decided to transport the airship to Japan by sea. One of the four NT craft is in South Africa carrying diamond detection equipment from De Beers, an application at which the very stable low vibration NT platform excels. The project included design adaptations for high temperature operation and desert climate, as well as a separate mooring mast and a very heavy mooring truck. NT-4 belonged to Airship Ventures of Moffett Field, Mountain View in the San Francisco Bay Area, and provided sight-seeing tours.

Blimps are used for advertising and as TV camera platforms at major sporting events. The most iconic of these are the Goodyear Blimps. Goodyear operates three blimps in the United States, and The Lightship Group, now The AirSign Airship Group, operates up to 19 advertising blimps around the world. Airship Management Services owns and operates three Skyship 600 blimps. Two operate as advertising and security ships in North America and the Caribbean. Airship Ventures operated a Zeppelin NT for advertising, passenger service and special mission projects. They were the only airship operator in the U.S. authorized to fly commercial passengers, until closing their doors in 2012.

Skycruise Switzerland AG owns and operates two Skyship 600 blimps. One operates regularly over Switzerland used on sightseeing tours.

The Switzerland-based Skyship 600 has also played other roles over the years. For example, it was flown over Athens during the 2004 Summer Olympics as a security measure. In November 2006, it carried advertising calling it &quot;The Spirit of Dubai&quot; as it began a publicity tour from London to Dubai, UAE on behalf of The Palm Islands, the world&#x27;s largest man-made islands created as a residential complex.

Los Angeles-based Worldwide Aeros Corp. produces FAA Type Certified Aeros 40D Sky Dragon airships.

In May 2006, the U.S. Navy began to fly airships again after a hiatus of nearly 44 years. The program uses a single American Blimp Company A-170 nonrigid airship, with designation MZ-3A. Operations focus on crew training and research, and the platform integrator is Northrop Grumman. The program is directed by the Naval Air Systems Command and is being carried out at NAES Lakehurst, the original centre of U.S. Navy lighter-than-air operations in previous decades.

In November 2006 the U.S. Army bought an A380+ airship from American Blimp Corporation through a Systems level contract with Northrop Grumman and Booz Allen Hamilton. The airship started flight tests in late 2007, with a primary goal of carrying of payload to an altitude of under remote control and autonomous waypoint navigation. The program will also demonstrate carrying of payload to The platform could be used for intelligence collection. In 2008, the &quot;CA-150&quot; airship was launched by Vantage Airship. This is an improved modification of model &quot;CA-120&quot; and completed manufacturing in 2008. With larger volume and increased passenger capacity, it is the largest manned nonrigid airship in China at present.

In late June 2014 the Electronic Frontier Foundation flew the GEFA-FLUG AS 105 GD/4 blimp AE Bates (owned by, and in conjunction with, Greenpeace) over the NSA&#x27;s Bluffdale Utah Data Center in protest.

====Postwar projects====
Hybrid designs such as the Heli-Stat airship/helicopter, the Aereon aerostatic/aerodynamic craft, and the CycloCrane (a hybrid aerostatic/rotorcraft), struggled to take flight. The Cyclocrane was also interesting in that the airship&#x27;s envelope rotated along its longitudinal axis.

In 2005, a short-lived project of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was Walrus HULA, which explored the potential for using airships as long-distance, heavy lift craft. The primary goal of the research program was to determine the feasibility of building an airship capable of carrying of payload a distance of and land on an unimproved location without the use of external or ground equipment (such as masts). In 2005, two contractors, Lockheed Martin and US Aeros Airships were each awarded approximately $3 million to do feasibility studies of designs for WALRUS. Congress removed funding for Walrus HULA in 2006.

==Modern Airships==
===Military===
In 2010, the U.S. Army awarded a $517 million (£350.6 million) contract to Northrop Grumman and partner Hybrid Air Vehicles to develop a Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) system, in the form of three HAV 304s. The project was cancelled in February 2012 due to it being behind schedule and over budget; also the forthcoming U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan where it was intended to be deployed. Following this the Hybrid Air Vehicles HAV 304 Airlander 10 was repurchased by Hybrid Air Vehicles then modified and reassembled in Bedford, UK, and renamed the Airlander 10. As of 2018, it was being tested in readiness for its UK flight test programme.

, a French company, manufactures and operates airships and aerostats. For 2 years, A-NSE has been testing its airships for the French Army. Airships and aerostats are operated to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support. Their airships include many innovative features such as water ballast take-off and landing systems, variable geometry envelopes and thrust–vectoring systems.

The U.S. government has funded two major projects in the high altitude arena. The Composite Hull High Altitude Powered Platform (CHHAPP) is sponsored by U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This aircraft is also sometimes called &quot;HiSentinel High-Altitude Airship&quot;. This prototype ship made a five-hour test flight in September 2005. The second project, the high-altitude airship (HAA), is sponsored by DARPA. In 2005, DARPA awarded a contract for nearly $150 million to Lockheed Martin for prototype development. First flight of the HAA was planned for 2008 but suffered programmatic and funding delays. The HAA project evolved into the High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator (HALE-D). The U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin launched the first-of-its kind HALE-D on July 27, 2011. After attaining an altitude of , due to an anomaly, the company decided to abort the mission. The airship made a controlled descent in an unpopulated area of southwest Pennsylvania.

On 31 January 2006 Lockheed Martin made the first flight of their secretly built hybrid airship designated the P-791. The design is very similar to the SkyCat, unsuccessfully promoted for many years by the British company Advanced Technologies Group (ATG).

Dirigibles have been used in the War in Afghanistan for reconnaissance purposes, as they allow for constant monitoring of a specific area through cameras mounted on the airships.

===Passenger transport===
In the 1990s, the successor of the original Zeppelin company in Friedrichshafen, the &quot;Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH&quot;, reengaged in airship construction. The first experimental craft (later christened &quot;Friedrichshafen&quot;) of the type &quot;Zeppelin NT&quot; flew in September 1997. Though larger than common blimps, the &quot;Neue Technologie&quot; (New Technology) zeppelins are much smaller than their giant ancestors and not actually Zeppelin-types in the classical sense. They are sophisticated semirigids. Apart from the greater payload, their main advantages compared to blimps are higher speed and excellent maneuverability. Meanwhile, several &quot;Zeppelin NT&quot; have been produced and operated profitably in joyrides, research flights and similar applications.

In June 2004, a Zeppelin NT was sold for the first time to a Japanese company, Nippon Airship Corporation, for tourism and advertising mainly around Tokyo. It was also given a role at the 2005 Expo in Aichi. The aircraft began a flight from Friedrichshafen to Japan, stopping at Geneva, Paris, Rotterdam, Munich, Berlin, Stockholm and other European cities to carry passengers on short legs of the flight. Russian authorities denied overflight permission, so the airship had to be dismantled and shipped to Japan rather than following the historic &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; flight from Germany to Japan.

In 2008, Airship Ventures Inc. began operations from Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California and until November 2012 offered tours of the San Francisco Bay Area for up to 12 passengers.

===Exploration===
In November 2005, De Beers, a diamond mining company, launched an airship exploration program over the remote Kalahari Desert. A Zeppelin NT, equipped with a Bell Geospace gravity gradiometer, was used to find potential diamond mines by scanning the local geography for low-density rock formations, known as kimberlite pipes. On 21 September 2007, the airship was severely damaged by a whirlwind while in Botswana. One crew member, who was on watch aboard the moored craft, was slightly injured but released after overnight observation in hospital.
===Thermal===
Several companies, such as Cameron Balloons in Bristol, United Kingdom, build hot-air airships. These combine the structures of both hot-air balloons and small airships. The envelope is the normal cigar shape, complete with tail fins, but is inflated with hot air instead of helium to provide the lifting force. A small gondola, carrying the pilot and passengers, a small engine, and the burners to provide the hot air are suspended below the envelope, beneath an opening through which the burners protrude.

Hot-air airships typically cost less to buy and maintain than modern helium-based blimps, and can be quickly deflated after flights. This makes them easy to carry in trailers or trucks and inexpensive to store. They are usually very slow moving, with a typical top speed of . They are mainly used for advertising, but at least one has been used in rainforests for wildlife observation, as they can be easily transported to remote areas.

===Unmanned remote===
Remote-controlled (RC) airships, a type of unmanned aerial system (UAS), are sometimes used for commercial purposes such as advertising and aerial video and photography as well as recreational purposes. They are particularly common as an advertising mechanism at indoor stadiums. While RC airships are sometimes flown outdoors, doing so for commercial purposes is illegal in the US. Commercial use of an unmanned airship must be certified under part 121.

=== Adventures ===
In 2008, French adventurer Stephane Rousson attempted to cross the English Channel with a muscular pedal powered airship.

Stephane Rousson also flies the Aérosail, a sky sailing yacht.

==Current design projects==

Today, with large, fast, and more cost-efficient fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, it is unknown whether huge airships can operate profitably in regular passenger transport though, as energy costs rise, attention is once again returning to these lighter-than-air vessels as a possible alternative. At the very least, the idea of comparatively slow, &quot;majestic&quot; cruising at relatively low altitudes and in comfortable atmosphere certainly has retained some appeal. There have been some niches for airships in and after World War II, such as long-duration observations, antisubmarine patrol, platforms for TV camera crews, and advertising; these generally require only small and flexible craft, and have thus generally been better fitted for cheaper (non-passenger) blimps.

===Heavy lifting===
It has periodically been suggested that airships could be employed for cargo transport, especially delivering extremely heavy loads to areas with poor infrastructure over great distances. This has also been called roadless trucking. Also, airships could be used for heavy lifting over short distances (e.g. on construction sites); this is described as heavy-lift, short-haul. In both cases, the airships are heavy haulers. One recent enterprise of this sort was the &quot;Cargolifter&quot; project, in which a hybrid (thus not entirely Zeppelin-type) airship even larger than &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was projected. Around 2000, CargoLifter AG built the world&#x27;s largest self-supporting hall, measuring long, wide and high about south of Berlin. In May 2002, the project was stopped for financial reasons; the company had to file bankruptcy. The enormous CargoLifter hangar was later converted to house the Tropical Islands Resort. Although no rigid airships are currently used for heavy lifting, hybrid airships are being developed for such purposes. AEREON 26, tested in 1971, was described in John McPhee&#x27;s &quot;The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed&quot;.

An impediment to the large-scale development of airships as heavy haulers has been figuring out how they can be used in a cost-efficient way. In order to have a significant economic advantage over ocean transport, cargo airships must be able to deliver their payload faster than ocean carriers but more cheaply than airplanes. William Crowder, a fellow at the Logistics Management Institute, has calculated that cargo airships are only economical when they can transport 500 to 1,000 tons, approximately the same as a super-jumbo aircraft. The large initial investment required to build such a large airship has been a hindrance to production, especially given the risk inherent in a new technology. The chief commercial officer of the company hoping to sell the LMH-1, a cargo airship currently being developed by Lockheed Martin, believes that airships can be economical in hard-to-reach locations such as mining operations in northern Canada that currently require ice roads.

===Metal-clad airships===
A metal-clad airship has a very thin metal envelope, rather than the usual fabric. The shell may be either internally braced or monocoque as in the ZMC-2, which flew many times in the 1920s, the only example ever to do so. The shell may be gas-tight as in a non-rigid blimp, or the design may employ internal gas bags as in a rigid airship. Compared to a fabric envelope the metal cladding is expected to be more durable.

===Hybrid airships===
A hybrid airship is a general term for an aircraft that combines characteristics of heavier-than-air (aeroplane or helicopter) and lighter-than-air technology. Examples include helicopter/airship hybrids intended for heavy lift applications and dynamic lift airships intended for long-range cruising. Most airships, when fully loaded with cargo and fuel, are usually ballasted to be heavier than air, and thus must use their propulsion system and shape to create aerodynamic lift, necessary to stay aloft. All airships can be operated to be slightly heavier than air at periods during flight (descent). Accordingly, the term &quot;hybrid airship&quot; refers to craft that obtain a significant portion of their lift from aerodynamic lift or other kinetic means.

For example, the Aeroscraft is a buoyancy assisted air vehicle that generates lift through a combination of aerodynamics, thrust vectoring and gas buoyancy generation and management, and for much of the time will fly heavier than air. Aeroscraft is Worldwide Aeros Corporation&#x27;s continuation of DARPA&#x27;s now cancelled Walrus HULA (Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft) project.

The Patroller P3 hybrid airship developed by Advanced Hybrid Aircraft Ltd, BC, Canada, is a relatively small () buoyant craft, manned by the crew of five and with the endurance of up to 72 hours. The flight-tests with the 40% RC scale model proved that such a craft can be launched and landed without a large team of strong ground-handlers. Design features a special &quot;winglet&quot; for aerodynamic lift control.

===Airships in space exploration===
Airships have been proposed as a potential cheap alternative to surface rocket launches for achieving Earth orbit. JP Aerospace have proposed the Airship to Orbit project, which intends to float a multi-stage airship up to mesospheric altitudes of 55 km (180,000 ft) and then use ion propulsion to accelerate to orbital speed. At these heights, air resistance would not be a significant problem for achieving such speeds. The company has not yet built any of the three stages.

NASA has proposed the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept, which comprises a series of five missions including crewed missions to the atmosphere of Venus in airships. Pressures on the surface of the planet are too high for human habitation, but at a specific altitude the pressure is equal to that found on Earth and this makes Venus a potential target for human colonization.

Hypothetically, there could be an airship lifted by a vacuum—that is, by material that can contain nothing at all inside but withstand the atmospheric pressure from the outside. It is, at this point, science fiction, although NASA has posited that some kind of vacuum airship could eventually be used to explore the surface of Mars.

===Cruiser feeder transport airship===
EU FP7 MAAT Project has studied an innovative cruiser/feeder airship system, for the stratosphere with a cruiser remaining airborne for a long time and feeders connecting it to the ground and flying as piloted balloons.

=== Airships for humanitarian and cargo transport ===
Google co-founder Sergey Brin founded LTA Research in 2015 to develop airships for humanitarian and cargo transport. The company&#x27;s 124-meter-long airship Pathfinder 1 received from the FAA a special airworthiness certificate for the helium-filled airship in September 2023.

The certificate allowed the largest airship since the ill-fated Hindenburg to begin flight tests at Moffett Field, a joint civil-military airport in Silicon Valley.

==Comparison with heavier-than-air aircraft==
The advantage of airships over aeroplanes is that static lift sufficient for flight is generated by the lifting gas and requires no engine power. This was an immense advantage before the middle of World War I and remained an advantage for long-distance or long-duration operations until World War II. Modern concepts for high-altitude airships include photovoltaic cells to reduce the need to land to refuel, thus they can remain in the air until consumables expire. This similarly reduces or eliminates the need to consider variable fuel weight in buoyancy calculations.

The disadvantages are that an airship has a very large reference area and comparatively large drag coefficient, thus a larger drag force compared to that of aeroplanes and even helicopters. Given the large frontal area and wetted surface of an airship, a practical limit is reached around , only about one-third the typical airspeed of a modern commercial airplane. Thus, airships are used where speed is not critical.

The lift capability of an airship is equal to the buoyant force minus the weight of the airship. This assumes standard air-temperature and pressure conditions. Corrections are usually made for water vapor and impurity of lifting gas, as well as percentage of inflation of the gas cells at liftoff. Based on specific lift (lifting force per unit volume of gas), the greatest static lift is provided by hydrogen (11.15 N/m3 or 71 lbf/1000 cu ft) with helium (10.37 N/m3 or 66 lbf/1000 cu ft) a close second.

In addition to static lift, an airship can obtain a certain amount of dynamic lift from its engines. Dynamic lift in past airships has been about 10% of the static lift. Dynamic lift allows an airship to &quot;take off heavy&quot; from a runway similar to fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. This requires additional weight in engines, fuel, and landing gear, negating some of the static lift capacity.

The altitude at which an airship can fly largely depends on how much lifting gas it can lose due to expansion before stasis is reached. The ultimate altitude record for a rigid airship was set in 1917 by the L-55 under the command of Hans-Kurt Flemming when he forced the airship to attempting to cross France after the &quot;Silent Raid&quot; on London. The L-55 lost lift during the descent to lower altitudes over Germany and crashed due to loss of lift. While such waste of gas was necessary for the survival of airships in the later years of World War I, it was impractical for commercial operations, or operations of helium-filled military airships. The highest flight made by a hydrogen-filled passenger airship was on the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&#x27;s&quot; around-the-world flight.

The greatest disadvantage of the airship is size, which is essential to increasing performance. As size increases, the problems of ground handling increase geometrically. As the German Navy changed from the P class of 1915 with a volume of over to the larger Q class of 1916, the R class of 1917, and finally the W class of 1918, at almost ground handling problems reduced the number of days the Zeppelins were able to make patrol flights. This availability declined from 34% in 1915, to 24.3% in 1916 and finally 17.5% in 1918.

So long as the power-to-weight ratios of aircraft engines remained low and specific fuel consumption high, the airship had an edge for long-range or -duration operations. As those figures changed, the balance shifted rapidly in the aeroplane&#x27;s favour. By mid-1917, the airship could no longer survive in a combat situation where the threat was aeroplanes. By the late 1930s, the airship barely had an advantage over the aeroplane on intercontinental over-water flights, and that advantage had vanished by the end of World War II.

This is in face-to-face tactical situations. Currently, a high-altitude airship project is planned to survey hundreds of kilometres as their operation radius, often much farther than the normal engagement range of a military aeroplane. For example, a radar mounted on a vessel platform high has radio horizon at range, while a radar at altitude has radio horizon at range. This is significantly important for detecting low-flying cruise missiles or fighter-bombers.

==Safety==
The most commonly used lifting gas, helium, is inert and therefore presents no fire risk. A series of vulnerability tests were done by the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency DERA on a Skyship 600. Since the internal gas pressure was maintained at only 1–2% above the surrounding air pressure, the vehicle proved highly tolerant to physical damage or to attack by small-arms fire or missiles. Several hundred high-velocity bullets were fired through the hull, and even two hours later the vehicle would have been able to return to base. Ordnance passed through the envelope without causing critical helium loss. The results and related mathematical model have presented in the hypothesis of considering a Zeppelin NT size airship. In all instances of light armament fire evaluated under both test and live conditions, the airship was able to complete its mission and return to base.

==Licensing==
In the United Kingdom, the basic pilot licence for airships is the PPL(As), or private pilot licence, which requires a minimum of 35 hours instruction on airships. To fly commercially, an Commercial Pilot Licence (Airships) is required.

<text>The Bachem Ba 349 Natter () is a World War II German point-defence rocket-powered interceptor, which was to be used in a very similar way to a manned surface-to-air missile. After a vertical take-off, which eliminated the need for airfields, most of the flight to the Allied bombers was to be controlled by an autopilot. The primary role of the relatively untrained pilot was to aim the aircraft at its target bomber and fire its armament of rockets. The pilot and the fuselage containing the rocket engine would then land using separate parachutes, while the nose section was disposable.

The first and only manned vertical take-off flight, on 1 March 1945, ended in the death of the test pilot, Lothar Sieber.

==Development==
===Background===
In 1943, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air superiority was being challenged by the Allies over the &quot;Reich&quot; and radical innovations were required to overcome the crisis. Surface-to-air missiles appeared to be a promising approach to counter the Allied strategic bombing offensive; a variety of projects were started, but invariably problems with the guidance and homing systems prevented any of these from attaining operational status. Providing the missile with a pilot, who could operate a weapon during the brief terminal approach phase, offered a solution.

Submissions for a simple target defence interceptor were requested by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in early 1944 under the umbrella of the , literally &quot;Emergency Fighter Program&quot;. A number of simple designs were proposed, including the Heinkel P.1077 &quot;Julia&quot;, in which the pilot lay prone (on his stomach), to reduce the frontal area.

The &quot;Julia&quot; was the front-runner for the contract. The initial plan was to launch the aircraft vertically, but this concept was later changed to a conventional horizontal take-off from a tricycle-wheeled trolley, similar to that used by the first eight prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance bomber.

===Bachem&#x27;s proposal===
The Natter was first conceived by Dr Erich Bachem in August 1944, after witnessing an American bombing raid on a major German city. He believed there ought to be a way to break up these large formations of bombers. His BP-20 (&quot;Natter&quot;) was a development from a design he had worked on at Fieseler, the Fi 166 concept, but considerably more radical than the other submissions. It was built using glued and nailed wooden parts with an armour-plated bulkhead and bulletproof glass windshield at the front of the cockpit. The initial plan was to power the machine with a Walter HWK 109-509A-2 rocket engine; however, only the 109-509A-1, as used in the Me 163, was available. It had a sea level thrust variable between at &quot;idle&quot; to at full power, with the &quot;Natter&#x27;s&quot; intended quartet of rear flank-mount Schmidding SG34 solid fuel rocket boosters used in its vertical launch to provide an additional thrust for 10 seconds before they burned out and were jettisoned. The experimental prototypes slid up a -tall vertical steel launch tower for a maximum sliding length of in three guideways, one for each wing tip and one for the lower tip of the ventral tail fin. By the time the aircraft left the tower it was hoped that it would have achieved sufficient speed to allow its aerodynamic surfaces to provide stable flight.

Under operational conditions, once the Natter had left the launcher, it would be guided to the proximity of the Allied bombers by an autopilot with the possibility of an added beam guidance similar to that used in some V-2 rocket launches. Only then would the pilot take control, aim and fire the armament, which was originally proposed to be a salvo of nineteen 55mm R4M rockets. Later, 28 R4Ms or a number of the larger, 73mm Henschel Hs 297 &quot;Föhn&quot; rockets were suggested, with either variety of unguided rocket fired from the Natter&#x27;s nose-mounted cellular launch tubes. The Natter was intended to fly up and over the bombers, by which time its Walter engine would probably be out of propellant. Following its one-time attack with its rockets, the pilot would dive his Natter, now effectively a glider, to an altitude of around , flatten out, release the nose of the aircraft and a small braking parachute from the rear fuselage. The fuselage would decelerate and the pilot would be ejected forwards by his own momentum and land by means of a personal parachute.

In an early proposal in August 1944, the Natter design had a concrete nose; it was suggested that the machine might ram a bomber, but this proposal was subsequently withdrawn in later Project Natter outlines. Bachem stated clearly in the initial proposal that the Natter was not a suicide weapon and much effort went into designing safety features for the pilot. However, owing to the potential dangers for the pilot inherent in the operation of this precarious aircraft, the Natter is sometimes listed as a suicide craft. The design had one decisive advantage over its competitors – it eliminated the necessity to land an unpowered gliding machine at an airbase, which, as the history of the Me 163 rocket aircraft had clearly demonstrated, made an aircraft extremely vulnerable to attack by Allied fighters.

===Modifications===
Heinrich Himmler became interested in Bachem&#x27;s design. The Reichsführer-SS granted Bachem an interview and fully supported the project. In the middle of September 1944, the Technical Office of the Waffen-SS made an order for Bachem to develop and manufacture the Natter at his Waldsee factory. The Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) officially designated the BP-20 the Ba 349A and construction began. During December 1944, the project came largely under the control of the SS and Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler. This decision is said to have been the only time the SS significantly interfered with aircraft design and air fighting strategy. Early-on in the project, the RLM undertook an engineering assessment of the Natter, which it reported on 28 October 1944.

The Natter was designed to be built by unskilled labor with poor-quality tools and inexpensive material. Various stringent economies were imposed on an already frugal design. The Natter had no landing gear, which saved weight, expense and construction time. Consequently, one of the most unusual features of the machine was the escape of the pilot and recovery of the machine.

The proposed sequence of these events was as follows: After the attack, the Natter might dive to a lower altitude and flatten out into level flight. The pilot would then proceed with a well-practised escape sequence. He would open the cockpit canopy latch, which would allow the canopy to flick backwards on its hinge in the airstream. Next, the pilot would undo his seat belt and remove his feet from the rudder pedal stirrups. By squeezing a lever mounted on the control column, he would release a lock at the base of the column, which would allow him to tilt the column forwards where it could engage in and undo a safety latch for the nose release mechanism. He would then lean a little further forward and pull a lever hinged near the floor at the front of the cockpit, freeing the nose section, which self-jettisoned as a result of the reduced aerodynamic pressure at the front of the fuselage.

As the nose section separated, it was intended to briefly pull on two cables that released a small ribbon parachute stored on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The parachute subsequently opened and decelerated the Natter. The pilot would be ejected from the cockpit by his own momentum and as soon as he was clear of the fuselage, he would open his personal parachute and descend to the ground. A parachute was to eject the valuable Walter rocket engine from the rear, which would decelerate the aircraft and eject the pilot with inertia, however, associated problems with this mechanism were still not fully resolved prior to the conflict&#x27;s end.

Wind tunnel testing on a wooden model, scaled to 40% of full size, was performed at the &quot;Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt&quot; (DVL), the Institute for Aerodynamics at Berlin-Adlershof in September 1944 at speeds up to . Results from these tests were reported in January 1945 to the Bachem-Werk. Further model tests were carried out at the &quot;Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt Hermann Göring&quot; (LFA) facility in Völkenrode-Braunschweig, at speeds close to Mach 1. In March the Bachem-Werk simply received a statement that satisfactory flying qualities should be expected with speeds up to .

===Flight testing===
Construction of the first experimental prototype &quot;Natter, Versuchsmuster 1&quot;, was completed on 4 October 1944. V1 was subsequently referred to as &quot;Baumuster1&quot; (&quot;BM1&quot;) and later still the &quot;B&quot; was dropped and the machine became known as the M1. Most subsequent prototypes were known by &#x27;M&#x27; codes, as the later prototypes of the Heinkel He 162 were. Manned glider flights began on 3 November 1944. The first glider M1 was towed to around 3,000 m by a Heinkel He 111 bomber with a cable (&quot;Tragschlepp&quot; mode) at Neuburg an der Donau. The pilot was Erich Klöckner, who made all four documented &quot;Tragschlepp&quot; (&quot;towed&quot;) flights.

After carrying out the test programme of the M1, he bailed out and the machine crashed into the ground. It was found that the towing cable, and in the case of the M3, the undercarriage interfered with the flight characteristics of the gliders and consequently the results were difficult to interpret. To resolve doubts about the Natter in the glider mode, Hans Zübert made a free flight in the M8 on 14 February, and showed that the Natter was indeed a good flying machine.

The vertical take-off trials were conducted on high ground called the Ochsenkopf at the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz&quot; (military training area) Heuberg near Stetten am kalten Markt, Württemberg. The first successful unmanned vertical take-off from the experimental launch tower occurred on 22 December 1944. The test machine, the M16, was powered only by the Schmidding solid boosters, as were all the early vertical launch trials. Up to and including 1 March 1945, 16 prototypes had been used, eight in glider trials and eight in VTO trials.

===Manned test flight===
By January 1945, Bachem was under pressure from the authorities in Berlin to carry out a manned flight by the end of February. On 25 February, M22 was in the experimental launch tower. It was as complete an operational machine as possible with the Walter HWK 109-509 A1 engine installed for the first time. A dummy pilot was in the cockpit. Lift-off from the tower was perfect. The engineers and ground crew watched as the M22 ascended under the combined power of the four Schmidding boosters and the Walter engine, an estimated total thrust of . The nose separated as programmed and the dummy pilot descended safely under its personal parachute. The remainder of the fuselage came down under its two large salvage parachutes, but when it hit the ground the Walter liquid-propellant rocket engine&#x27;s residual hypergolic propellants (&quot;T-Stoff&quot; oxidizer and &quot;C-Stoff&quot; fuel) exploded and the machine was destroyed.

Despite Bachem&#x27;s concerns that the test programme had been significantly cut short, a young volunteer &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; test pilot, Lothar Sieber, climbed into the cockpit of the fully fuelled M23 on 1 March. The aircraft was equipped with an FM transmitter for the purpose of transmitting flight data from various monitoring sensors in the machine. A hard wire intercom appears to have been provided between Sieber and the engineers in the launch bunker using a system similar to that used in the manned glider flights. Around 1100 am, the M23 was ready for take-off. Low stratus clouds lay over the Ochsenkopf. The Walter liquid-fueled rocket engine built up to full thrust and Sieber pushed the button to ignite the four solid boosters.

Initially, the Natter rose vertically but, at an altitude of about , it suddenly pitched up into an inverted curve at about 30° to the vertical. At about the cockpit canopy was seen to fly off. The Natter continued to climb at high speed at an angle of 15° from the horizontal and disappeared into the clouds. The Walter engine stalled about 15 seconds after take-off. It is estimated the Natter reached , at which point it nose-dived and hit the ground with great force about 32 seconds later, some kilometres from the launch site. Unknown at the time, one of the Schmidding boosters failed to jettison and its remains were dug up at the crash site in 1998.

The pilot was likely unconscious long before the crash. Bachem surmised Sieber had involuntarily pulled back on the control column under the effect of the 3 G acceleration. Examination of the canopy, which fell near the launch site, showed the tip of the latch was bent, suggesting it may not have been in the fully closed position at launch. The pilot&#x27;s headrest had been attached to the underside of the canopy and as the canopy flew off the pilot&#x27;s head would have snapped back suddenly about , hitting the solid wooden rear upper cockpit bulkhead, and either knocking Sieber unconscious or breaking his neck.

The accident reinforced Bachem&#x27;s long held belief that the take-off and flight in the vicinity of the target bombers should be fully automated. The canopy latch was strengthened and the headrest was attached to the backboard of the cockpit. Before the introduction of the autopilot in the test programme, the control column would have a temporary locking device on it, which would allow the machine to ascend vertically to at least and then be removed by the pilot. The Walter engine probably ceased operation because the Natter was virtually upside-down and air may have entered the intake pipes in the propellant tanks, starving the engine. Sieber had become the first person to take off vertically from the ground under pure rocket power, 16 years before Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s &quot;Vostok 1&quot; pioneering, peacetime orbital flight. Following Sieber&#x27;s death, all of the eight subsequent Natter flights were unmanned.

===Production===
The SS ordered 150 Natters, and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ordered 50, but none were delivered by the end of the war. Much debate has surrounded the number of Natters built at the Bachem-Werk and their disposition. According to Bachem, 36 &quot;Natters&quot; were produced at the Bachem-Werk in Waldsee by the end of the war. Up to April 1945, 17 aircraft had been used in unmanned trials comprising five gliders, all slung under an He 111 in the &quot;Mistelschlepp&quot; configuration prior to launch, and 12 VTO examples. Five aircraft were prepared for manned trials, four gliders and one VTO version. The M3 was flown twice, and then rebuilt at which time it was given the new code BM3a but was never flown. The total number of launches to early April 1945 was 22, as was the total number of Natters constructed up to that time. Bachem reported further that there were 14 more finished or almost finished aircraft in April 1945. Four of these were prototype A1 operational Natters built for test launching from a wooden pole launcher, which had been designed for field deployment. This new launcher was also constructed on the Heuberg, not far from the experimental steel tower. There is documentary evidence for two pole launches in April but not three as claimed by Bachem in his post-war presentation. The documentation for this third flight may have been destroyed by the SS at war&#x27;s end. Ten A1 operational Natters, called &quot;K-Maschinen&quot;, were constructed for the &quot;Krokus-Einsatz&quot; (&quot;Operation Crocus&quot;).

The fate of these 14 A1 Natters was as follows:
Three were fired from the vertical launch tower according to Bachem, four were burnt at Waldsee, two were burnt at &quot;Lager&quot; Schlatt, Oetztal, Austria, four were captured by US troops at Sankt Leonhard im Pitztal, Austria, and one, which had been sent as a sample model to a new factory in Thuringia, was captured by the Red Army. Consequently, the total of 36 test and operational aircraft constructed at the Bachem-Werk can be accounted for. However, Natter carcasses were used for a variety of ground-based purposes; for example, as a static booster rocket, armament and strength testing and pilot seat position tests. Some fuselages were reused after flight testing; for example, the M5, 6 and 7.

Of the four Natters captured at Sankt Leonhard im Pitztal, two went to the United States. Only one original Natter built in Germany in the Second World War survives in storage at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. The fate of the other Natter brought to the US is unknown. There is no documentary evidence that a Natter was ever flown from Muroc Field. The tail section of one of the Natters at Sankt Leonhard im Pitztal was broken off while it still rested on its trailer.

==Stability==
In early February 1945, the positions of the centre of gravity for the A1 operational machine during its flight profile were giving the RLM and the SS cause for concern. They wanted these figures to be decided upon for the upcoming construction of the A1 aircraft for &quot;Krokus-Einsatz&quot; (Operation Crocus), the field deployment of the Natter. The position of the centre of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the chord (distance between the leading and trailing edges) of the main wing. Thus 0% is the leading edge and 100% is the trailing edge. In the manned glider trials the centre of gravity had been varied between 20 and 34%.

At a meeting of engineers held on 8 February, the variations in the centre of gravity expected in the A1 &quot;Krokus&quot; machine were discussed. At take-off with the weight of the four solid boosters, the centre of gravity would be brought back to 65%, but after releasing these rockets it would move forwards to 22%. The free flight by Zübert on 14 February had showed unequivocally that the little Natter had excellent flying characteristics as a glider. The centre of gravity problem was solved initially by the addition of one-metre-square auxiliary tailfins that were released simultaneously with the jettisoning of the boosters. The &quot;Krokus&quot; aircraft had vanes that would direct the Walter rocket exhaust gases so as to assist vehicle stabilisation at low speed similar to those used in the V-2 rocket.

==Legacy==

By 25 April 1945, French forces had captured Waldsee and presumably took control of the Bachem-Werk. Shortly before the French troops arrived, a group of Bachem-Werk personnel set out for Austria with five A1 Natters on trailers. At Bad Wörishofen, the group waited for another squad retreating from Nabern unter Teck with one completed Natter. Both groups then set out for the Austrian Alps. One group with two Natters ended up at the junction of the river Inn and one of its tributaries, the Ötztaler Ache, at Camp Schlatt. The other group went to St. Leonhard im Pitztal with four aircraft. US troops captured the first group at Camp Schlatt around 4 May and the second group on the following day.

At some time during the project, the Bachem-Werk was ordered to give complete details of the BP-20 Natter to the Japanese, but there was doubt over whether they had received them. They were, however, known to have a general knowledge of the Natter and showed considerable interest in the project.

==&quot;Operation Krokus&quot; launch pads at Hasenholz wood==
An operational launch site for the first Ba 349A-1 operational Natters under the code name &quot;Operation Krokus&quot; was being established in a small wooded area called Hasenholz, south of the Stuttgart to Munich autobahn and to the east of Nabern unter Teck. Around the end of February and the beginning of March the Organisation Todt was in action, constructing each set of the trios of concrete foundations (or &quot;footings&quot;) for the launch towers. These three launch pads and their towers were arranged at the corners of an equilateral triangle, 120 m per side. The specific locations are said to be , and . In the centre of each of the three concrete footings is a square hole approximately 50 centimeters deep, which once served as the foundation for the launch tower. Beside each hole is a pipe, cut off at ground level, which was probably once a cable pit. These three concrete pads were noticed by a surveyor in the autumn of 1945, but not rediscovered until 1999.

On 27 January, eight pilots volunteered for the first operational flights and started familiarizing themselves with the Natter at Bachem&#x27;s factory on 5 February. This training continued until the beginning of April. The pilots were expecting to fly three combat-ready Natters on 20 April, which was Hitler&#x27;s birthday, but were unaware that the launch pads were still incomplete. But on that day the US 10th Armored Division drove its tanks into Kirchheim unter Teck to the northwest of Hasenholz wood. The next day it crossed the autobahn and headed straight for the Natter operational area. The Natter group subsequently retreated to Waldsee.
==Surviving aircraft and replicas==

Only one original A1 Natter survives; it is stored in the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland, US. It is in a poor state of repair and is no longer accessible to the general public. The evidence supports the proposition that this machine was captured by US troops at St. Leonhard im Pitztal, Austria in May 1945.

The Natter displayed at the Deutsches Museum is said to have been reconstructed partly from sub-assemblies that survived the end of the war. This machine is of the experimental type as launched from the steel tower and is painted to look like an M17. There are several static reproductions of Natters around the world, for example at the Planes of Fame Air Museum, Chino, California and Fantasy of Flight, Polk City, Florida, US.

==Film==
In 2010, Oliver Gortat and Philip Schneider made a documentary film about the Bachem Ba 349.

<doc id="58009" wikidata="Q40317" url="?curid=58009" title="Good Friday">
<text>Good Friday is a Christian holy day observing the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum. It is also known as Black Friday, Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, Friday of the Passion of the Lord.

Members of many Christian denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, United Protestant and some Reformed traditions (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), observe Good Friday with fasting and church services. In many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, the Service of the Great Three Hours&#x27; Agony is held from noon until 3p.m.—the hours the Bible records darkness covering the land until Jesus&#x27; death on the cross. Communicants of the Moravian Church have a Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.

The date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars. Eastern and Western Christianity disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday. Good Friday is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world, including in most Western countries and 12 U.S. states. Some predominantly Christian countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts—public dancing, horse racing—in remembrance of the somber nature of Good Friday.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Good Friday&quot; comes from the sense &#x27;pious, holy&#x27; of the word &quot;good&quot;. Less common examples of expressions based on this obsolete sense of &quot;good&quot; include &#x27;the good book&quot; for the Bible, &#x27;good tide&#x27; for Christmas or Shrovetide, and Good Wednesday for the Wednesday in Holy Week. A common folk etymology incorrectly analyzes &quot;Good Friday&quot; as a corruption of &quot;God Friday&quot;, similar to the linguistically correct description of &quot;&quot; as a contraction of &#x27;God be with ye&#x27;. In Old English, the day was called &quot;Long Friday&quot; ( ), and equivalents of this term are still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.

==Biblical accounts==

According to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus&#x27; disciple Judas Iscariot, arrested Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas received money (30 pieces of silver) for betraying Jesus and told the guards that whomever he kisses is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest, Caiaphas. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the Sanhedrin had assembled.

Conflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying &quot;I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?&quot; Jesus testified ambiguously, &quot;You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.&quot; The high priest condemned Jesus for blasphemy, and the Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death. Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also denied Jesus three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had foretold.

In the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king. Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death.

Pilate questioned Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of Galilee, King Herod, who was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast. Herod questioned Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released. Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for Barabbas, who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, &quot;Crucify him.&quot; Pilate&#x27;s wife had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to &quot;have nothing to do with this righteous man.&quot; Pilate had Jesus flogged and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death &quot;because he claimed to be God&#x27;s son.&quot; This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came.
Coming before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot. The sentence written was &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.&quot; Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by Simon of Cyrene), called the &quot;place of the Skull&quot;, or &quot;Golgotha&quot; in Hebrew and in Latin &quot;Calvary&quot;. There he was crucified along with two criminals.

Jesus agonized on the cross for three hours, from noon to 3 pm, darkness fell over the whole land. In the gospels of Mathew and Mark, Jesus is said to have spoken from the cross, quoting the messianic Psalm 22: &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;

With a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The centurion on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, &quot;Truly this was God&#x27;s Son!&quot;

Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus. Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named Nicodemus brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus. Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead. A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out, and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead.

Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus&#x27; body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus also brought 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes, and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs. They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb. Then they returned home and rested, because Shabbat had begun at sunset.

==Eastern Orthodox==

Byzantine Christians (Eastern Christians who follow the Rite of Constantinople: Orthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics) call this day &quot;Great and Holy Friday&quot;, or simply &quot;Great Friday&quot;. Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is recalled on this day, the Divine Liturgy (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the Great Feast of the Annunciation, which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern Gregorian Calendar). Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout Great Lent, but instead don black vestments. There is no &quot;stripping of the altar&quot; on Holy and Great Thursday as in the West; instead, all of the church hangings are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday.

The faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific Psalms and the Gospels, and singing hymns about Christ&#x27;s death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the Orthodox understanding, the events of Holy Week are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participate in the death and the resurrection of Jesus.

Great and Holy Friday is observed as an absolute fast, and adult Byzantine Christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits. &quot;On this Holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion. If someone is unable or has become very old [or is] unable to fast, he may be given bread and water after sunset. In this way we come to the holy commandment of the Holy Apostles not to eat on Great Friday.&quot; (cf. &quot;Black Fast&quot;)

===Matins of Holy and Great Friday===
The Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday night with the Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels. Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.
The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the liturgical year, and is a concatenation from all four Gospels. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large cross is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by incense and candles, and is placed in the center of the nave (where the congregation gathers) &quot;Sēmeron Kremātai Epí Xýlou&quot;:

Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross &quot;(three times)&quot;.&lt;br&gt;He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.&lt;br&gt;He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. &lt;br&gt;He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.&lt;br&gt;The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. &lt;br&gt;The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.&lt;br&gt;We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ &quot;(three times)&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.
The readings are:

# John 13:31-18:1 – Christ&#x27;s last sermon, Jesus prays for the apostles.
# John 18:1–28 – The agony in the garden, the mockery and denial of Christ.
# Matthew 26:57–75 – The mockery of Christ, Peter denies Christ.
# John 18:28–19:16 – Pilate questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans.
# Matthew 27:3–32 – Judas commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; Simon of Cyrene compelled to carry the cross.
# Mark 15:16–32 – Jesus dies.
# Matthew 27:33–54 – Jesus dies.
# Luke 23:32–49 – Jesus dies.
# John 19:25–37 – Jesus dies.
# Mark 15:43–47 – Joseph of Arimathea buries Christ.
# John 19:38–42 – Joseph of Arimathea buries Christ.
# Matthew 27:62–66 – The Jews set a guard.

During the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross. After the Canon, a brief, moving hymn, &quot;The Wise Thief&quot; is chanted by singers who stand at the foot of the cross in the center of the nave. The service does not end with the First Hour, as usual, but with a special dismissal by the priest:

May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.

===Royal Hours===
The next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the Royal Hours, a special expanded celebration of the Little Hours (including the First Hour, Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour and Typica) with the addition of scripture readings (Old Testament, Epistle and Gospel) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated). This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of &quot;Royal&quot; from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court.

===Vespers of Holy and Great Friday===

In the afternoon, around 3 pm, all gather for the Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross, commemorating the Deposition from the Cross. Following Psalm 103 (104) and the Great Litany, &#x27;Lord, I call&#x27; is sung without a Psalter reading. The first five stichera (the first being repeated) are taken from the Aposticha at Matins the night before, but the final 3 of the 5 are sung in Tone 2. Three more stichera in Tone 6 lead to the Entrance. The Evening Prokimenon is taken from Psalm 21 (22): &#x27;They parted My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.&#x27;

There are then four readings, with Prokimena before the second and fourth:

* Exodus 33:11-23 - God shows Moses His glory
* The second Prokimenon is from Psalm 34 (35): &#x27;Judge them, O Lord, that wrong Me: fight against them that fight against Me.&#x27;
* Job 42:12-20 - God restores Job&#x27;s wealth (note that verses 18-20 are found only in the Septuagint)
* Isaiah 52:13-54:1 - The fourth Suffering Servant song
* The third Prokimenon is from Psalm 87 (88): &#x27;They laid me in the lowest pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death.&#x27;
* 1 Corinthians 1:18-2:2 - St. Paul places Christ crucified as the centre of the Christian life

An Alleluia is then sung, with verses from Psalm 68 (69): &#x27;Save Me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.&#x27;

The Gospel reading is a composite taken from three of the four the Gospels (Matthew 27:1-38; Luke 23:39-43; Matthew 27:39-54; John 19:31-37; Matthew 27:55-61), essentially the story of the crucifixion as it appears according to St. Matthew, interspersed with St. Luke&#x27;s account of the confession of the Good Thief and St. John&#x27;s account of blood and water flowing from Jesus&#x27; side. During the Gospel, the body of Christ (the &quot;soma&quot;) is removed from the cross, and, as the words in the Gospel reading mention Joseph of Arimathea, is wrapped in a linen shroud, and taken to the altar in the sanctuary. The Aposticha reflects on the burial of Christ. Either at this point (in the Greek use) or during the troparion following (in the Slav use):

an &quot;epitaphios&quot; or &quot;winding sheet&quot; (a cloth embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial) is carried in procession to a low table in the nave which represents the Tomb of Christ; it is often decorated with an abundance of flowers. The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ. The service ends with a hope of the Resurrection:

Then the priest may deliver a homily and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios. In the Slavic practice, at the end of Vespers, Compline is immediately served, featuring a special &quot;Canon of the Crucifixion of our Lord and the Lamentation of the Most Holy Theotokos&quot; by Symeon the Logothete.

===Matins of Holy and Great Saturday===

On Friday night, the Matins of Holy and Great Saturday, a unique service known as &quot;The Lamentation at the Tomb&quot; &quot;(Epitáphios Thrēnos)&quot; is celebrated. This service is also sometimes called &quot;Jerusalem Matins&quot;. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.
A unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (&quot;Enkōmia&quot;), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of Psalm 119 (which is, by far, the longest psalm in the Bible). The &quot;Enkōmia&quot; are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day.

They consist of 185 tercet antiphons arranged in three parts (&quot;stáseis&quot; or &quot;stops&quot;), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short &quot;doxastiká&quot; (&quot;Gloriae&quot;) and &quot;Theotókia&quot; (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three &quot;stáseis&quot; are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: , &quot;Life in a grave&quot;, , &quot;Worthy it is&quot;, and , &quot;All the generations&quot;. Musically they can be classified as strophic, with 75, 62, and 48 tercet stanzas each, respectively.

The climax of the &quot;Enkōmia&quot; comes during the third &quot;stásis&quot;, with the antiphon &quot;Ω γλυκύ μου ἔαρ&quot;, a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (&quot;O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?&quot;). Later, during a different antiphon of that stasis (&quot;Early in the morning the myrrh-bearers came to Thee and sprinkled myrrh upon Thy tomb&quot;), young girls of the parish place flowers on the Epitaphios and the priest sprinkles it with rose-water. The author(s) and date of the &quot;Enkōmia&quot; are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of St. Romanos the Melodist.
The Evlogitaria (Benedictions) of the Resurrection are sung as on Sunday, since they refer to the conversation between the myrrh-bearers and the angel in the tomb, followed by kathismata about the burial of Christ. Psalm 50 (51) is then immediately read, and then followed by a much loved-canon, written by Mark the Monk, Bishop of Hydrous and Kosmas of the Holy City, with irmoi by Kassiani the Nun. The high-point of the much-loved Canon is Ode 9, which takes the form of a dialogue between Christ and the Theotokos, with Christ promising His Mother the hope of the Resurrection. This Canon will be sung again the following night at the Midnight Office.

Lauds follows, and its stichera take the form of a funeral lament, while always preserving the hope of the Resurrection. The doxasticon links Christ&#x27;s rest in the tomb with His rest on the seventh day of creation, and the theotokion (&quot;Most blessed art thou, O Virgin Theotokos...) is the same as is used on Sundays.

At the end of the Great Doxology, while the Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in procession around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.

When the procession has returned to the church, a troparion is read, similar to the ones read at the Sixth Hour throughout Lent, focusing on the purpose of Christ&#x27;s burial. A series of prokimena and readings are then said:

* The first prokimenon is from Psalm 43 (44): &#x27;Arise, Lord, and help us: and deliver us for Thy Name&#x27;s sake.&#x27;
* Ezekiel 37:1-14 - God tells Ezekiel to command bones to come to life.
* The second prokimenon is from Psalm 9 (9–10), and is based on the verses sung at the kathismata and Lauds on Sundays: &#x27;Arise, O Lord my God, lift up Thine hand: forget not Thy poor forever.&#x27;
* 1 Corinthians 5:6-8; Galatians 3:13-14 - St. Paul celebrates the Passion of Christ and explains its role in the life of Gentile Christians.
* The Alleluia verses are from Psalm 67 (68), and are based on the Paschal verses: &#x27;Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered.&#x27;
* Matthew 27:62-66 - The Pharisees ask Pilate to set a watch at the tomb.

At the end of the service, a final hymn is sung as the faithful come to venerate the Epitaphios.

==Roman Catholic==
In Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was &quot;Feria sexta in Parasceve&quot; (&quot;Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]&quot;). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed &quot;Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini&quot; (&quot;Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord&quot;), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to &quot;Feria sexta in Passione Domini&quot; (&quot;Friday of the Passion of the Lord&quot;).

===Day of Fasting===

The Catholic Church regards Good Friday and Holy Saturday as the Paschal fast, in accordance with Article 110 of Sacrosanctum Concilium. In the Latin Church, a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday.

===Services on the day===
The Roman Rite has no celebration of Mass between the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday) evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop. The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick. While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this celebration.

The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o&#x27;clock; however, for pastoral reasons (especially in countries where Good Friday is not a public holiday), it is permissible to celebrate the liturgy earlier, even shortly after midday, or at a later hour. The celebration consists of three parts: the liturgy of the word, the adoration of the cross, and the Holy communion. The altar is bare, without cross, candlesticks and altar cloths. It is also customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil. Traditionally, no bells are rung on Good Friday or Holy Saturday until the Easter Vigil.

The liturgical colour of the vestments used is red. Before 1970, vestments were black except for the Communion part of the rite when violet was used. If a bishop or abbot celebrates, he wears a plain mitre &quot;(mitra simplex)&quot;. Before the reforms of the Holy Week liturgies in 1955, black was used throughout.

The Vespers of Good Friday are only prayed by those who could not attend the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord.

===Three Hours&#x27; Agony===

The Three Hours&#x27; Devotion based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross begins at noon and ends at 3 pm, the time that the Christian tradition teaches that Jesus died on the cross.

===Liturgy===
The Good Friday liturgy consists of three parts: the Liturgy of the Word, the Veneration of the Cross, and the Holy Communion.
* The Liturgy of the Word consists of the clergy and assisting ministers entering in complete silence, without any singing. They then silently make a full prostration. This signifies the abasement (the fall) of (earthly) humans. It also symbolizes the grief and sorrow of the Church. Then follows the Collect prayer, and the reading or chanting of Isaiah 52:13–53:12, Hebrews 4:14–16, Hebrews 5:7–9, and the Passion account from the Gospel of John, traditionally divided between three deacons, yet usually read by the celebrant and two other readers. In the older form of the Mass known as the Tridentine Mass the readings for Good Friday are taken from Exodus 12:1-11 and the Gospel according to St. John (John 18:1-40); (John 19:1-42).
* The Great Intercessions also known as &quot;orationes sollemnes&quot; immediately follows the Liturgy of the Word and consists of a series of prayers for the Church, the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church, those preparing for baptism, the unity of Christians, the Jews, those who do not believe in Christ, those who do not believe in God, those in public office, and those in special need. After each prayer intention, the deacon calls the faithful to kneel for a short period of private prayer; the celebrant then sums up the prayer intention with a Collect-style prayer. As part of the pre-1955 Holy Week Liturgy, the kneeling was omitted only for the prayer for the Jews.
* The Adoration of the Cross has a crucifix, not necessarily the one that is normally on or near the altar at other times of the year, solemnly unveiled and displayed to the congregation, and then venerated by them, individually if possible and usually by kissing the wood of the cross, while hymns and the Improperia (&quot;Reproaches&quot;) with the Trisagion hymn are chanted.
* Holy Communion is bestowed according to a rite based on that of the final part of Mass, beginning with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, but omitting the ceremony of &quot;Breaking of the Bread&quot; and its related acclamation, the Agnus Dei. The Eucharist, consecrated at the Evening Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on Holy Thursday, is distributed at this service. Before the Holy Week reforms of Pope Pius XII in 1955, only the priest received Communion in the framework of what was called the Mass of the Presanctified, which included the usual Offertory prayers, with the placing of wine in the chalice, but which omitted the Canon of the Mass. The priest and people then depart in silence, and the altar cloth is removed, leaving the altar bare except for the crucifix and two or four candlesticks.

===Stations of the Cross===

In addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm, known as the Three Hours&#x27; Agony. In countries such as Malta, Italy, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.

In Rome, since the papacy of John Paul II, the heights of the Temple of Venus and Roma and their position opposite the main entrance to the Colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform. This may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the Pope as well as an illuminated cross, on the occasion of the Way of the Cross ceremony. The Pope, either personally or through a representative, leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the Colosseum.

===Plenary indulgence===
In the Roman Catholic Church, plenary indulgence is obtained if the faithful venerates the cross with piety in the solemn Celebration of the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday.

===Novena to the Divine Mercy===
The novena to the Divine Mercy begins on that day and lasts until the Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday. Both days are linked in terms of content, as the mercy of God flows from the Sacred Heart of Jesus that was pierced on the cross.

==Protestant==
===Lutheran Church===
In Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach.

More recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The three days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the three days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday and at the Vigil of Easter. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a tenebrae service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called &quot;Tenebrae&quot; it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.

The Good Friday liturgy appointed in &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot;, the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the Three Hours&#x27; Agony centered on the remembrance of the &quot;Seven Last Words,&quot; sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.

Along with observing a general Lenten fast, many Lutherans emphasize the importance of Good Friday as a day of fasting within the calendar. &quot;A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent&quot; recommends the Lutheran guideline to &quot;Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day, usually without meat&quot;.

===Anglican Communion===
In the Anglican Communion, the Black Fast has been historically observed by devout believers. The Black Fast was especially popular during the 19th century as it sought to imitate &quot;the fasting of the ancient church.&quot;

The 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; did not specify a particular rite to be observed on Good Friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services, including the Seven Last Words from the Cross and a three-hour service consisting of Matins, Ante-communion (using the Reserved Sacrament in high church parishes) and Evensong. In recent times, revised editions of the Prayer Book and Common Worship have re-introduced pre-Reformation forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms, including Creeping to the Cross.

===Methodist Church===

Many Methodist denominations commemorate Good Friday with fasting, as well as a service of worship based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross; this liturgy is known as the Three Hours Devotion as it starts at noon and concludes at 3 pm, the latter being the time that Jesus died on the cross.

On Maundy Thursday, the altar and the cross are usually veiled in black for Good Friday, as black is the liturgical colour for Good Friday in the United Methodist Church. A wooden cross may sit in front of the bare chancel.

===Moravian Church===
Moravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday.

Communicants of the Moravian Church practice the Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.

===Reformed Churches===
In the Reformed tradition, Good Friday is one of the evangelical feasts and is thus widely observed with church services, which feature the Solemn Reproaches in the pattern of Psalm 78, towards the end of the liturgy.

===Other Christian traditions===
Many Protestant churches hold an Interdenominational service with Lord&#x27;s Supper.

==Associated customs==
In many countries and territories with a strong Christian tradition such as Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, the countries of the Caribbean, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, the day is observed as a public or federal holiday. In the United States, 12 states observe Good Friday as state holiday: Connecticut, Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota. One associated custom is strict adherence to the Black Fast, where believers fast from food and liquids during the day and after sunset, a vegetarian meal with water is consumed. St. Ambrose, St. Chrysostom and St. Basil attest to the practice.

The processions of the day, hymns &quot;Crux fidelis&quot; by King John of Portugal, and Eberlin&#x27;s &quot;Tenebrae factae sunt&quot;, followed by &quot;Vexilla Regis&quot; is sung, translated from Latin as &quot;the standards of the King advance&quot;, and then follows a ceremony that is not a real Mass, it is called the &quot;Mass of the Pre-Sanctified.&quot;. This custom is respected also by forgoing the Mass, this is to take heed to the solemnity of the Sacrifice of Calvary. This is where the host of the prior day is placed at the altar, incensed, elevated so &quot;that it may be seen by the people&quot; and consumed. Germany and some other countries have laws prohibiting certain acts, such as dancing and horse racing, that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day.

===Australia===
Good Friday is a holiday under state and territory laws in all states and territories in Australia. Generally speaking, shops in all Australian states (but not in the two territories of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) are required to remain closed for the duration of Good Friday, although there are certain shops which are permitted to open and other shops can apply for exemptions. All schools and universities close on Good Friday in Australia, and Good Friday falls within the school holidays in most years in all states and territories except the Northern Territory, although many states now commence their school holidays in early April regardless of Easter. In 2024, for example, when Good Friday fell on 29 March, only Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia had school holidays which coincided with Good Friday.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.australia.com/en/facts-and-planning/when-to-go/australian-school-holidays.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of businesses are closed on Good Friday, although many recreational businesses, such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show, open on Good Friday as among non-religious families Good Friday is a popular day to indulge in such activities.

===Canada===

In Canada, Good Friday is a federal statutory holiday. In the province of Quebec &quot;employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday or Easter Monday.&quot;

===Cuba===
In an online article posted on Catholic News Agency by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, Cuban President Raúl Castro, with the Communist Party and his advisers, decreed that Good Friday that year would be a holiday. This was Castro&#x27;s response to a request made personally to him by Pope Benedict XVI during the latter&#x27;s Apostolic Visitation to the island and León, Mexico that month. The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba&#x27;s relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II&#x27;s success in getting Fidel Castro to declare Christmas Day a holiday. Both Good Friday and Christmas are now annual holidays in Cuba.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, Good Friday was designated a public holiday in the Holidays Ordinance, 1875. Good Friday continues to be a holiday after the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997. Government offices, banks, post offices and most offices are closed on Good Friday.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day. Up until 2018 it was illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally closed. Critics of the ban included the catering and tourism sector, but surveys showed that the general public were divided on the issue. In Northern Ireland, a similar ban operates until 5 pm on Good Friday.

===Malaysia===
Although Malaysia is a Muslim majority country, Good Friday is declared as a public holiday in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia as there is a significant Christian indigenous population in both states.

===Malta===

The Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the Passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around Malta and Gozo. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows. Good Friday processions take place in Birgu, Bormla, Għaxaq, Luqa, Mosta, Naxxar, Paola, Qormi, Rabat, Senglea, Valletta, Żebbuġ (Città Rohan) and Żejtun. Processions in Gozo occur in Nadur, Victoria (St. George and Cathedral), Xagħra and Żebbuġ, Gozo.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, Good Friday is a legal holiday and is a day of mandatory school closure for all New Zealand state and integrated schools. Good Friday is also a restricted trading day in New Zealand, which means that unexempted shops are not permitted to open on this day.

===Philippines===
In the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the day is commemorated with street processions, the Way of the Cross, the chanting of the &quot;Pasyón&quot;, &quot;Siete Palabras&quot; or the Seven Last Words of Jesus on the Cross, and performances of the &quot;Senákulo&quot; or Passion play. Some devotees engage in self-flagellation and even have themselves crucified as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church.
Church bells are not rung and Masses are not celebrated, while television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, broadcasting mostly religious content. Malls and shops are generally closed, as are restaurants as it is the second of three public holidays within the week.

After three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), the faithful venerate the cross in the local church and follow the procession of the Burial of Jesus.

In Cebu and many parts of the Visayan Islands, people usually eat &quot;binignit&quot; and &quot;biko&quot; as a form of fasting.

===Poland===
In Polish churches, a tableau of Christ&#x27;s Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary. Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord&#x27;s body. A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday. The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more. Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed.

===Singapore===
Good Friday is a public holiday in Singapore.

===Spain===

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday (also known as a Bank Holiday). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open. Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.

There has traditionally been no horse racing on Good Friday in the UK. However, in 2008, betting shops and stores opened for the first time on this day and in 2014 Lingfield Park and Musselburgh staged the UK&#x27;s first Good Friday race meetings. The BBC has for many years introduced its 7 am News broadcast on Radio 4 on Good Friday with a verse from Isaac Watts&#x27; hymn &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot;.

The tradition of Easter plays include 1960 Eastertime performance of Good Friday: A Play in Verse (1916) Artists Ursula O&#x27;Leary (Procula), and William Devlin as Pontius Pilate, perform with the atmospheric sound effects of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The Hugh Stewart production for the Home Service used soundware such as the EMS Synthi 100 and ARP Odyssey l.

===United States===
In the United States, Good Friday is not a government holiday at the federal level, because it is a secular country. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.

Some states, counties and municipalities may observe the holiday. Good Friday is a state holiday in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky (half-day), Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. State and local government offices and courts are closed, as well as some banks and post offices in these states, and in those counties and municipalities where Good Friday is observed as a holiday. Good Friday is also a holiday in the U.S. territories of Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico.

The stock markets have chosen to be closed on Good Friday, but the foreign exchange and bond trading markets open for a partial business day. Most retail stores remain open, while some of them may close early. Because of the timing of spring break, some public schools and universities are often closed on Good Friday.

In some governmental contexts Good Friday has been referred to by a generic name such as &quot;spring holiday&quot;. In 1999, in the case of &quot;Bridenbaugh v. O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, an Indiana state employee sued the governor for giving state employees Good Friday as a day off. The US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiff, stating that the government could give state employees a paid day off when that day is a religious holiday, including Good Friday, but only so long as the state can provide a valid secular purpose that coincides with the obvious religious purpose of the holiday.

==Calculating the date==

Good Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity (see Computus for details). Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal equinox. The Western calculation uses the Gregorian calendar, while the Eastern calculation uses the Julian calendar, whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar&#x27;s 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ.

In Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).

==Cultural references==
Good Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of Richard Wagner&#x27;s music drama &quot;Parsifal&quot;, which contains an orchestral interlude known as the &quot;Good Friday Music&quot;.

==Memoration on Wednesday of the Holy Week ==
Some Baptist congregations, the Philadelphia Church of God, and some non-denominational churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a so-called &quot;papist&quot; tradition, and instead observe the Crucifixion of Jesus on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which some/many Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ). A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb (&quot;heart of the earth&quot;) for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day (by inclusive counting, as was the norm at that time) if he had died on a Friday.

The Colorado River Indian Reservation includes parts of California and Arizona and is shared by members of the Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo peoples.

The original Colorado River and Fort Mojave reservations were established in 1865 and 1870, respectively. Both reservations include substantial senior water rights in the Colorado River; water is drawn for use in irrigated farming.

The four combined tribes sharing the Colorado River Indian Reservation function today as one geo-political unit known as the federally recognized Colorado River Indian Tribes; each tribe also continues to maintain and observe its individual traditions, distinct religions, and culturally unique identities.

==Culture==

In the 1930s, George Devereux, a Hungarian-French anthropologist, did fieldwork and lived among the Mohave for an extended period of study. He published extensively about their culture and incorporated psychoanalytic thinking in his interpretation of their culture.

===Language===
The Mojave language belongs to the River Yuman branch of the Yuman language family. In 1994 approximately 75 people in total on the Colorado River and Fort Mojave reservations spoke the language, according to linguist Leanne Hinton. The tribe has published language materials, and there are new efforts to teach the language to their children.

===Religion===
The Mohave creator is &quot;Matevilya,&quot; who gave the people their names and their commandments. His son is &quot;Mastamho,&quot; who gave them the River and taught them how to plant. Historically this was an agrarian culture; they planted in the fertile floodplain of the untamed river, following the age-old customs of the Aha cave. They have traditionally used the indigenous plant Datura as a deliriant hallucinogen in a religious sacrament. A Mohave who is coming of age must consume the plant in a rite of passage, in order to enter a new state of consciousness.

==History==
Much of early Mojave history remains unrecorded in writing, since the Mojave language was not written in precolonial times. They depended on oral communication to transmit their history and culture from one generation to the next. Disease, outside cultures and encroachment on their territory disrupted their social organization. Together with having to adapt to a majority culture of another language, this resulted in interrupting the Mojave transmission of their stories and songs to the following generations.

The tribal name has been spelled in Spanish and English transliteration in more than 50 variations, such as &quot;Hamock avi&quot;, &quot;Amacava,&quot; &quot;A-mac-ha ves&quot;, &quot;A-moc-ha-ve&quot;, &quot;Jamajabs&quot;, and &quot;Hamakhav&quot;. This has led to misinterpretations of the tribal name, also partly traced to a translation error in Frederick W. Hodge&#x27;s 1917 &quot;Handbook of the American Indians North of Mexico&quot; (1917). This incorrectly defined the name Mohave as being derived from &quot;hamock,&quot; (three), and &quot;avi,&quot; (mountain). According to this source, the name refers to the mountain peaks known as The Needles in English, located near the Colorado River. (The city of Needles, California is located a few miles north from here). But, the Mojave call these peaks &quot;Huukyámpve&quot;&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;where the battle took place,&quot; referring to the battle in which the God-son, Mastamho, slew the sea serpent.

===Ancestral lands===
The Mojave held lands along the river that stretched from Black Canyon, where the tall pillars of First House of Mutavilya loomed above the river, past Avi kwame or Spirit Mountain, the center of spiritual things, to the Quechan Valley, where the lands of other tribes began. As related to contemporary landmarks, their lands began in the north at Hoover Dam and ended about one hundred miles below Parker Dam on the Colorado River, or &quot;aha kwahwat&quot; in Mojave. The most famous incident in the 19th century was the adoption of Olive Oatman after her family was massacred by another tribe, all prior to them living on the reservation.

===19th–20th centuries===

In mid-April 1859, United States troops, led by Lieutenant Colonel William Hoffman, on the Expedition of the Colorado, moved upriver into Mojave country with the well-publicized objective of establishing a military post. By this time, white immigrants and settlers had begun to encroach on Mojave lands and the post was intended to protect east-west European-American emigrants from attack by the Mojave. Hoffman sent couriers among the tribes, warning that the post would be gained by force if they or their allies chose to resist. During this period, several members of the Rose-Baley Party were massacred by the Mojave. The Mojave warriors withdrew as Hoffman&#x27;s armada approached and the army, without conflict, occupied land near the future Fort Mojave. Hoffman ordered the Mojave men to assemble on April 23, 1859, at the armed stockade adjacent to his headquarters, to hear Hoffman&#x27; terms of peace. Hoffman gave them the choice of submission or extermination and the Mojave chose submission. At that time the Mojave population was estimated to be about 4,000, which composed 22 clans identified by totems.

Under American law the Mohave were to live on the Colorado River Reservation after its establishment in 1865. However, many refused to leave their ancestral homes in the Mojave Valley. At this time, under jurisdiction of the War Department, officials declined to try to force them onto the reservation and the Mojave in the area were relatively free to follow their tribal ways. In the midsummer of 1890, after the end of the Indian Wars, the War Department withdrew its troops and the post was transferred to the Office of Indian Affairs within the Department of the Interior.

Beginning in August 1890, the Office of Indian Affairs began an intensive program of assimilation where Mohave, and other native children living on reservations, were forced into boarding schools in which they learned to speak, write, and read English. This assimilation program, which was Federal policy, was based on the belief that this was the only way native peoples could survive. Fort Mojave was converted into a boarding school for local children and other &quot;non-reservation&quot; Indians. Until 1931, forty-one years later, all Fort Mojave boys and girls between the ages of six and eighteen were compelled to live at this school or to attend an advanced Indian boarding school far removed from Fort Mojave.

The assimilation helped to break up tribal culture and governments. In addition to English, schools taught American culture and customs and insisted that the children follow them; students were required to adopt European-American hairstyles (which included hair cutting), clothing, habits of eating, sleeping, toiletry, manners, industry, and language. Use of their own language or customs was a punishable offense; at Fort Mojave five lashes of the whip were issued for the first offense. Such corporal punishment of children scandalized the Mojave, who did not discipline their children in that way.

As part of the assimilation the administrators assigned English names to the children and registered as members of one of two tribes, the Mojave Tribe on the Colorado River Reservation and the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. These divisions did not reflect the traditional Mojave clan and kinship system. By the late 1960s, thirty years after the end of the assimilation program 18 of the 22 traditional clans had survived.

==Population==
Estimates of the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber (1925:883) put the 1770 population of the Mohave at 3,000 and Francisco Garcés, a Franciscan missionary-explorer, also estimated the population at 3,000 in 1776 (Garcés 1900(2):450).

A.L. Kroeber estimate of the population in 1910 was 1,050. By 1963 Lorraine M. Sherer&#x27;s research revealed the population had shrunk to approximately 988, with 438 at Fort Mojave and 550 at the Colorado River Reservation.

==Current status==
The Mohave, along with the Chemehuevi, some Hopi, and some Navajo, share the Colorado River Indian Reservation and function today as one geopolitical unit known as the federally recognized Colorado River Indian Tribes; each tribe also continues to maintain and observe its individual traditions, distinct religions, and culturally unique identities. The Colorado River Indian Tribes headquarters, library and museum are in Parker, Arizona, about 40 miles (64 km) north of I-10. The Colorado River Indian Tribes Native American Days Fair &amp; Expo is held annually in Parker, from Thursday through Sunday during the first week of October. The Megathrow Traditional Bird Singing &amp; Dancing social event is also celebrated annually, on the third weekend of March. RV facilities are available along the Colorado River.

<text>A microwave oven or simply microwave is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy (heat) in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because the heating effect is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high-water-content food item.

The development of the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves) to efficiently heat up water molecules. American electrical engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with developing and patenting the world&#x27;s first commercial microwave oven, the &quot;Radarange&quot;, which was first sold in 1947. He based it on British radar technology which had been developed before and during World War II. 

Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was introduced by Tappan in 1955, but it was still too large and expensive for general home use. Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. The countertop microwave oven was introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation. After microwave ovens became affordable for residential use in the late 1970s, their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world, and prices fell rapidly during the 1980s. In addition to cooking food, microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.

Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They rapidly heat foods which can easily burn or turn lumpy if cooked in conventional pans, such as hot butter, fats, chocolate, or porridge. Microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperature to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.

Microwave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave oven do not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying, browning, or baking at a higher temperature produces. However, such high-heat sources can be added to microwave ovens in the form of a convection microwave oven.

== History ==

=== Early developments ===
The exploitation of high-frequency radio waves for heating substances was made possible by the development of vacuum tube radio transmitters around 1920. By 1930 the application of short waves to heat human tissue had developed into the medical therapy of diathermy. At the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, Westinghouse demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10 kW, 60 MHz shortwave transmitter. The Westinghouse team, led by I. F. Mouromtseff, found that foods like steaks and potatoes could be cooked in minutes.

The 1937 United States patent application by Bell Laboratories states:
However, lower-frequency dielectric heating, as described in the aforementioned patent, is (like induction heating) an electromagnetic heating effect, the result of the so-called near-field effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 30 to 15 meters, respectively). Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to &quot;far-field&quot; effects that are due to classical electromagnetic radiation that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating effect of all types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the dielectric heating effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.

=== Cavity magnetron ===

The invention of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The cavity magnetron was a crucial component in the development of short wavelength radar during World War II. In 1937–1940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE and coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II. A higher-powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype. They invented a valve that could produce pulses of microwave radio energy at a wavelength of 10 cm, an unprecedented discovery.

Sir Henry Tizard traveled to the US in late September 1940 to offer Britain&#x27;s most valuable technical secrets including the cavity magnetron in exchange for US financial and industrial support (see Tizard Mission). An early 6 kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories, Wembley, London, was given to the U.S. government in September 1940. The cavity magnetron was later described by American historian James Phinney Baxter III as &quot;[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores&quot;. Contracts were awarded to Raytheon and other companies for the mass production of the cavity magnetron.

=== Discovery ===

In 1945, the heating effect of a high-power microwave beam was independently and accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked by Spencer was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters.

To verify his finding, Spencer created a high-density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer&#x27;s microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.

=== Commercial availability ===

In 1947, Raytheon built the &quot;Radarange&quot;, the first commercially available microwave oven. It was almost tall, weighed and cost about US$5,000 ($ in dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, about three times as much as today&#x27;s microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS &quot;Savannah&quot;. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($ to $ in dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952. Under contract to Whirlpool, Westinghouse, and other major appliance manufacturers looking to add matching microwave ovens to their conventional oven line, Tappan produced several variations of their built-in model from roughly 1955 to 1960. Due to maintenance (some units were water-cooled), in-built requirement, and cost—US$1,295 ($ in dollars)—sales were limited.

Japan&#x27;s Sharp Corporation began manufacturing microwave ovens in 1961. Between 1964 and 1966, Sharp introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable, an alternative means to promote more even heating of food. In 1965, Raytheon, looking to expand their Radarange technology into the home market, acquired Amana to provide more manufacturing capability. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($ in dollars). Unlike the Sharp models, a motor driven mode stirrer in the top of the oven cavity rotated allowing the food to remain stationary.

In the 1960s, Litton bought Studebaker&#x27;s Franklin Manufacturing assets, which had been manufacturing magnetrons and building and selling microwave ovens similar to the Radarange. Litton developed a new configuration of the microwave oven: the short, wide shape that is now common. The magnetron feed was also unique. This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where there is nothing to absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a trade show in Chicago, and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home microwave ovens. Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975. Market penetration was even faster in Japan, due to a less expensive re-engineered magnetron.
Several other companies joined in the market, and for a time most systems were built by defence contractors, who were most familiar with the magnetron. Litton was particularly well known in the restaurant business.

===Residential use===

While uncommon today, combination microwave-ranges were offered by major appliance manufacturers through much of the 1970s as a natural progression of the technology. Both Tappan and General Electric offered units that appeared to be conventional stove top/oven ranges, but included microwave capability in the conventional oven cavity. Such ranges were attractive to consumers since both microwave energy and conventional heating elements could be used simultaneously to speed cooking, and there was no loss of countertop space. The proposition was also attractive to manufacturers as the additional component cost could better be absorbed compared with countertop units where pricing was increasingly market-sensitive.

By 1972, Litton (Litton Atherton Division, Minneapolis) introduced two new microwave ovens, priced at $349 and $399, to tap into the market estimated at $750 million by 1976, according to Robert I Bruder, president of the division. While prices remained high, new features continued to be added to home models. Amana introduced automatic defrost in 1974 on their RR-4D model, and was the first to offer a microprocessor controlled digital control panel in 1975 with their RR-6 model.
The late 1970s saw an explosion of low-cost countertop models from many major manufacturers.

Formerly found only in large industrial applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a standard fixture of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned a microwave oven, up from only about 1% in 1971; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned a microwave oven in 1997. In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained a microwave oven and that 83% of them were used daily. In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had a microwave oven in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998. In France, 40% of households owned a microwave oven in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.

Adoption has been slower in less-developed countries, as households with disposable income concentrate on more important household appliances like refrigerators and ovens. In India, for example, only about 5% of households owned a microwave oven in 2013, well behind refrigerators at 31% ownership. However, microwave ovens are gaining popularity. In Russia, for example, the number of households with a microwave oven grew from almost 24% in 2002 to almost 40% in 2008. Almost twice as many households in South Africa owned microwave ovens in 2008 (38.7%) as in 2002 (19.8%). Microwave oven ownership in Vietnam in 2008 was at 16% of households, versus 30% ownership of refrigerators; this rate was up significantly from 6.7% microwave oven ownership in 2002, with 14% ownership for refrigerators that year.

Consumer household microwave ovens usually come with a cooking power of between 600 and 1200 watts. Microwave cooking power, also referred to as output wattage, is lower than its input wattage, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s listed power rating.

The size of household microwave ovens can vary, but usually have an internal volume of around , and external dimensions of approximately wide, deep and tall. Countertop microwaves vary in weight 23 – 45 lbs.

Microwaves can be turntable or flatbed. Turntable ovens include a glass plate or tray. Flatbed ones do not include a plate, so they have a flat and wider cavity.

By position and type, US DOE classifies them as (1) countertop or (2) over the range and built-in (wall oven for a cabinet or a drawer model).

A traditional microwave only has two power output levels, fully on and fully off. Intermediate heat settings are achieved using duty-cycle modulation and switch between full power and off every few seconds, with more time on for higher settings.

An inverter type, however, can sustain lower temperatures for a lengthy duration without having to switch itself off and on repeatedly. Apart from offering superior cooking ability, these microwaves are generally more energy-efficient.

, the majority of countertop microwave ovens (regardless of brand) sold in the United States were manufactured by the Midea Group.

=== Categories ===

Domestic microwave ovens are typically marked with the microwave-safe symbol, next to the device&#x27;s approximate IEC 60705 output power rating, in watts (typically either: 600W, 700W, 800W, 900W, 1000W), and a voluntary Heating Category (A-E).

== Principles ==


A microwave oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency in the so-called microwave region (300 MHz to 300 GHz). Microwave ovens use frequencies in one of the ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are otherwise used for communication amongst devices that do not need a license to operate, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services.

It is a common misconception that microwave ovens heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food. Instead, microwave ovens heat by causing molecules to spin under the influence of a constantly changing electric field, usually in the microwave frequencies range, and a higher wattage power of the microwave oven results in faster cooking times. Typically, consumer ovens work around a nominal 2.45 gigahertz (GHz) – a wavelength of in the 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz ISM band – while large industrial / commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz) – . Among other differences, the longer wavelength of a commercial microwave oven allows the initial heating effects to begin deeper within the food or liquid, and therefore become evenly spread within its bulk sooner, as well as raising the temperature deep within the food more quickly.

A microwave oven takes advantage of the electric dipole structure of water molecules, fats, and many other substances in the food, using a process known as dielectric heating. These molecules have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other. In an alternating electric field, they will constantly spin around as they continually try to align themselves with the electric field. This can happen over a wide range of frequencies. The electric field&#x27;s energy is absorbed by the dipole molecules as rotational energy. Then they hit non-dipole molecules, making them move faster as well. This energy is shared deeper into the substance as molecular rotation and translational movement occurs, signifying an increase in the temperature of the food. Once the electrical field&#x27;s energy is initially absorbed, heat will gradually spread through the object similarly to any other heat transfer by contact with a hotter body.

=== Defrosting ===
Microwave heating is more efficient on liquid water than on frozen water, where the movement of molecules is more restricted. Defrosting is done at a low power setting, allowing time for conduction to carry heat to still frozen parts of food. Dielectric heating of liquid water is also temperature-dependent: At 0 °C, dielectric loss is greatest at a field frequency of about 10 GHz, and for higher water temperatures at higher field frequencies.

===Fats and sugar===
Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves due to the dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. Microwave heating is less efficient on fats and sugars than on water because they have a smaller molecular dipole moment.

Although fats and sugar typically absorb energy less efficiently than water, paradoxically their temperatures rise faster and higher than water when cooking: Fats and oils require less energy delivered per gram of material to raise their temperature by 1 °C than does water (they have lower specific heat capacity) and they begin cooling off by &quot;boiling&quot; only after reaching a higher temperature than water (the temperature they require to vaporize is higher), so inside microwave ovens they normally reach higher temperatures – sometimes &quot;much&quot; higher. This can induce temperatures in oil or fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much in the manner of conventional broiling (UK: grilling), braising, or deep fat frying.

The effect is most often noticed by consumers from unexpected damage to plastic containers when microwaving foods high in sugar, starch, or fat generates higher temperatures. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water and do not damage plastic.

===Cookware===
Cookware must be transparent to microwaves. Conductive cookware, such as metal pots, reflects microwaves, and prevents the microwaves from reaching the food. Cookware made of materials with high electrical permittivity will absorb microwaves, resulting in the cookware heating rather than the food. Cookware made of melamine resin is a common type of cookware that will heat in a microwave oven, reducing the effectiveness of the microwave oven and creating a hazard from burns or shattered cookware.

=== Thermal runaway ===
Microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaways in some materials with low thermal conductivity which also have dielectric constants that increase with temperature. An example is glass, which can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave oven to the point of melting if preheated. Additionally, microwaves can melt certain types of rocks, producing small quantities of molten rock. Some ceramics can also be melted, and may even become clear upon cooling. Thermal runaway is more typical of electrically conductive liquids such as salty water.

=== Penetration ===
Another misconception is that microwave ovens cook food &quot;from the inside out&quot;, meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogeneous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers.

Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast with broiling / grilling (infrared) or convection heating methods which thinly deposit heat at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves depends on food composition and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating deeper.

=== Energy consumption ===
In use, microwave ovens can be as low as 50% efficient at converting electricity into microwaves, but energy-efficient models can exceed 64% efficiency. Stovetop cooking is 40–90% efficient, depending on the type of appliance used.

Because they are used fairly infrequently, the average residential microwave oven consumes only 72 kWh per year. Globally, microwave ovens used an estimated 77 TWh per year in 2018, or 0.3% of global electricity generation.

A 2000 study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the average microwave drew almost 3 watts of standby power when not being used, which would total approximately 26 kWh per year. New efficiency standards imposed in 2016 by the United States Department of Energy require less than 1 watt, or approximately 9 kWh per year, of standby power for most types of microwave ovens.

== Components ==
A microwave oven generally consists of:

* a high-voltage DC power source, either:
**a large high voltage transformer with a voltage doubler (a high-voltage capacitor and a diode)
**an electronic power converter usually based around an inverter.
* a cavity magnetron, which converts the high-voltage DC electric energy to microwave radiation
* a magnetron control circuit (usually with a microcontroller)
* a short waveguide (to couple microwave power from the magnetron into the cooking chamber)
* a turntable and/or metal wave guide stirring fan
* a control panel

In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. (One variant of the GE Spacemaker had two taps on the transformer primary, for high and low power modes.) Usually choice of power level does not affect intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models use &quot;inverter&quot; power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power settings, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.

The microwave frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The first is that they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for unlicensed purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in some countries (ITU Region 2) while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide. Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.

The cooking chamber is similar to a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves&#x27; wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.

=== Control panel ===
Modern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, LCD or vacuum fluorescent display, buttons for entering the cook time and a power level selection feature. A defrost option is typically offered, as either a power level or a separate function. Some models include pre-programmed settings for different food types, typically taking weight as input. In the 1990s, brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions.

Power settings are commonly implemented not by actually varying the power output, but by switching the emission of microwave energy off and on at intervals. The highest setting thus represents continuous power. Defrost might represent power for two seconds followed by no power for five seconds. To indicate cooking has completed, an audible warning such as a bell or a beeper is usually present, and/or &quot;End&quot; usually appears on the display of a digital microwave.

Microwave control panels are often considered awkward to use and are frequently employed as examples for user interface design.

== Variants and accessories ==
A variant of the conventional microwave oven is the convection microwave oven. A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave oven and a convection oven. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwave ovens are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwave ovens—those with exposed heating elements—can produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements. Some ovens use high speed air; these are known as impingement ovens and are designed to cook food quickly in restaurants, but cost more and consume more power.

In 2000, some manufacturers began offering high power quartz halogen bulbs to their convection microwave oven models, marketing them under names such as &quot;Speedcook&quot;, &quot;Advantium&quot;, &quot;Lightwave&quot; and &quot;Optimawave&quot; to emphasize their ability to cook food rapidly and with good browning. The bulbs heat the food&#x27;s surface with infrared (IR) radiation, browning surfaces as in a conventional oven. The food browns while also being heated by the microwave radiation and heated through conduction through contact with heated air. The IR energy which is delivered to the outer surface of food by the lamps is sufficient to initiate browning caramelization in foods primarily made up of carbohydrates and Maillard reactions in foods primarily made up of protein. These reactions in food produce a texture and taste similar to that typically expected of conventional oven cooking rather than the bland boiled and steamed taste that microwave-only cooking tends to create.

In order to aid browning, sometimes an accessory browning tray is used, usually composed of glass or porcelain. It makes food crisp by oxidizing the top layer until it turns brown. Ordinary plastic cookware is unsuitable for this purpose because it could melt.

Frozen dinners, pies, and microwave popcorn bags often contain a susceptor made from thin aluminium film in the packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.

== Heating characteristics ==
Microwave ovens produce heat directly within the food, but despite the common misconception that microwaved food cooks from the inside out, 2.45 GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately into most foods. The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer .

Uneven heating in microwaved food can be partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution.

: The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave oven can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven: When the water-saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be darkened which can provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.

The second problem is due to food composition and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low thermal conductivity, where dielectric constant increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaway. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave oven to the point of melting.

Due to this phenomenon, microwave ovens set at too-high power levels may even start to cook the edges of frozen food while the inside of the food remains frozen. Another case of uneven heating can be observed in baked goods containing berries. In these items, the berries absorb more energy than the drier surrounding bread and cannot dissipate the heat due to the low thermal conductivity of the bread. Often this results in overheating the berries relative to the rest of the food. &quot;Defrost&quot; oven settings either use low power levels or repeatedly turn the power off and on – intended to allow time for heat to be conducted within frozen foods from areas that absorb heat more readily to those which heat more slowly. In turntable-equipped ovens, more even heating can take place by placing food off-center on the turntable tray instead of exactly in the center, as this results in more even heating of the food throughout.

There are microwave ovens on the market that allow full-power defrosting. They do this by exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic radiation LSM modes. LSM full-power defrosting may actually achieve more even results than slow defrosting.

Microwave heating can be deliberately uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a &quot;susceptor&quot;. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are a good example of such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way.

=== Effects on food and nutrients ===

Any form of cooking diminishes overall nutrient content in food, particularly water-soluble vitamins common in vegetables, but the key variables are how much water is used in the cooking, how long the food is cooked, and at what temperature. Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into cooking water, which tends to make microwave cooking effective, given the shorter cooking times it requires and that the water heated is in the food. Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B from an active to inactive form; the amount of conversion depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get internally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B. The higher rate of loss is partially offset by the shorter cooking times required.

Spinach retains nearly all its folate when cooked in a microwave oven; when boiled, it loses about 77%, leaching nutrients into the cooking water. Bacon cooked by microwave oven has significantly lower levels of nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon. Steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a stovetop. Microwave blanching is 3–4 times more effective than boiled-water blanching for retaining of the water-soluble vitamins, folate, thiamin and riboflavin, with the exception of of which 29% is lost (compared with a 16% loss with boiled-water blanching).

=== Safety benefits and features ===
All microwave ovens use a timer to switch off the oven at the end of the cooking time.

Microwave ovens heat food without getting hot themselves. Taking a pot off a stove, unless it is an induction cooktop, leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or trivet that remains hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a casserole out of a conventional oven, one&#x27;s arms are exposed to the very hot walls of the oven. A microwave oven does not pose this problem.

Food and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than . Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is . That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.

The lower temperature of cooking (the boiling point of water) is a significant safety benefit compared with baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces the time needed to heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying at high-temperatures, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e., solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.

===Use in cleaning kitchen sponges===
Studies have investigated the use of the microwave oven to clean non-metallic domestic sponges which have been thoroughly wetted. A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for 2 minutes (at 1000-watt power) removed 99% of coliforms, &quot;E. coli&quot;, and MS2 phages. &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; spores were killed at 4 minutes of microwaving.

A 2017 study was less affirmative: About 60% of the germs were killed but the remaining ones quickly re-colonized the sponge.

== Issues ==
=== High temperatures ===
====Closed containers====
Closed containers, such as eggs, can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the increased pressure from steam. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell also explode as a result of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in a microwave oven, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves to the point that they may become dangerously hot.

====Fires====

Products that are heated for too long can catch fire. Though this is inherent to any form of cooking, the rapid cooking and unattended nature of the use of microwave ovens results in additional hazard.

====Superheating====
In rare cases, water and other liquids can superheat when heated in a microwave oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling (nucleation) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.

=== Metal objects ===

Contrary to popular assumptions, metal objects can be safely used in a microwave oven, but with some restrictions. Any metal or conductive object placed into the microwave oven acts as an antenna to some degree, resulting in an electric current. This causes the object to act as a heating element. This effect varies with the object&#x27;s shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.

Any object containing pointed metal can create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwave ovens is safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in oyster pails, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire, or into a pointed shape. Forks are a good example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.

Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.
The effect of microwaving thin metal films can be seen clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough to be used in microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave oven cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.

Another hazard is the resonance of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave oven is run without an object to absorb the radiation, a standing wave forms. The energy is reflected back and forth between the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. High reflected power may also cause magnetron arcing, possibly resulting in primary power fuse failure, though such a causal relationship is not easily established. Thus, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.

Certain foods such as grapes, if properly arranged, can produce an electric arc. Prolonged arcing from food carries similar risks to arcing from other sources as noted above.

Some other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print Thermos flasks and other heat-retaining containers (such as Starbucks novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any bit of the metal is exposed, all the outer shell can burst off the object or melt.

The high electrical fields generated inside a microwave oven often can be illustrated by placing a radiometer or neon glow-bulb inside the cooking chamber, creating glowing plasma inside the low-pressure bulb of the device.

=== Direct microwave exposure ===

Direct microwave exposure is not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source in a microwave oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed. Furthermore, ovens are equipped with redundant safety interlocks, which remove power from the magnetron if the door is opened. This safety mechanism is required by United States federal regulations. Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately (2 in) from the surface of the oven. This is far below the exposure level currently considered to be harmful to human health.

The radiation produced by a microwave oven is non-ionizing. It therefore does not have the cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens. However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating. Microwave ovens are sold with a protective interlock so that it cannot be run when the door is open or improperly latched.

Microwaves generated in microwave ovens cease to exist once the electrical power is turned off. They do not remain in the food when the power is turned off, any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp is turned off. They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. In contrast with conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally in a positive way by preserving more micronutrients – see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.

There are, however, a few cases where people have been exposed to direct microwave radiation, either from appliance malfunction or deliberate action. This exposure generally results in physical burns to the body, as human tissue, particularly the outer fat and muscle layers, has a similar composition to some foods that are typically cooked in microwave ovens and so experiences similar dielectric heating effects when exposed to microwave electromagnetic radiation.

=== Chemical exposure ===

The use of unmarked plastics for microwave cooking raises the issue of plasticizers leaching into the food.

The plasticizers which received the most attention are bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, although it is unclear whether other plastic components present a toxicity risk. Other issues include melting and flammability. An alleged issue of release of dioxins into food has been dismissed as an intentional red herring distraction from actual safety issues.

Some current plastic containers and food wraps are specifically designed to resist radiation from microwaves. Products may use the term &quot;microwave safe&quot;, may carry a microwave symbol (three lines of waves, one above the other) or simply provide instructions for proper microwave oven use. Any of these is an indication that a product is suitable for microwaving when used in accordance with the directions provided.

Plastic containers can release microplastics into food when heated in microwave ovens.

=== Uneven heating ===
Microwave ovens are frequently used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination may not be repressed if the microwave oven is used improperly. If safe temperature is not reached, this can result in foodborne illness, as with other reheating methods. While microwave ovens can destroy bacteria as well as conventional ovens can, they cook rapidly and may not cook as evenly, similar to frying or grilling, leading to a risk of some food regions failing to reach recommended temperatures. Therefore, a standing period after cooking to allow temperatures in the food to equalize is recommended, as well as the use of a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures.

===Interference===
Microwave ovens, although shielded for safety purposes, still emit low levels of microwave radiation. This is not harmful to humans, but can sometimes cause interference to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other devices that communicate on the 2.45 GHz wavebands, particularly at close range.
Conventional transformer ovens do not operate continuously over the mains cycle, but can cause significant slowdowns for many metres around the oven, whereas inverter-based ovens can stop nearby networking entirely while operating.

<text>Tora! Tora! Tora! () is a 1970 Japanese-American epic war film that dramatizes the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, from both American and Japanese positions. The film was produced by Elmo Williams and directed by Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, and stars an ensemble cast including Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, So Yamamura, E.G. Marshall, James Whitmore, Tatsuya Mihashi, Takahiro Tamura, Wesley Addy, and Jason Robards. It was Masuda and Fukasaku&#x27;s first English-language film, and first international co-production. The &quot;tora&quot; of the title, although literally meaning &quot;tiger&quot;, is actually an abbreviation of a two-syllable codeword (i.e., &quot;totsugeki raigeki&quot; 突撃雷撃, &quot;lightning attack&quot;), used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved.

The film was released in the United States by Twentieth Century Fox on September 23, 1970, and in Japan by the Toei Company on September 25. It received mixed reviews from American critics, but was praised for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, its visual effects, and its action sequences. &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was nominated for five Oscars at the 43rd Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, winning Best Visual Effects (L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers). The National Board of Review ranked it in its Top Ten Films of 1971. A 1994 survey at the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial determined that for Americans the film was the most common source of popular knowledge about the Pearl Harbor attack. 

==Plot==

In September 1940, following a trade embargo imposed on a belligerent Japan by the United States a year prior, severely limiting raw materials, influential Japanese army figures and politicians push through an alliance with Germany and Italy, despite opposition from the Japanese navy, and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, believing that Japan&#x27;s best hope of controlling the Pacific Ocean is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer Minoru Genda is chosen to mastermind the operation, while his old Naval Academy classmate Mitsuo Fuchida is selected to lead the attack.

Meanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese &quot;Purple Code&quot;, allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer monitor the transmissions. At Pearl Harbor, Admiral Kimmel increases defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii, which could provide early warning of enemy presence. General Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii, so General Howard Davidson of the 14th Pursuit Wing tries dispersing some planes to other airfields on Oahu to maintain air readiness.

Months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the Japanese fleet forays into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese planned 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese will launch a surprise attack after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions. However, Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President, while Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall&#x27;s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevents radio transmission, and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Two radar operators detect their approach to Hawaii, but the duty officer dismisses their concerns. Similarly, the claim by the destroyer to have sunk a Japanese miniature submarine off the entrance to Pearl Harbor is dismissed as unimportant. The Japanese thus achieve total surprise, which Commander Fuchida indicates with the signal &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;

The damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Several battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short&#x27;s anti-sabotage precautions prove a mistake, allowing the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. In Washington, Secretary of State Cordell Hull is stunned to learn of the attack and requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts – including a declaration that peace negotiations were at an end – was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught Japanese ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura, helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is rebuffed by Hull.

In the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. In the aftermath of the attack, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall&#x27;s telegram warning of impending danger. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto informs his staff that their primary target – the American aircraft carriers – were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels in the Pacific. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and concludes: &quot;I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;

==Production==

Veteran 20th Century Fox executive Darryl F. Zanuck, who had earlier produced &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what &quot;really happened on December 7, 1941&quot;, with a &quot;revisionist&#x27;s approach&quot;. He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese. Despite a breakthrough in intelligence, they had received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack. Recognizing that a balanced and objective recounting was necessary, Zanuck developed an American-Japanese co-production, allowing for &quot;a point of view from both nations&quot;. He was helped out by his son, Richard D. Zanuck, who was chief executive at Fox during this time.

Production on &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; took three years to plan and prepare for the eight months of principal photography. The film was created in two separate productions, one based in the United States, directed by Richard Fleischer, and one based in Japan. The Japanese side was initially to be directed by Akira Kurosawa, who worked on script development and pre-production for two years. However, after two weeks of shooting, he was replaced by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, who directed the Japanese sections. Toshiro Mifune reportedly had been scheduled to play Yamamoto but withdrew when Kurosawa left the project.

Richard Fleischer said of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s role in the project:
Larry Forrester and frequent Kurosawa collaborators Hideo Oguni and Ryūzō Kikushima wrote the screenplay, based on books written by Ladislas Farago and Gordon Prange of the University of Maryland, who served as a technical consultant. Numerous technical advisors on both sides, some of whom had participated in the battle and/or planning, were crucial in maintaining the accuracy of the film. Minoru Genda, the man who largely planned and led the attack on Pearl Harbor, was an uncredited technical advisor for the film.

Four cinematographers were involved in the main photography: Charles F. Wheeler, Shinsaku Himeda, Masamichi Satoh, and Osamu Furuya. They were jointly nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. A number of well-known cameramen also worked on the second units without credit, including Thomas Del Ruth and Rexford Metz. The second unit doing miniature photography was directed by Ray Kellogg, while the second unit doing aerial sequences was directed by Robert Enrietto.

Noted composer Jerry Goldsmith composed the film score and Robert McCall painted several scenes for various posters of the film.

The carrier entering Pearl Harbor towards the end of the film was in fact the , returning to port. The &quot;Japanese&quot; aircraft carrier was the anti-submarine carrier , fitted with a false bow to disguise the catapults. The Japanese A6M Zero fighters and the somewhat longer &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers or &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers were heavily modified Royal Canadian Air Force Harvard (T-6 Texan) and BT-13 Valiant pilot training aircraft. The large fleet of Japanese aircraft was created by Lynn Garrison, a well-known aerial action coordinator, who produced a number of conversions. Garrison and Jack Canary coordinated the actual engineering work at facilities in the Los Angeles area. These aircraft still make appearances at air shows.

For the parallel filming in Japan, full-scale mock-ups of the Japanese battleship and aircraft carrier were built from the waterline up on shore, with about of their bows extending out over the ocean on stilts. These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship&#x27;s decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model &quot;Akagi&quot;″s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: &quot;Akagi&quot; and . This was done because it was known that for the launching scenes filmed in the US, a US carrier would be used, and the islands of US carriers were always on the starboard side. A few of the modified aircraft were also converted in Japan for the flight scenes filmed there.

In preparation for filming, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was berthed at NAS North Island in San Diego to load all the aircraft, maintenance, and film crew prior to sailing to Hawaii. The night before filming the &quot;Japanese&quot; take-off scenes, she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego, and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these &quot;Japanese&quot; aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have arresting gear with which to land back on the carrier and so continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii, where the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor. Aircraft Specialties of Mesa, Arizona, performed maintenance on the aircraft while in Hawaii.

The actual crash landing of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress during filming, a result of a jammed landing gear, was used in the final cut. The film crew received word that one of the B-17s could not lower its starboard landing gear, so they quickly set up to film the &quot;single gear&quot; landing. The aircraft stayed aloft to use up as much fuel as possible prior to landing, which gave the film crew some time to prepare. After viewing the &quot;single gear&quot; landing footage, they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash, they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel, the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft included the Consolidated PBY Catalina and, especially, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk (two flyable examples were used). Predominantly, P-40 fighter aircraft were used to depict the U.S. defenders with a full-scale P-40 used as a template for fiberglass replicas (some with working engines and props) that were strafed and blown up during filming. Fleischer also said a scene involving a P-40 model crashing into the middle of a line of P-40s was unintended, as it was supposed to crash at the end of the line. The stuntmen involved in the scene were actually running for their lives. The B-17 crash along with several other scenes were reused in the 1976 film &quot;Midway&quot;.

With over 30 aircraft in the air, the flying scenes were complex to shoot, comparable to the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; where large formations of period-specific aircraft were filmed in staged aerial battles. The 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; would use some of the same modified aircraft.

=== Casting ===
The film was deliberately cast with actors who were not true box-office stars, including many Japanese amateurs, in order to place the emphasis on the story rather than the actors who were in it.

Several members of the cast had themselves served in World War II.
Some crew members also served in the war.
Some cast members served before or after World War II.
==Historical accuracy==

&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; is regarded highly by Pearl Harbor historians and survivors for its accuracy.

Parts of the film showing the takeoff of the Japanese aircraft utilize an , &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which was commissioned in 1943 and modernized after the war to have a very slightly angled flight deck. The ship was leased by the film producers, who needed an aircraft carrier for the film, and as &quot;Yorktown&quot; was scheduled to be decommissioned in 1970, the Navy made her available. She was used largely in the takeoff sequence of the Japanese attack aircraft. The sequence shows interchanging shots of models of the Japanese aircraft carriers and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. She does not look like any of the Japanese carriers involved in the attack, due to her large bridge island and her angled landing deck. The Japanese carriers had small bridge islands, and it wasn&#x27;t until after the war that angled flight decks were developed. In addition, during the scene in which Admiral Halsey is watching bombing practice, an aircraft carrier with the hull number 14 is shown. Admiral Halsey was on , not the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier , which would not be commissioned until 1944. This is understandable, however, as &quot;Enterprise&quot; and all six of the Japanese carriers from the attack had been scrapped or sunk.

In &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, an error involves the model of . In the film, &quot;Akagi&quot;″s bridge island is positioned on the starboard side of the ship, which is typical on most aircraft carriers. However, &quot;Akagi&quot; was an exception; her bridge island was on the port side of the ship. Despite this, the bridge section appeared accurately as a mirrored version of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s real port-side bridge. Secondly, all the Japanese aircraft in the footage bear the markings of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s aircraft (a single vertical red stripe following the red sun symbol of Japan), even though five other aircraft carriers participated, each having its own markings. In addition, the markings do not display the aircraft&#x27;s identification numbers as was the case in the actual battle. The white surround on the roundel on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards. Prior to this, the roundel was red only.

 was an old &quot;4-piper&quot; destroyer commissioned in 1918; the ship used in the movie, , which portrays &quot;Ward&quot;, looked far different from the original destroyer. In addition, in the movie, she fired two shots from her #1 gun turret. In reality, &quot;Ward&quot; fired the first shot from the #1 un-turreted gunmount and the second shot from the #3 wing mount. The attack on the midget submarine by USS &quot;Ward&quot; was previously mentioned in the film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;.

A full-scale set was built representing the stern section of a U.S. Navy Standard-type battleship showing two aft gun turrets each with three gun barrels. It was used to portray both and and other battleships. It was correct for USS &quot;Arizona&quot; but incorrect for USS &quot;Nevada&quot;, which had lower triple and upper twin gun turrets. The scale model of USS &quot;Nevada&quot; used to portray the whole ship in wide shots displayed the fore and aft turrets accurately in a 3-2-2-3 arrangement. A lattice mast (or cage mast) section representing a or battleship was built on the ground behind the full-scale stern set to give the appearance that the set was on Battleship Row. The USS &quot;Arizona&quot;/USS &quot;Nevada&quot; stern section set was used for the explosion that destroyed USS &quot;Arizona&quot;, although the explosion took place in the forward #2 magazine and &quot;Arizona&quot;″s stern section remained essentially intact.

The film has a Japanese Zero fighter being damaged by U.S. Navy CPO John William Finn at Naval Air Station at Kāneʻohe Bay and then deliberately crashing into a hangar. This is actually a composite of three incidents during the Pearl Harbor attack: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero crashed into Fort Kamehameha&#x27;s ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero deliberately crashed into a hillside after Finn shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a damaged Japanese aircraft crashed into the seaplane tender .

During a number of shots of the attack squadrons traversing across Oahu, a white cross can be seen standing on one of the mountainsides. The cross was actually erected after the attack as a memorial to the victims.

The film also featured Mitsuo Fuchida and Minoru Genda asking Admiral Nagumo for a third strike, but like many of Fuchida&#x27;s post war claims this has been called into question. Genda denied making such a request and he and Admiral Kusaka both denied that Fuchida did.

In the final scene, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto says: &quot;I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant&quot;. An abridged version of this quotation is featured in the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. The 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot; also features Yamamoto speaking aloud the &quot;sleeping giant&quot; quote. Although the quotation may well have encapsulated many of his real feelings about the attack, there is no printed evidence to prove Yamamoto made this statement or wrote it down. Director Richard Fleischer stated that while Yamamoto may never have said those words, the film&#x27;s producer, Elmo Williams, had found the line written in Yamamoto&#x27;s diary. Williams, in turn, has stated that Larry Forrester, the screenwriter, found a 1943 letter from Yamamoto to the Admiralty in Tokyo containing the quotation. However, Forrester cannot produce the letter, nor can anyone else, American or Japanese, recall it or find it. 

==Release==
The film had its world premiere on September 23, 1970, in New York, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.

==Reception==
===Box office===
At the time of its initial release, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was thought to be a box office disappointment in North America, despite its domestic box office of $29,548,291 making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1970. It was a major hit in Japan, and over the years, home media releases provided a larger overall profit. The film had earned in Japanese distributor rentals by 1971, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1971 in Japan.

According to Fox records, the film required in rentals to break even, and had done so by December 11, 1970.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 57% rating based on 30 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; is scrupulously accurate and lays out of the tragedy of Pearl Harbor with intricate detail, but the film&#x27;s clinical approach to the sound and fury signifies little feeling.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 46% based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film one star and felt that &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was &quot;one of the deadest, dullest blockbusters ever made&quot; and suffered from not having &quot;some characters to identify with.&quot; In addition, he criticized the film for poor acting and special effects in his 1970 review. Vincent Canby, reviewer for &quot; The New York Times&quot;, was similarly unimpressed, noting the film was &quot;nothing less than a $25-million irrelevancy.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also found the film to be boring; however, the magazine praised the film&#x27;s action sequences and production values. Charles Champlin in his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on September 23, 1970, considered the movie&#x27;s chief virtues as a &quot;spectacular&quot;, and the careful recreation of a historical event.

Despite the initial negative reviews, the film was critically acclaimed for its vivid action scenes and found favor with aviation aficionados. However, even the team of Jack Hardwick and Ed Schnepf, who had been involved in research on aviation films, relegated &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; to the &quot;also-ran&quot; status due to its slow-moving plotline.

Several later films and TV series relating to World War II in the Pacific have used footage from &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. These productions include the films &quot;Midway&quot; (1976; in the &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; DVD commentary, Fleischer expressed anger that Universal used the footage), &quot;All This and World War II&quot; (film 1976), &quot;Pearl&quot; (TV mini-series 1978), &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (TV mini-series 1979), &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980), and &quot;Australia&quot; (2008) as well as the &quot;Magnum, P. I.&quot; television series episode titled &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; (first airdate February 12, 1981).

In 1994, a survey at the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial in Honolulu determined that for Americans the film was the most common source of popular knowledge about the Pearl Harbor attack.

Clark Collis of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five stars, writing that the film &quot;is high on historical veracity but low on drama&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; released a special issue dedicated to &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; which detailed the Blu-Ray release of the film. Stating that the film &quot;has only grown in stature over the decades&quot;, it praises the attack sequences, calling them &quot;quite spectacular&quot;, and commends the portrayal of the Japanese as &quot;anything but ethnic stereotypes, which adds immensely to the impact of their side of the story&quot;. It also praises the &quot;innovative, pulse-pounding&quot; soundtrack. Reviewers called the film as being &quot;meticulous&quot; in its approach to dissecting the situation leading up to the attack. A reviewer called &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; a fine documentary-style film about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The usage of both American and Japanese filmmakers provides an unbiased film and unique viewing experience, and is uncommon in the genre. A 2018 article described the film as doing &quot;a most memorable job in portraying the whole Pearl Harbor experience&quot;.

<doc id="58019" wikidata="Q641044" url="?curid=58019" title="Harvard architecture">
<text>The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. It is often contrasted with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways. This architecture is often used in real-time processing or low-power applications.

The term is often stated as having originated from the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, which stored instructions on punched tape (24 bits wide) and data in electro-mechanical counters. These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit, and provided no access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not initialize itself. However, in the only peer-reviewed paper on the topic published in 2022 the author states that: 

* &#x27;The term &quot;Harvard architecture&quot; was coined decades later, in the context of microcontroller design&#x27; and only &#x27;retrospectively applied to the Harvard machines and subsequently applied to RISC microprocessors with separated caches&#x27;;

* &#x27;The so-called &quot;Harvard&quot; and &quot;von Neumann&quot; architectures are often portrayed as a dichotomy, but the various devices labeled as the former have far more in common with the latter than they do with each other&#x27;;

* &#x27;In short [the Harvard architecture] isn&#x27;t an architecture and didn&#x27;t derive from work at Harvard&#x27;.

Modern processors appear to the user to be systems with von Neumann architectures, with the program code stored in the same main memory as the data. For performance reasons, internally and largely invisible to the user, most designs have separate processor caches for the instructions and data, with separate pathways into the processor for each. This is one form of what is known as the modified Harvard architecture.

Harvard architecture is historically, and traditionally, split into two address spaces, but having three, i.e. two extra (and all accessed in each cycle) is also done, while rare.

==Memory details==
In a Harvard architecture, there is no need to make the two memories share characteristics. In particular, the word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory address structure can differ. In some systems, instructions for pre-programmed tasks can be stored in read-only memory while data memory generally requires read-write memory. In some systems, there is much more instruction memory than data memory so instruction addresses are wider than data addresses.

===Contrast with von Neumann architectures===

In a system with a pure von Neumann architecture, instructions and data are stored in the same memory, so instructions are fetched over the same data path used to fetch data. This means that a CPU cannot simultaneously read an instruction and read or write data from or to the memory. In a computer using the Harvard architecture, the CPU can both read an instruction and perform a data memory access at the same time, even without a cache. A Harvard architecture computer can thus be faster for a given circuit complexity because instruction fetches and data access do not contend for a single memory pathway.

Also, a Harvard architecture machine has distinct code and data address spaces: instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero. Instruction address zero might identify a twenty-four-bit value, while data address zero might indicate an eight-bit byte that is not part of that twenty-four-bit value.

===Contrast with modified Harvard architecture===

A modified Harvard architecture machine is very much like a Harvard architecture machine, but it relaxes the strict separation between instruction and data while still letting the CPU concurrently access two (or more) memory buses. The most common modification includes separate instruction and data caches backed by a common address space. While the CPU executes from cache, it acts as a pure Harvard machine. When accessing backing memory, it acts like a von Neumann machine (where code can be moved around like data, which is a powerful technique). This modification is widespread in modern processors, such as the ARM architecture, Power ISA and x86 processors. It is sometimes loosely called a Harvard architecture, overlooking the fact that it is actually &quot;modified&quot;.

Another modification provides a pathway between the instruction memory (such as ROM or flash memory) and the CPU to allow words from the instruction memory to be treated as read-only data. This technique is used in some microcontrollers, including the Atmel AVR. This allows constant data, such as text strings or function tables, to be accessed without first having to be copied into data memory, preserving scarce (and power-hungry) data memory for read/write variables. Special machine language instructions are provided to read data from the instruction memory, or the instruction memory can be accessed using a peripheral interface. (This is distinct from instructions which themselves embed constant data, although for individual constants the two mechanisms can substitute for each other.)

==Speed==
In recent years, the speed of the CPU has grown many times in comparison to the access speed of the main memory. Care needs to be taken to reduce the number of times main memory is accessed in order to maintain performance. If, for instance, every instruction run in the CPU requires an access to memory, the computer gains nothing for increased CPU speed—a problem referred to as being memory bound.

It is possible to make extremely fast memory, but this is only practical for small amounts of memory for cost, power and signal routing reasons. The solution is to provide a small amount of very fast memory known as a CPU cache which holds recently accessed data. As long as the data that the CPU needs is in the cache, the performance is much higher than it is when the CPU has to get the data from the main memory. On the other side, however, it may still be limited to storing repetitive programs or data and still has a storage size limitation, and other potential problems associated with it.

=== Internal vs. external design ===
Modern high performance CPU chip designs incorporate aspects of both Harvard and von Neumann architecture. In particular, the &quot;split cache&quot; version of the modified Harvard architecture is very common. CPU cache memory is divided into an instruction cache and a data cache. Harvard architecture is used as the CPU accesses the cache. In the case of a cache miss, however, the data is retrieved from the main memory, which is not formally divided into separate instruction and data sections, although it may well have separate memory controllers used for concurrent access to RAM, ROM and (NOR) flash memory.

Thus, while a von Neumann architecture is visible in some contexts, such as when data and code come through the same memory controller, the hardware implementation gains the efficiencies of the Harvard architecture for cache accesses and at least some main memory accesses.

In addition, CPUs often have write buffers which let CPUs proceed after writes to non-cached regions. The von Neumann nature of memory is then visible when instructions are written as data by the CPU and software must ensure that the caches (data and instruction) and write buffer are synchronized before trying to execute those just-written instructions.

==Modern uses of the Harvard architecture==
The principal advantage of the pure Harvard architecture—simultaneous access to more than one memory system—has been reduced by modified Harvard processors using modern CPU cache systems. Relatively pure Harvard architecture machines are used mostly in applications where trade-offs, like the cost and power savings from omitting caches, outweigh the programming penalties from featuring distinct code and data address spaces.

*Digital signal processors (DSPs) generally execute small, highly optimized audio or video processing algorithms using a Harvard architecture. They avoid caches because their behavior must be extremely reproducible. The difficulties of coping with multiple address spaces are of secondary concern to speed of execution. Consequently, some DSPs feature multiple data memories in distinct address spaces to facilitate SIMD and VLIW processing. Texas Instruments TMS320 C55x processors, for one example, feature multiple parallel data buses (two write, three read) and one instruction bus.
*Microcontrollers are characterized by having small amounts of program (flash memory) and data (SRAM) memory, and take advantage of the Harvard architecture to speed processing by concurrent instruction and data. The separate storage means the program and data memories may feature different bit widths, for example using 16-bit-wide instructions and 8-bit-wide data. They also mean that instruction prefetch can be performed in parallel with other activities. Examples include the PIC by Microchip Technology, Inc. and the AVR by Atmel Corp (now part of Microchip Technology).

Even in these cases, it is common to employ special instructions in order to access program memory as though it were data for read-only tables, or for reprogramming; those processors are modified Harvard architecture processors.

<doc id="58023" wikidata="Q1822063" url="?curid=58023" title="Lewis–Clark State College">
<text>Lewis-Clark State College is a public college in Lewiston, Idaho, United States. It was founded in 1893 and has an approximate annual enrollment of 3,600. The college offers more than 130 degrees.

== History ==

In 1893, Governor William J. McConnell signed an act on January 27 authorizing the establishment of the Lewiston State Normal School in Lewiston, &quot;provided the mayor and common council of that city on or before May 1, 1893, donate ten acres, within the city limits and known as part of the city park, and authorizing the said mayor and council to convey to the trustees of said normal school the said tract of land,&quot; etc.

The first Trustees on the school&#x27;s Board were James W. Reid (who had done the most to shepherd the authorization bill through the Idaho Legislature), Norman B. Willey (who had just stepped down as Idaho governor), Benjamin Wilson (a previous gubernatorial candidate), J. Morris Howe, and C. W. Schaff. Reid was elected President of the Board, a position he held until his death in 1902.

Lewiston residents lost no time in obtaining the required space for the school. However, the legislature acted slowly in providing construction funds, and then construction lagged. George E. Knepper had been hired as first President of the Normal School. Frustrated by the delays in getting his building, Knepper leased space in downtown Lewiston and opened for classes on January 6, 1896. The building itself was not ready until May. Over the next several years, more structures were added to the campus, including dormitories and a gymnasium.
In keeping with the normal school philosophy, Lewiston Normal focused on practical, hands-on training for new teachers. That meant the school provided a great deal of “manual training”—what is now called vocational education. Also, to insure that teachers truly knew how to handle a classroom, the school ran an on-campus training school. In it, real teachers taught real pupils, and student teachers also learned-by-doing under the supervision of experienced teacher-critics.

Until the 1920s, one-room schools served well over half of Idaho&#x27;s primary students. In most, only the teacher knew anything at all about running a school. Thus, “teachers assumed responsibility for shaping a district&#x27;s entire educational policy.”

The First World War certainly impacted the nation&#x27;s normal schools, but not as much as it did conventional institutions. Generally, male students were in the majority at regular colleges, many of which experienced brutal enrollment losses. Normal schools attracted a predominantly female student body, so the declines were much smaller—about 15% at Lewiston Normal.
The school experienced a painful crisis on December 5, 1917, when the Administration Building suffered severe damage in a fire,
 later determined to be arson by a student. Its cupola collapsed into the gutted interior of the main structure and the older east wing was totally destroyed. 

Lewiston Normal continued to grow, as the demand for pre-college teachers increased. However, by the late 1920s, the &quot;normal school&quot; idea was being supplanted by a &quot;teachers college&quot; approach. Such colleges still focused on teacher education, but now students could earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree—more and more often required for certification. Recognizing this trend, school supporters began a campaign to change Lewiston Normal&#x27;s status. They also began the process of upgrading the faculty—inciting much ill will.
Supporters also fought an ongoing battle just to keep the school open; some legislators still wanted to close the Normals to save money. The advent of World War II squelched that notion. Not only did the school continue to turn out desperately needed teachers, it also expanded its nurse-training program, and produced large numbers of fliers in its Navy Air School. In 1943, the Board of Education raised the school to full four-year status and became North Idaho Teachers College (NITC). Now with the ability to grant a Bachelor of Education degree, school leaders took it upon themselves to use the name Northern Idaho College of Education (NICE), and the legislature approved the name change in 1947.
The school got another temporary reprieve from the cost-cutters when a deluge of veterans funded by the G.I. Bill hit the campus after the war. However, that wave passed, and in 1951 budget hawks succeeded in closing the school, as well as its counterpart, the Southern Idaho College of Education (SICE), which had previously been called Albion State Normal School, in Albion in southern Idaho. The state&#x27;s other colleges had assured legislators that they could supply all the teachers needed. That promise proved disastrously wrong: In just three years, the state found itself issuing nearly 40% more provisional teaching certificates than it had in 1951.

Under that pressure, the legislature re-opened the school as Lewis-Clark Normal School in 1955 as a two-year school under the administration of the University of Idaho, north in Moscow. The first dean of the school was appointed for the third year in 1957, and enrollment was 319 in the fall of 1961. The arrangement with the university proved difficult and it ended abruptly in 1963 when the affiliation seemed like it might damage the university&#x27;s academic accreditation.

The ongoing need for teachers, a developing shortage of nurses, and a new push for vocational education from the federal government combined to rescue the school from oblivion. The state legislature voted to elevate it to four-year status in 1963 but did not approve funding until two years later. Enrollment of the now-independent, four-year school grew, from 465 in 1964 to 1,033 in the fall of 1968. It continued to grow and in July 1971 the name was officially changed to Lewis-Clark State College, and was the last normal school in the country to make the change.

== Athletics ==

The Lewis-Clark State athletic teams are called the Warriors and Lady Warriors. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) since autumn 2020. The Warriors and Lady Warriors previously competed in the Frontier Conference from 1998 to 2000.
LC State competes in twelve intercollegiate varsity sports: men&#x27;s sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis, and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. The school colors are navy blue, white, and red. The nickname &quot;Warriors&quot; was adopted after the school reopened in 1955; earlier nicknames include &quot;Pioneers&quot; in the 1930s, &quot;Loggers&quot; was adopted through a contest in October 1938, and continued until the 1951 closure.

===Baseball===
Absent for a decade (1952–1961), baseball returned as an intercollegiate sport in 1962. Since 1984, the team has won nineteen NAIA national championships; sixteen were under head coach Ed Cheff, who retired after 34 years in 2010. LC State has hosted the NAIA World Series at Harris Field since 2000, and also from 1984 through 1991.

<text>The bourgeoisie ( , ) are a class of business owners, merchants and wealthy people, in general, which emerged in the Late Middle Ages, originally as a &quot;middle class&quot; between the peasantry and aristocracy. They are traditionally contrasted with the proletariat by their wealth, political power, and education, as well as their access to and control of cultural, social, and financial capital.

The bourgeoisie in its original sense is intimately linked to the political ideology of liberalism and its existence within cities, recognised as such by their urban charters (e.g., municipal charters, town privileges, German town law), so there was no bourgeoisie apart from the citizenry of the cities. Rural peasants came under a different legal system.

In communist philosophy, the bourgeoisie is the social class that came to own the means of production during modern industrialisation and whose societal concerns are the value of private property and the preservation of capital to ensure the perpetuation of their economic dominance in society.

==Etymology==
The Modern French word ( or , ) derived from the Old French or (&#x27;town dweller&#x27;), which derived from (&#x27;market town&#x27;), from the Old Frankish (&#x27;town&#x27;); in other European languages, the etymologic derivations include the Middle English , the Middle Dutch , the German , the Modern English &quot;burgess&quot;, the Spanish , the Portuguese , and the Polish , which occasionally is synonymous with the intelligentsia.

In the 18th century, before the French Revolution (1789–1799), in the French , the masculine and feminine terms and identified the relatively rich men and women who were members of the urban and rural Third Estate – the common people of the French realm, who violently deposed the absolute monarchy of the Bourbon King Louis XVI (r. 1774–1791), his clergy, and his aristocrats in the French Revolution of 1789–1799. Hence, since the 19th century, the term &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; usually is politically and sociologically synonymous with the ruling upper class of a capitalist society. In English, the word &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, as a term referring to French history, refers to a social class oriented to economic materialism and hedonism, and to upholding the political and economic interests of the capitalist ruling-class.

Historically, the medieval French word denoted the inhabitants of the (walled market-towns), the craftsmen, artisans, merchants, and others, who constituted &quot;the bourgeoisie&quot;. They were the socio-economic class between the peasants and the landlords, between the workers and the owners of the means of production, the feudal nobility. As the economic managers of the (raw) materials, the goods, and the services, and thus the capital (money) produced by the feudal economy, the term &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; evolved to also denote the middle class – the businessmen who accumulated, administered, and controlled the capital that made possible the development of the bourgs into cities.

Contemporarily, the terms &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; (noun) identify the &quot;ruling class&quot; in capitalist societies, as a social stratum; while &quot;bourgeois&quot; (adjective / noun modifier) describes the (worldview) of men and women whose way of thinking is socially and culturally determined by their economic materialism and philistinism, a social identity famously mocked in Molière&#x27;s comedy (1670), which satirizes buying the trappings of a noble-birth identity as the means of climbing the social ladder. The 18th century saw a partial rehabilitation of bourgeois values in genres such as the (bourgeois drama) and &quot;bourgeois tragedy&quot;.

Emerging in the 1970s, the shortened term &quot;bougie&quot; became slang, referring to things or attitudes which are middle class, pretentious and suburban. In 2016, a hip-hop group Migos produced a song Bad and Boujee, featuring an intentional misspelling of the word as &quot;boujee&quot; – a term which has particularly been used by African Americans in reference to African Americans. The term refers to a person of lower or middle class doing pretentious activities or virtue signalling as an affectation of the upper-class.

==History==

===Origins and rise===

The bourgeoisie emerged as a historical and political phenomenon in the 11th century when the of Central and Western Europe developed into cities dedicated to commerce and crafts. This urban expansion was possible thanks to economic concentration due to the appearance of protective self-organization into guilds. Guilds arose when individual businessmen (such as craftsmen, artisans and merchants) conflicted with their rent-seeking feudal landlords who demanded greater rents than previously agreed.

In the event, by the end of the Middle Ages (), under regimes of the early national monarchies of Western Europe, the bourgeoisie acted in self-interest, and politically supported the king or queen against legal and financial disorder caused by the greed of the feudal lords. In the late-16th and early 17th centuries, the bourgeoisies of England and the Netherlands had become the financial – thus political – forces that deposed the feudal order; economic power had vanquished military power in the realm of politics.

===From progress to reaction (Marxist view)===
According to the Marxist view of history, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the bourgeoisie were the politically progressive social class who supported the principles of constitutional government and of natural right, against the Law of Privilege and the claims of rule by divine right that the nobles and prelates had autonomously exercised during the feudal order.

The English Civil War (1642–1651), the American War of Independence (1775–1783), and French Revolution (1789–1799) were partly motivated by the desire of the bourgeoisie to rid themselves of the feudal and royal encroachments on their personal liberty, commercial prospects, and the ownership of property. In the 19th century, the bourgeoisie propounded liberalism, and gained political rights, religious rights, and civil liberties for themselves and the lower social classes; thus the bourgeoisie was a progressive philosophic and political force in Western societies.

After the Industrial Revolution (1750–1850), by the mid-19th century the great expansion of the bourgeoisie social class caused its stratification – by business activity and by economic function – into the (bankers and industrialists) and the (tradesmen and white-collar workers). Moreover, by the end of the 19th century, the capitalists (the original bourgeoisie) had ascended to the upper class, while the developments of technology and technical occupations allowed the rise of working-class men and women to the lower strata of the bourgeoisie; yet the social progress was incidental.

==Denotations==

===Marxist theory===

According to Karl Marx, the bourgeois during the Middle Ages usually was a self-employed businessman – such as a merchant, banker, or entrepreneur – whose economic role in society was being the financial intermediary to the feudal landlord and the peasant who worked the fief, the land of the lord. Yet, by the 18th century, the time of the Industrial Revolution (1750–1850) and of industrial capitalism, the bourgeoisie had become the economic ruling class who owned the means of production (capital and land), and who controlled the means of coercion (armed forces and legal system, police forces and prison system).

In such a society, the bourgeoisie&#x27;s ownership of the means of production allowed them to employ and exploit the wage-earning working class (urban and rural), people whose only economic means is labor; and the bourgeois control of the means of coercion suppressed the sociopolitical challenges by the lower classes, and so preserved the economic status quo; workers remained workers, and employers remained employers.

In the 19th century, Marx distinguished two types of bourgeois capitalist:
* the functional capitalists, who are business administrators of the means of production;
* rentier capitalists whose livelihoods derive either from the rent of property or from the interest-income produced by finance capital, or from both.

In the course of economic relations, the working class and the bourgeoisie continually engage in class struggle, where the capitalists exploit the workers, while the workers resist their economic exploitation, which occurs because the worker owns no means of production, and, to earn a living, seeks employment from the bourgeois capitalist; the worker produces goods and services that are property of the employer, who sells them for a price.

Besides describing the social class who owns the means of production, the Marxist use of the term &quot;bourgeois&quot; also describes the consumerist style of life derived from the ownership of capital and real property. Marx acknowledged the bourgeois industriousness that created wealth, but criticised the moral hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie when they ignored the alleged origins of their wealth: the exploitation of the proletariat, the urban and rural workers. Further sense denotations of &quot;bourgeois&quot; describe ideological concepts such as &quot;bourgeois freedom&quot;, which is thought to be opposed to substantive forms of freedom; &quot;bourgeois independence&quot;; &quot;bourgeois personal individuality&quot;; the &quot;bourgeois family&quot;; et cetera, all derived from owning capital and property (see &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, 1848).

===France and Francophone countries===
In English, the term &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; is often used to denote the middle classes. In fact, the French term encompasses both the upper and middle economic classes, a misunderstanding which has occurred in other languages as well. The bourgeoisie in France and many French-speaking countries consists of five evolving social layers: , , , and .

====&quot;Petite bourgeoisie&quot;====
The is the equivalent of the modern-day middle class, or refers to &quot;a social class between the middle class and the lower class: the lower middle class&quot;.

===Nazism===
Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of proletarian internationalism and class struggle, and supported the &quot;class struggle between nations&quot;, and sought to resolve internal class struggle in the nation while it identified Germany as a proletariat nation fighting against plutocratic nations. The Nazi Party had many working-class supporters and members, and a strong appeal to the middle class. The financial collapse of the white collar middle-class of the 1920s figures much in their strong support of Nazism. In the poor country that was the Weimar Republic of the early 1930s, the Nazi Party realised their social policies with food and shelter for the unemployed and the homeless—who were later recruited into the Brownshirt (SA – Storm Detachments).

Adolf Hitler was impressed by the populist antisemitism and the anti-liberal bourgeois agitation of Karl Lueger, who as the mayor of Vienna during Hitler&#x27;s time in the city, used a rabble-rousing style of oratory that appealed to the wider masses. When asked whether he supported the &quot;bourgeois right-wing&quot;, Hitler claimed that Nazism was not exclusively for any class, and he also indicated that it favored neither the left nor the right, but preserved &quot;pure&quot; elements from both &quot;camps&quot;, stating: &quot;From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism.&quot;

Hitler distrusted capitalism for being unreliable due to its egotism, and he preferred a state-directed economy that is subordinated to the interests of the &quot;Volk&quot;. Hitler told a party leader in 1934, &quot;The economic system of our day is the creation of the Jews.&quot; Hitler said to Benito Mussolini that capitalism had &quot;run its course&quot;. Hitler also said that the business bourgeoisie &quot;know nothing except their profit. &#x27;Fatherland&#x27; is only a word for them.&quot; Hitler was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany during the period of the Weimar Republic, whom he referred to as &quot;cowardly shits&quot;.

===Modern history in Italy===
Because of their ascribed cultural excellence as a social class, the Italian fascist régime (1922–45) of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini regarded the bourgeoisie as an obstacle to modernism. Nonetheless, the Fascist State ideologically exploited the Italian bourgeoisie and their materialistic, middle-class spirit, for the more efficient cultural manipulation of the upper (aristocratic) and the lower (working) classes of Italy.

In 1938, Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech wherein he established a clear ideological distinction between capitalism (the social function of the bourgeoisie) and the bourgeoisie (as a social class), whom he dehumanized by reducing them into high-level abstractions: a moral category and a state of mind. Culturally and philosophically, Mussolini isolated the bourgeoisie from Italian society by portraying them as social parasites upon the fascist Italian state and &quot;The People&quot;; as a social class who drained the human potential of Italian society, in general, and of the working class, in particular; as exploiters who victimized the Italian nation with an approach to life characterized by hedonism and materialism. Nevertheless, despite the slogan &quot;The Fascist Man Disdains the &quot;Comfortable&quot; Life&quot;, which epitomized the anti-bourgeois principle, in its final years of power, for mutual benefit and profit, the Mussolini fascist régime transcended ideology to merge the political and financial interests of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini with the political and financial interests of the bourgeoisie, the Catholic social circles who constituted the ruling class of Italy.

Philosophically, as a materialist creature, the bourgeois man was stereotyped as irreligious; thus, to establish an existential distinction between the supernatural faith of the Roman Catholic Church and the materialist faith of temporal religion; in &quot;The Autarchy of Culture: Intellectuals and Fascism in the 1930s&quot;, the priest Giuseppe Marino said that:

Culturally, the bourgeois man may be considered effeminate, infantile, or acting in a pretentious manner; describing his philistinism in (1939), Roberto Paravese comments on the:

The economic security, financial freedom, and social mobility of the bourgeoisie threatened the philosophic integrity of Italian fascism, the ideological monolith that was the régime of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Any assumption of legitimate political power (government and rule) by the bourgeoisie represented a fascist loss of totalitarian state power for social control through political unity—one people, one nation, and one leader. Sociologically, to the fascist man, to become a bourgeois was a character flaw inherent to the masculine mystique; therefore, the ideology of Italian fascism scornfully defined the bourgeois man as &quot;spiritually castrated&quot;.

==Bourgeois culture==

===Cultural hegemony===
Karl Marx said that the culture of a society is dominated by the mores of the ruling-class, wherein their superimposed value system is abided by each social class (the upper, the middle, the lower) regardless of the socio-economic results it yields to them. In that sense, contemporary societies are bourgeois to the degree that they practice the mores of the small-business &quot;shop culture&quot; of early modern France; which the writer Émile Zola (1840–1902) naturalistically presented, analyzed, and ridiculed in the twenty-two-novel series (1871–1893) about &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot; family; the thematic thrust is the necessity for social progress, by subordinating the economic sphere to the social sphere of life.

===Conspicuous consumption===
The critical analyses of the bourgeois mentality by the German intellectual Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) indicated that the shop culture of the petite bourgeoisie established the sitting room as the center of personal and family life; as such, the English bourgeois culture is, he alleges, a sitting-room culture of prestige through conspicuous consumption. The material culture of the bourgeoisie concentrated on mass-produced luxury goods of high quality; between generations, the only variance was the materials with which the goods were manufactured.

In the early part of the 19th century, the bourgeois house contained a home that first was stocked and decorated with hand-painted porcelain, machine-printed cotton fabrics, machine-printed wallpaper, and Sheffield steel (crucible and stainless). The utility of these things was inherent in their practical functions. By the latter part of the 19th century, the bourgeois house contained a home that had been remodeled by conspicuous consumption. Here, Benjamin argues, the goods were bought to display wealth (discretionary income), rather than for their practical utility. The bourgeoisie had transposed the wares of the shop window to the sitting room, where the clutter of display signaled bourgeois success (see &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;, 1869).

Two spatial constructs manifest the bourgeois mentality: (i) the shop-window display, and (ii) the sitting room. In English, the term &quot;sitting-room culture&quot; is synonymous for &quot;bourgeois mentality&quot;, a &quot;philistine&quot; cultural perspective from the Victorian Era (1837–1901), especially characterized by the repression of emotion and of sexual desire; and by the construction of a regulated social-space where &quot;propriety&quot; is the key personality trait desired in men and women.

Nonetheless, from such a psychologically constricted worldview, regarding the rearing of children, contemporary sociologists claim to have identified &quot;progressive&quot; middle-class values, such as respect for non-conformity, self-direction, autonomy, gender equality, and the encouragement of innovation; as in the Victorian Era, the transposition to the US of the bourgeois system of social values has been identified as a requisite for employment success in the professions. 

Bourgeois values are dependent on rationalism, which began with the economic sphere and moves into every sphere of life which is formulated by Max Weber. The beginning of rationalism is commonly called the Age of Reason. Much like the Marxist critics of that period, Weber was concerned with the growing ability of large corporations and nations to increase their power and reach throughout the world.

==Satire and criticism in art==
Beyond the intellectual realms of political economy, history, and political science that discuss, describe, and analyze the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; as a social class, the colloquial usage of the sociological terms &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;bourgeoise&quot; describe the social stereotypes of the old money and of the , who is a politically timid conformist satisfied with a wealthy, consumerist style of life characterized by conspicuous consumption and the continual striving for prestige. This being the case, the cultures of the world describe the philistinism of the middle-class personality, produced by the excessively rich life of the bourgeoisie, is examined and analyzed in comedic and dramatic plays, novels, and films (see Authenticity).

The term bourgeoisie has been used as a pejorative and a term of abuse since the 19th century, particularly by intellectuals and artists.

===Theater===
 (The Would-be Gentleman, 1670) by Molière (Jean-Baptiste Poquelin), is a comedy-ballet that satirises Monsieur Jourdain, the prototypical nouveau riche man who buys his way up the social-class scale, to realise his aspirations of becoming a gentleman, to which end he studies dancing, fencing, and philosophy, the trappings and accomplishments of a gentleman, to be able to pose as a man of noble birth, someone who, in 17th-century France, was a man to the manor born; Jourdain&#x27;s self-transformation also requires managing the private life of his daughter, so that her marriage can also assist his social ascent.

===Literature===
&quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; (1901), by Thomas Mann (1875–1955), chronicles the moral, intellectual, and physical decay of a rich family through its declines, material and spiritual, in the course of four generations, beginning with the patriarch Johann Buddenbrook Sr. and his son, Johann Buddenbrook Jr., who are typically successful German businessmen; each is a reasonable man of solid character.

Yet, in the children of Buddenbrook Jr., the materially comfortable style of life provided by the dedication to solid, middle-class values elicits decadence: The fickle daughter, Toni, lacks and does not seek a purpose in life; son Christian is honestly decadent, and lives the life of a ne&#x27;er-do-well; and the businessman son, Thomas, who assumes command of the Buddenbrook family fortune, occasionally falters from middle-class solidity by being interested in art and philosophy, the impractical life of the mind, which, to the bourgeoisie, is the epitome of social, moral, and material decadence.

&quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922), by Sinclair Lewis (1885–1951), satirizes the American bourgeois George Follansbee Babbitt, a middle-aged realtor, booster, and joiner in the Midwestern city of Zenith, who – despite being unimaginative, self-important, and hopelessly conformist and middle-class – is aware that there must be more to life than money and the consumption of the best things that money can buy. Nevertheless, he fears being excluded from the mainstream of society more than he does living for himself, by being true to himself – his heart-felt flirtations with independence (dabbling in liberal politics and a love affair with a pretty widow) come to naught because he is existentially afraid.

Yet, George F. Babbitt sublimates his desire for self-respect, and encourages his son to rebel against the conformity that results from bourgeois prosperity, by recommending that he be true to himself:

===Films===
Many of the satirical films by the Spanish film director Luis Buñuel (1900–1983) examine the mental and moral effects of the bourgeois mentality, its culture, and the stylish way of life it provides for its practitioners.

* (&quot;The Golden Age&quot;, 1930) illustrates the madness and self-destructive hypocrisy of bourgeois society.
* (&quot;Beauty of the day&quot;, 1967) tells the story of a bourgeois wife who is bored with her marriage and decides to prostitute herself.
* (&quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot;, 1972) explores the timidity instilled by middle-class values.
* (&quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot;, 1977) illuminates the practical self-deceptions required for buying love as marriage.

<text>Control Data Corporation (CDC) was a mainframe and supercomputer company that in the 1960s was one of the nine major U.S. computer companies, which group included IBM, the Burroughs Corporation, and the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the NCR Corporation (NCR), General Electric, and Honeywell, RCA and UNIVAC. For most of the 1960s, the strength of CDC was the work of the electrical engineer Seymour Cray who developed a series of fast computers, then considered the fastest computing machines in the world; in the 1970s, Cray left the Control Data Corporation and founded Cray Research (CRI) to design and make supercomputers. In 1988, after much financial loss, the Control Data Corporation began withdrawing from making computers and sold the affiliated companies of CDC; in 1992, CDC established Control Data Systems, Inc. The remaining affiliate companies of CDC currently do business as the software company Dayforce.

== Background: World War II – 1957 ==


During World War II the U.S. Navy had built up a classified team of engineers to build codebreaking machinery for both Japanese and German electro-mechanical ciphers. A number of these were produced by a team dedicated to the task working in the Washington, D.C., area. With the post-war wind-down of military spending, the Navy grew increasingly worried that this team would break up and scatter into various companies, and it started looking for ways to keep the code-breaking team together.

Eventually they found their solution: John Parker, the owner of a Chase Aircraft affiliate named Northwestern Aeronautical Corporation located in St. Paul, Minnesota, was about to lose all his contracts due to the ending of the war. The Navy never told Parker exactly what the team did, since it would have taken too long to get top secret clearance. Instead they simply said the team was important, and they would be very happy if he hired them all. Parker was obviously wary, but after several meetings with increasingly high-ranking Naval officers it became apparent that whatever it was, they were serious, and he eventually agreed to give this team a home in his military glider factory.

The result was Engineering Research Associates (ERA). Formed in 1946, this contract engineering company worked on a number of seemingly unrelated projects in the early 1950s. Among these was the ERA Atlas, an early military stored program computer, the basis of the Univac 1101, which was followed by the 1102, and then the 36-bit ERA 1103 (UNIVAC 1103). The Atlas was built for the Navy, which intended to use it in their non-secret code-breaking centers. In the early 1950s a minor political debate broke out in Congress about the Navy essentially &quot;owning&quot; ERA, and the ensuing debates and legal wrangling left the company drained of both capital and spirit. In 1952, Parker sold ERA to Remington Rand.

Although Rand kept the ERA team together and developing new products, it was most interested in ERA&#x27;s magnetic drum memory systems. Rand soon merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. In the process of merging the companies, the ERA division was folded into Sperry&#x27;s UNIVAC division. At first this did not cause too many changes at ERA, since the company was used primarily to provide engineering talent to support a variety of projects. However, one major project was moved from UNIVAC to ERA, the UNIVAC II project, which led to lengthy delays and upsets to nearly everyone involved.

Since the Sperry &quot;big company&quot; mentality encroached on the decision-making powers of the ERA employees, a number left Sperry to form the Control Data Corp. in September 1957, setting up shop in an old warehouse across the river from Sperry&#x27;s St. Paul laboratory, in Minneapolis at 501 Park Avenue. Of the members forming CDC, William Norris was the unanimous choice to become the chief executive officer of the new company. Seymour Cray soon became the chief designer, though at the time of CDC&#x27;s formation he was still in the process of completing a prototype for the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), and he did not leave Sperry to join CDC until it was complete. The M-460 was Seymour&#x27;s first transistor computer, though the power supply rectifiers were still tubes.

== Early designs and Cray&#x27;s big plan ==
CDC started business by selling subsystems, mostly drum memory systems, to other companies. Cray joined the next year, and he immediately built a small transistor-based 6-bit machine known as the &quot;CDC Little Character&quot; to test his ideas on large-system design and transistor-based machines. &quot;Little Character&quot; was a great success.

In 1959, CDC released a 48-bit transistorized version of their re-design of the 1103 re-design under the name CDC 1604; the first machine was delivered to the U.S. Navy in 1960 at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Legend has it that the 1604 designation was chosen by adding CDC&#x27;s first street address (501 Park Avenue) to Cray&#x27;s former project, the ERA-Univac 1103.

A 12-bit cut-down version was also released as the CDC 160A in 1960, often considered among the first minicomputers. The 160A was particularly notable as it was built as a standard office desk, which was unusual packaging for that era. New versions of the basic 1604 architecture were rebuilt into the CDC 3000 series, which sold through the early and mid-1960s.

Cray immediately turned to the design of a machine that would be the fastest (or in the terminology of the day, largest) machine in the world, setting the goal at 50 times the speed of the 1604. This required radical changes in design, and as the project &quot;dragged on&quot; — it had gone on for about four years by then — the management got increasingly upset and it demanded greater oversight. Cray in turn demanded (in 1962) to have his own remote lab, saying that otherwise, he would quit. Norris agreed, and Cray and his team moved to Cray&#x27;s home town, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Not even Bill Norris, the founder and president of CDC, could visit Cray&#x27;s laboratory without an invitation.

== Peripherals business ==
In the early 1960s, the corporation moved to the Highland Park neighborhood of St. Paul where Norris lived. Through this period, Norris became increasingly worried that CDC had to develop a &quot;critical mass&quot; to compete with IBM. To do this, he started an aggressive program of buying up various companies to round out CDC&#x27;s peripheral lineup. In general, they tried to offer a product to compete with any of IBM&#x27;s, but running 10% faster and costing 10% less. This was not always easy to achieve.

One of its first peripherals was a tape transport, which led to some internal wrangling as the Peripherals Equipment Division attempted to find a reasonable way to charge other divisions of the company for supplying the devices. If the division simply &quot;gave&quot; them away at cost as part of a system purchase, they would never have a real budget of their own. Instead, a plan was established in which it would share profits with the divisions selling its peripherals, a plan eventually used throughout the company.

The tape transport was followed by the &quot;405 Card Reader&quot; and the &quot;415 Card Punch&quot;, followed by a series of tape drives and drum printers, all of which were designed in-house. The printer business was initially supported by Holley Carburetor in the Rochester, Michigan suburb outside of Detroit. They later formalized this by creating a jointly held company, Holley Computer Products. Holley later sold its stake back to CDC, the remainder becoming the Rochester Division.

Train printers and band printers in Rochester were developed in a joint venture with NCR and ICL, with CDC holding controlling interest. This joint venture was known as Computer Peripherals, Inc. (CPI). In the early 80s, it was merged with dot matrix computer printer manufacturer Centronics.

Norris was particularly interested in breaking out of the punched card–based workflow, where IBM held a stranglehold. He eventually decided to buy Rabinow Engineering, one of the pioneers of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. The idea was to bypass the entire punched card stage by having the operators simply type onto normal paper pages with an OCR-friendly typewriter font, and then submit those pages to the computer. Since a typewritten page contains much more information than a punched card (which has essentially one line of text from a page), this would offer savings all around. This seemingly simple task turned out to be much harder than anyone expected, and while CDC became a major player in the early days of OCR systems, OCR has remained a niche product to this day. Rabinow&#x27;s plant in Rockville, MD was closed in 1976, and CDC left the business.

With the continued delays on the OCR project, it became clear that punched cards were not going to go away any time soon, and CDC had to address this as quickly as possible. Although the 405 remained in production, it was an expensive machine to build. So another purchase was made, Bridge Engineering, which offered a line of lower-cost as well as higher-speed card punches. All card-handling products were moved to what became the Valley Forge Division after Bridge moved to a new factory, with the tape transports to follow. Later, the Valley Forge and Rochester divisions were spun off to form a new joint company with National Cash Register (later NCR Corporation), Computer Peripherals Inc (CPI), to share development and production costs across the two companies. ICL later joined the effort. Eventually the Rochester Division was sold to Centronics in 1982.

Another side effect of Norris&#x27;s attempts to diversify was the creation of a number of service bureaus that ran jobs on behalf of smaller companies that could not afford to buy computers. This was never very profitable, and in 1965, several managers suggested that the unprofitable centers be closed in a cost-cutting measure. Nevertheless, Norris was so convinced of the idea that he refused to accept this, and ordered an across-the-board &quot;belt tightening&quot; instead.

== Control Data Institute ==
Control Data created an international technical/computer vocational school from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s. By the late 1970s there were sixty-nine learning centers worldwide, serving 18,000 students.

== CDC 6600: defining supercomputing ==

Meanwhile, at the new Chippewa Falls lab, Seymour Cray, Jim Thornton, and Dean Roush put together a team of 34 engineers, which continued work on the new computer design. One of the ways they hoped to improve the CDC 1604 was to use better transistors, and Cray used the new silicon transistors using the planar process, developed by Fairchild Semiconductor. These were much faster than the germanium transistors in the 1604, without the drawbacks of the older mesa silicon transistors. The speed of light restriction forced a more compact design with refrigeration designed by Dean Roush. In 1964, the resulting computer was released onto the market as the CDC 6600, out-performing everything on the market by roughly ten times. When it sold over 100 units at $8 million ($ million in dollars) each; it was considered a supercomputer.

The 6600 had a 100ns, transistor-based CPU (Central Processing Unit) with multiple asynchronous functional units, using 10 logical, external I/O processors to off-load many common tasks and core memory. That way, the CPU could devote all of its time and circuitry to processing actual data, while the other controllers dealt with the mundane tasks like punching cards and running disk drives. Using late-model compilers, the machine attained a standard mathematical operations rate of 500 kiloFLOPS, but handcrafted assembly managed to deliver approximately 1 megaFLOPS. A simpler, albeit much slower and less expensive version, implemented using a more traditional serial processor design rather than the 6600&#x27;s parallel functional units, was released as the CDC 6400, and a two-processor version of the 6400 is called the CDC 6500.

A FORTRAN compiler, known as MNF (Minnesota FORTRAN), was developed by Lawrence A. Liddiard and E. James Mundstock at the University of Minnesota for the 6600.

After the delivery of the 6600 IBM took notice of this new company. In 1965 IBM started an effort to build a machine that would be faster than the 6600, the ACS-1. Two hundred people were gathered on the U.S. West Coast to work on the project, away from corporate prodding, in an attempt to mirror Cray&#x27;s off-site lab. The project produced interesting computer architecture and technology, but it was not compatible with IBM&#x27;s hugely successful System/360 line of computers. The engineers were directed to make it 360-compatible, but that compromised its performance. The ACS was canceled in 1969, without ever being produced for customers. Many of the engineers left the company, leading to a brain-drain in IBM&#x27;s high-performance departments.

In the meantime, IBM announced a new System/360 model, the Model 92, which would be just as fast as CDC&#x27;s 6600. Although this machine did not exist, sales of the 6600 dropped drastically while people waited for the release of the mythical Model 92. Norris did not take this tactic, dubbed as fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), lying down, and in an extensive antitrust lawsuit launched against IBM a year later, he eventually won a settlement valued at $80 million. As part of the settlement, he picked up IBM&#x27;s subsidiary, Service Bureau Corporation (SBC), which ran computer processing for other corporations on its own computers. SBC fitted nicely into CDC&#x27;s existing service bureau offerings.

During the designing of the 6600, CDC had set up &quot;Project SPIN&quot; to supply the system with a high speed hard disk memory system. At the time it was unclear if disks would replace magnetic memory drums, or whether fixed or removable disks would become the more prevalent. SPIN explored all of these approaches, and eventually delivered a 28&quot; diameter fixed disk and a smaller multi-platter 14&quot; removable disk-pack system. Over time, the hard disk business pioneered in SPIN became a major product line.

== CDC 7600 and 8600 ==

In the same month it won its lawsuit against IBM, CDC announced its new computer, the CDC 7600 (previously referred to as the 6800 within CDC). This machine&#x27;s hardware clock speed was almost four times that of the 6600 (36 MHz vs. 10 MHz), with a 27.5 ns clock cycle, and it offered considerably more than four times the total throughput, with much of the speed increase coming from extensive use of pipelining.

The 7600 did not sell well because it was introduced during the 1969 downturn in the U.S. national economy. Its complexity had led to poor reliability. The machine was not totally compatible with the 6000-series and required a completely different operating system, which like most new OSs, was primitive. The 7600 project paid for itself, but damaged CDC&#x27;s reputation. The 7600 memory had a split primary- and secondary-memory which required user management but was more than fast enough to make it the fastest uniprocessor from 1969 to 1976. A few dozen 7600s were the computers of choice at supercomputer centers around the world.

Cray then turned to the design of the CDC 8600. This design included four 7600-like processors in a single, smaller case. The smaller size and shorter signal paths allowed the 8600 to run at much higher clock speeds which, together with faster memory, provided most of the performance gains. The 8600, however, belonged to the &quot;old school&quot; in terms of its physical construction, and it used individual components soldered to circuit boards. The design was so compact that cooling the CPU modules proved effectively impossible, and access for maintenance difficult. An abundance of hot-running solder joints ensured that the machines did not work reliably; Cray recognized that a re-design was needed.

== The STAR and the Cyber ==
In addition to the redesign of the 8600, CDC had another project called the CDC STAR-100 under way, led by Cray&#x27;s former collaborator on the 6600/7600, Jim Thornton. Unlike the 8600&#x27;s &quot;four computers in one box&quot; solution to the speed problem, the STAR was a new design using a unit that we know today as the vector processor. By highly pipelining mathematical instructions with purpose-built instructions and hardware, mathematical processing is dramatically improved in a machine that was otherwise slower than a 7600. Although the particular set of problems it would be best at solving was limited compared to the general-purpose 7600, it was for solving exactly these problems that customers would buy CDC machines.

Since these two projects competed for limited funds during the late 1960s, Norris felt that the company could not support simultaneous development of the STAR and a complete redesign of the 8600. Therefore, Cray left CDC to form the Cray Research company in 1972. Norris remained, however, a staunch supporter of Cray, and invested money into Cray&#x27;s new company. In 1974 CDC released the STAR, designated as the Cyber 203. It turned out to have &quot;real world&quot; performance that was considerably worse than expected. STAR&#x27;s chief designer, Jim Thornton, then left CDC to form the Network Systems Corporation.

In 1975, a STAR-100 was placed into service in a Control Data service center which was considered the first supercomputer in a data center. Founder William C. Norris presided at the podium for the press conference announcing the new service. Publicity was a key factor in making the announcement a success by coordinating the event with Guinness; thus, establishing the Star-100 as &quot;The most powerful and fastest computer&quot; which was published in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. The late Duane Andrews, Public Relations, was responsible for coordinating this event. Andrews successfully attracted many influential editors including the research editor at Business Week who chronicled this publicity release &quot;... as the most exciting public event he attended in 20 years&quot;. Sharing the podium were William C. Norris, Boyd Jones V.P. and S. Steve Adkins, Data Center Manager. It was extremely rare for Bill Norris to take the podium being a very private individual. Also, during the lunch at a local country club, Norris signed a huge stack of certificates attesting to the record which were printed by the Star 100 on printer paper produced in our Lincoln, Nebraska plant. The paper included a half-tone photo of the Star 100. The main customers of the STAR-100 data center were oil companies running oil reservoir simulations. Most notably was the simulation controlled from a terminal in Texas which solved oil extraction simulations for oil fields in Kuwait. A front page &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; news article resulted in acquiring a new user, Allis-Chalmers, for simulation of a damaged hydroelectric turbine in a Norwegian mountain hydropower plant.

A variety of systems based on the basic 6600/7600 architecture were repackaged in different price/performance categories of the CDC Cyber, which became CDC&#x27;s main product line in the 1970s. An updated version of the STAR architecture, the Cyber 205, had considerably better performance than the original. By this time, however, Cray&#x27;s own designs, like the Cray-1, were using the same basic design techniques as the STAR, but were computing much faster. The Star 100 was able to process vectors up to 64K (65536) elements, versus 64 elements for the Cray-1, but the Star 100 took much longer for initiating the operation so the Cray-1 outperformed with short vectors.

Sales of the STAR were weak, but Control Data Corp. produced a successor system, the Cyber 200/205, that gave Cray Research some competition. CDC also embarked on a number of special projects for its clients, who produced an even smaller number of black project computers. The CDC Advanced Flexible Processor (AFP), also known as CYBER PLUS, was one such machine.

Another design direction was the &quot;Cyber 80&quot; project, which was aimed at release in 1980. This machine could run old 6600-style programs, and also had a completely new 64-bit architecture. The concept behind Cyber 80 was that current 6000-series users would migrate to these machines with relative ease. The design and debugging of these machines went on past 1980, and the machines were eventually released under other names.

CDC was also attempting to diversify its revenue from hardware into services and this included its promotion of the PLATO computer-aided learning system, which ran on Cyber hardware and incorporated many early computer interface innovations including bit-mapped touchscreen terminals.

== Magnetic Peripherals Inc. ==

Meanwhile, several very large Japanese manufacturing firms were entering the market. The supercomputer market was too small to support more than a handful of companies, so CDC started looking for other markets. One of these was the hard disk drive (HDD) market.

Magnetic Peripherals Inc., later Imprimis Technology, was originally a joint venture with Honeywell formed in 1975 to manufacture HDDs for both companies. CII-Honeywell Bull later purchased a 3 percent interest in MPI from Honeywell. Sperry became a partner in 1983 with 17 percent, making the ownership split CDC (67%) and Honeywell (17%). MPI was a captive supplier to its parents. It sold on an OEM basis only to them, while CDC sold MPI product to third parties under its brand name.

It became a major player in the HDD market. It was the worldwide leader in 14-inch disk drive technology in the OEM marketplace in the late 1970s and early 1980s especially with its SMD (Storage Module Device) and CMD (Cartridge Module Drive), with its plant at Brynmawr in the South Wales valleys running 24/7 production. The Magnetic Peripherals division in Brynmawr had produced 1 million disks and 3 million magnetic tapes by October 1979. CDC was an early developer of the eight-inch drive technology with products from its MPI Oklahoma City Operation. Its CDC Wren series drives were particularly popular with high end users, although it was behind the capacity growth and performance curves of numerous startups such as Micropolis, Atasi, Maxtor, and Quantum. CDC also co-developed the now universal Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) interface with Compaq and Western Digital, which was aimed at lowering the cost of adding low-performance drives.

CDC founded a separate division called Rigidyne in Simi Valley, California, to develop 3.5-inch drives using technology from the Wren series. These were marketed by CDC as the &quot;Swift&quot; series, and were among the first high-performance 3.5-inch drives on the market at their introduction in 1987.

In September 1988, CDC merged Rigidyne and MPI into the umbrella subsidiary of Imprimis Technology. The next year, Seagate Technology purchased Imprimis for $250 million in cash, 10.7 million in Seagate stock and a $50 million promissory note.

==Investments==
Control Data held interests in other companies including computer research company Arbitron, Commercial Credit Corporation and Ticketron.
=== Commercial Credit Corporation ===
In 1968, Commercial Credit Corporation was the target of a hostile takeover by Loews Inc. Loews had acquired nearly 10% of CCC, which it intended to break up on acquisition. To avoid the takeover, CCC forged a deal with CDC lending them the money to purchase control in CCC instead, and &quot;That is how a computer company came to own a fleet of fishing boats in the Chesapeake Bay.&quot; By the 1980s, Control Data entered an unstable period, which resulted in the company liquidating many of their assets. In 1986, Sandy Weill convinced the Control Data management to spin off their Commercial Credit subsidiary to prevent the company&#x27;s potential liquidation. Over a period of years, Weill used Commercial Credit to build an empire that became Citigroup. In 1999, Commercial Credit was renamed CitiFinancial, and in 2011, the full-service network of US CitiFinancial branches were renamed OneMain Financial.
===Ticketron===

In 1969, Control Data acquired 51% of Ticketron for $3.9 million from Cemp Investments. In 1970, Ticketron became the sole computerized ticketing provider in the United States. In 1973, Control Data increased the size of its investment.

Ticketron also provided ticketing terminals and back-end infrastructure for parimutuel betting, and provided similar services for a number of US lotteries, including those in New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington and Maryland.

By the mid 1980s, Ticketron was CDC&#x27;s most profitable business with revenue of $120 million and CDC, which was loss-making at the time, considered selling the business. In 1990 the majority of Ticketron&#x27;s assets and business, with the exception of a small antitrust carve-out for Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Telecharge&quot; business-unit, were bought by The Carlyle Group who sold it the following year to rival Ticketmaster.

== ETA Systems, wind-down and sale of assets ==
CDC decided to fight for the high-performance niche, but Norris considered that the company had become moribund and unable to quickly design competitive machines. In 1983 he set up a spinoff company, ETA Systems, whose design goal was a machine processing data at 10 GFLOPs, about 40 times the speed of the Cray-1. The design never fully matured, and it was unable to reach its goals. Nevertheless, the product was one of the fastest computers on the market, and 7 liquid nitrogen-cooled and 27 smaller air cooled versions of the computers were sold during the next few years. They used the new CMOS chips, which produced much less heat. The effort ended after half-hearted attempts to sell ETA Systems. In 1989, most of the employees of ETA Systems were laid off, and the remaining ones were folded into CDC.

Despite having valuable technology, CDC still suffered huge losses in 1985 ($567 million) and 1986 while attempting to reorganize. As a result, in 1987 it sold its PathLab Laboratory Information System to 3M. While CDC was still making computers, it was decided that hardware manufacturing was no longer as profitable as it used to be, and so in 1988 it was decided to leave the industry, bit by bit. The first division to go was Imprimis. After that, CDC sold other assets such as VTC (a chip maker that specialized in mass-storage circuitry and was closely linked with MPI), and non-computer-related assets like Ticketron. 

In 1992, the company separated into two independent companies – the computer businesses were spun out as Control Data Systems, Inc. (CDS), while the information service businesses became the Ceridian Corporation. 

CDS later became owner of ICEM Technologies, makers of ICEM DDN and ICEM Surf software and sold the business to PTC for $40.6m in 1998. In 1999, CDS was bought out by Syntegra, a subsidiary of the BT Group, and merged into BT&#x27;s Global Services organization.

Ceridian continues as a successful outsourced IT company focusing on human resources. CDC&#x27;s Energy Management Division, was one of its most successful business units, providing control systems solutions that managed as much as 25% of all electricity on the planet, and went to Ceridian in the split. This division was renamed Empros and was sold to Siemens in 1993. In 1997, General Dynamics acquired the Computing Devices International Division of Ceridian, which was a defense electronics and systems integration business headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota – originally Control Data&#x27;s Government Systems Division. 

In March 2001, Ceridian separated into two independent companies, with the old Ceridian Corporation renamed itself to Arbitron Inc. and the rest of the company (consisting of human resources services and Comdata business) took the Ceridian Corporation name. Ceridian was later split again in 2013, with formation of Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. (human resources services) and Comdata Inc. (payments business), marking the end of CDC assets split for good.

Note: The 8xx &amp; 9xx Cyber models, introduced beginning in 1982, formed the 64-bit Cyber 180 series, and their Peripheral Processors (PPs) were 16-bit. The 180 series had virtual memory capability, using CDC&#x27;s NOS/VE operating system.The more complete nomenclature for these was 180/xxx, although at times the shorter form (e.g. Cyber 990) was used.

==Peripheral Systems Group==
Control Data Corporation&#x27;s Peripheral Systems Group was both a hardware and a software development unit that functioned in the 1970s and 1980s.

Their services including development and marketing of IBM-oriented (operating) systems software. One of the Peripheral Systems Group&#x27;s software products was named CUPID, &quot;Control Data&#x27;s Program for Unlike Data Set Concatenation.&quot; Its focus was for customers of IBM&#x27;s MVS operating system, and the intended audience was systems programmers. The product&#x27;s General Information and Reference Manual included SysGen-like options and information about internal
user-accessible control blocks.

* &quot;The Adolescence of P-1&quot; (1977), by Thomas Ryan – Control Data computers were very enticing to young P-1.
* &quot;The New Avengers&quot; – In episode 2-10 (#23) (&quot;Complex&quot;, 1977) Purdey uses a CDC card reader.
* &quot;Mi-Sex – Computer Games&quot;: 1979 pop music video. The band enters the computer room in the Control Data North Sydney building and proceeds to play with CDC equipment.
* &quot;Tron&quot; (1982) – In the wide screen version of the film, when Flynn and Lora sneak into Encom, a CDC 7600 is visible in the background, alongside a Cray-1. This scene was shot at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) – The computer room shot up by one of the terrorists contained a number of working Cyber 180 computers and a mock-up of an ETA-10 supercomputer, along with a number of other peripheral devices, all provided by CDC Demonstration Services/Benchmark Lab. This equipment was requested on short notice after another computer manufacturer backed out at the last minute. Paul Derby, manager of the Benchmark Lab, arranged to send two van-loads of equipment to Hollywood for the shoot, accompanied by Jerry Sterns of the Benchmark Lab who supervised the equipment while it was on the set. After the machines were returned to Minnesota, they were inspected and tested, and as each machine was sold, a notation was made in the corporate records that the machine had appeared in the film.
* &quot;They Live&quot; (1988), by John Carpenter – As Roddy Piper&#x27;s character is trying on his new &quot;sunglasses&quot; that allow him to see the world as it is, he looks at an advertisement for Control Data Corporation and sees the word OBEY.

<text>The Chemehuevi ( ) are an indigenous people of the Great Basin. They are the southernmost branch of Southern Paiute. Today, Chemehuevi people are enrolled in the following federally recognized tribes:

* Colorado River Indian Tribes
* Chemehuevi Indian Tribe of the Chemehuevi Reservation
* Morongo Band of Mission Indians
* Cabazon Band of Mission Indians
* Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians
* Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians
* Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California

Some Chemehuevi are also part of the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians, whose members are mostly &quot;Sovovatum&quot; or &quot;Soboba band&quot; members of Cahuilla and Luiseño people.

==Name==
&quot;Chemehuevi&quot; has multiple interpretations. It is considered to either be a Mojave term meaning &quot;those who play with fish;&quot; or a Quechan word meaning &quot;nose-in-the-air-like-a-roadrunner.&quot; The Chemehuevi call themselves &quot;Nüwüvi&quot; (&quot;The People&quot;, singular &quot;Nüwü&quot;) or &quot;Tantáwats&quot;, meaning &quot;Southern Men.&quot; Alternate spellings of Chemehuevi include Chemeguab and Chemegueb.

==Language==
Their language, Chemehuevi, is a Colorado River Numic language, in the Numic language branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. First transcribed by John P. Harrington and Carobeth Laird in the early 20th century, it was studied in the 1970s by linguist Margaret L. Press. whose field notes and extensive sound recordings remain available. The language is now near extinction; during the filming of Ironbound Films&#x27; 2008 American documentary film &quot;The Linguists&quot;, linguists Greg Anderson and K. David Harrison interviewed and recorded one of the last 3 remaining speakers.

In 2015, the Siwavaats Junior College in Havasu Lake, California, was established to teach children the language. A Chemehuevi dictionary with 2,500 words was expected to become available in 2016.

==History and traditional culture==

The Chemehuevi were originally a desert tribe among the Southern Paiute group. Post-contact, they lived primarily in the eastern Mojave Desert and later Cottonwood Island in Nevada and the Chemehuevi Valley along the Colorado River in California. They were a nomadic people living in small groups given the sparse resources available in the desert environment. Carobeth Laird indicates their traditional territory spanned the High Desert from the Colorado River on the east to the Tehachapi Mountains on the west and from the Las Vegas area and Death Valley on the north to the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains in the south. They are most closely identified as among the Great Basin Indians. Among others they are cousins of the Kawaiisu.

The most comprehensive collection of Chemehuevi history, culture and mythology was gathered by Carobeth Laird (1895–1983) and her second husband, George Laird, one of the last Chemehuevi to have been raised in the traditional culture. Carobeth Laird, a linguist and ethnographer, wrote a comprehensive account of the culture and language as George Laird remembered it, and published their collaborative efforts in her 1976 &quot;The Chemehuevis&quot;, the first – and, to date, only – ethnography of the Chemehuevi traditional culture.

Describing the Chemehuevi as she knew them, and presenting the texture of traditional life amongst the people, Carobeth Laird writes:

The Chemehuevi character is made up of polarities which are complementary rather than contradictory. They are loquacious yet capable of silence; gregarious yet so close to the earth that single families or even men alone might live and travel for long periods away from other human beings; proud, yet capable of a gentle self-ridicule. They are conservative to a degree, yet insatiably curious and ready to inquire into and even to adopt new ways: to visit all tribes, whether friends or enemies; to speak strange tongues, sing strange songs, and marry strange wives.The Chemehuevi made intricately coiled baskets using a three-rod foundation of willow. Traditionally, the majority of weaving was completed with split willow, and darker patterns were made with devil&#x27;s claw and yucca, among other materials. This traditional style of basketmaking is currently practiced by a small group of weavers.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the combined 1770 population of the Chemehuevi, Koso, and Kawaiisu as 1,500. The combined estimate in 1910 dropped to 500. An Indian agent reported the Chemehuevi population in 1875 to be 350. Kroeber estimated U.S. census data put the Chemehuevi population in 1910 as 355. Population as of 2016 is in the thousands.

==Bands==
* Howaits (Hokwaits, lived in the Ivanpah Mountains, called Ivanpah Mountain Group)
* Kauyaichits (lived in the area of Ash Meadows, called Ash Meadows Group)
* Mokwats (lived in the Kingston Mountains, called Kingston Mountain Group)
* Moviats (Movweats, lived on Cottonwood Island, called Cottonwood Island Group)
* Palonies ( &quot;the bald-headed&quot;, traveled to the area north of Los Angeles)
* Shivawach (one group of them lived at Twentynine Palms, the second one in Chemehuevi Valley)
* Tümplsagavatsits (Timpashauwagotsits, lived in the Providence Mountains, therefore called Providence Mountain Group)
* Yagats (lived in the Amargosa Valley and along the Amargosa River, called Amargosa River Group)

<text>The Hopi are Native Americans who primarily live in northeastern Arizona. The majority are enrolled in the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and live on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona; however, some Hopi people are enrolled in the Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation at the border of Arizona and California.

The 2010 U.S. census states that about 19,338 US citizens self-identify as being Hopi.

The Hopi language belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family.

The primary meaning of the word &quot;Hopi&quot; is &quot;behaving one, one who is mannered, civilized, peaceable, polite, who adheres to the Hopi Way.&quot; Some sources contrast this to other warring tribes that subsist on plunder. &quot;Hopi&quot; is a concept deeply rooted in the culture&#x27;s religion, spirituality, and its view of morality and ethics. To be Hopi is to strive toward this concept, which involves a state of total reverence for all things, peace with these things, and life in accordance with the instructions of Maasaw, the Creator or Caretaker of Earth. The Hopi observe their religious ceremonies for the benefit of the entire world.

Hopi organize themselves into matrilineal clans. Children are born into the clan of their mother. Clans extend across all villages. Children are named by the women of the father&#x27;s clan. After the child is introduced to the Sun, the women of the paternal clan gather, and name the child in honor of the father&#x27;s clan. Children can be given over 40 names. The village members decide the common name. Current practice is to use a non-Hopi or English name or the parent&#x27;s chosen Hopi name. A person may also change the name upon initiation to traditional religious societies, or a major life event.

The Hopi understand their land to be sacred and understand their role as caretakers of the land that they inherited from their ancestors. Agriculture is significant to their lifeways and economy. Precontact architecture reflects early Hopi society and perceptions of home and family. Many Hopi homes share traits of neighboring Pueblo tribes. Early communal structures, especially Pueblo Great Houses, include living rooms, storage rooms, and religious sanctuaries, called kivas. Each of these rooms allowed for specific activities.

The Hopi encountered Spaniards in the 16th century, and are historically referred to as Pueblo people, because they lived in villages (&quot;pueblos&quot; in the Spanish language). The Hopi are thought to be descended from the Ancestral Pueblo people (Hopi: &quot;Hisatsinom&quot;), who constructed large apartment-house complexes and had an advanced culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States, comprising southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado. It is thought that Hopi people descend from those 
Ancestral Puebloan settlements along the Mogollon Rim of northern Arizona.

Hopi villages are now located atop mesas in northern Arizona. The Hopi originally settled near the foot of the mesas but in the course of the 17th century moved to the mesa tops for protection from the Utes, Apaches, and Spanish.

On December 16, 1882, President Chester A. Arthur passed an executive order creating an Indian reservation for the Hopi. It was smaller than the surrounding land that was annexed by the Navajo Reservation, which is the largest reservation in the country.

As of 2005 the Hopi Reservation is entirely surrounded by the much larger Navajo Reservation. As the result of land disputes from 1940 to 1970 or earlier, the two nations used to share the government designated &quot;Navajo–Hopi Joint Use Area&quot;, but this continued to be a source of conflict. The partition of this area, commonly known as Big Mountain, by Acts of Congress in 1974 and 1996, but as of 2008 has also resulted in long-term controversy.

On October 24, 1936, the Hopi Tribe ratified its constitution, creating a unicameral government where all powers are vested in a Tribal Council. The powers of the executive branch (chairman and vice chairman) and judicial branch, are limited. The traditional powers and authority of the Hopi Villages were preserved in the 1936 Constitution.

== Oraibi ==
Old Oraibi is one of four original Hopi villages. It was founded before A.D. 1100 and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited villages within the territory of the United States. In the 1540s the village was recorded as having 1,500– 3,000 residents.

==Early European contact, 1540–1680==

The first recorded European contact with the Hopi was by the Spanish in 1540. Spanish General Francisco Vásquez de Coronado went to North America to explore the land. While at the Zuni villages, he learned of the Hopi tribe. Coronado dispatched Pedro de Tovar and other members of their party to find the Hopi villages. The Spanish wrote that the first Hopi village they visited was Awatovi. They noted that there were about 16,000 Hopi and Zuni people. A few years later, the Spanish explorer García López de Cárdenas investigated the Rio Grande and met the Hopi. They warmly entertained Cardenas and his men and directed him on his journey.

In 1582–1583 the Hopi were visited by Antonio de Espejo&#x27;s expedition. He noted that there were five Hopi villages and around 12,000 Hopi people. During that period the Spanish explored and colonized the southwestern region of the New World, but never sent many forces or settlers to the Hopi country. Their visits to the Hopi were random and spread out over many years. Many times the visits were from military explorations.

The Spanish colonized near the Rio Grande and, because the Hopi did not live near rivers that gave access to the Rio Grande, the Spanish never left any troops on their land. The Spanish were accompanied by missionaries, Catholic friars. Beginning in 1629, with the arrival of 30 friars in Hopi country, the Franciscan Period started. The Franciscans had missionaries assigned and built a church at Awatovi.

==Pueblo Revolt of 1680==
Spanish Franciscan priests were only marginally successful in converting the Hopi and persecuted them for adhering to Hopi religious practices. The Spanish occupiers enslaved the Hopi populace, forcing them to labor and hand over goods and crops. Spanish oppression and attempts to convert the Hopi caused the Hopi over time to become increasingly intolerant towards their occupiers. The documentary record shows evidence of Spanish abuses. In 1655, a Franciscan priest by the name of Salvador de Guerra beat to death a Hopi man named Juan Cuna. As punishment, Guerra was removed from his post on the Hopi mesas and sent to Mexico City. In 1656, a young Hopi man by the name of Juan Suñi was sent to Santa Fe as an indentured servant because he impersonated the resident priest Alonso de Posada at Awatovi, an act believed to have been carried out in the spirit of Hopi clowning. During the period of Franciscan missionary presence (1629–1680), the only significant conversions took place at the pueblo of Awatovi. In the 1670s, the Rio Grande Pueblo Indians put forward the suggestion to revolt in 1680 and garnered Hopi support.

The Pueblo Revolt was the first time that diverse Pueblo groups had worked in unison to drive out the Spanish colonists. In the Burning of Awatovi, Spanish soldiers, local Catholic Church missionaries, friars, and priests were all put to death, and the churches and mission buildings were dismantled stone by stone. It took two decades for the Spanish to reassert their control over the Rio Grande Pueblos but the Catholic Inquisition never made it back to Hopiland. In 1700, the Spanish friars had begun rebuilding a smaller church at Awatovi. During the winter of 1700–01, teams of men from the other Hopi villages sacked Awatovi at the request of the village chief, killed all the men of the village, and removed the women and children to other Hopi villages, then completely destroyed the village and burned it to the ground. Thereafter, despite intermittent attempts during the 18th century, the Spanish never re-established a presence in Hopi country.

== Hopi-U.S. relations, 1849–1946 ==

In 1849, James S. Calhoun was appointed official Indian agent of Indian Affairs for the Southwest Territory of the U.S. He had headquarters in Santa Fe and was responsible for all of the Indian residents of the area. The first formal meeting between the Hopi and the U.S. government occurred in 1850 when seven Hopi leaders made the trip to Santa Fe to meet with Calhoun. They wanted the government to provide protection against the Navajo, a Southern Athabascan-speaking tribe who were distinct from Apaches. At this time, the Hopi leader was Nakwaiyamtewa.

The US established Fort Defiance in 1851 in Arizona, and placed troops in Navajo country to deal with their threats to the Hopi. General James J. Carleton, with the assistance of Kit Carson, was assigned to travel through the area. They &quot;captured&quot; the Navajo natives and forced them to the fort. As a result of the Long Walk of the Navajo, the Hopi enjoyed a short period of peace.

In 1847, Mormons settled in Utah and tried to convert the Indians to Mormonism. Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary, first made a trip into Hopi country in 1858. He was on good terms with the Hopi Indians, and in 1875 an LDS Church was built on Hopi land.

===Education===
In 1875, the English trader Thomas Keam escorted Hopi leaders to meet President Chester A. Arthur in Washington D.C. &quot;Loololma,&quot; village chief of Oraibi at the time, was very impressed with Washington. In 1887, a federal boarding school was established at Keams Canyon for Hopi children.

The Oraibi people did not support the school and refused to send their children from their villages. The Keams Canyon School was organized to teach the Hopi youth the ways of European-American civilization. It forced them to use English and give up their traditional ways. The children were made to abandon their tribal identity and completely take on European-American culture. Children were forced to give up their traditional names, clothing and language. Boys, who were also forced to cut their long hair, were taught European farming and carpentry skills. Girls were taught ironing, sewing, and &quot;civilized&quot; dining. The school also reinforced European-American religions. The American Baptist Home Mission Society made students attend services every morning and religious teachings during the week. In 1890, Commissioner of Indian Affairs Thomas Jefferson Morgan arrived in Hopi country with other government officials to review the progress of the new school. Seeing that few students were enrolled, they returned with federal troops who threatened to arrest the Hopi parents who refused to send their children to school, with Morgan forcibly taking children to fill the school.

===Hopi land===

Agriculture is an important part of Hopi culture, and their villages are spread out across the northern part of Arizona. The Hopi and the Navajo did not have a conception of land being bounded and divided. The Hopi people had settled in permanent villages, while the nomadic Navajo people moved around the four corners. Both lived on the land that their ancestors did. On December 16, 1882, President Chester A. Arthur issued an executive order creating a reservation for the Hopi. It was smaller than the Navajo Reservation, which was the largest in the country.

The Hopi reservation was originally a rectangle 55 by 70 miles (88.5 by 110 km) in the middle of the Navajo Reservation, with their village lands taking about half of the land. The reservation prevented encroachment by white settlers, but it did not protect the Hopis against the Navajos.

The Hopi and the Navajo fought over land, and they had different models of sustainability, as the Navajo were sheepherders. Eventually the Hopi went before the Senate Committee of Interior and Insular Affairs to ask them to help provide a solution to the dispute. The tribes argued over approximately of land in northern Arizona. In 1887 the U.S. government passed the Dawes Allotment Act. The purpose was to divide up communal tribal land into individual allotments by household, to encourage a model of European-American style subsistence farming on individually owned family plots of or less. The Department of Interior would declare remaining land &quot;surplus&quot; to the tribe&#x27;s needs and make it available for purchase by U.S. citizens. For the Hopi, the Act would destroy their ability to farm, their main means of income. The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not set up land allotments in the Southwest.

===Oraibi split===
The chief of the Oraibi, Lololoma, enthusiastically supported Hopi education, but his people were divided on this issue. Most of the village was conservative and refused to allow their children to attend school. These natives were referred to as &quot;hostiles&quot; because they opposed the American government and its attempts to force assimilation. The rest of the Oraibi were called &quot;friendlies&quot; because of their acceptance of white people and culture. The &quot;hostiles&quot; refused to let their children attend school. In 1893, the Oraibi Day School was opened in the Oraibi village. Although the school was in the village, traditional parents still refused to allow their children to attend. Frustrated with this, the US government often resorted to intimidation and force in the form of imprisonment as a means of punishment.

In November 1894, Captain Frank Robinson and a group of soldiers were dispatched to enter the village and arrested 18 of the Hopi resisters. Among those arrested were Habema (Heevi&#x27;ima) and Lomahongyoma. In the following days, they realized they had not captured all Hopi resisters and Sergeant Henry Henser was sent back to capture Potopa, a Hopi medicine man, known as &quot;one of the most dangerous of resisters&quot;. Eager to rid Orayvi of all resisters, government officials sent 19 Hopi men who they saw as troublesome to Alcatraz Prison, where they stayed for a year. The US government thought they undermined the Hopi resistance, however this only intensified ill feelings of bitterness and resistance towards the government. When the Hopi prisoners were sent home, they claimed that government officials told them that they did not have to send their children to school, but when they returned, Indian agents denied that this was promised to them. Another Oraibi leader, &quot;Lomahongyoma&quot;, competed with &quot;Lololoma&quot; for village leadership. In 1906 the village split after a conflict between hostiles and friendlies. The conservative hostiles left and formed a new village, known as &quot;Hotevilla&quot;.

==Federal recognition==
At the dawn of the 20th century, the U.S. government established day schools, missions, farming bureaus, and clinics on every Indian reservation. This policy required that every reservation set up its own police force and tribal courts and appointed a leader who would represent their tribe to the U.S. government. In 1910 in the Census for Indians, the Hopi Tribe had a total of 2,000 members, which was the highest in 20 years. The Navajo at this time had 22,500 members and have consistently increased in population. During the early years of this century, only about three percent of Hopis lived off the reservation. In 1924 Congress officially declared Native Americans to be U.S. citizens with the Indian Citizenship Act.

Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Hopi established a constitution to create their own tribal government, and in 1936 elected a Tribal Council. The Preamble to the Hopi constitution states that they are a self-governing tribe, focused on working together for peace and agreements between villages in order to preserve the &quot;good things of Hopi life.&quot; The constitution consists of 13 articles, addressing territory, membership, and organization of their government with legislative, executive and judicial branches.

==Hopi–Navajo land disputes==
From the 1940s to the 1970s, the Navajo moved their settlements closer to Hopi land, causing the Hopi to raise the issue with the U.S. government. This resulted in the establishment of &quot;District 6&quot; which placed a boundary around the Hopi villages on the first, second, and third mesas, thinning the reservation to . In 1962 the courts issued the &quot;Opinion, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment,&quot; which stated that the U.S. government did not grant the Navajo any type of permission to reside on the Hopi Reservation that was declared in 1882; and that the remaining Hopi land was to be shared with the Navajo, as the &quot;Navajo–Hopi Joint Use Area&quot;.

From 1961 to 1964, the Hopi tribal council signed leases with the U.S. government that allowed companies to explore and drill for oil, gas, and minerals in Hopi country. This drilling brought over three million dollars to the Hopi Tribe. In 1974, The Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act was passed,(Public Law 93–531; 25 U.S.C. 640d et seq.), followed by the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996, settling some issues not resolved in 1974. The 1974 Act created the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation, which forced the relocation of any Hopi or Navajo living on the other&#x27;s land. In 1992, the Hopi Reservation was increased to .

Today&#x27;s Hopi Reservation is traversed by Arizona State Route 264, a paved road that links the numerous Hopi villages.

==Tribal government==
On October 24, 1936, the Hopi Tribe of Arizona ratified a constitution. That constitution created a unicameral government where all powers are vested in a Tribal Council. While there is an executive branch (tribal chairman and vice chairman) and judicial branch, their powers are limited under the Hopi Constitution. The traditional powers and authority of the Hopi villages was preserved in the 1936 constitution.

The Hopi tribe is federally recognized and headquartered in Kykotsmovi, Arizona.

===Tribal officers===
The current tribal officers are:
* Chairman: Timothy Nuvangyaoma
* Vice Chairman: Clark W. Tenakhongva
* Tribal Secretary: Theresa Lomakema
* Treasurer: Wilfred Gaseoma
* Sergeant-at-Arms: Alfonso Sakeva

===Tribal council===
Representatives to the council are selected either by a community election or by an appointment from the village kikmongwi, or leader. Each representative serves a two-year term. Representation on the Tribal Council as of December 2017 is as follows:

Village of Upper Moenkopi: Hubert Lewis Sr., Michael Elmer, Robert Charley, Philton Talahytewa Sr.

Village of Bacavi: Dwayne Secakuku, Clifford Quotsaquahu

Village of Kykotsmovi: David Talayumptewa, Phillip Quochytewa Sr., Danny Honanie, Herman G. Honanie

Village of Sipaulavi: Rosa Honanie,

Village of Mishongnovi: Emma Anderson, Craig Andrews, Pansy K. Edmo, Rolanda Yoyletsdewa

First Mesa Consolidated Villages: Albert T. Sinquah, Ivan Sidney Sr., Wallace Youvella Jr., Dale Sinquah

Currently, the villages of Shungopavi, Oraibi, Hotevilla, and Lower Moenkopi do not have a representative on council. The Hopi Villages select council representatives, and may decline to send any representative. The declination has been approved by the Hopi Courts.

===Tribal courts===
The Hopi Tribal Government operates a Trial Court and Appellate Court in Keams Canyon. These courts operate under a Tribal Code, amended August 28, 2012.

==Economic development==

The Hopi tribe earns most of its income from natural resources. The tribe&#x27;s 2010 operating budget was $21.8 million, and projected mining revenues for 2010 were $12.8 million. On the Navajo Reservation, a significant amount of coal is mined yearly from which the Hopi Tribe shares mineral royalty income. Peabody Western Coal Company is one of the largest coal operations on Hopi land, with long-time permits for continued mining. Consequently, the closure of a large coal mine in 2019 has compounded existing unemployment. Combined with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of official help for those who have lost access to the coal they need to burn to heat their homes, Hopi have turned to nonprofits for help.

The Hopi Tribe Economic Development Corporation (HTEDC) is the tribal enterprise charged with creating diverse, viable economic opportunities. The HEDC oversees the Hopi Cultural Center and Walpi Housing Management. Other HTEDC businesses include the Hopi Three Canyon Ranches, between Flagstaff and Winslow and the 26 Bar Ranch in Eagar; Hopi Travel Plaza in Holbrook; three commercial properties in Flagstaff; and the Days Inn Kokopelli in Sedona. Tourism is a source of income. The Moenkopi Developers Corporation, a non-profit entity owned by the Upper village of Moenkopi, opened the 100-room Moenkopi Legacy Inn and Suites in Moenkopi, Arizona, near Tuba City, Arizona. It is the second hotel on the reservation. It provides non-Hopi a venue for entertainment, lectures, and educational demonstrations, as well as tours and lodging. The project is expected to support 400 jobs. The village also operates the Tuvvi Travel Center in Moenkopi. The Tribally owned and operated Hopi Cultural Center on Second Mesa includes gift shops, museums, a hotel, and a restaurant that serves Hopi dishes.

The Hopi people have repeatedly voted against gambling casinos as an economic opportunity.

On November 30, 2017, in his last day as Chairman of the Hopi Tribe, Herman G. Honanie and Governor Doug Ducey signed the Hopi Tribe-State of Arizona Tribal Gaming Compact, a year after the Tribe approved entering into a compact with the State of Arizona. The historic agreement, which gives the Hopi Tribe the opportunity to operate or lease up to 900 Class III gaming machines, makes Hopi the 22nd and last Arizona tribe to sign a gaming compact with the State.

==Culture==

The &quot;Hopi Dictionary&quot; gives the primary meaning of the word &quot;Hopi&quot; as: &quot;behaving one, one who is mannered, civilized, peaceable, polite, who adheres to the Hopi Way&quot;. Some sources contrast this to other warring tribes that subsist on plunder, considering their autonym, &quot;Hopisinom&quot; to mean &quot;The Peaceful People&quot; or &quot;Peaceful Little Ones&quot;. However, Malotki maintains that &quot;neither the notion &#x27;peaceful&#x27; nor the idea &#x27;little&#x27; are semantic ingredients of the term&quot;.

According to Barry Pritzker, &quot;...many Hopi feel an intimate and immediate connection with their past. Indeed, for many Hopi, time does not proceed in a straight line, as most people understand it. Rather, the past may be past and present more or less simultaneously.&quot;. In the present Fourth World, the Hopi worship Masauwu, who admonished them to &quot;always remember their gods and to live in the correct way&quot;. The village leader, &quot;kikmongwi&quot;, &quot;promoted civic virtue and proper behavior&quot;.

Traditionally, Hopi are organized into matrilineal clans. When a man marries, the children from the relationship are members of his wife&#x27;s clan. These clan organizations extend across all villages. Children are named by the women of the father&#x27;s clan. On the 20th day of a baby&#x27;s life, the women of the paternal clan gather, each woman bringing a name and a gift for the child. In some cases where many relatives would attend, a child could be given over 40 names, for example. The child&#x27;s parents generally decide the name to be used from these names. Current practice is to either use a non-Hopi or English name or the parent&#x27;s chosen Hopi name. A person may also change the name upon initiation into one of the religious societies, such as the kachina society, or with a major life event.

The Hopi practice a complete cycle of traditional ceremonies although not all villages retain or had the complete ceremonial cycle. These ceremonies take place according to the lunar calendar and are observed in each of the Hopi villages. Like other Native American groups, the Hopi have been influenced by Christianity and the missionary work of several Christian denominations. Few have converted enough to Christianity to drop their traditional religious practices.

The most widely publicized of Hopi katsina rites is the &quot;Snake Dance&quot;, an annual event during which the performers danced while handling live snakes.

Traditionally the Hopi are micro or subsistence farmers. The Hopi also are part of the wider cash economy; a significant number of Hopi have mainstream jobs; others earn a living by creating Hopi art, notably the carving of katsina dolls, the crafting of earthenware ceramics, and the design and production of fine jewelry, especially sterling silver.

The Hopi collect and dry a native perennial plant called &quot;Thelesperma megapotamicum&quot;, known by the common name Hopi tea, and use it to make an herbal tea, as a medicinal remedy and a yellow dye.

==Albinism==
The Hopi have a high rate of albinism. Primarily in Second Mesa and west villages towards Hotevilla—about 1 in 200 individuals.

==Politics==
Lancaster County has historically been somewhat conservative for an urban county. In the last 30 national elections, Lancaster County selected the Republican Party candidate 78% of the time. However, it has become more competitive in recent years, largely due to the influence of Lincoln and the University of Nebraska. Since 1988, the margin in the county has been 10 points or less all but once. In 2008, Barack Obama won a narrow majority in Lancaster County, becoming the first Democrat to carry the county since 1964, and only the second since 1936. Republican Donald Trump never won the county in all three of his runs.

As of January 2025, Republicans maintain a relative advantage in party registration in the county.

<doc id="58038" wikidata="Q236236" url="?curid=58038" title="Oliver Goldsmith">
<text>Oliver Goldsmith (10 November 1728 – 4 April 1774) was an Anglo-Irish poet, writer, and naturalist who is best known for his 1766 novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. It was one of the most popular literary works of 18th-century Britain. He also wrote the plays &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; (1768) and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1771), and &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; (1770), a poem. Goldsmith is additionally thought by some, including Washington Irving, to have written the 1765 classic children&#x27;s tale &quot;The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes&quot;, one of the earliest known works of children&#x27;s literature.

==Early life==

Goldsmith&#x27;s birth date and year are not known with certainty. According to the Library of Congress authority file, he told a biographer that he was born on 10 November 1728. The location of his birthplace is also uncertain. He was born either in the townland of Pallas, near Ballymahon, County Longford, Ireland, where his father was the Anglican curate of the parish of Forgney, or at the residence of his maternal grandparents, at the Smith Hill House near Elphin in County Roscommon, where his grandfather Oliver Jones was a clergyman and master of the Elphin diocesan school, and where Oliver studied. When Goldsmith was two years old, his father was appointed the rector of the parish of &quot;Kilkenny West&quot; in County Westmeath. The family moved to the parsonage at Lissoy, between Athlone and Ballymahon, and continued to live there until his father&#x27;s death in 1747.

In 1744, Goldsmith went up to Trinity College, Dublin. His tutor was Theaker Wilder. Neglecting his studies in theology and law, he fell to the bottom of his class. In 1747, along with four other undergraduates, he was expelled for a riot in which they attempted to storm the Marshalsea Prison. He was graduated in 1749 as a Bachelor of Arts, but without the discipline or distinction that might have gained him entry to a profession in the church or the law. His education seemed to have given him mainly a taste for fine clothes, cards, singing Irish airs, and playing the flute. He lived for a short time with his mother, tried various professions without success, studied medicine desultorily at the University of Edinburgh from 1752 to 1755, and set out on a walking tour of Flanders, France, Switzerland, and Northern Italy, living by his wits (busking with his flute).
==Career==
He settled in London in 1756, where he briefly held various jobs, including an apothecary&#x27;s assistant and an usher of a school. Perennially in debt and addicted to gambling, Goldsmith produced a massive output as a hack writer on Grub Street for the publishers of London, but his few painstaking works earned him the company of Samuel Johnson, with whom he was a founding member of &quot;The Club&quot;. There, through fellow Club member Edmund Burke, he made the acquaintance of Sir George Savile, who would later arrange a job for him at Thornhill Grammar School in Yorkshire. The combination of his literary work and his dissolute lifestyle led Horace Walpole to give him the epithet &quot;inspired idiot&quot;. During this period he used the pseudonym &quot;James Willington&quot; (the name of a fellow student at Trinity) to publish his 1758 translation of the autobiography of the Huguenot Jean Marteilhe.

=== Works ===
==== &quot;The Citizen of the World&quot; ====
In 1760 Goldsmith began to publish a series of letters in the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; under the title &quot;The Citizen of the World&quot; which brought him fame. Purportedly written by a Chinese traveller in England by the name of Lien Chi, they used this fictional outsider&#x27;s perspective to comment ironically and at times moralistically on British society and manners. It was inspired by the earlier essay series &quot;Persian Letters&quot; by Montesquieu.

==== &quot;The Hermit&quot; ====
Goldsmith wrote this 160-line romantic ballad in 1765. The hero and heroine are Edwin, a youth without wealth or power, and Angelina, the daughter of a lord &quot;beside the Tyne&quot;. Angelina spurns many wooers, but refuses to make plain her love for young Edwin. &quot;Quite dejected with my scorn&quot;, Edwin disappears and becomes a hermit. One day, Angelina turns up at his cell in boy&#x27;s clothes and, not recognising him, tells him her story. Edwin then reveals his true identity, and the lovers never part again. The poem is notable for its interesting portrayal of a hermit, who is fond of the natural world and his wilderness solitude but maintains a gentle, sympathetic demeanour toward other people. In keeping with eremitical tradition, however, Edwin the Hermit claims to &quot;spurn the [opposite] sex&quot;. This poem appears under the title of &quot;A Ballad&quot; sung by the character of Mr. Burchell in Chapter 8 of Goldsmith&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;.

==== &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; ====
In the 1760s Goldsmith witnessed the demolition of an ancient village and the destruction of its farms to clear land to become a wealthy man&#x27;s garden. His poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, published in 1770, expresses a fear that the destruction of villages and the conversion of land from productive agriculture to ornamental landscape gardens would ruin the peasantry.

Goldsmith has sometimes been credited with writing the classic children&#x27;s tale &quot;The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes&quot;, though this cannot be proved.

==Personal life==
In his &quot;Life&quot;, Washington Irving states that Goldsmith was between 5&#x27;4&quot; and 5&#x27;6&quot; in height, not heavily built but quite muscular and with rather plain features. In character, he had a lively sense of fun, was totally guileless, and never happier than when in the light-hearted company of children. The money that he sporadically earned was often frittered away or happily given away to the next good cause that presented itself so that any financial security tended to be fleeting and short-lived. Goldsmith&#x27;s talents were unreservedly recognised by Samuel Johnson, whose patronage – somewhat resented by Boswell – aided his eventual recognition in the literary world and the world of drama.

Goldsmith was described by contemporaries as prone to envy, a congenial but impetuous and disorganised personality who once planned to emigrate to America but failed because he missed his ship. At some point around this time, he worked at Thornhill Grammar School, later basing Squire Thornhill (in &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;) on his benefactor Sir George Savile and certainly spending time with eminent scientist Rev. John Mitchell, whom he probably knew from London. Mitchell sorely missed good company, which Goldsmith naturally provided in spades. Thomas De Quincey wrote of him &quot;All the motion of Goldsmith&#x27;s nature moved in the direction of the true, the natural, the sweet, the gentle&quot;.

Later researchers have speculated that Goldsmith may have suffered from color blindness, a condition which was not described until years after Goldsmith&#x27;s death. Munro MacLennan described several instances from Goldsmith&#x27;s life which suggest that he had an inability to distinguish between certain colors.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Goldsmith was an Anglican, and famously said &quot;as I take my shoes from the shoemaker, and my coat from the taylor, so I take my religion from the priest&quot;.

Thomas Hurst wrote that Goldsmith &quot;recognised with joy the existence and perfections of a Deity. For the Christian revelation also, he was always understood to have a profound respect – knowing that it was the source of our best hopes and noblest expectations.&quot;

==Death==
Goldsmith&#x27;s premature death in 1774 may have been partly due to his own misdiagnosis of a kidney infection. He was buried in Temple Church in London. The inscription reads; &quot;HERE LIES/OLIVER GOLDSMITH&quot;. A monument was originally raised for him at the site of his burial, but it was destroyed in an air raid in 1941. A monument to him survives in the centre of Ballymahon, also in Westminster Abbey with an epitaph written by Samuel Johnson.
&quot;Oliver Goldsmith: A Poet, Naturalist, and Historian, who left scarcely any style of writing untouched, and touched nothing that he did not adorn. Of all the passions, whether smiles were to move or tears, a powerful yet gentle master. In genius, vivid, versatile, sublime. In style, clear, elevated, elegant.&quot;&quot; Epitaph written by Dr. Johnson, translated from the original Latin. 

==Legacy==
Among his papers was found the prospectus of an encyclopedia, to be called the &quot;Universal dictionary of the arts and sciences&quot;. He wished this to be the British equivalent of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and it was to include comprehensive articles by Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, Edward Gibbon, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir William Jones, Fox and Dr. Burney. The project, however, was not realised due to Goldsmith&#x27;s death.

Two characters in the 1951 comedy &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; quote the same line from Goldsmith&#x27;s poem &quot;The Traveller&quot; – a subtle joke, because the film&#x27;s plot involves the recasting of stolen gold.

During the opening credits of the Sky One adaptation of Sir Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Christmas-like story &quot;The Hogfather&quot;, a portrait of Goldsmith is shown as part of a hall of memorials to those &quot;inhumed&quot; by the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Assassins&#x27; Guild&quot;.

In the 1925 novel &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, the last words of the poem &quot;An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog&quot;, &quot;The dog it was that died&quot;, are the dying words of bacteriologist Walter Fane, one of the primary characters in the novel. And using the title &quot;Elegy for a Mad Dog&quot; is an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D. (1971, Season 2, Episode 21).

The Tom Stoppard play The Dog It Was That Died takes its title from the same poem.

In the Nabokov novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, a central character&#x27;s house is situated between &quot;Goldsworth&quot; (the name of an estate) and &quot;Wordsmith University&quot;. Crossing these two names yields the names of the poets Wordsworth and Goldsmith; one of the narrators refers to this as the &quot;witty exchange of syllables invoking the two masters of the heroic couplet.&quot;

In the play &quot;Marx in Soho&quot; by Howard Zinn, Marx makes a reference to Goldsmith&#x27;s poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;.

In &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, T. S. Eliot parodies Goldsmith&#x27;s song &quot;When lovely woman stoops to folly&quot;.

The characters of &#x27;Edwin&#x27; and &#x27;Angelina&#x27; in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; were a reference to Goldsmith&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hermit&quot;.

<doc id="58039" wikidata="Q1351977" url="?curid=58039" title="Stuckism">
<text>Stuckism () is an international art movement founded in 1999 by Billy Childish and Charles Thomson to promote figurative painting as opposed to conceptual art. By May 2017, the initial group of 13 British artists had expanded to 236 groups in 52 countries.

Childish and Thomson have issued several manifestos. The first one was &quot;The Stuckists&quot;, consisting of 20 points starting with &quot;Stuckism is a quest for authenticity&quot;. &quot;Remodernism&quot;, the other well-known manifesto of the movement, opposes the deconstruction and irony of postmodernism in favor of what Stuckists refer to as the &quot;spirituality&quot; of the artist. In another manifesto they define themselves as &quot;anti-anti-art&quot; which is against anti-art and for what they consider conventional art.

After exhibiting in small galleries in Shoreditch, London, the Stuckists&#x27; first show in a major public museum was held in 2004 at the Walker Art Gallery, as part of the Liverpool Biennial. The group has demonstrated annually at Tate Britain against the Turner Prize since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the Charles Saatchi-patronised Young British Artists.

Although painting is the dominant artistic form of Stuckism, artists using other media such as photography, sculpture, film and collage have also joined, and share the Stuckist opposition to conceptualism and &quot;ego-art.&quot;

==Name, founding and origin==
The name &quot;Stuckism&quot; was coined in January 1999 by Charles Thomson in response to a poem read to him several times by Billy Childish. In it, Childish recites that his former girlfriend, Tracey Emin had said he was &quot;stuck! stuck! stuck!&quot; with his art, poetry and music. Later that month, Thomson approached Childish with a view to co-founding an art group called Stuckism, which Childish agreed to, on the basis that Thomson would do the work for the group, as Childish already had a full schedule.

There were eleven other founding members: Philip Absolon, Frances Castle, Sheila Clark, Eamon Everall, Ella Guru, Wolf Howard, Bill Lewis, Sanchia Lewis, Joe Machine, Sexton Ming, and Charles Williams. The membership has evolved since its founding through creative collaborations: the group was originally promoted as working in paint, but members have since worked in various other media, including poetry, fiction, performance, photography, film and music.

In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming were members of The Medway Poets performance group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed. Peter Waite&#x27;s Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows. In 1982, TVS broadcast a documentary on the poets. That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish. Group members published dozens of works. The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record &quot;The Medway Poets&quot; LP. Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years. Thomson got to know Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend was a friend of Emin; Thomson also met Everall. During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.

==Manifestos==
In August 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote &quot;The Stuckists manifesto&quot; which stress the value of painting as a medium, its use for communication, and the expression of emotion and experience – as opposed to what Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, nihilism and irony of conceptual art and postmodernism. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: &quot;Artists who don&#x27;t paint aren&#x27;t artists&quot;.

The second and third manifestos, &quot;An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota&quot; and &quot;Remodernism&quot; respectively, were sent to the director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota. He sent a brief reply: &quot;Thank you for your open letter dated 6 March. You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto &#x27;Remodernism&#x27;.&quot;

In the &quot;Remodernism&quot; manifesto, the Stuckists declared that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, a period of renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included &quot;Handy Hints&quot;, &quot;Anti-anti-art&quot;, &quot;The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing&quot;, &quot;The Turner Prize&quot;, &quot;The Decreptitude of the Critic&quot; and &quot;Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst&quot;.

In &quot;Anti-anti-art&quot;, the Stuckists outlined their opposition to what is known as &quot;anti-art&quot;. Stuckists claim that conceptual art is justified by the work of Marcel Duchamp, but that Duchamp&#x27;s work is &quot;anti-art by intent and effect&quot;. The Stuckists feel that &quot;Duchamp&#x27;s work was a protest against the stale, unthinking artistic establishment of his day&quot;, while &quot;the great (but wholly unintentional) irony of postmodernism is that it is a direct equivalent of the conformist, unoriginal establishment that Duchamp attacked in the first place&quot;.

Manifestos have been written by other Stuckists, including the Students for Stuckism group. An &quot;Underage Stuckists&quot; group was founded in 2006 with a manifesto for teenagers written by two 16-year-olds, Liv Soul and Rebekah Maybury, on MySpace. In 2009, a group calling itself The Other Muswell Hill Stuckists published &quot;The Founding, Manifesto and Rules of The Other Muswell Hill Stuckists&quot;.

==Growth in the UK==
In July 1999, the Stuckists were first mentioned in the media, in an article in &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; and soon gained other coverage, helped by press interest in Tracey Emin, who had been nominated for the Turner Prize.

The first Stuckist show was &quot;Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!&quot; in September 1999 in Joe Crompton&#x27;s in Shoreditch Gallery 108 (now defunct), followed by &quot;The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota&quot;. In 2000, they staged &quot;The Real Turner Prize Show&quot; at the same time as the Tate Gallery&#x27;s Turner Prize exhibition.

A &quot;Students for Stuckism&quot; group was founded in 2000 by students from Camberwell College of Arts, who staged their own exhibition. S.P. Howarth was expelled from the painting degree course at Camberwell college for his paintings, and had the first solo exhibit at the Stuckism International Gallery in 2002, named &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want a Painting Degree if it Means Not Painting&quot;.

Thomson stood as a Stuckist candidate for the 2001 British General Election, in the constituency of Islington South &amp; Finsbury, against Chris Smith, the then Secretary of State for Culture. He picked up 108 votes (0.4%). Childish left the group at this time because he objected to Thomson&#x27;s leadership.

From 2002 to 2005, Thomson ran the Stuckism International Centre and Gallery in Shoreditch, London. In 2003, under the title &quot;A Dead Shark Isn&#x27;t Art&quot;, the gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before Damien Hirst&#x27;s) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. It was suggested that Hirst may have seen this and copied it.

In 2003, they reported Charles Saatchi to the UK Office of Fair Trading, complaining that he had an effective monopoly on art. The complaint was not upheld. In 2003, an allied group, Stuckism Photography, was founded by Larry Dunstan and Andy Bullock. In 2005, the Stuckists offered a donation of 175 paintings from the Walker show to the Tate; however, it was rejected by the Tate&#x27;s trustees.

In August 2005, Thomson alerted the press to the fact that the Tate had purchased a work by Chris Ofili, &quot;The Upper Room&quot;, for £705,000 while the artist was a serving Tate trustee. Fraser Kee Scott, owner of A Gallery, demonstrated with the Stuckists outside the Tate Gallery against the gallery&#x27;s purchase of &quot;The Upper Room&quot;. Scott said in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that the Tate Gallery&#x27;s chairman, Paul Myners, was hypocritical for refusing to divulge the price paid. Ofili had asked other artists to donate work to the gallery. In July 2006 the Charity Commission censured the gallery for acting outside its legal powers. Sir Nicholas Serota stated that the Stuckists had &quot;acted in the public interest&quot;.

In October 2006, the Stuckists staged their first exhibition, &quot;Go West&quot;, in a commercial West End gallery, Spectrum London; this signalled their entry as &quot;major players&quot; in the art world.

An international symposium on Stuckism took place in October 2006 at the Liverpool John Moores University during the Liverpool Biennial. The programme was led by Naive John, founder of the Liverpool Stuckists. There was an accompanying exhibition in the 68 Hope Gallery at Liverpool School of Art and Design (John Moores University Gallery).

By 2006, there were 63 Stuckist groups in the UK. Members include Naive John, Mark D, Elsa Dax, Paul Harvey, Jane Kelly, Udaiyan, Peter McArdle, Peter Murphy, Rachel Jordan, Guy Denning and Abby Jackson. John Bourne opened Stuckism Wales at his home, a permanent exhibition of (mainly Welsh) paintings. Mandy McCartin is a regular guest artist.

In 2010, Paul Harvey&#x27;s painting of Charles Saatchi was banned from the window display of the Artspace Gallery in Maddox Street, London, on the grounds that it was &quot;too controversial for the area&quot;. It was the centrepiece of the show, &quot;Stuckist Clowns Doing Their Dirty Work&quot;, the first exhibition of the Stuckists in Mayfair, and depicted Saatchi with a sheep at his feet and a halo made from a cheese wrapper. The Saatchi Gallery said that Saatchi &quot;would not have any problem&quot; with the painting&#x27;s display. The gallery announced they were shutting down the show. Harvey said, &quot;I did it to make Saatchi look friendly and human. It&#x27;s a ludicrous decision&quot;.
The Stuckists protested with emails to the gallery. Subsequently, the painting was reinstated and the show continued.

===Demonstrations===

The Stuckists gained significant media coverage for eight years of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001, they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s &quot;Monument&quot;. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked &quot;The Death of Conceptual Art&quot; to the White Cube Gallery. Outside the launch of &quot;The Triumph of Painting&quot; at the Saatchi Gallery in 2004, they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi&#x27;s face emblazoned; they also carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.

Events outside Britain have included &quot;The Clown Trial of President Bush&quot; held in New Haven in 2003 to protest against the Iraq War. Michael Dickinson has exhibited political and satirical collages in Turkey for which he was arrested, and charged, but acquitted of any crime—an outcome which was seen to have positive implications for Turkey&#x27;s relationship with the European Union.

===The Stuckists Punk Victorian===

&quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot; was the first national gallery exhibition of Stuckist art. It was held at the Walker Art Gallery and Lady Lever Art Gallery and was part of the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. It consisted of over 250 paintings by 37 artists, mostly from the UK but also with a representation of international Stuckist artists from the US, Germany and Australia. There was an accompanying exhibition of Stuckist photographers. A book, &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot;, was published to accompany the exhibition. &quot;Daily Mail&quot; journalist Jane Kelly exhibited a painting of Myra Hindley in the show, which may have been the cause of her dismissal from her job.

===A Gallery===

In July 2007, the Stuckists held an exhibition at A Gallery, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Have Sex with You as long as We&#x27;re Married&quot;, titled after words apparently said to Thomson by his ex-wife, Stella Vine on their wedding night. The show coincided with the opening of Vine&#x27;s major show at Modern Art Oxford and was prompted by Thomson&#x27;s anger that the material promoting her show did not mention her time with the Stuckists. Tate chairman Paul Myners visited both shows.

===&quot;Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision&quot;===


As Charlotte Cripps of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, Charles Thomson&#x27;s painting &quot;Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision&quot; is one of the best known paintings to come out of the Stuckist movement, and as Jane Morris wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; it&#x27;s a likely &quot;signature piece&quot; for the movement, standing for its opposition to conceptual art. Painted in 2000, the piece has been exhibited in later Stuckist shows, and featured on placards in Stuckist demonstrations against the Turner Prize. It depicts Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery and the usual chairman of the Turner Prize jury, and satirises Young British Artist Tracey Emin&#x27;s installation, &quot;My Bed&quot;, consisting of her bed and objects, including knickers, which she exhibited in 1999 as a Turner Prize nominee.

==International movement==
In 2000, Regan Tamanui started the first Stuckist group outside Britain in Melbourne, Australia, and it was decided that other artists should be free to start their own groups also, named after their locality. Stuckism has since grown into an international art movement of 233 groups in 52 countries, as of July 2012.

===Africa===
Mafa Bamba founded &quot;The Abidgan Stuckists&quot; in 2001 in Ivory Coast and Kari Seid founded &quot;The Cape Town Stuckists&quot; in 2008 in South Africa.

===America===
In 2000, Susan Constanse founded the first U.S. group &quot;The Pittsburgh Stuckists&quot; in Pittsburgh—the second group to be founded outside the UK. This was announced in the &quot;In Pittsburgh Weekly&quot;, 1 November 2000: &quot;The new word in art is Stuckism. A Stuckist paints their life, mind and soul with no pretensions and no excuses.&quot; By 2011, there were 44 U.S. Stuckist groups. There have been Stuckist shows and demonstrations in the U.S., and American Stuckists have also exhibited in international Stuckist shows abroad. U.S. Stuckists include Ron Throop, Jeffrey Scott Holland, Frank Kozik and Terry Marks. There are also 4 Stuckist groups in Canada including &quot;The White Rock Stuckists&quot; in British Columbia founded by David Wilson.

===Asia===
Asim Butt founded the first Pakistani Stuckist group, &quot;The Karachi Stuckists&quot;, in 2005. At the end of 2009 he was thinking of expanding &quot;The Karachi Stuckists&quot; with new members; however, on 15 January 2010 he committed suicide. In 2011, Sheherbano Husain restarted the group.

&quot;The Tehran Stuckists&quot; is an Iranian Stuckist, Remodernist and anti-anti-art group of painters founded in 2007 in Tehran, which is a major protagonist of Asian Stuckism. In April 2010 they curated the first Stuckist exhibition in Iran, &quot;Tehran Stuckists: Searching for the Unlimited Potentials of Figurative Painting&quot;, at Iran Artists Forum, Mirmiran Gallery. Their second exhibition, &quot;International Stuckists: Painters Out of Order&quot;, including paintings by Stuckists from Iran, Britain, USA, Spain, South Africa, Pakistan and Turkey was held at Day Gallery in November 2013. Although one of the main aspects of Stuckism movement is that &quot;the Stuckist allows him/herself uncensored expression&quot;; however, &quot;The Tehran Stuckists&quot;&#x27; exhibitions in Iran are censored and they are not allowed to exhibit some of their artworks in Iranian galleries. The group has also participated in Stuckist exhibitions in Britain, Lithuania and Spain.

Other Asian Stuckists are Shelley Li (China), Smeetha Boumik (India), Joko Apridinoto (Indonesia), Elio Yuri Figini (Japan) and Fady Chamaa (Lebanon).

===Europe===

&quot;The Prague Stuckists&quot; were founded in 2005 in the Czech Republic by Robert Janás, Other Stuckist artists in Europe include Peter Klint (Germany), Michael Dickinson (Turkey), Odysseus Yakoumakis (Greece), Artista Eli (Spain), Kloot Per W (Belgium), Jaroslav Valečka (Czech Republic), Jiří Hauschka (Czech Republic), Markéta Korečková (Czech Republic), Ján Macko (Slovakia) and Pavel Lefterov (Bulgaria).

===Oceania===

In October 2000, Regan Tamanui founded &quot;The Melbourne Stuckists&quot; in Melbourne, the fourth Stuckist group to be started and the first one outside the UK. On 27 October 2000, he staged the &quot;Real Turner Prize Show&quot; at the Dead End Gallery in his home, concurrent with three shows with the same title in England (London, Falmouth and Dartington) and one in Germany in protest against the Tate Gallery&#x27;s Turner Prize. Other Australian Stuckists include Godfrey Blow, who exhibited in &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot;. In 2005 Mike Mayhew also founded &quot;The Christchurch Stuckists&quot; in New Zealand.

==Ex-Stuckists==
Co-founder Billy Childish left the group in 2001, but has stated that he remains committed to its principles. Sexton Ming left to concentrate on a solo career with the Aquarium Gallery. Wolf Howard left in 2006, but has exhibited with the group since. Jesse Richards who ran the Stuckism Centre USA in New Haven, left the group in 2006 to focus on Remodernist film.

In June 2000, Stella Vine went to a talk given by Childish and Thomson on Stuckism and Remodernism in London. At the end of May 2001, she exhibited some of her paintings publicly for the first time in the &quot;Vote Stuckist&quot; show in Brixton, and formed The Westminster Stuckists group. On 4 June, she took part in a Stuckist demonstration in Trafalgar Square. By 10 July, she had renamed her group The Unstuckists. In mid-August, Thomson and Vine married. A work by her was shown in the Stuckist show in Paris, which ended in mid-November, by which time she had rejected the Stuckists, and the marriage had ended.

In February 2004, Charles Saatchi bought a painting of Diana, Princess of Wales, by Vine and was credited with &quot;discovering&quot; her. Thomson said it was the Stuckists and not Saatchi who had discovered her. At the end of March 2004, Thomson made a formal complaint about Saatchi to the Office of Fair Trading, claiming that Saatchi&#x27;s leading position was monopolistic &quot;to the detriment of smaller competitors&quot;, citing Vine as an example of this. On 15 April, the OFT closed the file on the case on the basis that Saatchi was not &quot;in a dominant position in any relevant market.&quot;

==Responses and critique==
A short time after the 1999 exhibition of &quot;My Bed&quot; and the Stuckists&#x27; response with &quot;Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision&quot;, a pair of performance artists named Yuan Cai and Jian Jun Xi performed an art intervention titled &quot;Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey&#x27;s Bed&quot; at the Tate Gallery&#x27;s Turner Prize. Cai had written, among other things, the words &quot;Anti Stuckism&quot; on his bare back as the two jumped on the bed and performed a pillow fight. Fiachra Gibbons of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote (in 1999) that the event &quot;will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; ten years later, Jonathan Jones described the Stuckists as &quot;enemies of art&quot;, and what they say as &quot;cheap slogans&quot; and &quot;hysterical rants&quot;.

The artist Max Podstolski wrote that the art world needed a new manifesto, as confrontational as that of Futurism or Dadaism, &quot;written with a heart-felt passion capable of inspiring and rallying art world outsiders, dissenters, rebels, the neglected and disaffected&quot;, and suggests that &quot;Well now we&#x27;ve got it, in the form of Stuckism&quot;.

New York art gallery owner Edward Winkleman wrote in 2006 that he had never heard of the Stuckists, so he &quot;looked them up on Wikipedia&quot;, and stated he was &quot;turned off by their anti-conceptual stance, not to mention the inanity of their statement about painting, but I&#x27;m more than a bit interested in the democratization their movement represents.&quot; Thomson responded to Winkleman directly.

Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, writing in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, noted that the Stuckists&#x27; first exhibition in central London had brought &quot;multiple sales&quot; for leading artists of the movement, and that this raised the question of how good they were at painting. He observed that &quot;Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan have already taken a punt. Six of Thomson&#x27;s paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former prisoner who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price.&quot;

Paul Vallely defended Sir Nicholas Serota from Stuckist campaigns, criticizing the movement&#x27;s anti-conceptualism for its association with &quot;forces of social reaction&quot; such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and upholding Serota as the &quot;greatest single champion of modern art in Britain&quot;. Vallely stated that while &quot;I did smile&quot; at &quot;Acquisitions Decision&quot;, he equally admired Serota&#x27;s &quot;cool response to the Stuckist détournement&quot;, visiting the Punk Victorian show and conversing with members before rejecting an offered donation of their work as not of &quot;sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection&quot;

The BBC arts correspondent Lawrence Pollard wrote in 2009 that the way was paved for &quot;cultural agitators&quot; like the Stuckists, as well as the Vorticists, Surrealists and others, by the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot; of 20 February 1909.

<text>The Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads) are a family of monocot flowering plants of about 80 genera and 3700 known species, native mainly to the tropical Americas, with several species found in the American subtropics and one in tropical west Africa, &quot;Pitcairnia feliciana&quot;.

It is among the basal families within the Poales and is the only family within the order that has septal nectaries and inferior ovaries. These inferior ovaries characterize the Bromelioideae, a subfamily of the Bromeliaceae. The family includes both epiphytes, such as Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;), and terrestrial species, such as the pineapple (&quot;Ananas comosus&quot;). Many bromeliads are able to store water in a structure formed by their tightly overlapping leaf bases. However, the family is diverse enough to include the tank bromeliads, grey-leaved epiphyte &quot;Tillandsia&quot; species that gather water only from leaf structures called trichomes, and many desert-dwelling succulents.

The largest bromeliad is &quot;Puya raimondii&quot;, which reaches tall in vegetative growth with a flower spike tall, and the smallest is Spanish moss.

==Description==

Bromeliads are mostly herbaceous perennials, although a few have a more tree-like habit. Many are more or less succulent or have other adaptations to resist drought. They may be terrestrial or epiphytic, rarely climbing (e.g. &quot;Pitcairnia&quot; species). Some species of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; (e.g. Spanish moss, &quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;) are aerophytes, which have very reduced root systems and absorb water directly from the air. Many terrestrial and epiphytic bromeliads have their leaves in the form of vase-shaped rosettes which accumulate water. These rosettes, called &quot;tanks&quot;, can hold as much as ten liters (eighteen pints) of water, and be little biotic communities unto themselves. One individual tank was found to contain the following: four harvestmen, a spider, three species of wood lice, a centipede, a &quot;jumping millipede&quot;[sic], a pseudoscorpion, &quot;various metallic beetles&quot;, earwigs, a tree seedling, Chironomia fly larva, an ant colony, an earthworm, numerous mites, and a small frog. Individual leaves are not divided and have parallel veins without cross connections. The epidermis of the leaf contains silica. Bromeliad flowers are aggregated into inflorescences of various forms. The flowers have bracts, often brightly coloured, and distinct calyces of three sepals and corollas of three petals. The flowers have nectaries. They are pollinated by insects, birds (often hummingbirds) or bats, or more rarely (in &quot;Navia&quot;) they are wind-pollinated. Fruits are variable, typically taking the form of a capsule or a berry.

Bromeliads are able to live in an array of environmental conditions due to their many adaptations. Trichomes, in the form of scales or hairs, allow bromeliads to capture water in cloud forests and help to reflect sunlight in desert environments. Bromeliads with leaf vases can capture water and nutrients in the absence of a well-developed root system. Many bromeliads also use crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis to create sugars. This adaptation allows bromeliads in hot or dry climates to open their stomata at night rather than during the day, which reduces water loss. Both CAM and epiphytism have evolved multiple times within the family, with some taxa reverting to C3 photosynthesis as they radiated into less arid climates.

==Evolution==
Bromeliads are among the more recent plant groups to have emerged. They are thought to have originated in the tepuis of the Guiana Shield approximately 100 million years ago. The greatest number of extant basal species are found in the Andean highlands of South America. However, the family did not diverge into its extant subfamilies until 19 million years ago. The long period between the origin and diversification of bromeliads, during which no extant species evolved, suggests that there was much speciation and extinction during that time, which would explain the genetic distance of the Bromeliaceae from other families within the Poales.

Based on molecular phylogenetic studies, the family is divided into eight subfamilies. The relationship among them is shown in the following cladogram.
The most basal genus, &quot;Brocchinia&quot; (subfamily Brocchinioideae), is endemic to the Guiana Shield, and is placed as the sister group to the remaining genera in the family. The subfamilies Lindmanioideae and Navioideae are endemic to the Guiana Shield as well.

The West African species &quot;Pitcairnia feliciana&quot; is the only bromeliad not endemic to the Americas, and is thought to have reached Africa via long-distance dispersal about 12 million years ago.

=== Radiation of Tillandsioideae and &quot;Hechtia&quot; ===
The first groups to leave the Guiana Shield were the subfamily Tillandsioideae, which spread gradually into northern South America, and the genus &quot;Hechtia&quot; (Hechtioideae), which spread to Central America via long-distance dispersal. Both of these movements occurred approximately 15.4 million years ago. When it reached the Andes mountains, the speciation of Tillandsioideae occurred quite rapidly, largely due to the Andean uplift, which was also occurring rapidly from 14.2 to 8.7 million years ago. The uplift greatly altered the region&#x27;s geological and climatic conditions, creating a new mountainous environment for the epiphytic tillandsioids to colonize. These new conditions directly drove the speciation of the Tillandsioideae, and also drove the speciation of their animal pollinators, such as hummingbirds.

=== Evolution of the Bromelioideae ===
Around 5.5 million years ago, a clade of epiphytic bromelioids arose in Serra do Mar, a lush mountainous region on the coast of Southeastern Brazil. This is thought to have been caused not only by the uplift of Serra do Mar itself at that time, but also because of the continued uplift of the distant Andes mountains, which impacted the circulation of air and created a cooler, wetter climate in Serra do Mar. These epiphytes thrived in this humid environment, since their trichomes rely on water in the air rather than from the ground like terrestrial plants. Many epiphytic bromeliads with the tank habit also speciated here.

Even before this, a few other bromelioids had already dispersed to the Brazilian shield while the climate was still arid, likely through a gradual process of short-distance dispersal. These make up the terrestrial members of the Bromelioideae, which have highly xeromorphic characters.

==Classification ==
The family Bromeliaceae is currently placed in the order Poales.

===Subfamilies===
The family Bromeliaceae is organized into eight subfamilies:

*Brocchinioideae
*Lindmanioideae
*Tillandsioideae
*Hechtioideae
*Navioideae
*Pitcairnioideae
*Puyoideae
*Bromelioideae

Bromeliaceae were originally split into three subfamilies based on morphological seed characters: Bromelioideae (seeds in baccate fruits), Tillandsioideae (plumose seeds), and Pitcairnioideae (seeds with wing-like appendages). However, molecular evidence has revealed that while Bromelioideae and Tillandsioideae are monophyletic, Pitcairnioideae as traditionally defined is paraphyletic and should be split into six subfamilies: Brocchinioideae, Lindmanioideae, Hechtioideae, Navioideae, Pitcairnioideae, and Puyoideae.

Brocchinioideae is defined as the most basal branch of Bromeliaceae based on both morphological and molecular evidence, namely genes in chloroplast DNA.

Lindmanioideae is the next most basal branch distinguished from the other subfamilies by convolute sepals and chloroplast DNA.

Hechtioideae is also defined based on analyses of chloroplast DNA; similar morphological adaptations to arid environments also found in other groups (namely the genus &quot;Puya)&quot; are attributed to convergent evolution.

Navioideae is split from Pitcairnioideae based on its cochlear sepals and chloroplast DNA.

Puyoideae has been re-classified multiple times and its monophyly remains controversial according to analyses of chloroplast DNA.

==Distribution and habitat==

Plants in the Bromeliaceae are widely represented in their natural climates across the Americas. One species (&quot;Pitcairnia feliciana&quot;) can be found in Africa. They can be found at altitudes from sea level to 4,200 meters, from rainforests to deserts. 1,814 species are epiphytes, some are lithophytes, and some are terrestrial. Accordingly, these plants can be found in the Andean highlands, from northern Chile to Colombia, in the Sechura Desert of coastal Peru, in the cloud forests of Central and South America, in southern United States from southern Virginia to Florida to Texas, and in far southern Arizona.

== Ecology ==
Bromeliads often serve as phytotelmata, accumulating water between their leaves. One study found 175,000 bromeliads per hectare (2.5 acres) in one forest; that many bromeliads can sequester 50,000 liters (more than 13,000 gallons) of water. The aquatic habitat created as a result is host to a diverse array of invertebrates, especially aquatic insect larvae, including those of mosquitos. These bromeliad invertebrates benefit their hosts by increasing nitrogen uptake into the plant. A study of 209 plants from the Yasuní Scientific Reserve in Ecuador identified 11,219 animals, representing more than 350 distinct species, many of which are found only on bromeliads. Examples include some species of ostracods, small salamanders about in length, and tree frogs. Jamaican bromeliads are home to &quot;Metopaulias depressus&quot;, a reddish-brown crab across, which has evolved social behavior to protect its young from predation by &quot;Diceratobasis macrogaster&quot;, a species of damselfly whose larvae live in bromeliads. Some bromeliads even form homes for other species of bromeliads.

Trees or branches that have a higher incidence of sunlight tend to have more bromeliads. In contrast, the sectors facing west receive less sunlight and therefore fewer bromeliads. In addition, thicker trees have more bromeliads, possibly because they are older and have greater structural complexity.

==Cultivation and uses==

Humans have been using bromeliads for thousands of years. The Incas, Aztecs, Maya and others used them for food, protection, fiber and ceremony, just as they are still used today. European interest began when Spanish conquistadors returned with pineapple, which became so popular as an exotic food that the image of the pineapple was adapted into European art and sculpture. In 1776, the species &quot;Guzmania lingulata&quot; was introduced to Europe, causing a sensation among gardeners unfamiliar with such a plant. In 1828, &quot;Aechmea fasciata&quot; was brought to Europe, followed by &quot;Vriesea splendens&quot; in 1840. These transplants were so successful, they are still among the most widely grown bromeliad varieties.

In the 19th century, breeders in Belgium, France and the Netherlands started hybridizing plants for wholesale trade. Many exotic varieties were produced until World War I, which halted breeding programs and led to the loss of some species. The plants experienced a resurgence of popularity after World War II. Since then, Dutch, Belgian and North American nurseries have greatly expanded bromeliad production.

Only one bromeliad, the pineapple (&quot;Ananas comosus&quot;), is a commercially important food crop. Bromelain, a common ingredient in meat tenderizer, is extracted from pineapple stems. Many other bromeliads are popular ornamental plants, grown as both garden and houseplants.

Bromeliads are important food plants for many peoples. For example, the Pima of Mexico occasionally consume flowers of &quot;Tillandsia erubescens&quot; and &quot;T. recurvata&quot; due to their high sugar content; in Argentina and Bolivia, the shoot apices of &quot;T. rubella&quot; and &quot;T. maxima&quot; are consumed; in Venezuela, indigenous coastal tribes eat a sour-tasting but sweet-smelling berry, known as &#x27;Maya&#x27;, of &quot;Bromelia chrysantha&quot; as a fruit or in fermented beverages; in Chile, the sweet fruit of &quot;Greigia sphacelata,&quot; known as &#x27;chupones&#x27;, is consumed raw.

===Collectors===
Édouard André was a French collector/explorer whose many discoveries of bromeliads in the Cordilleras of South America would be influential on horticulturists to follow. He served as a source of inspiration to 20th-century collectors, in particular Mulford B. Foster and Lyman Smith of the United States and Werner Rauh of Germany and Michelle Jenkins of Australia.

<text>The Chinese sovereign was the ruler of a particular monarchical regime in the historical periods of ancient China and imperial China. Sovereigns ruling the same regime, and descended from the same paternal line, constituted a dynasty. Several titles and naming schemes have been used throughout Chinese history.

==Sovereign titles==

===Emperor===

The characters &quot;Huang&quot; (皇 huáng &quot;august (ruler)&quot;) and &quot;Di&quot; (帝 dì &quot;divine ruler&quot;) had been used separately and never consecutively (see Three August Ones and Five Emperors). The character was reserved for mythological rulers until the first emperor of Qin (Qin Shi Huang), who created a new title &quot;Huangdi&quot; (皇帝 in pinyin: huáng dì) for himself in 221 BCE, which is commonly translated as &quot;Emperor&quot; in English. This title continued in use until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

From the Han dynasty, the title &quot;Huangdi&quot; could also be abbreviated to &quot;huang&quot; or &quot;di&quot;. The former nobility titles &quot;Qing&quot; (卿), &quot;Daifu&quot; (大夫) and &quot;Shi&quot; (仕) became synonyms for court officials.

The power of the emperor varied between emperors and dynasties, with some emperors being absolute rulers and others being figureheads with actual power lying in the hands of court factions, eunuchs, the bureaucracy or noble families. In principle, the title of emperor was transmitted from father to son via primogeniture, as endorsed by Confucianism. However, there are many exceptions to this rule. For example, because the Emperor usually had many concubines, the first born of the empress (i.e. the chief consort) is usually the heir apparent. However, Emperors could elevate another more favoured child or the child of a favourite concubine to the status of Crown Prince. Disputes over succession occurred regularly and have led to a number of civil wars. In the Qing dynasty, primogeniture was abandoned altogether, with the designated heir kept secret until after the Emperor&#x27;s death.

Of the San Huang Wu Di, the three first of them were called 皇 (huang, &quot;august (ruler)&quot;) and the five last were called 帝 (di, &quot;divine ruler&quot;), which can translate as either emperor, demigod, divine ancestor, or superhuman. This title may have been used in the Shang and Xia dynasties, though oracle bones were found from the Shang dynasty showing the title 王 (wáng, &quot;king&quot;).

===King===
The king (王, &quot;wáng&quot;) was the Chinese head of state during the Zhou dynasty. Its use during the Xia and Shang is uncertain but possible: the character has been found upon oracle bones. It was abolished under the Qin and, after that, the same term was used for (and translated as) royal princes. The title was commonly given to members of the Emperor&#x27;s family and could be inherited. A poem from about 2,500 years ago said &quot;普天之下,莫非王土.率土之賓,莫非王臣&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;Under the sky, nothing isn&#x27;t the king&#x27;s land; the people who lead the lands, no one isn&#x27;t the king&#x27;s subjects.&quot;

===Son of Heaven===
&quot;Son of Heaven&quot; was a title of the Emperor based on the Mandate of Heaven. The Son of Heaven is a universal emperor who rules tianxia comprising &quot;all under heaven&quot;. The title was not interpreted literally. The monarch is a mortal chosen by Heaven, not its actual descendant. The title comes from the Mandate of Heaven, created by the monarchs of the Zhou dynasty to justify deposing the Shang dynasty. They declared that Heaven had revoked the mandate from the Shang and given it to the Zhou in retaliation for their corruption and misrule. Heaven bestowed the mandate to whoever was best fit to rule. The title held the emperor responsible for the prosperity and security of his people through the threat of losing the mandate.

Unlike with over sovereigns such as the Emperor of Japan, Chinese political theory allowed for dynastic change, based on the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. The theory behind this was that the Chinese emperor acted as the Son of Heaven. As the only legitimate ruler, his authority extended to &quot;all under heaven&quot; and had neighbors only in a geographical sense. He holds a mandate to which he had a valid claim to rule over (or to lead) everyone else in the world as long as he served the people well. If the ruler became immoral, then rebellion is justified and heaven would take away that mandate and give it to another. This single most important concept legitimized the dynastic cycle or the change of dynasties regardless of social or ethnic background. This principle made it possible for dynasties founded by families of non-noble origins such as the Han dynasty and the Ming dynasty or non-ethnic Han dynasties such as the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. It was moral integrity and benevolent leadership that determined the holder of the Mandate of Heaven. Every dynasty that self-consciously adopted this administrative practice powerfully reinforced this Sinocentric concept throughout the history of imperial China. Historians noted that this was one of the key reasons why imperial China in many ways had the most efficient system of government in ancient times.

It was generally not possible for a woman to succeed to the throne and in the history of China; there has only been one reigning Empress, Wu Zetian (624–705), who usurped the throne of the Tang dynasty by establishing her own Wu Zhou dynasty.

==Monarchical titles==
Chinese monarchs possessed an elaborate set of monarchical titles, both when they were alive and after their death. Based on Chinese historiographical convention, monarchs of China are typically referred to by one of their many titles, although it is not incorrect per se to reference them using other titles that they held. Even though exceptions exist, Chinese rulers until the end of the Sui dynasty are mainly referred to by their posthumous names, monarchs from the Tang dynasty to the Yuan dynasty are generally known by their temple names, while rulers from the Ming dynasty onwards are typically known by their era names. As some of these titles were used repeatedly throughout history, historians often reference the name of the regime to avoid potential confusion. The same monarchical tradition was adopted throughout the Chinese cultural sphere.

General format in Mandarin Chinese:


===Regnal name===
Regnal names (; ) were monarchical titles adopted during the reign of monarchs or after their abdication. Due to naming taboo, regnal names were the most straightforward method Chinese rulers could be referred to during their regimes.

===Era name===

Era names (; ) were proclaimed by Chinese sovereigns for the purpose of identifying and numbering years since 140 BC, during the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han. Strictly speaking, era names were not personal titles of Chinese monarchs per se. However, as most rulers of the Ming and Qing dynasties adopted only one era name throughout the entirety of their reigns, era names have come to be closely associated with Ming and Qing monarchs, to the extent that they are frequently referenced using their respective era names by historians.

Although a specific era name could be used by one monarch only, there were also many instances in which an era name was used by multiple monarchs, or a monarch could proclaim numerous era names throughout his/her reign. For this reason, it would be tedious for Chinese monarchs before the Ming dynasty to be referred to by their era names.

===Temple name===
Temple names (; ) were accorded to Chinese monarchs after their death, for the purpose of ancestor worship. Temple names consisted of two or three Chinese characters, with the last word being either (; &quot;progenitor&quot;) or (; &quot;ancestor&quot;).

===Posthumous name===

Posthumous names (; ) were accorded to Chinese monarchs after their death. These were adjectives originally intended to determine the achievements and moral values, or the lack thereof, of one&#x27;s life.

===Historiographical denomination===
Historians sometimes refer to certain Chinese rulers using generic terms, mostly due to their lack of regnal name, temple name or posthumous name. These terms describe the circumstances of the monarchs and are not officially accorded by the regimes themselves. The monarchical rank held by the rulers is affixed to the back of these adjectives to form the full historiographical denominations. For example, &quot; () is formed from the amalgamation of &quot; (; &quot;deposed&quot;) and the abbreviated form of &quot;&quot; (; &quot;emperor&quot;), thus is used to refer to monarchs who were overthrown.

<text>In computer science, an LL parser (Left-to-right, leftmost derivation) is a top-down parser for a restricted context-free language. It parses the input from Left to right, performing [[LL parser|L]]eftmost derivation of the sentence.

An LL parser is called an LL(&quot;k&quot;) parser if it uses &quot;k&quot; tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence. A grammar is called an LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammar if an LL(&quot;k&quot;) parser can be constructed from it. A formal language is called an LL(&quot;k&quot;) language if it has an LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammar. The set of LL(&quot;k&quot;) languages is properly contained in that of LL(&quot;k&quot;+1) languages, for each &quot;k&quot; ≥ 0. A corollary of this is that not all context-free languages can be recognized by an LL(&quot;k&quot;) parser.

An LL parser is called LL-regular (LLR) if it parses an LL-regular language. The class of LLR grammars contains every LL(k) grammar for every k. For every LLR grammar there exists an LLR parser that parses the grammar in linear time.

Two nomenclative outlier parser types are LL(*) and LL(finite). A parser is called LL(*)/LL(finite) if it uses the LL(*)/LL(finite) parsing strategy. LL(*) and LL(finite) parsers are functionally closer to PEG parsers. An LL(finite) parser can parse an arbitrary LL(k) grammar optimally in the amount of lookahead and lookahead comparisons. The class of grammars parsable by the LL(*) strategy encompasses some context-sensitive languages due to the use of syntactic and semantic predicates and has not been identified. It has been suggested that LL(*) parsers are better thought of as TDPL parsers.
Against the popular misconception, LL(*) parsers are not LLR in general, and are guaranteed by construction to perform worse on average (super-linear against linear time) and far worse in the worst-case (exponential against linear time).

LL grammars, particularly LL(1) grammars, are of great practical interest, as parsers for these grammars are easy to construct, and many computer languages are designed to be LL(1) for this reason. LL parsers may be table-based, i.e. similar to LR parsers, but LL grammars can also be parsed by recursive descent parsers. According to Waite and Goos (1984), LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars were introduced by Stearns and Lewis (1969).

== Overview ==

For a given context-free grammar, the parser attempts to find the leftmost derivation.
Given an example grammar formula_1:

# formula_2
# formula_3
# formula_4

the leftmost derivation for formula_5 is:

:formula_6

Generally, there are multiple possibilities when selecting a rule to expand the leftmost non-terminal. In step 2 of the previous example, the parser must choose whether to apply rule 2 or rule 3:

:formula_7

To be efficient, the parser must be able to make this choice deterministically when possible, without backtracking. For some grammars, it can do this by peeking on the unread input (without reading). In our example, if the parser knows that the next unread symbol is formula_8 , the only correct rule that can be used is 2.

Generally, an formula_9 parser can look ahead at formula_10 symbols. However, given a grammar, the problem of determining if there exists a formula_9 parser for some formula_10 that recognizes it is undecidable. For each formula_10, there is a language that cannot be recognized by an formula_9 parser, but can be by an formula_15.

We can use the above analysis to give the following formal definition:

Let formula_1 be a context-free grammar and formula_17. We say that formula_1 is formula_9, if and only if for any two leftmost derivations:

# formula_20
# formula_21

the following condition holds: the prefix of the string formula_22 of length formula_10 equals the prefix of the string formula_24 of length formula_10 implies formula_26.

In this definition, formula_27 is the start symbol and formula_28 any non-terminal. The already derived input formula_29, and yet unread formula_22 and formula_31 are strings of terminals. The Greek letters formula_32, formula_33 and formula_34 represent any string of both terminals and non-terminals (possibly empty). The prefix length corresponds to the lookahead buffer size, and the definition says that this buffer is enough to distinguish between any two derivations of different words.

== Parser ==

The formula_9 parser is a deterministic pushdown automaton with the ability to peek on the next formula_10 input symbols without reading. This peek capability can be emulated by storing the lookahead buffer contents in the finite state space, since both buffer and input alphabet are finite in size. As a result, this does not make the automaton more powerful, but is a convenient abstraction.

The stack alphabet is formula_37, where:
* formula_38 is the set of non-terminals;
* formula_39 the set of terminal (input) symbols with a special end-of-input (EOI) symbol formula_40.
The parser stack initially contains the starting symbol above the EOI: formula_41. During operation, the parser repeatedly replaces the symbol formula_42 on top of the stack:
* with some formula_32, if formula_44 and there is a rule formula_45;
* with formula_46 (in some notations formula_47), i.e. formula_42 is popped off the stack, if formula_49. In this case, an input symbol formula_50 is read and if formula_51, the parser rejects the input.
If the last symbol to be removed from the stack is the EOI, the parsing is successful; the automaton accepts via an empty stack.

The states and the transition function are not explicitly given; they are specified (generated) using a more convenient &quot;parse table&quot; instead. The table provides the following mapping:
* row: top-of-stack symbol formula_42
* column: formula_53 lookahead buffer contents
* cell: rule number for formula_45 or formula_46
If the parser cannot perform a valid transition, the input is rejected (empty cells). To make the table more compact, only the non-terminal rows are commonly displayed, since the action is the same for terminals.

== Concrete example ==

=== Set up ===
To explain an LL(1) parser&#x27;s workings we will consider the following small LL(1) grammar:

# S → F
# S → ( S + F )
# F → a

and parse the following input:

:( a + a )

An LL(1) parsing table for a grammar has a row for each of the non-terminals and a column for each terminal (including the special terminal, represented here as $, that is used to indicate the end of the input stream).

Each cell of the table may point to at most one rule of the grammar (identified by its number). For example, in the parsing table for the above grammar, the cell for the non-terminal &#x27;S&#x27; and terminal &#x27;(&#x27; points to the rule number 2:

The algorithm to construct a parsing table is described in a later section, but first let&#x27;s see how the parser uses the parsing table to process its input.

=== Parsing procedure ===

In each step, the parser reads the next-available symbol from the input stream, and the top-most symbol from the stack. If the input symbol and the stack-top symbol match, the parser discards them both, leaving only the unmatched symbols in the input stream and on the stack.

Thus, in its first step, the parser reads the input symbol &#x27;(&#x27; and the stack-top symbol &#x27;S&#x27;. The parsing table instruction comes from the column headed by the input symbol &#x27;(&#x27; and the row headed by the stack-top symbol &#x27;S&#x27;; this cell contains &#x27;2&#x27;, which instructs the parser to apply rule (2). The parser has to rewrite &#x27;S&#x27; to &#x27;( S + F )&#x27; on the stack by removing &#x27;S&#x27; from stack and pushing &#x27;)&#x27;, &#x27;F&#x27;, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27; onto the stack, and this writes the rule number 2 to the output. The stack then becomes:

 [ (, S, +, F, ), $ ]

In the second step, the parser removes the &#x27;(&#x27; from its input stream and from its stack, since they now match. The stack now becomes:

 [ S, +, F, ), $ ]

Now the parser has an &#x27;a&#x27; on its input stream and an &#x27;S&#x27; as its stack top. The parsing table instructs it to apply rule (1) from the grammar and write the rule number 1 to the output stream. The stack becomes:

 [ F, +, F, ), $ ]

The parser now has an &#x27;a&#x27; on its input stream and an &#x27;F&#x27; as its stack top. The parsing table instructs it to apply rule (3) from the grammar and write the rule number 3 to the output stream. The stack becomes:

 [ a, +, F, ), $ ]

The parser now has an &#x27;a&#x27; on the input stream and an &#x27;a&#x27; at its stack top. Because they are the same, it removes it from the input stream and pops it from the top of the stack. The parser then has an &#x27;+&#x27; on the input stream and &#x27;+&#x27; is at the top of the stack meaning, like with &#x27;a&#x27;, it is popped from the stack and removed from the input stream. This results in:

 [ F, ), $ ]

In the next three steps the parser will replace &#x27;F&#x27; on the stack by &#x27;a&#x27;, write the rule number 3 to the output stream and remove the &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;)&#x27; from both the stack and the input stream. The parser thus ends with &#x27;$&#x27; on both its stack and its input stream.

In this case the parser will report that it has accepted the input string and write the following list of rule numbers to the output stream:

: [ 2, 1, 3, 3 ]

This is indeed a list of rules for a leftmost derivation of the input string, which is:

: S → ( S + F ) → ( F + F ) → ( a + F ) → ( a + a )

===Parser implementation in C++===

Below follows a C++ implementation of a table-based LL parser for the example language:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;stack&gt;

enum Symbols {
 // the symbols:
 // Terminal symbols:
 TS_L_PARENS, // (
 TS_R_PARENS, // )
 TS_A, // a
 TS_PLUS, // +
 TS_EOS, // $, in this case corresponds to &#x27;\0&#x27;
 TS_INVALID, // invalid token

 // Non-terminal symbols:
 NTS_S, // S
 NTS_F // F

Converts a valid token to the corresponding terminal symbol
Symbols lexer(char c)
 switch (c)
 case &#x27;(&#x27;: return TS_L_PARENS;
 case &#x27;)&#x27;: return TS_R_PARENS;
 case &#x27;a&#x27;: return TS_A;
 case &#x27;+&#x27;: return TS_PLUS;
 case &#x27;\0&#x27;: return TS_EOS; // end of stack: the $ terminal symbol
 default: return TS_INVALID;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
 using namespace std;

 if (argc &lt; 2)
 cout « &quot;usage:\n\tll &#x27;(a+a)&#x27;&quot; « endl;
 return 0;

 // initialize the symbols stack
 ss.push(TS_EOS); // terminal, $
 ss.push(NTS_S); // non-terminal, S

 // initialize the symbol stream cursor
 p = &amp;argv[1][0];

 // set up the parsing table
 table[NTS_S][TS_L_PARENS] = 2;
 table[NTS_S][TS_A] = 1;
 table[NTS_F][TS_A] = 3;

 while (ss.size() &gt; 0)
 if (lexer(*p) == ss.top())
 cout « &quot;Matched symbols: &quot; « lexer(*p) « endl;
 p++;
 ss.pop();
 else
 cout « &quot;Rule &quot; « table[ss.top()][lexer(*p)] « endl;
 switch (table[ss.top()][lexer(*p)])
 case 1: // 1. S → F
 ss.pop();
 ss.push(NTS_F); // F
 break;

 case 2: // 2. S → ( S + F )
 ss.pop();
 ss.push(TS_R_PARENS); // )
 ss.push(NTS_F); // F

 ss.push(NTS_S); // S
 ss.push(TS_L_PARENS); // (
 break;

 case 3: // 3. F → a
 ss.pop();
 ss.push(TS_A); // a
 break;

 default:
 cout « &quot;parsing table defaulted&quot; « endl;
 return 0;
 }

 cout « &quot;finished parsing&quot; « endl;

== Remarks ==

As can be seen from the example, the parser performs three types of steps depending on whether the top of the stack is a nonterminal, a terminal or the special symbol $:
* If the top is a nonterminal then the parser looks up in the parsing table, on the basis of this nonterminal and the symbol on the input stream, which rule of the grammar it should use to replace nonterminal on the stack. The number of the rule is written to the output stream. If the parsing table indicates that there is no such rule then the parser reports an error and stops.
* If the top is a terminal then the parser compares it to the symbol on the input stream and if they are equal they are both removed. If they are not equal the parser reports an error and stops.
* If the top is $ and on the input stream there is also a $ then the parser reports that it has successfully parsed the input, otherwise it reports an error. In both cases the parser will stop.
These steps are repeated until the parser stops, and then it will have either completely parsed the input and written a leftmost derivation to the output stream or it will have reported an error.

== Constructing an LL(1) parsing table ==

In order to fill the parsing table, we have to establish what grammar rule the parser should choose if it sees a nonterminal &quot;A&quot; on the top of its stack and a symbol &quot;a&quot; on its input stream.
It is easy to see that such a rule should be of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; and that the language corresponding to &quot;w&quot; should have at least one string starting with &quot;a&quot;.
For this purpose we define the &quot;First-set&quot; of &quot;w&quot;, written here as Fi(&quot;w&quot;), as the set of terminals that can be found at the start of some string in &quot;w&quot;, plus ε if the empty string also belongs to &quot;w&quot;.
Given a grammar with the rules &quot;A&quot;1 → &quot;w&quot;1, …, &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;w&quot;&quot;n&quot;, we can compute the Fi(&quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;) and Fi(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) for every rule as follows:
# initialize every Fi(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) with the empty set
# add Fi(&quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;) to Fi(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) for every rule &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; → &quot;w&quot;i, where Fi is defined as follows:
#* Fi(&quot;aw&quot;&#x27;) = { &quot;a&quot; } for every terminal &quot;a&quot;
#* Fi(&quot;Aw) = Fi(&quot;A&quot;) for every nonterminal &quot;A&quot; with ε not in Fi&quot;&#x27;(&quot;A&quot;)
#* Fi(&quot;Aw&#x27; &quot;) = (Fi(&quot;A&quot;) \ { ε }) ∪ Fi(&quot;w&#x27; &quot;) for every nonterminal &quot;A&quot; with ε in Fi(&quot;A&quot;)
#* Fi(ε) = { ε }
# add Fi(&quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;) to Fi(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) for every rule &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; → &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;
# do steps 2 and 3 until all Fi sets stay the same.
The result is the least fixed point solution to the following system:
* Fi(&quot;A&quot;) ⊇ Fi(&quot;w&quot;) for each rule A → &quot;w&quot;
* Fi(&quot;a&quot;) ⊇ { &quot;a&quot; }, for each terminal &quot;a&quot;
* Fi(&quot;w&quot;0 &quot;w&quot;1) ⊇ Fi(&quot;w&quot;0)·Fi(&quot;w1&quot;), for all words &quot;w&quot;0 and &quot;w&quot;1
* Fi(ε) ⊇ {ε}
where, for sets of words U and V, the truncated product is defined by formula_56, and w:1 denotes the initial length-1 prefix of words w of length 2 or more, or w, itself, if w has length 0 or 1.

Unfortunately, the First-sets are not sufficient to compute the parsing table.
This is because a right-hand side &quot;w&quot; of a rule might ultimately be rewritten to the empty string.
So the parser should also use the rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; if ε is in Fi(&quot;w&quot;) and it sees on the input stream a symbol that could follow &quot;A&quot;. Therefore, we also need the &quot;Follow-set&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, written as Fo(&quot;A&quot;) here, which is defined as the set of terminals &quot;a&quot; such that there is a string of symbols &quot;αAaβ&quot; that can be derived from the start symbol. We use $ as a special terminal indicating end of input stream, and &quot;S&quot; as start symbol.

Computing the Follow-sets for the nonterminals in a grammar can be done as follows:
# initialize Fo(&quot;S&quot;) with { $ } and every other Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) with the empty set
# if there is a rule of the form &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot; → &quot;wAiw&#x27; &quot;, then
#* if the terminal &quot;a&quot; is in Fi(&quot;w&#x27; &quot;), then add &quot;a&quot; to Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;)
#* if ε is in Fi(&quot;w&#x27; &quot;), then add Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;) to Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;)
#* if &quot;w&#x27; &quot; has length 0, then add Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;) to Fo(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;)
# repeat step 2 until all Fo sets stay the same.
This provides the least fixed point solution to the following system:
* Fo(&quot;S&quot;) ⊇ {$}
* Fo(&quot;A&quot;) ⊇ Fi(&quot;w&quot;)·Fo(&quot;B&quot;) for each rule of the form B → ... A w
Now we can define exactly which rules will appear where in the parsing table.
If &quot;T&quot;[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;] denotes the entry in the table for nonterminal &quot;A&quot; and terminal &quot;a&quot;, then
: &quot;T&quot;[&quot;A&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] contains the rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; if and only if
:: &quot;a&quot; is in Fi(&quot;w&quot;) or
:: ε is in Fi(&quot;w&quot;) and &quot;a&quot; is in Fo(&quot;A&quot;).
Equivalently: &quot;T&quot;[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;] contains the rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; for each &quot;a&quot; ∈ Fi(&quot;w&quot;)·Fo(&quot;A&quot;).

If the table contains at most one rule in every one of its cells, then the parser will always know which rule it has to use and can therefore parse strings without backtracking.
It is in precisely this case that the grammar is called an &quot;LL&quot;(1) &quot;grammar&quot;.

== Constructing an LL(&quot;k&quot;) parsing table ==

The construction for LL(1) parsers can be adapted to LL(&quot;k&quot;) for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 with the following modifications:
* the truncated product is defined formula_57, where w:k denotes the initial length-k prefix of words of length &gt; k, or w, itself, if w has length k or less,
* Fo(&quot;S&quot;) = {$k}
* Apply Fi(αβ) = Fi(α)formula_58Fi(β) also in step 2 of the Fi construction given for LL(1).
* In step 2 of the Fo construction, for &quot;Aj&quot; → &quot;wAiw&#x27;&quot; simply add Fi(&quot;w&#x27;&quot;)formula_58Fo(&quot;Aj&quot;) to Fo(&quot;Ai&quot;).
where an input is suffixed by k end-markers $, to fully account for the k lookahead context. This approach eliminates special cases for ε, and can be applied equally well in the LL(1) case.

Until the mid-1990s, it was widely believed that (for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1) was impractical, since the parser table would have exponential size in &quot;k&quot; in the worst case. This perception changed gradually after the release of the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set around 1992, when it was demonstrated that many programming languages can be parsed efficiently by an LL(&quot;k&quot;) parser without triggering the worst-case behavior of the parser. Moreover, in certain cases LL parsing is feasible even with unlimited lookahead. By contrast, traditional parser generators like yacc use LALR(1) parser tables to construct a restricted LR parser with a fixed one-token lookahead.

== Conflicts ==

As described in the introduction, LL(1) parsers recognize languages that have LL(1) grammars, which are a special case of context-free grammars; LL(1) parsers cannot recognize all context-free languages. The LL(1) languages are a proper subset of the LR(1) languages, which in turn are a proper subset of all context-free languages. In order for a context-free grammar to be an LL(1) grammar, certain conflicts must not arise, which we describe in this section.

=== Terminology ===

Let &quot;A&quot; be a non-terminal. FIRST(&quot;A&quot;) is (defined to be) the set of terminals that can appear in the first position of any string derived from &quot;A&quot;. FOLLOW(&quot;A&quot;) is the union over:
# FIRST(&quot;B&quot;) where &quot;B&quot; is any non-terminal that immediately follows &quot;A&quot; in the right-hand side of a production rule.
# FOLLOW(&quot;B&quot;) where &quot;B&quot; is any head of a rule of the form &quot;B&quot; → &quot;wA&quot;.

=== LL(1) conflicts ===

There are two main types of LL(1) conflicts:

==== FIRST/FIRST conflict ====
The FIRST sets of two different grammar rules for the same non-terminal intersect.
An example of an LL(1) FIRST/FIRST conflict:
 S -&gt; E | E &#x27;a&#x27;
 E -&gt; &#x27;b&#x27; | ε
FIRST(&quot;E&quot;) = {&quot;b&quot;, ε} and FIRST(&quot;E&quot; &quot;a&quot;) = {&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;}, so when the table is drawn, there is conflict under terminal &quot;b&quot; of production rule &quot;S&quot;.

===== Special case: left recursion =====

Left recursion will cause a FIRST/FIRST conflict with all alternatives.
 E -&gt; E &#x27;+&#x27; term | alt1 | alt2

==== FIRST/FOLLOW conflict ====
The FIRST and FOLLOW set of a grammar rule overlap. With an empty string (ε) in the FIRST set, it is unknown which alternative to select.
An example of an LL(1) conflict:
 S -&gt; A &#x27;a&#x27; &#x27;b&#x27;
 A -&gt; &#x27;a&#x27; | ε
The FIRST set of &quot;A&quot; is {&quot;a&quot;, ε}, and the FOLLOW set is {&quot;a&quot;}.

=== Solutions to LL(1) conflicts ===

==== Left factoring ====

A common left-factor is &quot;factored out&quot;.
 A -&gt; X | X Y Z
becomes
 A -&gt; X B
 B -&gt; Y Z | ε
Can be applied when two alternatives start with the same symbol like a FIRST/FIRST conflict.

Another example (more complex) using above FIRST/FIRST conflict example:
 S -&gt; E | E &#x27;a&#x27;
 E -&gt; &#x27;b&#x27; | ε
becomes (merging into a single non-terminal)
 S -&gt; &#x27;b&#x27; | ε | &#x27;b&#x27; &#x27;a&#x27; | &#x27;a&#x27;
then through left-factoring, becomes
 S -&gt; &#x27;b&#x27; E | E
 E -&gt; &#x27;a&#x27; | ε

==== Substitution ====
Substituting a rule into another rule to remove indirect or FIRST/FOLLOW conflicts.
Note that this may cause a FIRST/FIRST conflict.

==== Left recursion removal ====
See.

For a general method, see removing left recursion.
A simple example for left recursion removal:
The following production rule has left recursion on E
 E -&gt; E &#x27;+&#x27; T
 E -&gt; T
This rule is nothing but list of Ts separated by &#x27;+&#x27;. In a regular expression form T (&#x27;+&#x27; T)*.
So the rule could be rewritten as 
 E -&gt; T Z
 Z -&gt; &#x27;+&#x27; T Z
 Z -&gt; ε
Now there is no left recursion and no conflicts on either of the rules.

However, not all context-free grammars have an equivalent LL(k)-grammar, e.g.:
 S -&gt; A | B
 A -&gt; &#x27;a&#x27; A &#x27;b&#x27; | ε
 B -&gt; &#x27;a&#x27; B &#x27;b&#x27; &#x27;b&#x27; | ε
It can be shown that there does not exist any LL(k)-grammar accepting the language generated by this grammar.

<doc id="58046" wikidata="Q930352" url="?curid=58046" title="Figure-eight knot">
<text>The figure-eight knot or figure-of-eight knot is a type of stopper knot. It is very important in both sailing and rock climbing as a method of stopping ropes from running out of retaining devices. Like the overhand knot, which will jam under strain, often requiring the rope to be cut, the figure-eight will also jam, but is usually more easily undone than the overhand knot.

The stevedore knot is an extension of simple figure-eight knot with an additional turn before the end is finally tightened.

== Different types ==

=== Figure-eight loop ===

The figure-eight loop is used like an overhand loop knot. This type of knot can be used in prusik climbing when used in conjunction with a climbing harness, a climbing rope, and locking carabiner designed for climbing, to ascend or descend with minimal equipment and effort.

=== Figure-eight bend ===

The figure-eight bend knot is used to &quot;splice&quot; together two ropes, not necessarily of equal diameter. This knot is tied starting with a loose figure-eight knot on one rope (the larger-diameter one if unequal), and threading of the other rope&#x27;s running end through the first figure eight, starting at the first figure-eight&#x27;s running end and paralleling the path of the first rope through the figure eight until the second&#x27;s ropes running end lies parallel against first&#x27;s standing end. The result is two figure-eight knots, each partly inside the other and tightening its hold on the other when they are pulled in opposite directions. This can be a permanent or temporary splice. While it precludes the ropes&#x27; slipping relative to each other, it is a typical knot in having less strength than the straight ropes.

===Offset figure-eight bend ===

The offset figure-eight bend is a poor knot that has been implicated in the deaths of several rock climbers.

=== Stein knot ===
The stein knot (also known as a stone knot) is a variation of the figure-eight knot. It is used to secure a rope that is already passed around a post or through a ring. It is quick and easy to tie and untie. It is a device rigging rather than a true knot. In canyoneering, it is used to isolate rope strands to allow one person to rappel while another is getting on the rappel, or allow rappellers the option of using a single or a double rope. It is also used in basketmaking.

==Symbolic use==
* In heraldry, this knot is known as Savoy knot.
* In the United States Navy, a figure-of-eight badge was formerly worn by enlisted men who had successfully completed the apprentice rating. 
* In The Scout Association in the United Kingdom, awards for gallantry and long service are represented by a cloth figure-of-eight knot emblem in various colours.

<doc id="58055" wikidata="Q44725" url="?curid=58055" title="Bering Sea">
<text>The Bering Sea ( , ; ) is a marginal sea of the Northern Pacific Ocean. It forms, along with the Bering Strait, the divide between the two largest landmasses on Earth: Eurasia and the Americas. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. The Bering Sea is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian navigator, who, in 1728, was the first European to systematically explore it, sailing from the Pacific Ocean northward to the Arctic Ocean.

The Bering Sea is separated from the Gulf of Alaska by the Alaska Peninsula. It covers over and is bordered on the east and northeast by Alaska, on the west by the Russian Far East and the Kamchatka Peninsula, on the south by the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands and on the far north by the Bering Strait, which connects the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean&#x27;s Chukchi Sea. Bristol Bay is the portion of the Bering Sea between the Alaska Peninsula and Cape Newenham on mainland Southwest Alaska.

The Bering Sea ecosystem includes resources within the jurisdiction of the United States and Russia, as well as international waters in the middle of the sea (known as the &quot;Donut Hole&quot;). The interaction between currents, sea ice, and weather makes for a vigorous and productive ecosystem.

==History==
Most scientists think that during the most recent ice age, sea level was low enough to allow humans to migrate east on foot from Asia to North America across what is now the Bering Strait. Other animals including megafauna migrated in both directions. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;Bering land bridge&quot; and is accepted by most, though not all scientists, to be the first point of entry of humans into the Americas.

There is a small portion of the Kula Plate in the Bering Sea. The Kula Plate is an ancient tectonic plate that used to subduct under Alaska.

On 18 December 2018, a large meteor exploded above the Bering Sea. The meteor exploded at an altitude of 25.6km, releasing 49 kilotons of energy.

==Geography==
===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bering Sea as follows:

::&quot;On the North.&quot; The Southern limit of the Chuckchi Sea [The Arctic Circle between Siberia and Alaska]

::&quot;On the South.&quot; A line running from Kabuch Point () in the Alaskan Peninsula, through the Aleutian Islands to the South extremes of the Komandorski Islands and on to Cape Kamchatka in such a way that all the narrow waters between Alaska and Kamchatka are included in the Bering Sea.

===Islands===
Islands of the Bering Sea include:
* Pribilof Islands, including St. Paul Island
* Komandorski Islands, including Bering Island
* St. Lawrence Island
* Diomede Islands
* King Island
* St. Matthew Island
* Karaginsky Island
* Nunivak Island
* Sledge Island
* Hagemeister Island

===Regions===
Regions of the Bering Sea include:
* Bering Strait
* Bristol Bay
* Gulf of Anadyr
* Norton Sound

The Bering Sea contains 16 submarine canyons including the largest submarine canyon in the world, Zhemchug Canyon.



==Ecosystem==
The Bering Sea shelf break is the dominant driver of primary productivity in the Bering Sea. This zone, where the shallower continental shelf drops off into the North Aleutians Basin is also known as the &quot;Greenbelt&quot;. Nutrient upwelling from the cold waters of the Aleutian basin flowing up the slope and mixing with shallower waters of the shelf provide for constant production of phytoplankton.

The second driver of productivity in the Bering Sea is seasonal sea ice that, in part, triggers the spring phytoplankton bloom. Seasonal melting of sea ice causes an influx of lower salinity water into the middle and other shelf areas, causing stratification and hydrographic effects which influence productivity. In addition to the hydrographic and productivity influence of melting sea ice, the ice itself also provides an attachment substrate for the growth of algae as well as interstitial ice algae.

Some evidence suggests that great changes to the Bering Sea ecosystem have already occurred. Warm water conditions in the summer of 1997 resulted in a massive bloom of low energy coccolithophorid phytoplankton (Stockwell et al. 2001). A long record of carbon isotopes, which is reflective of primary production trends of the Bering Sea, exists from historical samples of bowhead whale baleen. Trends in carbon isotope ratios in whale baleen samples suggest that a 30–40% decline in average seasonal primary productivity has occurred over the last 50 years. The implication is that the carrying capacity of the Bering Sea is much lower now than it has been in the past.

==Biodiversity==
The sea supports many whale species, including the beluga, humpback whale, bowhead whale, gray whale and blue whale, the vulnerable sperm whale, and the endangered fin whale, sei whale and the rarest in the world, the North Pacific right whale. Other marine mammals include walrus, Steller sea lion, northern fur seal, orca and polar bear.

The Bering Sea is very important to the seabirds of the world. Over 30 species of seabirds and approximately 20 million individuals breed in the Bering Sea region. Seabird species include tufted puffins, the endangered short-tailed albatross, spectacled eider, and red-legged kittiwakes. Many of these species are unique to the area, which provides highly productive foraging habitat, particularly along the shelf edge and in other nutrient-rich upwelling regions, such as the Pribilof, Zhemchug, and Pervenets canyons. The Bering Sea is also home to colonies of crested auklets, with upwards of a million individuals.

Two Bering Sea species, the Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;) and spectacled cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax perspicillatus&quot;), are extinct because of overexploitation by man. In addition, a small subspecies of Canada goose, the Bering Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis asiatica&quot;) is extinct due to overhunting and the introduction of rats to their breeding islands.

The Bering Sea supports many species of fish, some of which support large and valuable commercial fisheries. Commercial fish species include Pacific cod, several species of flatfish, sablefish, Pacific salmon, and Pacific herring. Shellfish include red king crab and snow crab.

Fish biodiversity is high, and at least 419 species of fish have been reported from the Bering Sea.

==Fisheries==
The Bering Sea is world-renowned for its productive and profitable fisheries, such as king crab, opilio and tanner crabs, Bristol Bay salmon, pollock and other groundfish. These fisheries rely on the productivity of the Bering Sea via a complicated and little understood food web. 

Commercial fishing is lucrative business in the Bering Sea, which is relied upon by the largest seafood companies in the world to produce fish and shellfish. On the U.S. side, commercial fisheries catch approximately $1 billion worth of seafood annually, while Russian Bering Sea fisheries are worth approximately $600 million annually.

The Bering Sea also serves as the central location of the Alaskan king crab and snow crab seasons, which are chronicled on the Discovery Channel television program &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;. Landings from Alaskan waters represents half the U.S. catch of fish and shellfish.

==Change==
Because of the changes going on in the Arctic, the future evolution of the Bering Sea climate and ecosystem is uncertain. Between 1979 and 2012, the region experienced small growth in sea ice extent, standing in contrast to the substantial loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean to the north.

==In media==
&#x27;The White Seal&#x27;, one of many chapters on Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, features the Bering Sea as the birthplace and homeland of Kotick, a rare white fur seal.

The film &quot;Harbinger Down&quot;, which was released on August 7, 2015, was about a group of grad students who booked passage on the crabbing boat Harbinger to study the effects of global warming on a pod of beluga whales in the Bering Sea.

One of the central characters in the 1949 film &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; has the given name &quot;Bering&quot; due to having been born in a ship crossing the Bering Sea.

The 2002 supernatural thriller, &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, directed by Steve Beck, follows a marine salvage crew in the Bering Sea who discover the lost Italian ocean liner, &quot;Antonia Graza&quot; that disappeared in 1962.

<text>Marion County is a county located in the North Central region of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 375,908. Its county seat is Ocala. Marion County comprises the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It includes part of Ocala National Forest, which also extends into three other counties.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Evidence of ancient indigenous cultures has been found in Marion County, as well as of the earliest encounter between European explorers and historic indigenous peoples. In 1976, an archaeological investigation found ancient artifacts in Marion County that appear to be the oldest in mainland United States. Excavations at an ancient stone quarry (on the Container Corporation of America site (8Mf154) in Marion County) yielded &quot;crude stone implements&quot;. Thousands of pieces of chert were found at the site. These showed signs of extensive wear and were found in deposits below those holding Paleo-Indian artifacts. Thermoluminescence dating and weathering analysis independently gave dates of 26,000 to 28,000 Years Before Present (YBP) for the production of these artifacts, prior to Clovis points. The findings suggested human habitation in this area much earlier than documented by other evidence. Barbara Purdy had bipoint evidence from the CCA site, which also predated Clovis points, which she reported in a 2008 paper.

The county seat of Ocala, Florida, is named for a Timucuan village visited and recorded by the Spanish Hernando de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century. During the colonial period, Spain and Great Britain traded control of this area.

===Settlement===
After acquisition of the Florida territory by the United States in the 1820s, Marion County was created in 1844 from portions of Alachua, Mosquito (Orange), and Hillsborough counties. Until 1853, Marion County included most of what are now Lake and Sumter counties. In 1849, Putnam County was created and took the northeast portion of Marion. Levy County&#x27;s creation took some of the western portion of Marion in 1877, near the end of the Reconstruction era.

Marion County is named after General Francis Marion of South Carolina, a guerrilla fighter and hero of the American Revolutionary War who was known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;. Numerous early settlers of this area were natives of South Carolina and likely picked their local hero as the county&#x27;s namesake. The Act creating the county of Marion of the Territory of Florida was signed on March 14, 1844, by the territorial governor, R. K. Call. The county motto is &quot;Kingdom of the Sun.&quot;

===Civil War era===
Marion County was a hotbed of secessionist activity. Organizers petitioned the state to host the Florida Secession Convention and break away from the United States with other Southern states. The area had many plantations and more than half of the population was enslaved African Americans.

Several Confederate Army units were organized by plantation owners, including the Marion Rifle Guards, organized May 2, 1861, by Captain W.L. Fletcher, county treasurer. It served as part of the Fourth Florida Infantry under Col. Edward Hopkins. Other company&#x27;s included the Hammock Guards, commanded by Captain J.S. Hopkins; Marion Dragoons, a cavalry unit organized and financed by William A. Owens, Marion Hornets, commanded by Captain Wade Eichelberger, and the Marion Light Artillery, commanded at one time by John Marshall Martin. The Civil War and its aftermath disrupted local society and strained the economy. The population declined in its wake as many African Americans moved to towns or cities for better opportunities.

===Post-Reconstruction era to mid-20th century===
During the post-Reconstruction period, there was considerable racial violence in Marion County. Locals lynched between 19 and 26 African Americans in the county from the 1880s to 1935.

===Mid-20th century to present===
Since the mid-20th century, thoroughbred horse farms have been established in the county. Such thoroughbred farms have become known for such race champions as Needles, bred at Bonnie Heath Farm, and in 1956, becoming the first Florida-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. In 1978 Affirmed from Harbor View Farm won the Triple Crown.

Carl G. Rose, who had come to Florida in 1916 from Indiana to oversee construction of the first asphalt road in the state, is credited with developing the first thoroughbred horse farm in 1943. As an engineer, he had become familiar with the area&#x27;s limestone, which he realized supported good pasture for raising strong horses. (Limestone also nurtures central Kentucky&#x27;s noted Bluegrass Region.) In 1943, Rose bought land along State Highway 200, at $10 per acre, establishing Rosemere Farm. The next year one of his horses, Gornil, won at Miami&#x27;s Tropical Park, becoming the first Florida-raised thoroughbred to win a Florida race. This raised the profile of Marion County in the racing world.

<text>William Christopher Handy (November 16, 1873 – March 28, 1958) was an American composer and musician who referred to himself as the Father of the Blues. He was one of the most influential songwriters in the United States. One of many musicians who played the distinctively American blues music, Handy did not create the blues genre but was one of the first to publish music in the blues form, thereby taking the blues from a regional music style (Delta blues) with a limited audience to a new level of popularity.

Handy used elements of folk music in his compositions. He was scrupulous in documenting the sources of his works, which frequently combined stylistic influences from various performers.

== Early life ==

Handy was born on November 16, 1873, in Florence, Alabama, the son of Elizabeth Brewer and Charles Barnard Handy. His father was the pastor of a small church in Guntersville, a town in northern Alabama&#x27;s Marshall County. Handy wrote in his 1941 autobiography &quot;Father of the Blues&quot; that he was born in a log cabin built by his grandfather William Wise Handy, who became an African Methodist Episcopal minister after the Emancipation Proclamation. The log cabin of Handy&#x27;s birth has been preserved near downtown Florence.

Handy&#x27;s father believed that musical instruments were tools of the devil. Without his parents&#x27; permission, Handy bought his first guitar, which he had seen in a local shop window and secretly saved for by picking berries and nuts and making lye soap. Upon seeing the guitar, his father asked him, &quot;What possessed you to bring a sinful thing like that into our Christian home?&quot; and ordered him to &quot;take it back where it came from&quot;, but he also arranged for his son to take organ lessons. The organ lessons did not last long, but Handy moved on to learn to play the cornet. He joined a local band as a teenager, but he kept this fact a secret from his parents. He purchased a cornet from a fellow band member and spent every free minute practicing it.

While growing up, he apprenticed in carpentry, shoemaking, and plastering. He was deeply religious. His musical style was influenced by the church music he sang and played in his youth and by the sounds of nature. He cited as inspiration the &quot;whippoorwills, bats and hoot owls and their outlandish noises&quot;, Cypress Creek washing on the fringes of the woodland, and &quot;the music of every songbird and all the symphonies of their unpremeditated art&quot;.

He worked on a &quot;shovel brigade&quot; at the McNabb furnace, where he learned to use his shovel to make music with the other workers to pass the time. The workers would beat their shovels against hard surfaces in complex rhythms that Handy said were &quot;better to us than the music of a martial drum corps.&quot; Handy would later recall this improvisational spirit as being a formative experience for him, musically: &quot;Southern Negroes sang about everything...They accompany themselves on anything from which they can extract a musical sound or rhythmical effect.&quot; He reflected, &quot;In this way, and from these materials, they set the mood for what we now call Blues.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
In September 1892, Handy traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to take a teaching exam. He passed it easily and gained a teaching job at the Teachers Agriculture and Mechanical College (the current-day Alabama A&amp;M University) in Normal, then an independent community near Huntsville. Learning that it paid poorly, he quit the position and found employment at a pipe works plant in nearby Bessemer.

In his time off from his job, he organized a small string orchestra and taught musicians how to read music. He later organized the Lauzetta Quartet. When the group read about the upcoming World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, they decided to attend. To pay their way, they performed odd jobs along the way. They arrived in Chicago and then learned that the World&#x27;s Fair had been postponed for a year. Next they headed to St. Louis, Missouri, but found no work.

After the quartet disbanded, Handy went to Evansville, Indiana. He played the cornet in the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. In Evansville, he joined a successful band that performed throughout neighboring cities and states. His musical endeavors were varied: he sang first tenor in a minstrel show, worked as a band director, choral director, cornetist, and trumpeter. At the age of 23, he became the bandmaster of Mahara&#x27;s Colored Minstrels.

In a three-year tour they traveled to Chicago, throughout Texas and Oklahoma to Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, and on to Cuba, Mexico and Canada. Handy was paid a salary of $6 per week. Returning from Cuba the band traveled north through Alabama, where they stopped to perform in Huntsville. Weary of life on the road, he and his wife, Elizabeth, stayed with relatives in his nearby hometown of Florence.

In 1896, while performing at a barbecue in Henderson, Kentucky, Handy met Elizabeth Price. They married on July 19, 1896. She gave birth to Lucille, the first of their six children, on June 29, 1900, after they had settled in Florence.

Around that time, William Hooper Councill, the president of State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes in Huntsville (which became Alabama A&amp;M University), the same college Handy had refused to teach at in 1892 due to low pay, hired Handy to teach music. He became a faculty member in September 1900 and taught through much of 1902. He was disheartened to discover that the college emphasized teaching European music considered to be &quot;classical&quot;. He felt he was underpaid and could make more money touring with a minstrel group.

=== Development of the blues style ===
In 1902, Handy traveled throughout Mississippi, listening to various styles of popular black music. The state was mostly rural and music was part of the culture, especially in cotton plantations in the Mississippi Delta. Musicians usually played guitar or banjo or, to a much lesser extent, piano. Handy&#x27;s remarkable memory enabled him to recall and transcribe the music he heard in his travels.

After a dispute with AAMC President Councill, Handy resigned his teaching position to return to the Mahara Minstrels and tour the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. In 1903, he became the director of a black band organized by the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Handy and his family lived there for six years. During this time, he had several formative experiences that he later recalled as influential in his developing musical style. In 1903, while waiting for a train in Tutwiler, Mississippi in the Mississippi Delta, Handy overheard a black man playing a steel guitar using a knife as a slide.

About 1905, while playing a dance in Cleveland, Mississippi, Handy was given a note asking for &quot;our native music&quot;. He played an old-time Southern melody but was asked if a local colored band could play a few numbers. Handy assented, and three young men with well-worn instruments began to play. Research by Elliott Hurwitt for the Mississippi Blues Trail identified the leader of the band in Cleveland as Prince McCoy. In his autobiography, Handy described the music they played:

Handy also took influence from the square dances held by Mississippi blacks, which typically had music in the G major key. In particular, he picked the same key for his 1914 hit, &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot;.

=== First hit: &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; ===

In 1909 Handy and his band moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where they played in clubs on Beale Street. &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; was a campaign song written for Edward Crump, the successful Democratic Memphis mayoral candidate in the 1909 election and political boss. The other candidates also employed Black musicians for their campaigns. Handy later rewrote the tune and changed its name from &quot;Mr. Crump&quot; to &quot;Memphis Blues.&quot; The 1912 publication of the sheet music of &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; introduced his style of 12-bar blues; it was credited as the inspiration for the foxtrot by Vernon and Irene Castle, a New York dance team. Handy sold the rights to the song for $100. By 1914, when he was 40, he had established his musical style, his popularity had greatly increased, and he was a prolific composer.

In his autobiography, Handy described how he incorporated elements of black folk music into his musical style. The basic three-chord harmonic structure of blues music and the use of flat third and seventh chords in songs played in the major key all originated in vernacular music created for and by impoverished southern blacks. Those notes are now referred to in jazz and blues as blue notes. His customary three-line lyrical structure came from a song he heard Phil Jones perform. Finding the structure too repetitive, he adapted it: &quot;Consequently I adopted the style of making a statement, repeating the statement in the second line, and then telling in the third line why the statement was made.&quot; He also made sure to leave gaps in the lyrics for the singer to provide improvisational filler, which was common in folk blues.

Writing about the first time &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; was played, in 1914, Handy said,
His published musical works were groundbreaking because of his race. In 1912, he met Harry Pace at the Solvent Savings Bank in Memphis. Pace was the valedictorian of his graduating class at Atlanta University and a student of W. E. B. Du Bois. By the time of their meeting, Pace had demonstrated a strong understanding of business. He earned his reputation by saving failing businesses. Handy liked him, and Pace later became the manager of Pace and Handy Sheet Music.

In 1916, American composer William Grant Still, early in his career, worked in Memphis for W.C. Handy&#x27;s band. In 1918, Still joined the United States Navy to serve in World War I. After the war, he went to Harlem, where he continued to work for Handy.

=== Move to New York ===

In 1917, Handy and his publishing business moved to New York City, where he had offices in the Gaiety Theatre office building in Times Square. By the end of that year, his most successful songs had been published: &quot;Memphis Blues&quot;, &quot;Beale Street Blues&quot;, and &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot;. That year, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, a white New Orleans jazz ensemble, had recorded the first jazz record, introducing the style to a wide segment of the American public. Handy had little fondness for jazz, but bands dove into his repertoire with enthusiasm, making many of these songs jazz standards.

Handy encouraged performers such as Al Bernard, a soft-spoken white man who nonetheless was a powerful blues singer. He sent Bernard to Thomas Edison to be recorded, which resulted in a series of successful recordings. Handy also published music written by other writers, such as Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Shake Rattle and Roll&quot; and &quot;Saxophone Blues&quot;, and &quot;Pickaninny Rose&quot; and &quot;O Saroo&quot;, two black traditional tunes contributed by a pair of white women from Selma, Alabama. Publication of these hits, along with Handy&#x27;s blues songs, gave his business a reputation as a publisher of black music.

In 1919, Handy signed a contract with Victor Talking Machine Company for a third recording of his unsuccessful 1915 song &quot;Yellow Dog Blues&quot;. The resulting Joe Smith recording of the song was a strong seller, with orders numbering in the hundreds of thousands of copies.

Handy tried to interest black singers in his music but was unsuccessful; many musicians chose to play only the current hits, and did not want to take risks with new music. According to Handy, he had better luck with white bandleaders, who &quot;were on the alert for novelties. They were therefore the ones most ready to introduce our numbers.&quot; Handy also had little success selling his songs to black women singers, but in 1920, Perry Bradford convinced Mamie Smith to record two non-blues songs (&quot;That Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Man Down&quot;) that were published by Handy and accompanied by a white band. When Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; became a hit as recorded by Smith, black blues singers became popular. Handy&#x27;s business began to decrease because of the competition.

In 1920, Pace amicably dissolved his partnership with Handy, with whom he also collaborated as lyricist. Pace formed Pace Phonograph Company and Black Swan Records, and many of the employees went with him. Handy continued to operate the publishing company as a family-owned business. He published works of other black composers as well as his own, which included more than 150 sacred compositions and folk song arrangements and about 60 blues compositions. In the 1920s, he founded the Handy Record Company in New York City; while this label released no records, Handy organized recording sessions with it, and some of those recordings were eventually released on Paramount Records and Black Swan Records. So successful was &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; that, in 1929, he and director Dudley Murphy collaborated on a RCA motion picture of the same name, which was to be shown before the main attraction. Handy suggested blues singer Bessie Smith for the starring role because the song had made her popular. The movie was filmed in June and was shown in movie houses throughout the United States from 1929 to 1932.

The importance of Handy&#x27;s work as a musician and musicologist crossed the boundaries of genre, coming to influence European composers such as Maurice Ravel, who was inspired during a stay in Paris of Handy and his orchestra for the composition of the famous sonata nr 2 for violin and piano known not by chance as the Blues sonata.

In 1926 Handy wrote &quot;Blues: An Anthology—Complete Words and Music of 53 Great Songs&quot;. It is an early attempt to record, analyze, and describe the blues as an integral part of the South and the history of the United States. To celebrate the publication of the book and to honor Handy, Small&#x27;s Paradise in Harlem hosted a party, &quot;Handy Night&quot;, on Tuesday October 5, which contained the best of jazz and blues selections provided by Adelaide Hall, Lottie Gee, Maude White, and Chic Collins.

=== Later career and death ===
In a 1938 radio episode of Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; Handy was described as &quot;the father of jazz as well as the blues.&quot; Fellow blues performer Jelly Roll Morton wrote an open letter to &quot;Downbeat&quot; magazine fuming that he had invented jazz.

After the publication of his autobiography, Handy published a book on African-American musicians, titled &quot;Unsung Americans Sung&quot; (1944). He wrote three other books: &quot;Blues: An Anthology: Complete Words and Music of 53 Great Songs&quot;, &quot;Book of Negro Spirituals&quot;, and &quot;Negro Authors and Composers of the United States&quot;. He lived on Strivers&#x27; Row in Harlem. He became blind after an accidental fall from a subway platform in 1943.

From 1943 until his death, he lived in Yonkers. His grandson is the physicist Carlos Handy (born 1950), who now leads the Handy Brothers Music Company. After the death of his first wife, he remarried in 1954 when he was 80. His bride was his secretary Irma Louise Logan, who he frequently said had become his eyes. In 1955, he had a stroke, and he began to use a wheelchair. More than 800 people attended his 84th birthday party at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

On March 28, 1958, Handy died of bronchial pneumonia at Sydenham Hospital in New York City. Over 25,000 people attended his funeral in Harlem&#x27;s Abyssinian Baptist Church. Over 150,000 people gathered in the streets near the church to pay their respects. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

== Compositions ==
Handy&#x27;s music does not always follow the classic 12-bar pattern, often having 8- or 16-bar bridges between 12-bar verses.
* &quot;Memphis Blues&quot;, written 1909, published 1912. Although usually subtitled &quot;Boss Crump&quot;, it is a distinct song from Handy&#x27;s campaign satire, &quot;Boss Crump don&#x27;t &#x27;low no easy riders around here&quot;, which was based on the good-time song &quot;Mamma Don&#x27;t Allow It.&quot;
* &quot;Yellow Dog Blues&quot; (1912), &quot;Your easy rider&#x27;s gone where the Southern cross the Yellow Dog.&quot; The reference is to the crossing at Moorhead, Mississippi, of the Southern Railway and the local Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, called the Yellow Dog. By Handy&#x27;s telling locals assigned the words &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; to the letters Y.D. (for Yazoo Delta) on the freight trains that they saw.
* &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; (1914), &quot;the jazzman&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Loveless Love&quot;, based in part on the classic &quot;Careless Love&quot;. Possibly the first song to complain of modern synthetics, &quot;with milkless milk and silkless silk, we&#x27;re growing used to soulless soul.&quot;
* &quot;Aunt Hagar&#x27;s Blues&quot;, the biblical Hagar, handmaiden to Abraham and Sarah, was considered the &quot;mother&quot; of African Americans
* &quot;Beale Street Blues&quot; (1916), written as a farewell to Beale Street of Memphis, which was named Beale Avenue until the song&#x27;s popularity caused it to be changed
* &quot;Long Gone John (from Bowling Green)&quot;, about a famous bank robber
* &quot;Chantez-Les-Bas (Sing &#x27;Em Low)&quot;, a tribute to the Creole culture of New Orleans
* &quot;Atlanta Blues&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Make Me a Pallet on your Floor&quot; as its chorus.
* &quot;Ole Miss Rag&quot; (1917), a ragtime composition, recorded by Handy&#x27;s Orchestra of Memphis

<doc id="58070" wikidata="Q677173" url="?curid=58070" title="House of Este">
<text>The House of Este ( , , ) is a European dynasty of North Italian origin whose members ruled parts of Italy and Germany for many centuries.

The original House of Este&#x27;s elder branch, which is known as the House of Welf, included dukes of Bavaria and of Brunswick. This branch produced Britain&#x27;s Hanoverian monarchs, as well as one Emperor of Russia (Ivan VI) and one Holy Roman Emperor (Otto IV).

The original House of Este&#x27;s younger branch, which is simply called the House of Este, included rulers of Ferrara (1240–1597), and of Modena (900–1859) and Reggio (1288–1796). This branch&#x27;s male line became extinct with the death of Ercole III in 1803.

==Origins==
According to Edward Gibbon, the family originated from the Roman Attii family, which migrated from Rome to Este to defend Italy against the Ostrogoths. However, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. The names of the early members of the family indicate that a Frankish origin is much more likely. The Encyclopædia Britannica regards this family as a branch of the Obertenghi. 

The first known member of the house was Margrave Adalbert of Mainz, known only as the father of Oberto I, Count palatine of Italy, who died around 975. Oberto&#x27;s grandson, Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan (996–1097) built a castle at Este, near Padua, and named himself after the location. He had three sons from two marriages, two of whom became the ancestors of the two branches of the family:
* Welf IV, the eldest (d. 1101), was the son of Kunigunde (d. 1056), the last of the Elder Welfs. He inherited the property of his maternal uncle, Welf, Duke of Carinthia, became duke of Bavaria in 1070, and is the ancestor of the elder branch, the House of Welf.
* Hugh, issue of Azzo&#x27;s second marriage to Garsend of Maine, inherited the French County of Maine, a legacy of his mother&#x27;s dowry, but sold it one year later and died without heirs.
* Fulco I, Margrave of Milan (d. about 1128/35), the third son, is the ancestor of the younger Italian line of Este.

The two surviving branches, with Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Bavaria on the German (Welf dynasty) side, concluded an agreement in 1154 which allocated the family&#x27;s Italian possessions to the younger line, the Fulc-Este, who in the course of time acquired Ferrara, Modena and Reggio. Este itself was taken over in 1275 by Padua, and in 1405 (together with Padua) by Venice.

==Elder branch – Younger House of Welf==
The elder branch of the original House of Este, known as the House of Welf (were also called Guelfs &quot;Guelf&quot; or &quot;Guelph&quot; which derives from the Italianized name for original “Welf”), produced dukes of Bavaria (1070–1139, 1156–1180), dukes of Saxony (1138–1139, 1142–1180), a Holy Roman Emperor, Otto IV (1198–1218), dukes of Brunswick and Lüneburg (1208–1806), later also dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg (1689-1803), styled the &quot;Electors of Hanover&quot; in 1705, and princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269-1807). The House of Welf gave Great Britain and the United Kingdom the &quot;Hanoverian monarchs&quot; (1714–1901) as well as gave Russia an emperor Ivan VI.

After the peace ending the Napoleonic Wars reshaped Europe, ushering in the modern era, the Electorate of Hanover (duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg, held in personal union by the king of Great Britain, George III) was dissolved by treaty. Its lands were enlarged and the state was promoted to a kingdom. The new kingdom existed from 1815 to 1866, but upon the accession of Queen Victoria (who could not inherit Hanover under Salic law) in 1837, it passed to her uncle, Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, and thus ceased to be in personal union with the British Crown.

The senior branch of the House of Welf continued to be ruled by the princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, as undisputed until the death of the ruling duke of Brunswick Prince William VIII, in 1884. Prior to his death, his brother Charles II from Geneva, as exiled de jure ruler of the house, had declared the Prussian annexation of the crown and the earlier Hanoverian usurpation absolutely illegal acts of usurpation inside of the German House. At his death, his grandson continued internationally recognized appeals. Hanover formed the Guelph Party (or German Party) to continue political appeals against the Prussian and German annexations of the crown.

==Younger branch – Margraves of Este==

All later generations of the Italian branch are descendants of Fulco d&#x27;Este. From 1171 on, his descendants were titled Margraves of Este.

Obizzo I (d. 1193), the first margrave, battled against Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. His nephew Azzo d&#x27;Este VI (1170–1212) became podestà of Mantua and Verona. As the dowry of his niece &quot;the Marchesella&quot;, Ferrara passed to Azzo VI d&#x27;Este In 1146, with the last of the Adelardi. In 1242 Azzo VII &quot;Novello&quot; was nominated podestà for his lifetime.

The lordship of Ferrara was made hereditary by Obizzo II (d. 1293), who was proclaimed Lord of Ferrara in 1264, Lord of Modena in 1288, and Lord of Reggio in 1289. Ferrara was a papal fief and the Este family were given the position of hereditary papal vicars in 1332.

Ferrara became a significant center of culture under Niccolò d&#x27;Este III (1384–1441), who received several popes with great magnificence, especially Eugene IV. He held a Council in Ferrara in 1438, later known as the Council of Florence.

His successors were his illegitimate sons Leonello (1407–1450) and Borso (1413–1471), who was elevated to Duke of Modena and Reggio by Emperor Frederick III in 1452, receiving these duchies as imperial fiefs. In 1471, he received the duchy of Ferrara as papal fief from Pope Paul II, for which occasion splendid frescoes were executed at Palazzo Schifanoia.

Borso was succeeded by a half-brother, Ercole (1431–1505), who was one of the most significant patrons of the arts in late 15th and early 16th century Italy. Ferrara grew into a cultural center renowned especially for music; Josquin des Prez worked for Duke Ercole, Jacob Obrecht came to Ferrara twice, and Antoine Brumel served as principal musician from 1505. Ercole&#x27;s daughter Beatrice (1475–1497) married Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan; another daughter, Isabella (1474–1539), married Francesco Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua.

Ercole I&#x27;s successor was his son Alfonso I (1476–1534), third husband of Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, sister to Cesare Borgia. Alfonso I was a patron of Ariosto.

The son of Alfonso and Lucrezia Borgia, Ercole d&#x27;Este II (1508–1559), married Renée of France, daughter of Louis XII of France. His son Alfonso II first married Lucrezia, daughter of grand-duke Cosimo I of Tuscany. After she died, he married Barbara, the sister of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor (1527–1576). His third wife, Margherita Gonzaga, was daughter of the duke of Mantua.

Alfonso II raised the glory of Ferrara to its highest point, continuing the patron of Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini and in general favoring the arts and sciences, as the princes of his house had always done. The legitimate line ended in 1597 with him; as his heir, Emperor Rudolph II recognized his first cousin Cesare d&#x27;Este (1533–1628), member of a cadet branch born out of wedlock, who continued to rule in the imperial duchies and carried on the family name. Ferrara, on the other hand, was annexed by force of arms in 1598 by Pope Clement VIII on grounds of the heir&#x27;s illegitimacy and incorporated into the Papal States.

During the 18th century, the unhappy marriage between the last male heir of the Este family, the future Duke Ercole III, and the sovereign Duchess of Massa and Carrara, Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, produced only one surviving child, Maria Beatrice. However, the Salic law excluded her, as a woman, from the succession to her father, while she was entitled to succeed her mother since the Salic law was derogated in the Duchy of Massa and Carrara by virtue of a 1529 decree of the Emperor Charles V.

When it became obvious that the princely couple would not produce a large offspring, the reigning Duke, Francesco III, set out to prevent Modena from suffering the same fate as Ferrara almost two centuries earlier. Thus, in 1753, two simultaneous treaties (one public and one secret) were concluded between the House of Este and the House of Austria, by which the Archduke Leopold, Empress Maria Theresa&#x27;s ninth-born child and third son, and Maria Beatrice were engaged, and the former was designated by Francesco III as heir for the imperial investiture as Duke of Modena and Reggio in the event of extinction of the Este male line. In the meantime, Francesco would cover the office of governor of Milan ad interim, which was destined for the archduke. 

In 1761, however, following the death of an older brother, Leopold became heir to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany as provided for the second male heir of the imperial couple, and the treaties had to be revised. In 1763, in spite of the harsh opposition of Maria Beatrice&#x27;s father, the two families agreed to simply replace the name of Leopold with that of Maria Theresa&#x27;s fourteenth child, Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Austria, who was four years younger than his betrothed. In January 1771 the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg ratified Ferdinand&#x27;s future investiture and, in October, Maria Beatrice and he finally got married in Milan, thus giving rise to the new House of Austria-Este.

Ercole III finally ascended the throne in 1780 upon the death of Francesco III, but was deposed in 1796 by the French. His States were transformed into the Cispadane Republic, which one year later was merged into the Cisalpine Republic and then into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Ercole was compensated with the small principality of Breisgau in southwestern Germany, and when he died in 1803, it passed to his son-in-law, who in 1806 lost it to the enlarged and elevated Grand Duchy of Baden during the Napoleonic reorganization of the western territories of the defunct Holy Roman Empire. In December of that same year, Ferdinand died without ever having had the opportunity to exercise his prerogatives as heir to the Este States.

Maria Beatrice had succeeded her mother as Duchess of Massa and Carrara in 1790, but she too had been deposed by the French invasion in 1796.

<doc id="58074" wikidata="Q373401" url="?curid=58074" title="Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)">
<text>The Battle of Cape St. Vincent (14 February 1797) was one of the opening battles of the Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808), as part of the French Revolutionary Wars, where a British fleet under Admiral Sir John Jervis defeated a greatly superior Spanish fleet under Admiral Don José de Córdoba y Ramos near Cape St. Vincent, Portugal.

==Background==
After the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796 allying Spanish and French forces against Great Britain, the Royal Navy blockaded Spain in 1797, impairing communications with its empire. The Spanish declaration of war on Britain and Portugal in October 1796 made the British position in the Mediterranean untenable. The combined Franco-Spanish fleet of 38 ships of the line heavily outnumbered the British Mediterranean Fleet of fifteen ships of the line, forcing the British to evacuate their positions in first Corsica and then Elba. Early in 1797, the Spanish fleet of 27 ships of the line lay at Cartagena on the Mediterranean Sea. The Spanish planned to join the French fleet at Brest and escort a large merchant convoy, carrying mainly mercury for gold and silver production, from Cádiz. The convoy entered Cádiz harbour along with warships &quot;Neptuno&quot;, &quot;Terrible&quot; and &quot;Bahama&quot;, prior to running into the British force.

Don José de Córdoba and the Spanish fleet left Cartagena on 1 February and might have reached Cádiz safely but for a fierce Levanter, the easterly wind, blowing between Gibraltar and Cádiz, which pushed the Spanish fleet further out into the Atlantic than intended. As the winds died down, the fleet began working its way back to Cádiz. In the meantime, the British Mediterranean Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jervis, had sailed from the Tagus with ten ships of the line to try to intercept the Spanish fleet. On 6 February, Jervis was joined off Cape St. Vincent by a reinforcement of five ships of the line from the Channel Fleet under Rear-Admiral William Parker. On 11 February, the British frigate HMS &quot;Minerve&quot;, under the command of Commodore Horatio Nelson, passed through the Spanish fleet unseen due to heavy fog. Nelson reached the British fleet of fifteen ships off Spain on 13 February, and told the location of the Spanish fleet to Jervis, commanding the fleet from his flagship &quot;Victory&quot;. In the fog, Nelson had not been able to count the Spanish ships, but Jervis&#x27;s squadron immediately sailed to intercept them as they continued toward Cádiz. Early on the 14th, Jervis learnt that the Spanish fleet was 35 miles to windward.

==Battle==
 Though Admiral Jervis still had no idea of the size of the fleet he was up against, during the night came the sounds for which he had been waiting: Spanish signal guns in the fog. At 2:50 a.m. came the report that the Spanish fleet was some fifteen miles distant. By 5:30 a.m., &quot;Niger&quot; reported them closer still, as a cold and foggy February dawn rose on the British fleet, formed in two lines of battle. Jervis turned to his officers on the quarterdeck of &quot;Victory&quot; and said, &quot;A victory to England is very essential at this moment.&quot; Jervis put Captain Thomas Troubridge in &quot;Culloden&quot; in the lead. At 6:30 a.m., &quot;Culloden&quot; signalled that she could see five enemy sail to the south east, and along with &quot;Blenheim&quot; and &quot;Prince George&quot; turned toward the Spanish ships. As they loomed up out of the fog, a signal lieutenant in &quot;Barfleur&quot; described them as &quot;thumpers, looming like Beachy Head in a fog.&quot; On the quarterdeck of &quot;Victory&quot;, Jervis, Captain Robert Calder and Captain Benjamin Hallowell counted the enemy ships: the British were outnumbered nearly two-to-one.
It would be difficult to disengage, and the situation would only get worse were the Spanish fleet to join up with the French: Jervis decided to continue. Hearing this, the Canadian Captain Hallowell became so excited he thumped the Admiral on the back, &quot;That&#x27;s right Sir John, and, by God, we&#x27;ll give them a damn good licking!&quot; The Spanish were formed in two loose columns, one of about 18 ships to windward and the other, of about nine ships, somewhat closer to the British. At about 10:30 a.m., the Spanish ships in the weather column were seen to wear ship and turn to port. This gave the impression that they might form a line and pass along the weather column of the British fleet, exposing the smaller British column to the fire of the larger Spanish division. At 11:00 a.m., Jervis ordered: &quot;Form in a line of battle ahead and astern of Victory as most convenient.&quot; When this was completed the British fleet had formed a single line of battle, sailing south to pass between the two Spanish columns. At 11:12 a.m., Jervis made his next signal: &quot;Engage the enemy&quot; and then at 11:30 a.m.: &quot;Admiral intends to pass through enemy lines&quot;. The Battle of Cape St. Vincent had begun.
To the British advantage, the Spanish fleet was formed into two groups and was unprepared for battle, while the British were already in line. Jervis passed between the two Spanish groups, minimising the fire they could put into him, while letting him fire in both directions.

&quot;Culloden&quot; tacked to reverse her course and take after the Spanish column, followed by &quot;Blenheim&quot;, then &quot;Prince George&quot;. The Spanish lee division now put about to the port tack to break the British line at the point where the ships were tacking in succession. &quot;Orion&quot; came round untouched, but &quot;Colossus&quot; was going about when her foreyard and foretop yard were shot away. She was forced to wear ship instead of tack and the leading Spanish vessel came close enough to threaten her with a broadside. Saumarez in &quot;Orion&quot; saw the danger to &quot;Colossus&quot; and backed his sails to give covering fire. As &quot;Victory&quot; came to the tacking point, another attempt was made to break the British line, but &quot;Victory&quot; was too fast and &quot;Principe de Asturias&quot; received two raking broadsides as she tacked close to her. &quot;We gave them their Valentine in style,&quot; later wrote a gunner in &quot;Goliath&quot;. As the last ship in the British line passed the Spanish, the British line had formed a U shape with &quot;Culloden&quot; in the lead and on the reverse course but chasing the rear of the Spanish. At this point the Spanish lee division bore up to make an effort to join their compatriots to windward. Had they managed this, the battle would have ended indecisively with the Spanish running for Cádiz and the British harrying their sterns in the manner of the Armada in 1588.
At 1:05 p.m., Jervis hoisted a signal:
Take suitable stations for mutual support and engage the enemy as coming up in succession
Nelson had returned to his ship &quot;Captain&quot; (a seventy-four) and was now towards the rear of the British line, much closer to the larger group. He saw that Jervis&#x27; manoeuvre could not be completed before the Spanish escaped, relatively unharmed. Taking the battle into his own hands, Nelson ordered Captain Ralph Willett Miller to wear ship and take &quot;Captain&quot; out of line to engage the smaller group.

As soon as the seventy-four was around, Nelson directed her to pass between &quot;Diadem&quot; and &quot;Excellent&quot; and ran across the bows of the Spanish ships forming the central group of the weather division. This group included the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;, the largest ship afloat at the time and mounting 130 guns; the &quot;San José&quot;, 112; &quot;Salvador del Mundo&quot;, 112; &quot;San Nicolás&quot;, 84; &quot;San Ysidro,&quot; 74; and &quot;Mexicano,&quot; 112.

As a junior commander, Nelson was acting against Admiral Jervis&#x27; order to &quot;form line ahead and astern of &quot;Victory&quot;&quot;, and using his own wide interpretation of &quot;take suitable stations&quot; in the later signal. Had his action failed, Nelson would have been subject to court-martial for disobeying orders in the face of the enemy, with subsequent demotion and disgrace.

At about 1:30 p.m., &quot;Culloden&quot; was gradually overhauling the Spanish rear and began a renewed but not very close engagement of the same group of ships. Jervis signalled his rearmost ship, &quot;Excellent&quot; to come to the wind on the larboard tack and following this order, Collingwood brought his ship round to a position ahead of &quot;Culloden&quot;. After a few more minutes, &quot;Blenheim&quot; and &quot;Prince George&quot; came up behind and the group of British ships prevented the Spanish from grouping together.

The &quot;Captain&quot; was now under fire from as many as six Spanish ships, of which three were 112-gun three-deckers and a fourth Córdoba&#x27;s 130-gun flagship &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. At about 2:00 p.m., &quot;Culloden&quot; had stretched so far ahead as to cover the &quot;Captain&quot; from the heavy fire poured into her by the Spanish four-decker and her companions, as they hauled up and brought their broadsides to bear. Of the respite thus afforded to her, the &quot;Captain&quot; took immediate advantage, replenishing her lockers with shot and splicing and repairing her running rigging.

At about 2:30, &quot;Excellent&quot;, having been directed by signal to bear up, edged away and at 2:35, arriving abreast of the disabled Spanish three-decker &quot;Salvator del Mundo&quot;, engaged the latter on her weather bow for a few minutes; then passing on to the next Spanish ship, &quot;San Ysidro&quot;, whose three topmasts had already been shot away. This ship Captain Collingwood engaged closely until 2:50 when, after a gallant defence in her crippled state, &quot;San Ysidro&quot; hauled down the Spanish flag.

Moments later, &quot;Excellent&quot; and &quot;Diadem&quot; commenced an attack on &quot;Salvator del Mundo&quot;, with &quot;Excellent&quot; stationing herself on the weather bow and &quot;Diadem&quot; on the lee quarter of the Spanish three-decker. &quot;Salvator del Mundo&quot;, more or less disabled, saw &quot;Victory&quot; was about to pass close astern firing her bow guns and judiciously hauled down her flag.

By about 3:00, &quot;Excellent&quot; was already in close action with &quot;San Nicolás&quot; which, with foretop mast shot away, had encountered &quot;Captain&quot;. &quot;Excellent&quot; fired broadsides into &quot;San Nicolás&quot; and then made sail to clear ahead. To avoid &quot;Excellent&quot;, &quot;San Nicolás&quot; luffed up and ran foul of &quot;San José&quot;, which had suffered the loss of mizzen mast and other damage.

&quot;Captain&quot; was by now almost uncontrollable with her wheel shot away. At this point, her foretop mast fell over the side leaving her unmanageable, with little option but to board the Spanish vessels. &quot;Captain&quot; opened fire with her larboard broadside, and then put the helm over and hooked her larboard cat-head with the starboard quarter of &quot;San Nicolás&quot;.
At 3:20, with a cry of &quot;Westminster Abbey or Glorious Victory!&quot;, Nelson ordered his boarders to cross the first Spanish ship onto the second. He later wrote,
The soldiers of the 69th, with an alacrity which will ever do them credit, and Lieutenant Pearson of the same regiment, were almost the foremost on this service – the first man who jumped into the enemy&#x27;s mizen chains was Commander Berry, late my First Lieutenant (Captain Miller was in the very act of going also, but I directed him to remain); he was supported from our sprit sail yard, which hooked in the mizen rigging. A soldier of the 69th Regiment having broken the upper quarter-gallery window, I jumped in myself, and was followed by others as fast as possible. I found the cabin doors fastened, and some Spanish officers fired their pistols: but having broke open the doors the soldiers fired, and the Spanish Brigadier fell, as retreating to the quarter-deck. I pushed immediately onwards for the quarter-deck, where I found Commander Berry in possession of the poop, and the Spanish ensign hauling down. I passed with my people, and Lieutenant Pearson, on the larboard gangway, to the forecastle, where I met two or three Spanish officers, prisoners to my seamen: they delivered me their swords. A fire of pistols, or muskets, opening from the stern gallery of the San Josef, I directed the soldiers to fire into her stern; and calling to Captain Miller, ordered him to send more men into the San Nicolas; and directed my people to board the first-rate, which was done in an instant, Commander Berry assisting me into the main chains. At this moment a Spanish officer looked over the quarter deck rail, and said they surrendered. From this most welcome intelligence, it was not long before I was on the quarter deck, where the captain, with a bow, presented me his sword, and said the admiral was dying of his wounds. I asked him on his honour if the ship was surrendered. He declared she was: on which I gave him my hand, and desired him to call on his officers and ship&#x27;s company and tell them of it: which he did – and on the quarter deck of a Spanish first-rate, extravagant as the story may seem, did I receive the swords of vanquished Spaniards: which as I received, I gave to William Fearney, one of my bargemen, who put them, with the greatest sang-froid, under his arm.
Both Spanish vessels were successfully captured. This manoeuvre was so unusual and so widely admired in the Royal Navy that using one enemy ship to cross to another became known facetiously as &quot;Nelson&#x27;s patent bridge for boarding enemy vessels.&quot;

&quot;Infante Don Pelayo&quot; and &quot;San Pablo&quot;, which had been dispatched from de Córdoba&#x27;s group at 8.00 a.m. to investigate guns heard to the north, now sailed in and bore down on &quot;Diadem&quot; and &quot;Excellent&quot;. By this time &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; had struck her colours to surrender, but &quot;Infante Don Pelayo&quot;&#x27;s captain Cayetano Valdés warned &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; to fly her flag again under threat she would be deemed an enemy ship and raked. The Spanish four-decker raised her flag and was saved from capture.

By 4:00 p.m., &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was relieved by two of her escorts and made away. Admiral Moreno&#x27;s squad put together the survivors of de Córdoba&#x27;s group and turned to assist the harassed Spanish sails. Jervis signalled his fleet to cover the prizes and disabled vessels and at 4:15 the frigates were directed to take the prizes in tow. At 4:39 the fleet was ordered to take station in line astern of &quot;Victory&quot;. The battle was by now almost over with only some remaining skirmishing between &quot;Britannia&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and the departing Spanish covering &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; (which was to later be captured at the Battle of Trafalgar).

Nelson remained on board the captured Spanish ships while they were secured – and was cheered by the British ships as they passed. He returned to the &quot;Captain&quot; to thank Captain Miller and presented him with the sword of the captain of the &quot;San Nicolás&quot;.

At 5:00, Nelson shifted his pennant from the disabled &quot;Captain&quot; to &quot;Irresistible&quot;. Still black with smoke and with his uniform in shreds, Nelson went on board &quot;Victory&quot; where he was received on the quarter-deck by Admiral Jervis – &quot;the Admiral embraced me, said he could not sufficiently thank me, and used every kind expression which could not fail to make me happy.&quot;

The Battle of Cape St. Vincent had cost the lives of 73 men of the Royal Navy and seriously wounded a further 227, and lightly wounded 100. Spanish casualties were far higher, about 1,000 men killed or wounded; aboard &quot;San Nicolás&quot; alone 144 were killed.

It was a great and welcome victory for the Royal Navy – 15 British ships had defeated a Spanish fleet of 27 with far more guns and men. Admiral Jervis&#x27; highly disciplined force had been pitted against an inexperienced Spanish Navy under Don José Córdoba, the Spanish men fighting fiercely but without direction. After the &quot;San José&quot; was captured it was found that some of her guns still had tampions plugging their muzzles. The confusion amongst the Spanish was so great that they were unable to use their guns without causing more damage to their own ships than to the British.

==Aftermath==
Jervis had given orders to destroy the four prizes had the action restarted. Several days later, the frigate (32) spotted the damaged &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; making her way back to Spain. The captain, Orozco, now commissioned by de Cordoba, had flown his flag in frigate &quot;Diana&quot;. &quot;Terpsichore&quot; engaged but kept dodging out of range from the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;&#x27;s stern guns. &quot;Terpsichore&quot; nonetheless was hit twice in a sudden move, resulting in damage in her rigging, masts and sails as well as some impacts on her hull. Captain Richard Bowen then ordered to keep the pursuit from a longer distance, but the frigate vanished away.

While the British fleet lay at Lagos Bay in Portugal, about 3000 Spanish prisoners from the four prizes were landed. Jervis resumed his blockade of the Spanish fleet in Cadiz. The continuation of the blockade for most of the following three years largely curtailed the Spanish fleet until the Peace of Amiens in 1802. The containment of the Spanish threat and the further reinforcement of his fleet enabled Jervis to send a squadron under Nelson back into the Mediterranean the following year. That squadron, including Saumarez&#x27;s &quot;Orion&quot;, Troubridge&#x27;s &quot;Culloden&quot;, and &quot;Goliath&quot;, now under Foley, re-established British command of the Mediterranean at the Battle of the Nile.

Jervis was made Baron Jervis of Meaford and Earl St. Vincent, and granted a life pension of £3,000 per year. Nelson was knighted as a member of the Order of the Bath. Nelson&#x27;s promotion to Rear-Admiral was not a reward for his services, but simply a happy coincidence: promotion to flag rank in the Navy of the time was based on seniority on the Captain&#x27;s list and not on achievement. The City of London presented Jervis, now Earl St. Vincent, with the Freedom of the City in a gold box valued at 100 guineas, and awarded both him and Nelson a ceremonial sword. The presentation box and sword are both currently held at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. The swords awarded Jervis and Nelson were the first of their kind to be issued by the City of London. St. Vincent was awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and given a gold medal by the King. &quot;The London Gazette&quot; published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money due to the commander, officers, and men in the battle, a sum of £140,000.

Though the Spanish Navy was defeated, it was not a decisive defeat, such as the British Navy would inflict on the French in the Battle of the Nile two years later. Looking to reform for future engagements against the British, Admiral de Cordóba was blamed for the loss, dismissed from the Spanish Navy and forbidden from the royal court.

In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;St. Vincent&quot; to all surviving claimants from the battle.

<text>Hervé Jean-Pierre Villechaize (; April 23, 1943 – September 4, 1993) was a French actor and painter. He is best known for his roles as the evil henchman Nick Nack in the 1974 James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and as Mr. Roarke&#x27;s assistant, Tattoo, on the American television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; that he played from 1977 to 1983. On &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, his shout of &quot;De plane! De plane!&quot; became one of the show&#x27;s signature phrases. He died by suicide in 1993.

==Early life==
Villechaize was born in Nazi-occupied Paris on April 23, 1943, to Evelyn, an Anglo-Italian socialite who was an ambulance driver during World War II and André Villechaize, a surgeon in Toulon. Villechaize also had German ancestry. The youngest of four sons, Villechaize was born with dwarfism, likely due to an endocrine disorder, which his surgeon father tried unsuccessfully to cure in several institutions. In later years, he insisted on being called a &quot;midget&quot; rather than a &quot;dwarf&quot;, which annoyed his acting contemporary with a similar condition, Billy Barty, who was an activist who found that term derogatory. Villechaize was bullied at school for his condition and found solace in painting. In 1959, at age 16, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts to study art. In 1961, he became the youngest artist ever to have his work displayed in the Museum of Paris.

In 1964, Villechaize left France for the United States. He settled in a Bohemian section of New York City, and taught himself English by watching television.

==Career==
Villechaize initially worked as an artist, painter, and photographer. He began acting in Off-Broadway productions, including Werner Liepolt&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master Dante&quot; and a play by Sam Shepard, and he also modelled for photos for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; before moving on to film.

His first film appearance was in &quot;Chappaqua&quot; (1966). His second film was Edward Summer&#x27;s &quot;Item 72-D: The Adventures of Spa and Fon&quot;, filmed in 1969. This was followed by several films, including &quot;The Gang That Couldn&#x27;t Shoot Straight&quot; (1971); Christopher Speeth and Werner Liepolt&#x27;s &quot;Malatesta&#x27;s Carnival of Blood&quot; (1973); &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; (1974); and Oliver Stone&#x27;s first film, &quot;Seizure&quot; (1974). He was asked to play a role in Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s film &quot;Dune&quot;, which had originally begun pre-production in 1971, but was later cancelled.

Villechaize&#x27;s big break was being cast in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), by which time he had become so poor that he was living in his car in Los Angeles. Prior to being signed by Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli, he made ends meet by working as a rat catcher&#x27;s assistant near his South Central home. From what his co-star Christopher Lee saw, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; filming was possibly the happiest time of Villechaize&#x27;s life; Lee likened it to honey in the sandwich between an insecure past and an uncertain future.

In the 1970s, Villechaize performed Oscar the Grouch on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as a pair of legs peeping out from Oscar&#x27;s trash can, for scenes that required Oscar to be mobile. These appearances began in the third season, and included the 1978 Hawaii episodes.

In 1980, Cleveland International Records released a single by the Children of the World, featuring Villechaize as vocalist: &quot;Why&quot;, with B-side &quot;When a Child Is Born&quot;.

Though popular with the public, Villechaize proved a difficult actor on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, where he continually propositioned women and quarreled with the producers. He was eventually fired after demanding a salary on par with that of his co-star Ricardo Montalbán. For its final season from &#x27;83-&#x27;84, Villechaize was replaced by Christopher Hewett, best known for his lead role in the sitcom &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;.

Villechaize also starred in the movie &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; (1980), and appeared in &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982), and episodes of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;. He later played the title role in the &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; episode of Shelley Duvall&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;. In the 1980s, he became popular in Spain due to his impersonations of Prime Minister Felipe González on the television show &quot;Viaje con nosotros&quot; (&quot;Travel with Us&quot;), with showman Javier Gurruchaga. His final appearance was a cameo as himself in an episode of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In the mid-1970s, Villechaize met actress Susan Tyrrell. According to Tyrrell, they had a two-year relationship and shared a home in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles.

Villechaize married twice. He married his first wife, artist Anne Sadowski, in 1970. After Villechaize&#x27;s serial infidelities, as well as ridicule over their height difference, they divorced in 1978 or 1979 (sources differ). He met his second wife, Camille Hagen, an actress and stand-in double, in 1977 on the set of the pilot for &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. They married in 1980 and Hagen filed for divorce 15 months later. During their marriage, they lived at a San Fernando Valley ranch, which also was home to a menagerie of farm animals and pets. 

In the early morning hours of September 4, 1993, at his North Hollywood home, Villechaize, aged 50, is believed to have first fired a shot through the sliding-glass patio door to awaken his longtime girlfriend, Kathy Self, before shooting himself. Self found Villechaize in his backyard, and he was pronounced dead at the Medical Center of North Hollywood. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean off Point Fermin in San Pedro, Los Angeles.

Villechaize left a suicide note saying he was despondent over longtime health problems. He was suffering from chronic pain due to having oversized internal organs putting increasing pressure on his body. According to Self, Villechaize often slept in a kneeling position so he could breathe more easily. He also left an audio recording of the suicide that included his last words.

At the time of his death, Cartoon Network was in negotiations for him to co-star in &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, which was then in pre-production. Villechaize would have voiced Space Ghost&#x27;s sidekick on the show.

==Depictions in media==
Sacha Gervasi spent several years writing a script about Villechaize. Gervasi conducted a lengthy interview with Villechaize just prior to his death. The film &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot;, which is based on the last few days of Villechaize&#x27;s life, stars Peter Dinklage in the title role, and premiered on HBO on October 20, 2018.

<doc id="58079" wikidata="Q242115" url="?curid=58079" title="Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period">
<text>The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period () was an era of political upheaval and division in Imperial China from 907 to 979. Five dynastic states quickly succeeded one another in the Central Plain, and more than a dozen concurrent dynastic states, collectively known as the Ten Kingdoms, were established elsewhere, mainly in South China. It was a prolonged period of multiple political divisions in Chinese imperial history.

Traditionally, the era is seen as beginning with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 and reaching its climax with the founding of the Song dynasty in 960. In the following 19 years, Song gradually subdued the remaining states in South China, but the Liao dynasty still remained in China&#x27;s north (eventually succeeded by the Jin dynasty), and the Western Xia was eventually established in China&#x27;s northwest.

Many states had been &quot;de facto&quot; independent long before 907 as the late Tang dynasty&#x27;s control over its numerous &quot;fanzhen&quot; officials waned, but the key event was their recognition as sovereign by foreign powers. After the Tang collapsed, several warlords of the Central Plain crowned themselves emperor. During the 70-year period, there was near-constant warfare between the emerging kingdoms and the alliances they formed. All had the ultimate goal of controlling the Central Plain and establishing themselves as the Tang&#x27;s successor.

The last of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms regimes was Northern Han, which held out until Song conquered it in 979. For the next several centuries, although the Song controlled much of South China, they coexisted alongside the Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, and various other regimes in China&#x27;s north, until finally all of them were conquered by the Yuan dynasty.

== Background ==
Towards the end of the Tang dynasty, the imperial government granted increased powers to the &quot;jiedushi&quot; (), the regional military governors. The An Lushan (755–763) and Huang Chao rebellions weakened the imperial government, and by the early 10th century the &quot;jiedushi&quot; commanded &quot;de facto&quot; independence from its authority. In the last decades of the Tang dynasty, they were not even appointed by the central court anymore, but developed hereditary systems, from father to son or from patron to protégé. They had their own armies rivaling the &quot;palace armies&quot; and amassed huge wealth, as testified by their sumptuous tombs. Due to the decline of Tang central authority after the An Lushan Rebellion, there was a growing tendency to superimpose large regional administrations over the old districts and prefectures that had been used since the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). These administrations, known as circuit commissions, would become the boundaries of the later Southern regimes; many circuit commissioners became the emperors or kings of these states.

The historian Hugh Clark proposed a three-stage model of broad political trends during this time period. The first stage (880–910) consists of the period between the Huang Chao Rebellion and the formal end of the Tang dynasty, which saw chaotic fighting between warlords who controlled approximately one or two prefectures each. The second stage (910–950) saw the various warlords stabilize and gain enough legitimacy to proclaim new dynasties. The third stage (950–979) saw the forceful reunification of China by the Later Zhou dynasty and its successor the Song dynasty, and the demilitarisation of the provinces. Southern China, divided into several independent dynastic kingdoms, was more stable than the North which saw constant regime change. Consequently, the Southern kingdoms were able to embark on trade, land reclamation, and infrastructure projects, laying the groundwork for the Song Dynasty economic boom. This economic shift to the south also led to a vast southward migration.

===North===

According to Nicholas Tackett, the three provinces of Hebei (Chengde, Youzhou, Weibo) were able to maintain much greater autonomy from the central government in the aftermath of the An Lushan rebellion. With their administration under local military control, these provinces never submitted tax revenues, and governorships lapsed into hereditary succession. They engaged in occasional war with the central government, or against each other, and Youzhou seemed to conduct its own foreign policy. This meant that the culture of these northeastern provinces started diverging from the capital. Many of the elites in post-Tang China, including the future emperors of the Song dynasty, came from this region.

The administrations of the Five Dynasties and the early Song Dynasty shared a pattern of being disproportionately drawn from the families of military governors in northern and northwestern China (Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi), their personal staff, and the bureaucrats who served in the capitals of the Five dynasties. These families had risen to prominence due to the unraveling of central authority after the An Lushan Rebellion, despite lacking esteemed ancestry. The historian Deng Xiaonan argued that many of these military families, including the Song imperial family, were of mixed Han Chinese-Turkic-Kumo Xi ancestry.

The term &quot;Five Dynasties&quot; was coined by Song dynasty historians and reflects the view that the successive regimes based in Kaifeng, controlled the Central Plain and possessed the Mandate of Heaven. The first of the Five Dynasties was founded by Zhu Wen, the rebel defector turned warlord who ultimately ended the Tang dynasty. The rest of the Five Dynasties as well as the Song dynasty all emerged from a military organization originally led by Shatuo Turks whose commanders replaced each other in frequent coup d&#x27;état. The Later Tang was founded by Li Cunxu, the son of Shatuo leader Li Keyong, who was the main military rival to Zhu Wen in the late Tang. The Later Jin founder Shi Jingtang was the son of a Shatuo commander in Li Keyong&#x27;s army and became the son-in-law of the Later Tang general and emperor Li Siyuan, who was himself an adopted son of Li Keyong. The Later Han founder Liu Zhiyuan was a Shatuo officer under Li Siyuan and Shi Jintang. The father of the Later Zhou founder Guo Wei fought in Li Keyong&#x27;s army and Guo served under Liu Zhiyuan. The father of Song founder Zhao Kuangyin served in the armies of Later Tang, Later Han, and Later Zhou. Zhao, also a professional soldier, rose through the ranks of the Later Zhou before seizing the throne in the Chenqiao Mutiny in 960, which ended the era of the Five Dynasties.

The Qing historian Wang Fuzhi (1619–1692) wrote that this period could be compared to the earlier Warring States period of ancient China, remarking that none of the rulers could be described as &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;. The Five Dynasties&#x27; rulers, despite claiming the status of emperor, sometimes dealt with each other on terms of diplomatic equality out of pragmatic concern. This concept of &quot;sharing the Mandate of Heaven&quot; as &quot;sibling states&quot; was the result of the brief balance of power. After the reunification of China by the Song dynasty, the Song embarked on a special effort to denounce such arrangements.

===South===
The Southern regimes generally had more stable and effective government during this period. Even the rulers of the Southern states were almost all military leaders from the North with their key officers and elite forces also hailing from the North since the bulk of the Tang army was based in the North. The founders of Wu and Former Shu were &#x27;rogues&#x27; from Huainan and Xuchang respectively, the founder of Min was a minor government staffer from Huainan, the founder of Wuyue was a &#x27;rogue&#x27; from Hangzhou, the founder of Chu was (according to one source) a carpenter from Xuchang, the founder of Jingnan was a slave from Shanzhou and the founder of Southern Han was a southern tribal chief. The Southern kingdoms were founded by men of low social status who rose up through superior military ability, who were later scorned as &quot;bandits&quot; by future scholars. However, once established, these rulers took great pains to portray themselves as promoters of culture and economic development so as to legitimize their rule; many wooed former Tang courtiers to help administer their states.

The economies of each of the southern regions had prospered in the late Tang. Guangdong and Fujian were the sites of important port cities trading exotic goods, the middle Yangtze and Sichuan were centers of tea and porcelain production, and the Yangtze delta was a center of extremely high agricultural production and an entrepot for the other regions. The regions were economically interdependent. Sui and Tang&#x27;s policies, while paying little attention to developing the South, gave the South room to innovate free of tight administrative controls. The dominant northern officials had been unwilling to serve in the South during the Tang, and so southerners were recruited by the Tang to serve in a local capacity under the &quot;Southern Selection&quot; supplemental system. These southern officials became the administrative core of the Ten Kingdoms and later dominated the bureaucracy by the mid-Song.

== Five Dynasties ==

===Later Liang (907–923)===

During the Tang dynasty, the warlord Zhu Wen was originally a member of Huang Chao&#x27;s rebel army, he took on a crucial role in suppressing the Huang Chao Rebellion. For this function, he was awarded the Xuanwu Jiedushi title. Within a few years, he had consolidated his power by destroying neighbours and forcing the move of the imperial capital to Luoyang, which was within his region of influence. In 904, he executed Emperor Zhaozong of Tang and made Zhaozong&#x27;s 13-year-old son Emperor Ai of Tang a subordinate ruler. Three years later, he induced the boy emperor to abdicate in his favour. He then proclaimed himself emperor, thus beginning the Later Liang.

===Later Tang (923–936)===
In the final years of the Tang dynasty, rival warlords declared independence in the provinces they governed—not all of which recognized the emperor&#x27;s authority. Li Keyong was the jiedushi for the Hedong circuit in present Shanxi, forming a polity called Jin (晉). His son Li Cunxu and Liu Shouguang fiercely fought the regime forces to conquer northern China; Li Cunxu succeeded. He defeated Liu Shouguang (who had proclaimed a Yan Empire in 911) in 915, and declared himself emperor in 923; within a few months, he brought down the Later Liang regime. Thus began the Shatuo Later Tang—the first in a long line of conquest dynasties. After reuniting much of northern China, in 924 Cunxu received the submission of Shaanxi&#x27;s Qi kingdom, and in 925 Cunxu conquered the Former Shu, a regime that had been set up in Sichuan.

===Later Jin (937–947)===

The Later Tang had a few years of relative calm, followed by unrest. In 934, Sichuan again asserted independence. In 936, Shi Jingtang rebelled against Li Congke, the fourth emperor of the Later Tang. Shi Jingtang, a Shatuo jiedushi from Taiyuan, was aided by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty in his rebellion. In return for their aid, Shi Jingtang promised annual tribute and the Sixteen Prefectures (modern northern Hebei and Beijing) to the Khitans. The rebellion succeeded, and Shi Jingtang became emperor in this same year.

Not long after the founding of Later Jin, the Liao came to regard the emperor as a proxy ruler for China. In 943, the Khitans declared war and within three years seized the capital, Kaifeng, marking the end of Later Jin. But while they had conquered vast regions of China, the Khitans were unable or unwilling to control those regions and retreated from them early in the next year.

===Later Han (947–951)===

To fill the power vacuum, the jiedushi Liu Zhiyuan entered the imperial capital in 947 and proclaimed the advent of the Later Han, establishing a third successive Shatuo reign. This was the shortest of the five dynasties. Following a coup in 951, General Guo Wei, a Han Chinese, was enthroned, thus beginning the Later Zhou. However, Liu Chong, a member of the Later Han imperial family, established a rival Northern Han regime in Taiyuan and requested Khitan aid to defeat the Later Zhou.

===Later Zhou (951–960)===
After the death of Guo Wei in 954, his adopted son Chai Rong succeeded the throne and began a policy of expansion and reunification. One month after Chai Rong took the throne, Liu Chong, Emperor of Northern Han, allied with Liao dynasty to launch an assault on Later Zhou. Against the advice of Minister Feng Dao, Chai Rong decided to lead his army against the incursion. When Chai Rong engaged Liu Chong at Gao Ping (in modern Jincheng), two of Chai&#x27;s generals, Fan Aineng and He Hui, fled from the battlefield along with their troops. At this critical moment, Chai Rong risked his life to break through the defense and crushed Liu&#x27;s forces. After this campaign, Chai Rong consolidated his power. Between 956 and 958, forces of Later Zhou conquered much of Southern Tang, the most powerful regime in southern China, which ceded all the territory north of the Yangtze in defeat. In 959, Chai Rong attacked the Liao in an attempt to recover territories ceded during the Later Jin. After many victories, he succumbed to illness.

In 960, the general Zhao Kuangyin staged a coup and took the throne for himself, founding the Northern Song dynasty. This is the official end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. During the next two decades, Zhao Kuangyin and his successor Zhao Kuangyi defeated the other remaining regimes in South China, conquering Northern Han in 979, starting the Song dynasty era in 982.

== Ten Kingdoms ==

Unlike the dynasties of northern China, which succeeded one another in rapid succession, the regimes of South China were generally concurrent, each controlling a specific geographical area. These were known as &quot;The Ten Kingdoms&quot; (in fact, some claimed the title of Emperor, such as Former Shu and Later Shu). Each court was a center of artistic excellence. The period is noted for the vitality of its poetry and for its economic prosperity. Commerce grew so quickly that there was a shortage of metallic currency. This was partly addressed by the creation of bank drafts, or &quot;flying money&quot; (&quot;feiqian&quot;), as well as by certificates of deposit. Wood block printing became common during this period, 500 years before Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s press.

The Ten Kingdoms were:

* Yang Wu (907–937)
* Wuyue (907–978)
* Min (909–945)
* Ma Chu (907–951)
* Southern Han (917–971)
* Former Shu (907–925)
* Later Shu (934–965)
* Jingnan (924–963)
* Southern Tang (937–976)
* Northern Han (951–979)

Only ten are traditionally listed, hence the era&#x27;s name. Some historians, such as Bo Yang, count eleven, including Yan and Qi but not the Northern Han, viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han. This era also coincided with the founding of the Liao dynasty in the north, and the Dali Kingdom in the southwest.

Other regimes during this period include Zhao, Yiwu Circuit, Dingnan Circuit, Wuping Circuit, Qingyuan Circuit, Yin, Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom, Guiyi Circuit and Xiliangfu.

===Yang Wu===
The Yang Wu (902–937) was established in modern-day Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi. It was founded by Yang Xingmi, who became a Tang dynasty military governor in 892. The capital was initially at Guangling (present-day Yangzhou) and later moved to Jinling (present-day Nanjing). The kingdom fell in 937 when it was taken from within by the founder of the Southern Tang.

===Wuyue===
The Wuyue was the longest-lived (907–978) and among the most powerful of the southern states. Wuyue was known for its learning and culture. It was founded by Qian Liu, who set up his capital at Xifu (modern-day Hangzhou). It was based mostly in modern Zhejiang province but also held parts of southern Jiangsu. Qian Liu was named the Prince of Yue by the Tang emperor in 902; the Prince of Wu was added in 904. After the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, he declared himself king of Wuyue. Wuyue survived until the eighteenth year of the Song dynasty, when Qian Shu surrendered to the expanding dynasty.

===Min===
The Min (909–945) was founded by Wang Shenzhi, who named himself the Prince of Min with its capital at Changle (present-day Fuzhou). One of Shenzhi&#x27;s sons proclaimed the independent state of Yin in the northeast of Min territory. The Southern Tang took that territory after the Min asked for help. Despite declaring loyalty to the neighboring Wuyue, the Southern Tang finished its conquest of Min in 945.

===Southern Han===
The Southern Han (917–971) was founded in Guangzhou by Liu Yan. His brother, Liu Yin, was named regional governor by the Tang court. The kingdom included Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. It was finally conquered by the Song dynasty.

===Ma Chu===
The Ma Chu (927–951) was founded by Ma Yin with the capital at Changsha. The kingdom held Hunan and northeastern Guangxi. Ma was named regional military governor by the Tang court in 896, and named himself the Prince of Chu with the fall of the Tang in 907. This status as the Prince of Chu was confirmed by the Southern Tang in 927. The Southern Tang absorbed the state in 951 and moved the royal family to its capital in Nanjing, although Southern Tang rule of the region was temporary, as the next year former Chu military officers under the leadership of Liu Yan seized the territory. In the waning years of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the region was ruled by Zhou Xingfeng. In 963, the region was annexed by Song dynasty.

===Northern Han===

Though considered one of the ten kingdoms, the Northern Han was based in the traditional Shatuo stronghold of Shanxi. It was founded by Liu Min (), formerly known as Liu Chong (), after the Later Han fell to the Han Chinese-led Later Zhou in 951. With the protection of the powerful Liao dynasty, the Northern Han maintained nominal independence until the Song dynasty wrested it from the Khitans in 979.

===Jingnan (also known as Nanping)===
The smallest of the southern states, Jingnan (924–963), was founded by Gao Jichang, a former general of Liang. It was based in Jiangling and held two other districts southwest of present-day Wuhan in Hubei. Gao was in the service of the Later Liang (the successor of the Tang in North China). Gao&#x27;s successors claimed the title of King of Nanping after the fall of the Later Liang in 924. It was a small and weak kingdom, and thus tried to maintain good relations with each of the Five Dynasties. The kingdom fell to advancing armies of the Song in 963.

===Former Shu===
Former Shu (907–925) was founded after the fall of the Tang dynasty by Wang Jian, who held his court in Chengdu. The kingdom held most of present-day Sichuan, western Hubei, and parts of southern Gansu and Shaanxi. Wang was named military governor of western Sichuan by the Tang court in 891. The kingdom fell when his son surrendered in the face of an advance by the Later Tang in 925.

===Later Shu===
The Later Shu (935–965) is essentially a resurrection of the previous Shu state that had fallen a decade earlier to the Later Tang. Because the Later Tang was in decline and Li Cunxu was killed in a revolt, Meng Zhixiang found the opportunity to reassert Shu&#x27;s independence. Like the Former Shu, the capital was at Chengdu and it basically controlled the same territory as its predecessor. The kingdom was ruled well until forced to succumb to Song armies in 965.

===Southern Tang===

The Southern Tang (937–975) was the successor state of Wu as Li Bian (Emperor Liezu) took the state over from within in 937. Expanding from the original domains of Wu, it eventually took over Yin, Min, and Chu, holding present-day southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, Hunan, and eastern Hubei at its height. The kingdom became nominally subordinate to the expanding Song in 961 and was invaded outright in 975, when it was formally absorbed into the Song dynasty.

===Transitions between the Ten Kingdoms===

Although more stable than northern China as a whole, southern China was also torn apart by warfare. Wu quarreled with its neighbours, a trend that continued as Wu was replaced with Southern Tang. In the 940s Min and Chu underwent internal crises which Southern Tang handily took advantage of, destroying Min in 945 and Chu in 951. Remnants of Min and Chu, however, survived in the form of Qingyuan Jiedushi and for many years after. With this, Southern Tang became the undisputedly most powerful regime in southern China. However, it was unable to defeat incursions by the Later Zhou between 956 and 958, and ceded all of its land north of the Yangtze River.

The Song dynasty, established in 960, was determined to reunify China. Jingnan and Wuping Jiedushi were swept away in 963, Later Shu in 965, Southern Han in 971, and Southern Tang in 975. Finally, Wuyue and Qingyuan Jiedushi gave up their land to Northern Song in 978, bringing all of southern China under the control of the central government.

In common with other periods of fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period resulted in a division between northern and southern China. The greater stability of the Ten Kingdoms, especially the longevity of Wuyue and Southern Han, would contribute to the development of distinct regional identities within China. The distinction was reinforced by the &quot;Old History&quot; and the &quot;New History&quot;. Written from the northern viewpoint, these chronicles organized the history around the Five Dynasties (the north), presenting the Ten Kingdoms (the south) as illegitimate, self-absorbed and indulgent.

==Culture==
The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period turned away from the international cultural mood of the Tang dynasty and appears as a transition towards the solidified national culture of the Song dynasty. Throughout the period, there was marked cultural and economic growth, rather than decline.

Several Northern dynasties originated in the northeast, and centralisation of the north led to a migration of provincial elites into the capital, particularly northeasterners, creating a new metropolitan culture. After the unification of China by the Song dynasty, the culture, arts and literature of the Southern states were incorporated into the new regime. The Song dynasty adopted a distinctively Southern Chinese cultural outlook. The preserved cultural traditions of Southern Tang, Wu Yue and Later Shu were used to rebuild the cultural landscape of the north. Southern libraries were transported north, Southeastern architecture was promoted in the new capital, and Southeastern Buddhist icons, clergy and relics were concentrated in the new capital so as to reintegrate these traditions into the imperial culture. This was distinct from the five Northern dynasties, who never supported extended monastic lineage networks but instead typically sought to restrict them and draw on their economic and military resources.

Although short, the period saw cultural innovations in different areas. Pottery saw the appearance of &quot;white ceramics&quot;/ In painting, the &quot;varied landscape&quot; of China was inspired by Taoism. It emphasized the sacredness of mountains as places between heaven and earth and depicted the natural world as a source of harmony.

==Law==
In later tradition, the Five Dynasties is viewed as a period of judicial abuse and excessive punishment. This view reflects both actual problems with the administration of justice and the bias of Confucian historians, who disapproved of the decentralization and militarization that characterized this period. While Tang procedure called for delaying executions until appeals were exhausted, this was not generally the case in the Five Dynasties.

Other abuses included the use of severe torture. The Later Han was the most notorious dynasty in this regard. Suspects could be tortured to death with long knives and nails. The military officer in charge of security of the capital is said to have executed suspects without inquiry.

The Tang code of 737 was the basic statutory law for this period, together supplemental edicts and collections. The Later Liang promulgated a code in 909. This code was blamed for delays in the administration of justice and said to be excessively harsh with respect to economic crimes. The Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Zhou also produced recompilations. The Later Han was in power too briefly to make a mark on the legal system.

<text>Vladimir Vasilyevich Atlasov or Otlasov ( or Отла́сов; – 1711) was a Siberian Cossack who was the first Russian to organize systematic exploration of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Atlasov Island, an uninhabited volcanic island off the southern tip of Kamchatka, and the Atlasova volcano are named after him.

==Biography==
Atlasov was born in Veliky Ustyug. The first mention of him in the historical records comes from around 1682, when he was collecting the &quot;yasak&quot; on the Aldan River and one of the Uda rivers. In 1695, the voyevoda of Yakutsk appointed Atlasov as the &quot;prikazshchik&quot; of Anadyrsk. The Russians here had heard reports of a &#x27;Kamchatka River&#x27; to the south and were already collecting yasak on the headwaters of the rivers that flow south toward Kamchatka. At least one of them had followed the Penzhina River to the Sea of Okhotsk. In 1696, he sent Luka Morozko south to explore. Morozko got as far south as the Tegil river on the west side of the peninsula and returned with some &#x27;mysterious writings&#x27;, apparently from a wrecked Japanese ship.

In 1697, Atlasov set off south with 65 serving-men and 60 Yukaghirs. Travelling on reindeer, they reached the mouth of the Penzhina River. He went down the west coast for two weeks and then crossed to the east coast. (Lantzeff has this as February 1697 on the Olyutor Gulf, but the Russian wiki has him leaving in the spring of 1697 and the Olyutor Gulf is rather far to the northeast). He left Morzoko to explore the east side and returned to the west side, but Morozko had to be recalled to deal with a Yukaghir mutiny (at the Palana River). Going south to the Tegil river, he heard reports of the Kamchatka river and recrossed the Central Range to the Kamchatka where he met the Itelmens for the first time. He made an alliance with one clan and went downriver and burned a village of their enemies. Returning, he learned that some Koryaks had stolen his reindeer. He chased them, killed about 150 and retrieved his reindeer. Continuing down the west side he reached the Icha River where he rescued or captured a Japanese sailor who had been shipwrecked. Further south he reached the Golygina River area, from which he was able to see Atlasov Island. Here he met the first Ainu and managed to kill fifty of them. Returning north to the Icha, he sent a party of men over the mountains to build an &quot;ostrog&quot; at Verkhnekamchatsk on the upper Kamchatka. Here he decided to return to Anadyrsk, either under pressure of his men or because he was running short of gunpowder and lead.

He reached Anadyrsk in July 1699 and wrote a report. He reached Yakutsk in June 1700 and in February 1701 reached Moscow where he presented his report. He was promoted to Golova and sent back to administer Kamchatka. On the Angara River in 1701 he met and plundered a merchant&#x27;s boat loaded with Chinese goods. For this he and his men were thrown in jail. Kamchatka became increasingly disorderly and in 1707 Atlasov was released and sent to Kamchatka to restore order. On the journey his methods were so rough that most of his men sent a letter of protest to Yakutsk. He pacified the natives to some degree, but in December 1707 his own cossacks revolted and imprisoned him. He escaped (from Verkhnekamchatsk) and went downriver to Nizhnekamchatsk, but the local commander refused to step aside and give him command. What he did for the next four years is uncertain. In January 1711, he was murdered in his sleep by another band of mutineers.
