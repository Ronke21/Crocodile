<text>In quantum mechanics, a density matrix (or density operator) is a matrix that describes an ensemble of physical systems as quantum states (even if the ensemble contains only one system). It allows for the calculation of the probabilities of the outcomes of any measurements performed upon the systems of the ensemble using the Born rule. It is a generalization of the more usual state vectors or wavefunctions: while those can only represent pure states, density matrices can also represent &quot;mixed ensembles&quot; (sometimes ambiguously called &quot;mixed states&quot;). Mixed ensembles arise in quantum mechanics in two different situations:
# when the preparation of the systems lead to numerous pure states in the ensemble, and thus one must deal with the statistics of possible preparations, and
# when one wants to describe a physical system that is entangled with another, without describing their combined state; this case is typical for a system interacting with some environment (e.g. decoherence). In this case, the density matrix of an entangled system differs from that of an ensemble of pure states that, combined, would give the same statistical results upon measurement.

Density matrices are thus crucial tools in areas of quantum mechanics that deal with mixed ensembles, such as quantum statistical mechanics, open quantum systems and quantum information.

== Definition and motivation ==
The density matrix is a representation of a linear operator called the density operator. The density matrix is obtained from the density operator by a choice of an orthonormal basis in the underlying space. In practice, the terms &quot;density matrix&quot; and &quot;density operator&quot; are often used interchangeably.

Pick a basis with states formula_1, formula_2 in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, then the density operator is represented by the matrix
formula_3 
where the diagonal elements are real numbers that sum to one (also called populations of the two states formula_1, formula_2). 
The off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates of each other (also called coherences); they are restricted in magnitude by the requirement that formula_6 be a positive semi-definite operator, see below.

A density operator is a positive semi-definite, self-adjoint operator of trace one acting on the Hilbert space of the system. This definition can be motivated by considering a situation where some pure states formula_7 (which are not necessarily orthogonal) are prepared with probability formula_8 each. This is known as an &quot;ensemble&quot; of pure states. The probability of obtaining projective measurement result formula_9 when using projectors formula_10 is given by
formula_11
which makes the density operator, defined as 
formula_12
a convenient representation for the state of this ensemble. It is easy to check that this operator is positive semi-definite, self-adjoint, and has trace one. Conversely, it follows from the spectral theorem that every operator with these properties can be written as formula_13 for some states formula_14 and coefficients formula_8 that are non-negative and add up to one. However, this representation will not be unique, as shown by the Schrödinger–HJW theorem.

Another motivation for the definition of density operators comes from considering local measurements on entangled states. Let formula_16 be a pure entangled state in the composite Hilbert space formula_17. The probability of obtaining measurement result formula_9 when measuring projectors formula_10 on the Hilbert space formula_20 alone is given by
formula_21
where formula_22 denotes the partial trace over the Hilbert space formula_23. This makes the operator 
formula_24
a convenient tool to calculate the probabilities of these local measurements. It is known as the reduced density matrix of formula_16 on subsystem 1. It is easy to check that this operator has all the properties of a density operator. Conversely, the Schrödinger–HJW theorem implies that all density operators can be written as formula_26 for some state formula_27.

== Pure and mixed states ==
A pure quantum state is a state that can not be written as a probabilistic mixture, or convex combination, of other quantum states. There are several equivalent characterizations of pure states in the language of density operators. A density operator represents a pure state if and only if:
* it can be written as an outer product of a state vector formula_28 with itself, that is, formula_29
* it is a projection, in particular of rank one.
* it is idempotent, that is formula_30
* it has purity one, that is, formula_31

It is important to emphasize the difference between a probabilistic mixture (i.e. an ensemble) of quantum states and the superposition of two states. If an ensemble is prepared to have half of its systems in state formula_32 and the other half in formula_33, it can be described by the density matrix: 
: formula_34
where formula_32 and formula_33 are assumed orthogonal and of dimension 2, for simplicity. On the other hand, a quantum superposition of these two states with equal probability amplitudes results in the pure state formula_37 with density matrix 
: formula_38
Unlike the probabilistic mixture, this superposition can display quantum interference.

 Geometrically, the set of density operators is a convex set, and the pure states are the extremal points of that set. The simplest case is that of a two-dimensional Hilbert space, known as a qubit. An arbitrary mixed state for a qubit can be written as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, which together with the identity matrix provide a basis for formula_39 self-adjoint matrices:
: formula_40
where the real numbers formula_41 are the coordinates of a point within the unit ball and
: formula_42
Points with formula_43 represent pure states, while mixed states are represented by points in the interior. This is known as the Bloch sphere picture of qubit state space.

=== Example: light polarization ===

An example of pure and mixed states is light polarization. An individual photon
can be described as having right or left circular polarization, described by the orthogonal quantum states formula_44 and formula_45 or a superposition of the two: it can be in any state formula_46 (with formula_47), corresponding to linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. Consider now a vertically polarized photon, described by the state formula_48. If we pass it through a circular polarizer that allows either only formula_44 polarized light, or only formula_45 polarized light, half of the photons are absorbed in both cases. This may make it &quot;seem&quot; like half of the photons are in state formula_44 and the other half in state formula_45, but this is not correct: if we pass formula_53 through a linear polarizer there is no absorption whatsoever, but if we pass either state formula_44 or formula_45 half of the photons are absorbed.

Unpolarized light (such as the light from an incandescent light bulb) cannot be described as &quot;any&quot; state of the form formula_46 (linear, circular, or elliptical polarization). Unlike polarized light, it passes through a polarizer with 50% intensity loss whatever the orientation of the polarizer; and it cannot be made polarized by passing it through any wave plate. However, unpolarized light &quot;can&quot; be described as a statistical ensemble, e. g. as each photon having either formula_44 polarization or formula_45 polarization with probability 1/2. The same behavior would occur if each photon had either vertical polarization formula_59 or horizontal polarization formula_60 with probability 1/2. These two ensembles are completely indistinguishable experimentally, and therefore they are considered the same mixed state. For this example of unpolarized light, the density operator equals
: formula_61

There are also other ways to generate unpolarized light: one possibility is to introduce uncertainty in the preparation of the photon, for example, passing it through a birefringent crystal with a rough surface, so that slightly different parts of the light beam acquire different polarizations. Another possibility is using entangled states: a radioactive decay can emit two photons traveling in opposite directions, in the quantum state formula_62. The joint state of the two photons &quot;together&quot; is pure, but the density matrix for each photon individually, found by taking the partial trace of the joint density matrix, is completely mixed.

== Equivalent ensembles and purifications ==

A given density operator does not uniquely determine which ensemble of pure states gives rise to it; in general there are infinitely many different ensembles generating the same density matrix. Those cannot be distinguished by any measurement. The equivalent ensembles can be completely characterized: let formula_63 be an ensemble. Then for any complex matrix formula_64 such that formula_65 (a partial isometry), the ensemble formula_66 defined by
: formula_67
will give rise to the same density operator, and all equivalent ensembles are of this form.

A closely related fact is that a given density operator has infinitely many different purifications, which are pure states that generate the density operator when a partial trace is taken. Let 
: formula_68
be the density operator generated by the ensemble formula_63, with states formula_7 not necessarily orthogonal. Then for all partial isometries formula_64 we have that
: formula_72
is a purification of formula_73, where formula_74 is an orthogonal basis, and furthermore all purifications of formula_73 are of this form.

== Measurement ==
Let formula_76 be an observable of the system, and suppose the ensemble is in a mixed state such that each of the pure states formula_77 occurs with probability formula_8. Then the corresponding density operator equals
: formula_79

The expectation value of the measurement can be calculated by extending from the case of pure states:
: formula_80
where formula_81 denotes trace. Thus, the familiar expression formula_82 for pure states is replaced by
: formula_83
for mixed states.

Moreover, if formula_76 has spectral resolution
: formula_85
where formula_86 is the projection operator into the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue formula_87, the post-measurement density operator is given by
: formula_88
when outcome &quot;i&quot; is obtained. In the case where the measurement result is not known the ensemble is instead described by
: formula_89

If one assumes that the probabilities of measurement outcomes are linear functions of the projectors formula_86, then they must be given by the trace of the projector with a density operator. Gleason&#x27;s theorem shows that in Hilbert spaces of dimension 3 or larger the assumption of linearity can be replaced with an assumption of non-contextuality. This restriction on the dimension can be removed by assuming non-contextuality for POVMs as well, but this has been criticized as physically unmotivated.

== Entropy ==
The von Neumann entropy formula_91 of a mixture can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of formula_73 or in terms of the trace and logarithm of the density operator formula_73. Since formula_73 is a positive semi-definite operator, it has a spectral decomposition such that formula_95, where formula_96 are orthonormal vectors, formula_97, and formula_98. Then the entropy of a quantum system with density matrix formula_73 is
: formula_100

This definition implies that the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. If formula_101 are states that have support on orthogonal subspaces, then the von Neumann entropy of a convex combination of these states,
: formula_102
is given by the von Neumann entropies of the states formula_101 and the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution formula_104:
: formula_105
When the states formula_101 do not have orthogonal supports, the sum on the right-hand side is strictly greater than the von Neumann entropy of the convex combination formula_73.

Given a density operator formula_73 and a projective measurement as in the previous section, the state formula_109 defined by the convex combination
: formula_110
which can be interpreted as the state produced by performing the measurement but not recording which outcome occurred, has a von Neumann entropy larger than that of formula_73, except if formula_112. It is however possible for the formula_109 produced by a &quot;generalized&quot; measurement, or POVM, to have a lower von Neumann entropy than formula_73.

== Von Neumann equation for time evolution ==

Just as the Schrödinger equation describes how pure states evolve in time, the von Neumann equation (also known as the Liouville–von Neumann equation) describes how a density operator evolves in time. The von Neumann equation dictates that
: formula_115
where the brackets denote a commutator.

This equation only holds when the density operator is taken to be in the Schrödinger picture, even though this equation seems at first look to emulate the Heisenberg equation of motion in the Heisenberg picture, with a crucial sign difference:
: formula_116
where formula_117 is some &quot;Heisenberg picture&quot; operator; but in this picture the density matrix is &quot;not time-dependent&quot;, and the relative sign ensures that the time derivative of the expected value formula_118 comes out &quot;the same as in the Schrödinger picture&quot;.

If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the von Neumann equation can be easily solved to yield
: formula_119

For a more general Hamiltonian, if formula_120 is the wavefunction propagator over some interval, then the time evolution of the density matrix over that same interval is given by
: formula_121

== Wigner functions and classical analogies ==

The density matrix operator may also be realized in phase space. Under the Wigner map, the density matrix transforms into the equivalent Wigner function,
: formula_122

The equation for the time evolution of the Wigner function, known as Moyal equation, is then the Wigner-transform of the above von Neumann equation,
: formula_123
where formula_124 is the Hamiltonian, and formula_125 is the Moyal bracket, the transform of the quantum commutator.

The evolution equation for the Wigner function is then analogous to that of its classical limit, the Liouville equation of classical physics. In the limit of a vanishing Planck constant formula_126, formula_127 reduces to the classical Liouville probability density function in phase space.

== Example applications ==
Density matrices are a basic tool of quantum mechanics, and appear at least occasionally in almost any type of quantum-mechanical calculation. Some specific examples where density matrices are especially helpful and common are as follows:
* Statistical mechanics uses density matrices, most prominently to express the idea that a system is prepared at a nonzero temperature. Constructing a density matrix using a canonical ensemble gives a result of the form formula_128, where formula_129 is the inverse temperature formula_130 and formula_131 is the system&#x27;s Hamiltonian. The normalization condition that the trace of formula_73 be equal to 1 defines the partition function to be formula_133. If the number of particles involved in the system is itself not certain, then a grand canonical ensemble can be applied, where the states summed over to make the density matrix are drawn from a Fock space.
* Quantum decoherence theory typically involves non-isolated quantum systems developing entanglement with other systems, including measurement apparatuses. Density matrices make it much easier to describe the process and calculate its consequences. Quantum decoherence explains why a system interacting with an environment transitions from being a pure state, exhibiting superpositions, to a mixed state, an incoherent combination of classical alternatives. This transition is fundamentally reversible, as the combined state of system and environment is still pure, but for all practical purposes irreversible, as the environment is a very large and complex quantum system, and it is not feasible to reverse their interaction. Decoherence is thus very important for explaining the classical limit of quantum mechanics, but cannot explain wave function collapse, as all classical alternatives are still present in the mixed state, and wave function collapse selects only one of them.
* Similarly, in quantum computation, quantum information theory, open quantum systems, and other fields where state preparation is noisy and decoherence can occur, density matrices are frequently used. Noise is often modelled via a depolarizing channel or an amplitude damping channel. Quantum tomography is a process by which, given a set of data representing the results of quantum measurements, a density matrix consistent with those measurement results is computed.
* When analyzing a system with many electrons, such as an atom or molecule, an imperfect but useful first approximation is to treat the electrons as uncorrelated or each having an independent single-particle wavefunction. This is the usual starting point when building the Slater determinant in the Hartree–Fock method. If there are formula_134 electrons filling the formula_134 single-particle wavefunctions formula_136, then the collection of formula_134 electrons together can be characterized by a density matrix formula_138.

== C*-algebraic formulation of states ==
It is now generally accepted that the description of quantum mechanics in which all self-adjoint operators represent observables is untenable. For this reason, observables are identified with elements of an abstract C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; (that is one without a distinguished representation as an algebra of operators) and states are positive linear functionals on &quot;A&quot;. However, by using the GNS construction, we can recover Hilbert spaces that realize &quot;A&quot; as a subalgebra of operators.

Geometrically, a pure state on a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a state that is an extreme point of the set of all states on &quot;A&quot;. By properties of the GNS construction these states correspond to irreducible representations of &quot;A&quot;.

The states of the C*-algebra of compact operators &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) correspond exactly to the density operators, and therefore the pure states of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) are exactly the pure states in the sense of quantum mechanics.

The C*-algebraic formulation can be seen to include both classical and quantum systems. When the system is classical, the algebra of observables become an abelian C*-algebra. In that case the states become probability measures.

== History ==
The formalism of density operators and matrices was introduced in 1927 by John von Neumann and independently, but less systematically, by Lev Landau and later in 1946 by Felix Bloch. Von Neumann introduced the density matrix in order to develop both quantum statistical mechanics and a theory of quantum measurements. The name density matrix itself relates to its classical correspondence to a phase-space probability measure (probability distribution of position and momentum) in classical statistical mechanics, which was introduced by Eugene Wigner in 1932.

In contrast, the motivation that inspired Landau was the impossibility of describing a subsystem of a composite quantum system by a state vector.

<text>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is an executive department of the U.S. federal government that oversees U.S. national energy policy and energy production, the research and development of nuclear power, the military&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy-related research, and energy conservation.

The DOE was created in 1977 in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. It sponsors more physical science research than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories. The DOE also directs research in genomics, with the Human Genome Project originating from a DOE initiative.

The department is headed by the secretary of energy, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the Cabinet. The current secretary of energy is Chris Wright, who has served in the position since February 2025. The department&#x27;s headquarters are in southwestern Washington, D.C., in the James V. Forrestal Building, with additional offices in Germantown, Maryland.

== History ==

===Formation and consolidation===
In 1942, during World War II, the United States started the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. After the war, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created to control the future of the project. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 also created the framework for the first National Laboratories. Among other nuclear projects, the AEC produced fabricated uranium fuel cores at locations such as Fernald Feed Materials Production Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 split the responsibilities of the AEC into the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was charged with regulating the nuclear power industry, and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which was assigned to manage the nuclear weapon, naval reactor, and energy development programs.

The 1973 oil crisis called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law the Department of Energy Organization Act, which established the Department of Energy. The new agency, which began operations on October 1, 1977, consolidated the Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Federal Power Commission, and programs of various other agencies. Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, who served under Presidents Nixon and Ford during the Vietnam War, was appointed as the first secretary.

President Carter proposed the Department of Energy with the goal of promoting energy conservation and energy independence, and developing alternative sources of energy to reduce the use of fossil fuels. With international energy&#x27;s future uncertain for America, Carter acted quickly to have the department come into action the first year of his presidency. This was an extremely important issue of the time as the oil crisis was causing shortages and inflation. With the Three Mile Island accident, Carter was able to intervene with the help of the department. Through the DOE, Carter was able to make changes within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including improving management and procedures, since nuclear energy and weapons are responsibilities of the department.

=== Weapon plans stolen ===
In December 1999, the FBI was investigating how China obtained plans for a specific nuclear device. Wen Ho Lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime. The U.S. Congress held hearings to investigate the Department of Energy&#x27;s handling of his case. Republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues, rather than the DOE. All but one of the 59 charges against Lee were eventually dropped because the investigation proved the plans the Chinese obtained could not have come from Lee. Lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies. The episode eventually led to the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-autonomous agency within the department.

=== Loan guarantee program of 2005 ===
In 2001, American Solar Challenge was sponsored by the DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. After the 2005 race, the DOE discontinued its sponsorship.

Title XVII of Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes the DOE to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that &quot;avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases&quot; and &quot;employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued&quot;. In loan guarantees, a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment, as well as other conditions, before the loan guarantee is completed.

In September 2008, the DOE, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management (INMM), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) partnered to develop and launch the World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS), an international non-governmental organization designed to provide a forum to share best practices in strengthening the security and safety of nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities.

In December 2024, the Loan Programs Office announced it would extend the largest loan ever sanctioned – a $15 billion (US) low-interest loan to support the modernization of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric’s hydroelectric power structure, enhance transmission lines critical for renewable energy integration, data center operations, and the growing fleet of electric vehicles. Initially requested as a $30 billion (US) loan, the amount was reduced due to concerns over the company’s repayment capacity.

== Organization ==

The department announced a reorganization with new names of under secretaries in 2022.
The department is under the control and supervision of a United States Secretary of Energy, a political appointee of the President of the United States. The Energy Secretary is assisted in managing the department by a United States Deputy Secretary of Energy, also appointed by the president, who assumes the duties of the secretary in the secretary&#x27;s absence. The department also has three under secretaries, each appointed by the president, who oversee the major areas of the department&#x27;s work. The president also appoints seven officials with the rank of Assistant Secretary of Energy who have line management responsibility for major organizational elements of the department. The Energy Secretary assigns their functions and duties.

=== Symbolism in the seal ===
Excerpt from the Code of Federal Regulations, in Title 10: Energy:

The official seal of the Department of Energy &quot;includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt, on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo. It is crested by the white head of an eagle, atop a white rope. Both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency, in gold, appears on a green background.&quot;

&quot;The eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the Nation&#x27;s increasing demands for energy. The sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands. The rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities. The lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the Nation&#x27;s challenge in harnessing the forces.&quot;

&quot;The color scheme is derived from nature, symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man&#x27;s existence. The blue field represents air and water, green represents mineral resources and the earth itself, and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme represents the Nation&#x27;s commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment.&quot;

== Budget ==
On May 7, 2009 President Barack Obama unveiled a $26.4 billion budget request for DOE for fiscal year (FY) 2010, including $2.3 billion for the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). That budget aimed to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure. It also proposed significant investments in hybrids and plug-in hybrids, smart grid technologies, and scientific research and innovation.

As part of the $789 billion economic stimulus package in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congress provided Energy with an additional $38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, adding about 75 percent to Energy&#x27;s annual budgets. Most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts. For fiscal year 2013, each of the operating units of the Department of Energy operated with the following budgets:
In March 2018, Energy Secretary Rick Perry testified to a Senate panel about the Trump administration&#x27;s DOE budget request for fiscal year 2019. The budget request prioritized nuclear security while making large cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The proposal was a $500 million increase in funds over fiscal year 2017. It &quot;promotes innovations like a new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) and gains for the Office of Fossil Energy. Investments would be made to strengthen the National Nuclear Security Administration and modernize the nuclear force, as well as in weapons activities and advanced computing.&quot; However, the budget for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would be lowered to $696 million under the plan, down from $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2017. Overall, the department&#x27;s energy and related programs would be cut by $1.9 billion.

==Programs and contracts==
=== Energy Savings Performance Contract ===
Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) are contracts under which a contractor designs, constructs, and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project, and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency&#x27;s utility bills. The contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings, and after the contract ends, all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency.

=== Energy Innovation Hubs ===
Energy Innovation Hubs are multi-disciplinary, meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies. The Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) was the first DOE Energy Innovation Hub established in July 2010, for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) solutions for commercial nuclear reactors.

The 2009 DOE budget includes $280 million to fund eight Energy Innovation Hubs, each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge. Two of the eight hubs are included in the EERE budget and will focus on integrating smart materials, designs, and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity. Another two hubs, included in the DOE Office of Science budget, were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes. Yet another hub was made to develop &quot;smart&quot; materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions.

In 2012, the DOE awarded $120 million to the Ames Laboratory to start a new EIH, the Critical Materials Institute, which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements.

===Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy===

ARPA-E was officially created by the America COMPETES Act , authored by Congressman Bart Gordon, within the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in 2007, though without a budget. The initial budget of about $400 million was a part of the economic stimulus bill of February 2009.

<text>The Faboideae are a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae or Leguminosae. An acceptable alternative name for the subfamily is Papilionoideae, or Papilionaceae when this group of plants is treated as a family.

This subfamily is widely distributed, and members are adapted to a wide variety of environments. Faboideae may be trees, shrubs, or herbaceous plants. Members include the pea, the sweet pea, the laburnum, and other legumes. The pea-shaped flowers are characteristic of the Faboideae subfamily and root nodulation is very common.

<doc id="62888" wikidata="Q38301" url="?curid=62888" title="Gordon Setter">
<text>The Gordon Setter is a Scottish large breed of dog, a member of the setter family that also includes both the better-known Irish Setter and the English Setter. Setter breeds are classified as members of either the Sporting or Gundog Group depending on the national kennel club or council. 

The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. Their quarry in Scotland, may be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock: whilst overseas bird dogs are worked on quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin and any other bird that will sit to a dog—that is to say, will attempt to avoid a potential predator by concealment rather than by taking to the wing at the first sign of danger. It is this combination of a bird that will sit fast in front of a dog that will remain on point that makes bird dog work possible.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
Gordon Setters, also known as &quot;black and tans&quot;, have a coal-black coat with distinctive markings of a rich chestnut or mahogany colour on their paws and lower legs, vents, throat, and muzzles; one spot above each eye; and two spots on their chest. A small amount of white is allowed on the chest. Although uncommon, red Gordons are occasionally born to normal-coloured parents, the result of expression of a recessive red gene. Predominantly tan, red, or buff dogs are ineligible for showing. A Gordon&#x27;s coat is straight or slightly waved (but not curly), long and silky, with chest, stomach, ear, leg, and tail feathering. According to the AKC breed standard, &quot;the bearing is intelligent, noble, and dignified&quot;. They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, with males reaching at the withers and up to in weight.

===Temperament===
The AKC describes the Gordon Setter temperament as &quot;alert, interested, and confident. He is fearless and willing, intelligent, and capable. He is loyal and affectionate, and strong-minded enough to stand the rigors of training&quot;. Gordons are intensely loyal to their owners; thrive in an attentive, loving environment; and are good family dogs. Puppies and adult dogs can be quite boisterous, and although they are patient by nature, may not be suitable for households with very young children. Gordons are sensitive and empathic, eager to learn, and need firm but gentle handling. Early socialisation and obedience training are important. The breed is one of the slowest to mature, not hitting prime until three years of age or more, and will show puppy-like characteristics well into their older years.

Gordons were bred to run, and require 60 to 80 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. Young dogs should not be over-exercised or begin agility training until they are at least 18 months old, to avoid joint problems later in life. Because of their hunting instincts, Gordons should not be allowed to roam freely if unsupervised, as they are apt to wander into a potentially dangerous traffic situation while following a scent.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Although not as prone to hip dysplasia as many of the larger breeds, Gordons can suffer from the condition. Other health issues can include hypothyroidism, gastric torsion (bloat) and eye diseases such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and cataracts. Life expectancy for the breed is generally about 10 to 15 years.

At the beginning of 2009, a report was issued to all of the Breed Clubs in the UK concerning cases of late onset PRA in Gordon Setters.

On March 14, 2011, Animal Health Trust (AHT) made a DNA test available. The mutation is termed rcd4 (for rod-cone degeneration 4) to distinguish it from other, previously described forms of rod-cone degeneration. It is recessive, and 19 out of the 21 Gordons in their study who had clinical signs of PRA were homozygous for this mutation, indicating it is the major cause of PRA in the breed. As many as 50% of Gordon Setters may be carriers.
== Origin ==


Many of the gun dogs described by Stonehenge are no longer to be found in the United Kingdom or have been absorbed into one of the other breeds. The Russian Setter, the Welsh Setter, Northern Irish Water Spaniel, Southern Irish Water Spaniel and English Water Spaniel, the Spanish Pointer and the Portuguese Pointer have all disappeared in the past hundred and fifty years, and the pictures of some of the breeds that are still with us show considerable differences to the breed as we see them today.

Edward Laverick wrote in &quot;The Setter&quot;, published in 1872: &quot;the setter is but an improved spaniel&quot;; while the Rev Pearce in &quot;The Dog&quot;, published in the same year, said, &#x27;he is a direct descendant of the Spaniel: &quot;a Setting Spaniel&quot; was the first Setter&#x27;. Since then this is the generally agreed with conclusion that the Setter was primarily derived from the old Land Spaniel, so called so as to distinguish it from the Water Spaniel. It is however likely that outside crosses with Hounds or Pointers did influence its development. William Taplin in &quot;The Sportsman&#x27;s Cabinet&quot; (1803–04) maintained that it was &quot;originally produced by a commixture between the Spanish pointer and the larger breed of the English spaniel&quot;.

We now really need not to go back to the Spaniel and its specialised development into the setting-dog, as it was called, and can be found in the work by the famous French sportsman, Gaston de Foix, Vicomte de Béarn (1331–91), who it is said owned about 1500 dogs &#x27;brought from all countries of Europe&#x27; and was known as &#x27;Gaston Phèbus&#x27; owing to his love for the chase. This work is called &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot; or &quot;Miroir de Phèbus&quot;, and was started in 1387. This work was the bases of &quot;The Master of Game&quot; written between 1406 and 1413 by Edward III&#x27;s grandson, Edward, second Duke of York, who acknowledged his debt to de Foix. Below is the main passage referring to the Spaniel and the Setting-dog, as republished in 1904:

&lt;poem&gt;Another kind of dog is that is called falcon-dog or spaniel [&quot;espaignols&quot; in the French original] because it comes from Spain, notwithstanding that there are many in other countries...

A good spaniel should not be too rough, though his tail should be rough. The good qualities that such a dogs are these: They love well their masters and follow them without losing, although they be in a great crowd of men, and commonly they go before their master, running and wagging their tail, and raise or start fowl and wild beasts. But their right craft is of the partridge and of the quail. It is good for a man that has a noble goshawk, or a tierecel, or a sparrowhawk for the partridges to have such dogs; and also, when they are taught to be couchers (&quot;chiens couchants&quot; in the original French—ed.), they are good for taking partridge and quail with the net...&lt;/poem&gt;
:—Baillie-Grohman, p. 66

The modern Gordon Setter is a predominantly black dog with rich tan marking on the muzzle, legs and chest. A little bigger and heavier than either the Irish or English, he is nevertheless descended from the same genetic mixing pot, which undoubtedly has its origins among those setting spaniels we met earlier. The Kennel Club applied the name &#x27;Gordon Setter&#x27; to the breed in 1924. Before that they were known as black and tan setters, and were found in many kennels beside those of the Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743–1827). Indeed, as we shall see, there is plenty of evidence that the majority of the setters at Gordon Castle during the Duke&#x27;s time were tri-coloured rather than pure black and tan.

The breed was brought to the United States by George Blunt and Daniel Webster in 1842, with the purchase of two dogs named Rake and Rachel from the Duke&#x27;s kennels. The American Kennel Club officially recognised the breed in 1892.

== Breed development ==

===As a gundog in Scotland and Northern England ===
Among the many changes which took place in sport and country affairs during the 20th century were those concerned with the method of shooting and consequent role of the gundog. These changes were accelerated after World War II, prior to which there were many &quot;dogging moors&quot; in the north of England and especially in Scotland. Walking up game became largely superseded by driving and field-craft by marksmanship. The function of the gundog was as a result limited to the recovery of dead or wounded birds and — in the age of specialisation — this meant that the Labrador Retriever came to the forefront while the number of working pointers and setters declined year after year.

Besides the modernisation of the style of shooting and the work required of gundogs, the situation was altered by the new developments that also took place in farming, which helped to bring about a marked reduction in the partridge population. Factors include the introduction of modernisation such as early cutting of silage, the use of fast-moving mechanical equipment, the burning or ploughing of stubble-fields soon after harvest, the destruction of hedgerows, and the use of chemical sprays for weed-killing. The hedgerows had provided shelter and nesting sites; the weeds and other herbage supplied food and cover; whilst the stubble-fields had been a primary source of winter food; so the partridges were deprived of some important assets, whilst the wide use of chemicals on the land exercised a direct harmful effect. These changes significantly affected the status of setters and pointers. Though often used as a general purpose gundog, the Gordon Setter has been a wide-ranging dog employed in the Scotland to locate red grouse and ptarmigan on the Scottish or North of England moors and partridges on the stubble-fields of the south of England. Up to the late 1930s, most Gordons were kept for this type of work, so that the majority were to be found in Scotland and the north of England; but now they are more evenly distributed and there are no large working kennels.

The function of the setter is well summarised by Captain Blaine: 
Two Gordon Setters have achieved the title of Dual Champion. The Kennel Club regulations state this title can only be claimed by dogs who have achieved the title of Show Champion and Field Trial Champion. The first was a bitch, Amscot Irresista Belle; her pet name was Trisca. The second was Trisca&#x27;s relative, Boyers Scarlatti.

===Gordon Castle and other historically important kennels===
Alexander, the 4th Duke of Gordon (1743–1827), established his kennel of Black and Tan Setters at Gordon Castle, which was situated near Fochabers, not far from the River Spey and a few miles from the coast of Moray. The exact date when this occurred is not known. A Colonel Thornton visited the place during his tour of the Highlands in 1786. He makes no mention of any kennel of Setters at that time, although he does note that &quot;The Duke of Gordon still keeps up a diversion of falconry….I saw, also, here a true Highland greyhound, which is now become very scarce….&quot; The Duke was indeed devoted to country pursuits and was among the last of his day in Scotland to keep hawks and practise falconry; he was celebrated for his Scottish Deerhounds as well as his Setters. However all that can be inferred from the Colonel&#x27;s remarks is that there are unlikely to have been any Setters of note at the Castle in 1786.

There is much on record that seems reliable about the origin or derivation of the Duke of Gordon&#x27;s Setters, though verification at this late date is of course impossible. Most of this evidence comes from Samuel Brown, the Veterinary Surgeon of Melton Mowbray, who was a great authority on the breed. In a letter to &quot;The Field&quot; in 1864, Samuel Brown stated: 

Five years later, in another letter to the same journal, the Rev F. W. Adye wrote: 
These facts were well known to J. H. Walsh (‘Stonehenge’), Editor of &quot;The Field&quot; and a leading authority on sporting dogs, for it is he who mentions in the first chapter of his book &quot;The Dogs of the British Islands&quot; (1867) that a Setter &quot;from Mr Coke of Norfolk and doubtless related to the late Duke of Gordon’s kennel, as Mr Coke and the duke bred together and interchanged setters frequently.&quot; Therefore, it does appear to be reasonably established that Mr Coke provided most of the original Setters for the Duke&#x27;s kennel. The Rev Hutchinson, who wrote under the pseudonym ‘Sixty-one’, insisted that &quot;the original setter taken or sent to Gordon Castle by the first Marquis of Anglesea&quot;, however what has been seen is that, according to Samuel Brown’s ‘old gentleman sportsman’, the Marquees of Anglesey likewise had his original stock of Setters at Beaudesart from Mr Coke – probably, although this cannot be confirmed, some years before the Gordon Castle kennel was founded; for in 1869 the Beaudesart Setters were said to have been maintained ‘for sixty years pure and unmixed with any blood’. It is most unlikely that the Duke obtained his setters from only one source, we know that he interbreed with other kennels besides Mr Coke’s, notably with Lord Lovat’s.

<doc id="62889" wikidata="Q469636" url="?curid=62889" title="Night monkey">
<text>Night monkeys, also known as owl monkeys or douroucoulis (), are nocturnal New World monkeys of the genus Aotus, the only member of the family Aotidae (). The genus comprises eleven species which are found across Panama and much of South America in primary and secondary forests, tropical rainforests and cloud forests up to . Night monkeys have large eyes which improve their vision at night, while their ears are mostly hidden, giving them their name &quot;Aotus&quot;, meaning &quot;earless&quot;.

Night monkeys are the only truly nocturnal monkeys with the exception of some cathemeral populations of Azara&#x27;s night monkey, who have irregular bursts of activity during day and night. They have a varied repertoire of vocalisations and live in small family groups of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Night monkeys have monochromatic vision which improves their ability to detect visual cues at night.

Night monkeys are threatened by habitat loss, the pet trade, hunting for bushmeat, and by biomedical research. They constitute one of the few monkey species affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; and are therefore used as experimental subjects in malaria research. The Peruvian night monkey is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an Endangered species, while four are Vulnerable species, four are Least-concern species, and two are data deficient.

==Taxonomy==
Until 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (&quot;A. lemurimus&quot;) or two species (&quot;A. lemurinus&quot; and &quot;A. azarae&quot;). Chromosome variability showed that there was more than one species in the genus and Hershkovitz (1983) used morphological and karyological evidence to propose nine species, one of which is now recognised as a junior synonym. He split &quot;Aotus&quot; into two groups: a northern, gray-necked group (&quot;A. lemurinus&quot;, &quot;A. hershkovitzi&quot;, &quot;A. trivirgatus&quot; and &quot;A. vociferans&quot;) and a southern, red-necked group (&quot;A. miconax&quot;, &quot;A. nancymaae&quot;, &quot;A. nigriceps&quot; and &quot;A. azarae&quot;). Arguably, the taxa otherwise considered subspecies of &quot;A. lemurinus&quot; – &quot;brumbacki&quot;, &quot;griseimembra&quot; and &quot;zonalis&quot; – should be considered separate species, whereas &quot;A. hershkovitzi&quot; arguably is a junior synonym of &quot;A. lemurinus&quot;. A new species from the gray-necked group was recently described as &quot;A. jorgehernandezi&quot;. As is the case with some other splits in this genus, an essential part of the argument for recognizing this new species was differences in the chromosomes. Chromosome evidence has also been used as an argument for merging &quot;species&quot;, as was the case for considering &quot;infulatus&quot; a subspecies of &quot;A. azarae&quot; rather than a separate species. One extinct species is known from the fossil record.

==Physical characteristics==
Night monkeys have large brown eyes; the size improves their nocturnal vision increasing their ability to be active at night. They are sometimes said to lack a tapetum lucidum, the reflective layer behind the retina possessed by many nocturnal animals. Other sources say they have a tapetum lucidum composed of collagen fibrils. At any rate, night monkeys lack the tapetum lucidum composed of riboflavin crystals possessed by lemurs and other strepsirrhines, which is an indication that their nocturnality is a secondary adaption evolved from ancestrally diurnal primates.

Their ears are rather difficult to see; this is why their genus name, &quot;Aotus&quot; (meaning &quot;earless&quot;) was chosen. There is little data on the weights of wild night monkeys. From the figures that have been collected, it appears that males and females are similar in weight; the heaviest species is Azara&#x27;s night monkey at around , and the lightest is Brumback&#x27;s night monkey, which weighs between . The male is slightly taller than the female, measuring , respectively.

==Ecology==
Night monkeys can be found in Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela. The species that live at higher elevations tend to have thicker fur than the monkeys at sea level. Night monkeys can live in forests undisturbed by humans (primary forest) as well as in forests that are recovering from human logging efforts (secondary forest).

=== Distribution ===
A primary distinction between red-necked and gray-necked night monkeys is spatial distribution. Gray-necked night monkeys (&quot;Aotus lemurinus&quot; group) are found north of the Amazon River, while the red-necked group (&quot;Aotus azare&quot; group) are localized south of the Amazon River. Red-necked night monkeys are found throughout various regions of the Amazon rainforest of South America, with some variation occurring between the four species. Nancy Ma&#x27;s night monkey occurs in both flooded and unflooded tropical rainforest regions of Peru, preferring moist swamp and mountainous areas. This species has been observed nesting in regions of the Andes and has recently been introduced to Colombia, likely as a result of post-research release into the community. The black-headed night monkey is also found mainly in the Peruvian Amazon (central and upper Amazon), however its range extends throughout Brazil and Bolivia to the base of the Andes mountain chain. Night monkeys such like the black-headed night monkey, generally inhabit cloud forests; areas with consistent presence of low clouds with a high mist and moisture content which allows for lush and rich vegetation to grow year round, providing excellent food and lodging sources. The Peruvian night monkey, like Nancy Ma&#x27;s night monkey, is endemic to the Peruvian Andes however it is found at a higher elevation, approximately above sea level and therefore exploits different niches of this habitat. The distribution of &quot;A. azare&quot;, extends further towards the Atlantic Ocean, spanning Argentina, Bolivia and the drier, south western regions of Paraguay, however unlike the other red-necked night monkey species, it is not endemic to Brazil.

=== Sleep sites ===
During the daylight hours, night monkeys rest in shaded tree areas. These species have been observed exploiting four different types of tree nests, monkeys will rest in; holes formed in the trunks of trees, in concave sections of branches surrounded by creepers and epiphytes, in dense areas of epiphyte, climber and vine growth and in areas of dense foliage. These sleeping sites provide protection from environmental stressors such as heavy rain, sunlight and heat. Sleeping sites are therefore carefully chosen based upon tree age, density of trees, availability of space for the group, ability of site to provide protection, ease of access to the site and availability of site with respect to daily routines. While night monkeys are an arboreal species, nests have not been observed in higher strata of the rainforest ecosystem, rather a higher density of nests were recorded at low-mid vegetation levels. Night monkeys represent a territorial species, territories are defended by conspecifics through the use of threatening and agonistic behaviours. Ranges between night monkey species often do overlap and result in interspecific aggressions such as vocalizing and chasing which may last up to an hour.

=== Diet ===
Night monkeys are primarily frugivorous, as fruits are easily distinguished through the use of olfactory cues, but leaf and insect consumption has also been observed in the cathemeral night monkey species &quot;A. azare&quot;. A study conducted by Wolovich et al., indicated that juveniles and females were much better at catching both crawling and flying insects than adult males. In general, the technique used by night monkeys in insect capturing is to use the palm of the hand to flatten a prey insect against a tree branch and then proceed to consume the carcass. During the winter months or when food sources are reduced, night monkeys have also been observed foraging on flowers such as &quot;Tabebuia heptaphylla&quot;, however this does not represent a primary food source.

=== Reproduction ===
In night monkeys, mating occurs infrequently, however females are fertile year-round, with reproductive cycles range from 13 to 25 days. The gestation period for night monkey is approximately 117– 159 days but varies from species to species. Birthing season extends from September to March and is species-dependent, with one offspring being produced per year; however, in studies conducted in captivity, twins were observed. Night monkeys reach puberty at a relatively young age, between 7 and 11 months, and most species attain full sexual maturity by the time they reach 2 years of age. &quot;A. azare&quot; represents an exception reaching sexual maturity by the age of 4.

==Behavior==
The name &quot;night monkey&quot; comes from the fact that all species are active at night and are, in fact, the only truly nocturnal monkeys (an exception is the subspecies of Azara&#x27;s night monkey, &quot;Aotus azarae azarae&quot;, which is cathemeral). Night monkeys make a notably wide variety of vocal sounds, with up to eight categories of distinct calls (gruff grunts, resonant grunts, sneeze grunts, screams, low trills, moans, gulps, and hoots), and a frequency range of 190–1,950 Hz. Unusual among the New World monkeys, they are monochromats, that is, they have no colour vision, presumably because it is of no advantage given their nocturnal habits. They have a better spatial resolution at low light levels than other primates, which contributes to their ability to capture insects and move at night. Night monkeys live in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Family groups defend territories by vocal calls and scent marking.

The night monkey is socially monogamous, and all night monkeys form pair bonds. Only one infant is born each year. The male is the primary caregiver, and the mother carries the infant for only the first week or so of its life. This is believed to have developed because it increases the survival of the infant and reduces the metabolic costs on the female. Adults will occasionally be evicted from the group by same-sex individuals, either kin or outsiders.

=== Nocturnality ===
The family &quot;Aotidae&quot; is the only family of nocturnal species within the suborder Anthropoidea. While the order primates is divided into prosimians; many of which are nocturnal, the anthropoids possess very few nocturnal species and therefore it is highly likely that the ancestors of the family &quot;Aotidae&quot; did not exhibit nocturnality and were rather diurnal species.  The presence of nocturnal behavior in &quot;Aotidae&quot; therefore exemplifies a derived trait; an evolutionary adaptation that conferred greater fitness advantages onto the night monkey.  Night monkey share some similarities with nocturnal prosimians including low basal metabolic rate, small body size and good ability to detect visual cues at low light levels. Their responses to olfactory stimulus are intermediate between those of the prosimians and diurnal primate species, however the ability to use auditory cues remains more similar to diurnal primate species than to nocturnal primate species. This provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that nocturnality is a derived trait in the family &quot;Aotidae&quot;.

As the ancestor of &quot;Aotidae&quot; was likely diurnal, selective and environmental pressures must have been exerted on the members of this family which subsequently resulted in the alteration of their circadian rhythm to adapt to fill empty niches. Being active in the night rather than during the day time, gave &quot;Aotus&quot; access to better food sources, provided protection from predators, reduced interspecific competition and provided an escape from the harsh environmental conditions of their habitat. To begin, resting during the day allows for decreased interaction with diurnal predators. Members of the family &quot;Aotidae,&quot; apply the predation avoidance theory, choosing very strategic covered nests sites in trees. These primates carefully choose areas with sufficient foliage and vines to provide cover from the sun and camouflage from predators, but which simultaneously allow for visibility of ground predators and permit effective routes of escape should a predator approach too quickly. Activity at night also permits night monkeys to avoid aggressive interactions with other species such as competing for food and territorial disputes; as they are active when most other species are inactive and resting.

Night monkeys also benefit from a nocturnal life style as activity in the night provides a degree of protection from the heat of the day and the thermoregulation difficulties associated. Although night monkey, like all primates are endothermic, meaning they are able to produce their own heat, night monkeys undergo behavioural thermoregulation in order to minimize energy expenditure. During the hottest points of the day, night monkeys are resting and therefore expending less energy in the form of heat. As they carefully construct their nests, night monkeys also benefit from the shade provided by the forest canopy which enables them to cool their bodies through the act of displacing themselves into a shady area. Additionally, finding food is energetically costly and completing this process during the day time usually involves the usage of energy in the form of calories and lipid reserves to cool the body down. Foraging during the night when it is cooler, and when there is less competition, supports the optimal foraging theory; maximize energy input while minimizing energy output.

While protection from predators, interspecific interactions, and the harsh environment propose ultimate causes for nocturnal behavior as they increase the species fitness, the proximate causes of nocturnality are linked to the environmental effects on circadian rhythm. While diurnal species are stimulated by the appearance of the sun, in nocturnal species, activity is highly impacted by the degree of moon light available. The presence of a new moon has correlated with inhibition of activity in night monkeys who exhibit lower levels of activity with decreasing levels of moon light. Therefore, the lunar cycle has a significant influence on the foraging and a nocturnal behaviors of night monkey species.

=== Pair-bonded social animals (social monogamy) ===
Night monkeys are socially monogamous—they form a bond and mate with one partner. They live in small groups consisting of a pair of reproductive adults, one infant and one to two juveniles. These species exhibit mate guarding, a practice in which the male individual will protect the female he is bonded to and prevent other conspecifics from attempting to mate with her.  Mate guarding likely evolved as a means of reducing energy expenditure when mating. As night monkey territories generally have some edge overlap, there can be a large number of individuals coexisting in one area which may make it difficult for a male to defend many females at once due to high levels of interspecific competition for mates. Night monkeys form bonded pairs and the energy expenditure of protecting a mate is reduced. Pair bonding may also be exhibited as a result of food distribution. In the forest, pockets of food can be dense or very patchy and scarce. Females, as they need energy stores to support reproduction are generally distributed to areas with sufficient food sources. Males will therefore also have to distribute themselves to be within proximity to females, this form of food distribution lends itself to social monogamy as finding females may become difficult if males have to constantly search for females which may be widely distributed depending on food availability that year.

However, while this does explain social monogamy, it does not explain the high degree of paternal care which is exhibited by these primates. After the birth of an infant, males are the primary carrier of the infant, carrying offspring up to 90% of the time. In addition to aiding in child care, males will support females during lactation through sharing their foraged food with lactating females. Generally, food sharing is not observed in nature as the search for food requires a great degree of energy expenditure, but in the case of night monkey males, food sharing confers offspring survival advantages. As lactating females may be too weak to forage themselves, they may lose the ability to nurse their child, food sharing therefore ensures that offspring will be well feed. The act of food sharing is only observed among species where there is a high degree of fidelity in paternity. Giving up valuable food sources would not confer an evolutionary advance unless it increased an individual&#x27;s fitness; in this case, paternal care ensures success of offspring and therefore increases the father&#x27;s fitness.

=== Olfactory communication and foraging ===
Recent studies have proposed that night monkeys rely on olfaction and olfactory cues for foraging and communication significantly more than other diurnal primate species. This trend is reflected in the species physiology; members of Aotidae possess larger scent perception organs than their diurnal counterparts. The olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb and volume of lateral olfactory tract are all larger in &quot;Aotus&quot; than in any of the other new world monkey species. It is therefore likely that increased olfaction capacities improved the fitness of these nocturnal primate species; they produced more offspring and passed on these survival enhancing traits. The benefits of increased olfaction in night monkeys are twofold; increased ability to use scent cues has facilitated night time foraging and is also an important factor in mate selection and sexual attractivity.

As a substantial portion of the night monkey&#x27;s activities occurring during the dark hours of the night, there is a much lower reliance of visual and tactile cues. When foraging at night, members of the family Aotidae will smell fruits and leaves before ingesting to determine the quality and safety of the food source. As they are highly frugivorous and cannot perceive colour well, smell becomes the primary determinant of the ripeness of fruits and is therefore an important component in the optimal foraging methods of these primates. Upon finding a rich food source, night monkeys have been observed scent marking not only the food source, but the route from their sleeping site to the food source as well. Scent can therefore be used as an effective method of navigation and reduce energy expenditure during subsequent foraging expeditions. Night monkeys possess several scent glands covered by greasy hair patches, which secrete pheromones that can be transferred onto vegetation or other conspecifics. Scent glands are often located subcaudal, but also occur near the muzzle and the sternum. The process of scent marking is accomplished through the rubbing of the hairs covering scent glands onto the desired &quot;marked item&quot;.

Olfactory cues are also of significant importance in the process of mating and mate guarding. Male night monkeys will rub subcaudal glands onto their female partner in a process called &quot;partner marking&quot; in order to relay the signal to coexisting males that the female is not available for mating. Night monkeys also send chemical signals through urine to communicate reproductive receptivity. In many cases, male night monkeys have been observed drinking the urine of their female mate; it is proposed that the pheromones in the urine can indicate the reproductive state of a female and indicate ovulation. This is especially important in night monkeys as they cannot rely on visual cues, such as the presence of a tumescence, to determine female reproductive state. Therefore, olfactory communication in night monkeys is a result of sexual selection; sexually dimorphic trait conferring increased reproductive success. This trait demonstrates sexual dimorphism, as males have larger subcaudal scent glands compared to female counterparts and sex differences have been recorded in the glandular secretions of each sex. There is a preference for scents of a particular type; those which indicate reproductive receptivity, which increases species fitness by facilitating the production of offspring.

== Conservation ==
According to the IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature), the Peruvian night monkey is classified an Endangered species, four species are Vulnerable, four are Least-concern species, and two are data deficient. Most night monkey species are threatened by varying levels of habitat loss throughout their range, caused by agricultural expansion, cattle ranching, logging, armed conflict, and mining operations. To date, it is estimated that more than 62% of the habitat of the Peruvian night monkey has been destroyed or degraded by human activities. However, some night monkey species have become capable of adapting exceptionally well to anthropogenic influences in their environment. Populations of Peruvian night monkey have been observed thriving in small forest fragments and plantation or farmland areas, however this is likely possible given their small body size and may not be an appropriate alternate habitat option for other larger night monkey species. Studies have already been conducted into the feasibility of agroforestry; plantations which simultaneously support local species biodiversity. In the case of &quot;A. miconax&quot;, coffee plantations with introduced shade trees, provided quality habitat spaces. While the coffee plantation benefited from the increased shade—reducing weed growth and desiccation, night monkeys used the space as a habitat, a connection corridor or stepping stone area between habitats that provided a rich food source. However, some researchers question the agroforestry concept, maintaining that monkeys are more susceptible to hunting, predator and pathogens in plantation fields, thus indicating the need for further research into the solution before implementation.

Night monkeys are additionally threatened by both national and international trade for bushmeat and domestic pets. Since 1975, the pet trade of night monkeys has been regulated by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).  In the last forty years, nearly 6,000 live night monkeys and more than 7,000 specimens have been traded from the nine countries which they call home. While the restrictive laws put into place by CITES are aiding in the reduction of these numbers, 4 out of 9 countries, show deficiencies in maintaining the standards outlined by CITES Increased attention and enforcement of these laws will be imperative for the sustainability of night monkey populations.

Use in biomedical research poses another threat to night monkey biodiversity. Species such as Nancy Ma&#x27;s night monkey, like human beings, are susceptible to infection by the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; parasite responsible for malaria. This trait caused them to be recommended by the World Health Organization as test subjects in the development of malaria vaccines. Up to 2008, more than 76 night monkeys died as a result of vaccine testing; some died from malaria, while others perished due to medical complications from the testing.

Increased research and knowledge of night monkey ecology is an invaluable tool in determining conservation strategies for these species and raising awareness for consequences of the anthropogenic threats facing these primates. Radio-collaring of free ranging primates proposes a method of obtaining more accurate and complete data surrounding primate behavior patterns. This in turn can aid in understanding what measures need to be taken to promote the conservation of these species. Radio collaring not only allows for the identification of individuals within a species, increased sample size, more detailed dispersal and range patterns, but also facilitates educational programs which raise awareness for the current biodiversity crisis. The usage of radio-collaring while potentially extremely valuable, has been shown to interfere with social group interactions, the development of better collaring techniques and technology will therefore be imperative in the realisation and successful use of radio collars on night monkeys.

<text>The English Setter is a medium-size breed of dog. It is part of the setter group, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white coat has long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour (known as ticking), and the different colour varieties are referred to as &#x27;belton&#x27;.

As a gun dog, it is used to hunt for game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. It is sometimes referred to as the Laverack or Llewellin Setter as these were famous strains of the breed during the major development period in the 19th century. Those from hunting stock are generally of a finer build and with less coat than those bred for show exhibition.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The English Setter is a medium-sized dog which should have an elegant overall appearance. Its size can range from for females up to for males. The field or hunting type can be finer in build and construction than those from bench or show lines. The breed was designed to hunt game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse so should be able to cover a lot of ground when seeking the airborne scent of the birds, carrying its head high. The head should be slightly domed with a muzzle of good depth and show chiselling under the eyes, which should be dark in colour with a kind, gentle expression. The top of the ears (sometimes the ears are referred to as &quot;leathers&quot;) are positioned in line with the eyes and lie in an elegant fold. It has a long muscular neck, well angled shoulders and a brisket of good depth. The body is of a moderate length proportionate to its height and it has strong powerful hindquarters. It carries its tail in line with its back and the tail should be long enough to reach the hock.

The main body coat is short to medium length, lies flat and has a silky texture. Long silky coat – usually called &quot;feathering&quot;, forms fringes on the outside of the ears, neck, chest, down the back of the front legs, under the belly and on the back legs. The tail is also feathered with long coat.
The body coat and feathering should be straight and flat but not profuse and never curly although a slight wave can be seen.

The bench or show type has a long, flowing coat that requires regular grooming. The field or hunting type has a shorter coat that requires less grooming.

The base colour of the coat is white with differing coloured ticking also called flecks or speckling. The various speckled coat colours when occurring in English Setters are referred to as &quot;belton&quot;; valid combinations are white with black flecks (&quot;blue belton&quot;), white with orange flecks (&quot;orange belton&quot;), white with orange flecks and lighter nose (&quot;lemon belton&quot;), white with liver flecks (&quot;liver belton&quot;), or &quot;tricolour&quot;, which is blue or liver belton with tan markings on the face, chest, and legs. The flecking should not form large patches on the body and the flecks should be distributed all over the body. The use of the word &quot;belton&quot; was first coined by Laverack, who developed the breed in the 19th century, to describe his ideal for flecking and is also the name of a village in the extreme north of England. Puppies&#x27; coats may not have all the markings that they have as adults.
===Temperament===

This breed&#x27;s standard temperament is best described as a &quot;Gentleman by Nature&quot;. However, it can also be strong-willed and mischievous, especially if coming from working/field breeding lines. English Setters are energetic, people-oriented dogs, that are well suited to families who can give them attention and activity, or to working with a hunter, where they have a job to do. They are active dogs that need plenty of exercise and up to two hours a day of exercise is recommended. Inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch potatoes and lap dogs; the breed is described as &quot;intensely friendly,&quot; &quot;good natured,&quot; and &quot;adores visitors and is particularly happy with children.&quot;

They rank 37th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of above average working/obedience intelligence. English Setters are very intelligent and can be trained to perform about any task another breed can do, with the exception of herding. However, they are not always easy to train, as their natural bird instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments. Their temperament is considered to be gentle and as English Setters can be very sensitive to criticism, positive reinforcement training methods using treats and praise work best when undertaking basic training.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 10 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

Dogs, both pedigree and cross breeds, can be affected with genetic problems. Those known to sometimes occur in English Setters can include congenital deafness, which was reported as affecting 12.4 percent of the 701 English Setters tested by the Louisiana State University in 2010. As at 2013, there has not been any detailed research on this condition undertaken in the UK; autoimmune thyroiditis, which was shown to affect 26.2 percent of 747 English Setters examined between January 1974 until December 2012 in an Orthopedic Foundation for Animals listing; canine hypothyroidism; elbow dysplasia; and allergies, which can include some sensitivity to certain food ingredients and also skin conditions, are known to occur.

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

==Function==

Setters hunt by ranging over large distances in a systematic, methodical manner, silently seeking game by scent. When prey is found by scenting the air, the dog will freeze rather than give chase. The dog will stop in a sort of crouch or &quot;set&quot; by freezing in a standing position upon finding their quarry and this distinctive stance is how the term “setter” evolved. Once the dog has indicated where the birds are by freezing on point, on command it would then slowly creep forward to disturb the birds into flight. Once the birds were in flight the hunter who had been following the dog would release hawks to capture the birds in the air. When netting superseded the use of hawks, setting dogs would still be used to indicate the whereabouts of the birds, but the hunter would come up behind the dog and throw a net over the birds. In the mid-1600s, guns became more readily available and shooting game birds became a popular pastime of the landed gentry. The basic work of setters was still to find and point to the location of game birds but it also had to be steady to shot.

The scent of game birds is airborne so to pick up this scent the setter carries its head well up and should never follow foot scent. Most setters are born with a natural proclivity to hunting. Dogs that show excitement and interest in birds are described as being &quot;birdy&quot;, and trainers look for puppies that show this particular trait. Training is usually done with quail as a first choice or domesticated pigeons.

Writing in 1876, Arnold Burges described the &quot;pure-blooded English Setter&quot; as &quot;the best animal for American upland shooting&quot; in his book &quot;The American Kennel and Sporting Field&quot;.

==Early history==
&quot;Setting dogges&quot; is an old term used for setters and the original purpose of the English Setter was to set or point upland game birds. From the best available information, it appears that the English Setter was a trained bird dog in England more than 400 years ago and there are works of art created in the early 15th century showing dogs that are discernible as being of a “setter type”. There is evidence that the English Setter originated in crosses of the Spanish Pointer, large Water Spaniel, and English Springer Spaniel, which combined to produce an excellent bird dog with a high degree of proficiency in finding and pointing game in open country.

Writing in 1576, Dr Johannes Caius states: &quot;There is also at this date among us a new kind of dogge brought out of Fraunce, and they bee speckled all over with white and black, which mingled colours incline to a marble blewe&quot;. Argue speculates this may be a description of the blue belton colour found in English Setters.

Caius went on to describe the dog called a setter using the Latin name index:
By the 17th century setters, or &quot;setting dogges&quot;, had become established and were widespread on British estates, although the evolution into the more specific individual breeds of setters occurred at a later date. The interbreeding of the different colours was still taking place during this period but it gradually changed and sportsman/breeders began to segregate matings to dogs adapted to the terrain it was required to work on.

==Breed development==
The modern English Setter owes its appearance to Edward Laverack (1800–1877), who developed his own strain of the breed by careful breeding during the 19th century in England and to another Englishman, Richard Purcell Llewellin (1840–1925), who founded his strain using Laverack&#x27;s best dogs and outcrossed them with the Duke, Rhoebe and later Duke&#x27;s littermate Kate bloodlines with the best results.

Historically, many dogs descending from the same bloodline were referred to by the name of their breeder or owner and the nomenclatures &quot;Laverack Setter&quot; and &quot;Llewellin Setter&quot; describe English Setters bred by Laverack and Llewellin. Horace Lytle, one time gundog editor of &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot;, author and a well-known gundog trainer, clarified this in the book &quot;How to train your bird dog&quot;, which he wrote in 1928:
Around 1826, Reverend A Harrison of Carlisle in Cumbria sold a male dog called &quot;Ponto&quot; and a female named &quot;Old Moll&quot; to Laverack and this pair formed the foundation of his English Setters. Laverack did not know the exact pedigree of these dogs but maintained the strain had been pure-bred for the previous thirty-five years. Laverack closely inbred to these two dogs for generations and his bloodline was successful in dog shows and as a working dog in field trials.

In 1874, C. H. Raymond from Morris Plains, New Jersey imported the first English Setter from the Laverack bloodline to America. The working setter Count Noble descended from these early imports and is commemorated in the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.
Llewellin&#x27;s strain was based on Laverack&#x27;s best dogs, which were then outcrossed with the bloodlines of his dogs Duke, Rhoebe and later Duke&#x27;s littermate, Kate. It was Kate bred with Laverack&#x27;s best hunting males that produced Llewellin&#x27;s ideals Fd.Ch.Ch. Armstrong&#x27;s Dash II and later Fd.Ch.Ch Dashing Bondhu. They were the foundation of Llewellin&#x27;s personal strain known as &quot;Dashing Bondhu&quot;. William Humphrey (1882–1963) inherited them from Llewellin in 1925 and continued them pure until his death in 1963.
Jim the Wonder Dog, described as a Llewellin setter, was said to have &quot;possessed an occult power&quot; and there is a bronze statue of him in a memorial garden on the square in Marshall, Missouri, built to commemorate him.

==In competitions==
The field type and show type English Setter look very different, even though they are the same breed. Field type setters are often smaller and are seen with less feathering and usually more distinctive spotting than show type setters. Both traits are beneficial in the field: less feathering makes getting burs out of their coat easier and the spotting makes them easier to see in the field.

English Setters are classified within the gundog group in the UK and the Sporting group in America and Canada. The FCI place them in section 2, British and Irish Pointers and Setters, of Group 7.

In the English Setter breed, compared to other breeds, there are very few Dual Champions. The Kennel Club have four champion titles available to be achieved by setters competing in the UK. These are Show Champion (Sh Ch) which is awarded to dogs who have won three Challenge Certificates (CCs) under three different judges with at least one CC won after 12 months of age; Champion (Ch) is the title gained by dogs who have won a Sh Ch title plus a field trial award, Diploma of Merit or a Show Gundog Working Certificate; Field Trial Champion (Ft Ch) means the dog has won a pointer or setter open stake or two first prizes at two different stakes under two different A Panel judges. There must be no less than 16 runners entered; and a Dual Champion – the highest award available to setters – is a dog who has achieved the titles of Show Champion and Field Trial Champion.

An English Setter called &quot;Countess&quot; was the first gun dog to ever attain a Dual Champion title. She was sired by Dash 2nd and her dam was Moll 3rd. Her breeder was Laverack, who sold her to Sam Lang; he in turn passed her on to Llewellin in whose name she was entered in field trials.

In the U.K., the breed has been successful at Crufts and secured the award of Best in Show in 1964, 1977 and 1988. At the Westminster show in America an English Setter won the Best in Show title in 1938. He was only 11 months old and at his first show. This was before entry to the show was restricted to Champions in 1992. As of 2013, he is the only setter to achieve Best in Show at Westminster since the award of Best in Show started to be made in 1907.

==Registrations==
When the American Kennel Club was established in 1878, English Setters, together with eight other sporting breeds, were accepted as the first pure-bred registrations by the club. The very first dog registered with the AKC and the holder of registration number one was an English Setter named &quot;Adonis&quot;. He was born in 1875 and is recorded as sired by &quot;Leicester&quot; out of a bitch named &quot;Dart&quot;. His colours were given as black, white and tan. He was owned by his breeder George E. Delano of New Bedford, MA.

English Setters were especially popular in the UK during the 1960s, 70s and 80s and registrations of puppies reached 1344 during 1974. In 2012, the Kennel Club listed the English Setter amongst the Vulnerable Native Breeds as only 234 puppies were registered. A decade earlier, in 2002, there were 568 English Setter puppies registered. However, during 2012 the number of English Setter puppies registered increased to 314, so the breed was moved to the Kennel Club&#x27;s &quot;At Watch&quot; list, which is for breeds with registrations from 300 to 450. In 2015 registrations fell to 289 resulting in a return to the Vulnerable Native Breeds list for 2016. The breed is still fairly well represented in Italy, where it is popular as a working gun-dog. Even in Italy, however the breed is in sharp decline, going from 20,999 registrations in 2002, to 14510 registrations in 2011. In contrast, the American Kennel Club stated that 2011 was the &quot;year of the setters, with all four making big jumps over the past year&quot;. English Setters had previously ranked at 101 in 2010 but moved up to 87 in 2011, a position the breed maintained in 2012.

<doc id="62893" wikidata="Q38584" url="?curid=62893" title="Dingo">
<text>The dingo (either included in the species Canis familiaris, or considered one of the following independent taxa: Canis familiaris dingo, Canis dingo, or Canis lupus dingo) is an ancient (basal) lineage of dog found in Australia. Its taxonomic classification is debated as indicated by the variety of scientific names presently applied in different publications. It is variously considered a form of domestic dog not warranting recognition as a subspecies, a subspecies of dog or wolf, or a full species in its own right.

The dingo is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo&#x27;s three main coat colourations are light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull is wedge-shaped and appears large in proportion to the body. The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today&#x27;s domestic dogs, and can be traced back through Maritime Southeast Asia to Asia. The oldest remains of dingoes in Australia are around 3,500 years old.

A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;dingo&quot; comes from the Dharug language used by the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney area. 
The first British colonists to arrive in Australia in 1788 established a settlement at Port Jackson and noted &quot;dingoes&quot; living with Indigenous Australians. The name was first recorded in 1789 by Watkin Tench in his &quot;Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay&quot;:

Related Dharug words include &quot;ting-ko&quot; meaning &quot;bitch&quot;, and &quot;tun-go-wo-re-gal&quot; meaning &quot;large dog&quot;. The dingo has different names in different indigenous Australian languages, such as &quot;boolomo&quot;, &quot;dwer-da&quot;, &quot;joogoong&quot;, &quot;kal&quot;, &quot;kurpany&quot;, &quot;maliki&quot;, &quot;mirigung&quot;, &quot;noggum&quot;, &quot;papa-inura&quot;, and &quot;wantibirri&quot;. Some authors propose that a difference existed between camp dingoes and wild dingoes as they had different names among indigenous tribes. The people of the Yarralin, Northern Territory, region frequently call those dingoes that live with them &quot;walaku&quot;, and those that live in the wilderness &quot;ngurakin&quot;. They also use the name &quot;walaku&quot; to refer to both dingoes and dogs. The colonial settlers of New South Wales wrote using the name dingo only for camp dogs. It is proposed that in New South Wales the camp dingoes only became wild after the collapse of Aboriginal society.

==Taxonomy==

Dogs associated with indigenous people were first recorded by Jan Carstenszoon in the Cape York Peninsula area in 1623. In 1699, Captain William Dampier visited the coast of what is now Western Australia and recorded that &quot;my men saw two or three beasts like hungry wolves, lean like so many skeletons, being nothing but skin and bones&quot;. In 1788, the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay under the command of Australia&#x27;s first colonial governor, Arthur Phillip, who took ownership of a dingo and in his journal made a brief description with an illustration of the &quot;Dog of New South Wales&quot;. In 1793, based on Phillip&#x27;s brief description and illustration, the &quot;Dog of New South Wales&quot; was classified by Friedrich Meyer as &quot;Canis dingo&quot;.

In 1999, a study of the maternal lineage through the use of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) as a genetic marker indicates that the dingo and New Guinea singing dog developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf &quot;Canis lupus&quot; its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: &quot;&quot;familiaris&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 [domestic dog]&quot; and &quot;&quot;dingo&quot; Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]&quot;. Wozencraft included &quot;hallstromi&quot;—the New Guinea singing dog—as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. He referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision. The inclusion of &quot;familiaris&quot; and &quot;dingo&quot; under a &quot;domestic dog&quot; clade has been noted by other mammalogists, and their classification under the wolf debated.

In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), which therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.

In 2020, the American Society of Mammalogists considered the dingo a synonym of the domestic dog. However, recent DNA sequencing of a &#x27;pure&#x27; wild dingo from South Australia suggests that the dingo has a different DNA methylation pattern to the German Shepherd. In 2024, a study found that the Dingo and New Guinea singing dog show 5.5% genome introgression from the ancestor of the recently extinct Japanese wolf, with Japanese dogs showing 4% genome introgression. This introgression occurred before the ancestor of the Japanese wolf arrived in Japan.

===Domestic status===
The dingo is regarded as a feral dog because it descended from domesticated ancestors. The dingo&#x27;s relationship with Indigenous Australians is one of commensalism, in which two organisms live in close association, but do not depend on each other for survival. They both hunt and sleep together. The dingo is, therefore, comfortable enough around humans to associate with them, but is still capable of living independently. Any free-ranging, unowned dog can be socialised to become an owned dog, as some dingoes do when they join human families. Although the dingo exists in the wild, it associates with humans, but has not been selectively bred unlike other domesticated animals. Therefore, its status as a domestic animal is not clear. Whether the dingo was a wild or domesticated species was not clarified from Meyer&#x27;s original description, which translated from the German language reads:

It is not known if it is the only dog species in New South Wales, and if it can also still be found in the wild state; however, so far it appears to have lost little of its wild condition; moreover, no divergent varieties have been discovered.

===History===
The earliest known dingo remains, found in Western Australia, date to 3,450 years ago. Based on a comparison of modern dingoes with these early remains, dingo morphology has not changed over these thousands of years. This suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period and that the dingo represents an early form of dog. They have lived, bred, and undergone natural selection in the wild, isolated from other dogs until the arrival of European settlers, resulting in a unique breed.

In 2020, an MDNA study of ancient dog remains from the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins of southern China showed that most of the ancient dogs fell within haplogroup A1b, as do the Australian dingoes and the pre-colonial dogs of the Pacific, but in low frequency in China today. The specimen from the Tianluoshan archaeological site, Zhejiang province dates to 7,000 YBP (years before present) and is basal to the entire haplogroup A1b lineage. The dogs belonging to this haplogroup were once widely distributed in southern China, then dispersed through Southeast Asia into New Guinea and Oceania, but were replaced in China by dogs of other lineages 2,000 YBP.

The oldest reliable date for dog remains found in mainland Southeast Asia is from Vietnam at 4,000 YBP, and in Island Southeast Asia from Timor-Leste at 3,000 YBP. The earliest dingo remains in the Torres Straits date to 2,100 YBP. In New Guinea, the earliest dog remains date to 2,500–2,300 YBP from Caution Bay near Port Moresby, but no ancient New Guinea singing dog remains have been found.

The earliest dingo skeletal remains in Australia are estimated at 3,450 YBP from the Mandura Caves on the Nullarbor Plain, south-eastern Western Australia; 3,320 YBP from Woombah Midden near Woombah, New South Wales; and 3,170 YBP from Fromme&#x27;s Landing on the Murray River near Mannum, South Australia. Dingo bone fragments were found in a rock shelter located at Mount Burr, South Australia, in a layer that was originally dated 7,000–8,500 YBP. Excavations later indicated that the levels had been disturbed, and the dingo remains &quot;probably moved to an earlier level.&quot; The dating of these early Australian dingo fossils led to the widely held belief that dingoes first arrived in Australia 4,000 YBP and then took 500 years to disperse around the continent. However, the timing of these skeletal remains was based on the dating of the sediments in which they were discovered, and not the specimens themselves.

In 2018, the oldest skeletal bones from the Madura Caves were directly carbon dated between 3,348 and 3,081 YBP, providing firm evidence of the earliest dingo and that dingoes arrived later than had previously been proposed. The next-most reliable timing is based on desiccated flesh dated 2,200 YBP from Thylacine Hole, 110 km west of Eucla on the Nullarbor Plain, southeastern Western Australia. When dingoes first arrived, they would have been taken up by Indigenous Australians, who then provided a network for their swift transfer around the continent. Based on the recorded distribution time for dogs across Tasmania and cats across Australia once indigenous Australians had acquired them, the dispersal of dingoes from their point of landing until they occupied continental Australia is proposed to have taken only 70 years. The red fox is estimated to have dispersed across the continent in only 60–80 years.

At the end of the last glacial maximum and the associated rise in sea levels, Tasmania became separated from the Australian mainland 12,000 YBP, and New Guinea 6,500–8,500 YBP by the inundation of the Sahul Shelf. Fossil remains in Australia date to around 3,500 YBP and no dingo remains have been uncovered in Tasmania, so the dingo is estimated to have arrived in Australia at a time between 3,500 and 12,000 YBP. To reach Australia through Island Southeast Asia even at the lowest sea level of the last glacial maximum, a journey of at least over open sea between ancient Sunda and Sahul was necessary, so they must have accompanied humans on boats.

===Phylogeny===

Whole genome sequencing indicates that, while dogs are a genetically divergent subspecies of the grey wolf, the dog is not a descendant of the extant grey wolf. Rather, these are sister taxa which share a common ancestor from a ghost population of wolves that disappeared at the end of the Late Pleistocene. The dog and the dingo are not separate species. The dingo and the Basenji are basal members of the domestic dog clade.

Mitochondrial genome sequences indicate that the dingo falls within the domestic dog clade, and that the New Guinea singing dog is genetically closer to those dingoes that live in southeastern Australia than to those that live in the northwest. The dingo and New Guinea singing dog lineage can be traced back from Island Southeast Asia to Mainland Southeast Asia. Gene flow from the genetically divergent Tibetan wolf forms 2% of the dingo&#x27;s genome, which likely represents ancient admixture in eastern Eurasia.

By the close of the last ice age 11,700 years ago, five ancestral dog lineages had diversified from each other, with one of these being represented today by the New Guinea singing dog. In 2020, the first whole genome sequencing of the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog was undertaken. The study indicates that the ancestral lineage of the dingo/New Guinea singing dog clade arose in southern East Asia, migrated through Island Southeast Asia 9,900 , and reached Australia 8,300 ; however, the human population which brought them remains unknown. The dingo&#x27;s genome indicates that it was once a domestic dog which commenced a process of feralisation since its arrival 8,300 years ago, with the new environment leading to changes in those genomic regions which regulate metabolism, neurodevelopment, and reproduction.

A 2016 genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 8,300 years ago, followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 7,800 years ago. The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named Sahul that existed until 6,500–8,000 years ago. Whole genome analysis of the dingo indicates there are three sub-populations which exist in Northeast (Tropical), Southeast (Alpine), and West/Central Australia (Desert). Morphological data showing the dingo skulls from Southeastern Australia (Alpine dingoes) being quite distinct from the other ecotypes. And genomic and mitochondrial DNA sequencing demonstrating at least 2 dingo mtDNA haplotypes colonised Australia.

In 2020, a genetic study found that the New Guinea Highland wild dogs were genetically basal to the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog, and therefore the potential originator of both.

==Description==
The dingo is a medium-sized canid with a lean, hardy body that is adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The head is the widest part of the body, wedge-shaped, and large in proportion to the body. Captive dingoes are longer and heavier than wild dingoes, as they have access to better food and veterinary care. The average wild dingo male weighs and the female , compared with the captive male and the female . The average wild dingo male length is and the female , compared with the captive male and the female . The average wild dingo male stands at the shoulder height of and the female , compared with the captive male and the female . Dingoes rarely carry excess fat and the wild ones display exposed ribs. Dingoes from northern and northwestern Australia are often larger than those found in central and southern Australia. The dingo is similar to the New Guinea singing dog in morphology apart from the dingo&#x27;s greater height at the withers. The average dingo can reach speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour.

Compared with the dog, the dingo is able to rotate its wrists and can turn doorknobs or raise latches in order to escape confinement. Dingo shoulder joints are unusually flexible, and they can climb fences, cliffs, trees, and rocks. These adaptations help dingoes climbing in difficult terrain, where they prefer high vantage points. A similar adaptation can be found in the Norwegian Lundehund, which was developed on isolated Norwegian islands to hunt in cliff and rocky areas. Wolves do not have this ability.
Compared with the skull of the dog, the dingo possesses a longer muzzle, longer carnassial teeth, longer and more slender canine teeth, larger auditory bullae, a flatter cranium with a larger sagittal crest, and larger nuchal lines. In 2014, a study was conducted on pre-20th century dingo specimens that are unlikely to have been influenced by later hybridisation. The dingo skull was found to differ relative to the domestic dog by its larger palatal width, longer rostrum, shorter skull height, and wider sagittal crest. However, this was rebutted with the figures falling within the wider range of the domestic dog and that each dog breed differs from the others in skull measurements. Based on a comparison with the remains of a dingo found at Fromme&#x27;s Landing, the dingo&#x27;s skull and skeleton have not changed over the past 3,000 years. Compared to the wolf, the dingo possesses a paedomorphic cranium similar to domestic dogs. However, the dingo has a larger brain size compared to dogs of the same body weight, with the dingo being more comparable with the wolf than dogs are. In this respect, the dingo resembles two similar mesopredators, the dhole and the coyote. The eyes are triangular (or almond-shaped) and are hazel to dark in colour with dark rims. The ears are erect and occur high on the skull.

===Coat colour===

The dingo&#x27;s three main coat colours are described as being light ginger (or tan), black and tan, and creamy white. The ginger colour ranges from a deep rust to a pale cream and can be found in 74% of dingoes. Often, small white markings are seen on the tip of the tail, the feet, and the chest, but with no large white patches. Some do not exhibit white tips. The black and tan dingoes possess a black coat with a tan muzzle, chest, belly, legs, and feet and can be found in 12% of dingoes. Solid white can be found in 2% of dingoes and solid black 1%. 

Only three genes affect coat colour in the dingo compared with nine genes in the domestic dog. The ginger colour is dominant and carries the other three main colours – black, tan, and white. White dingoes breed true, and black and tan dingoes breed true; when these cross, the result is a sandy colour. The coat is not oily, nor does it have a dog-like odour. The dingo has a single coat in the tropical north of Australia and a double thick coat in the cold mountains of the south, the undercoat being a wolf-grey colour. Patchy and brindle coat colours can be found in dingoes with no dog ancestry and these colours are less common in dingoes of mixed ancestry.

===Tail===
The dingo&#x27;s tail is flattish, tapering after mid-length and does not curve over the back, but is carried low.

===Gait===
When walking, the dingo&#x27;s rear foot steps in line with the front foot, and these do not possess dewclaws.

===Lifespan===
Dingoes in the wild live 3–5 years with few living past 7–8 years. Some have been recorded living up to 10 years. In captivity, they live for 14–16 years. One dingo has been recorded to live just under 20 years.

==Adaptation==

===Hybrids, distribution and habitat===
The wolf-like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their chromosomes number 78; therefore they can potentially interbreed to produce fertile hybrids. In the Australian wild there exist dingoes, feral dogs, and the crossings of these two, which produce dingo–dog hybrids. Most studies looking at the distribution of dingoes focus on the distribution of dingo-dog hybrids, instead.

Dingoes occurred throughout mainland Australia before European colonisation. They are not found in the fossil record of Tasmania, so they apparently arrived in Australia after Tasmania had separated from the mainland due to rising sea levels. The introduction of agriculture reduced dingo distribution, and by the early 1900s, large barrier fences, including the Dingo Fence, excluded them from the sheep-grazing areas. Land clearance, poisoning, and trapping caused the extinction of the dingo and hybrids from most of their former range in southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Today, they are absent from most of New South Wales, Victoria, the southeastern third of South Australia, and the southwestern tip of Western Australia. They are sparse in the eastern half of Western Australia and the adjoining areas of the Northern Territory and South Australia. They are regarded as common across the remainder of the continent.

The dingo could be considered an ecotype or an ecospecies that has adapted to Australia&#x27;s unique environment. The dingo&#x27;s present distribution covers a variety of habitats, including the temperate regions of eastern Australia, the alpine moorlands of the eastern highlands, the arid hot deserts of Central Australia, and the tropical forests and wetlands of Northern Australia. The occupation of, and adaption to, these habitats may have been assisted by their relationship with indigenous Australians.

===Prey and diet===
A 20-year study of the dingo&#x27;s diet was conducted across Australia by the federal and state governments. These examined a total of 13,000 stomach contents and fecal samples. For the fecal samples, determining the matching tracks of foxes and feral cats was possible without including these samples in the study, but in distinguishing between the tracks left by dingoes and those of dingo hybrids or feral dogs was impossible. The study found that these canines prey on 177 species represented by 72.3% mammals (71 species), 18.8% birds (53 species), 3.3% vegetation (seeds), 1.8% reptiles (23 species), and 3.8% insects, fish, crabs, and frogs (28 species). The relative proportions of prey are much the same across Australia, apart from more birds being eaten in the north and south-east coastal regions, and more lizards in Central Australia. Some 80% of the diet consisted of 10 species: red kangaroo, swamp wallaby, cattle, dusky rat, magpie goose, common brushtail possum, long-haired rat, agile wallaby, European rabbit, and common wombat. Of the mammals eaten, 20% could be regarded as large.

However, the relative proportions of the size of prey mammals varied across regions. In the tropical coast region of northern Australia, agile wallabies, dusky rats, and magpie geese formed 80% of the diet. In Central Australia, the rabbit has become a substitute for native mammals, and during droughts, cattle carcasses provide most of the diet. On the Barkly Tableland, no rabbits occur nor does any native species dominate the diet, except for long-haired rats that form occasional plagues. In the Fortescue River region, the large red kangaroo and common wallaroo dominate the diet, as few smaller mammals are found in this area. On the Nullarbor Plain, rabbits and red kangaroos dominate the diet, and twice as much rabbit is eaten as red kangaroo. In the temperate mountains of eastern Australia, swamp wallaby and red-necked wallaby dominate the diet on the lower slopes and wombat on the higher slopes. Possums are commonly eaten here when found on the ground. In coastal regions, dingoes patrol the beaches for washed-up fish, seals, penguins, and other birds.

Dingoes drink about a litre of water each day in the summer and half a litre in winter. In arid regions during the winter, dingoes may live from the liquid in the bodies of their prey, as long as the number of prey is sufficient. In arid Central Australia, weaned pups draw most of their water from their food. There, regurgitation of water by the females for the pups was observed. During lactation, captive females have no higher need of water than usual, since they consume the urine and feces of the pups, thus recycling the water and keeping the den clean. Tracked dingoes in the Strzelecki Desert regularly visited water-points every 3–5 days, with two dingoes surviving 22 days without water during both winter and summer.

===Hunting behaviour===
Dingoes, dingo hybrids, and feral dogs usually attack from the rear as they pursue their prey. They kill their prey by biting the throat, which damages the trachea and the major blood vessels of the neck. The size of the hunting pack is determined by the type of prey targeted, with large packs formed to help hunt large prey. Large prey can include kangaroos, cattle, water buffalo, and feral horses. Dingoes will assess and target prey based on the prey&#x27;s ability to inflict damage. Large kangaroos are the most commonly killed prey. The main tactic is to sight the kangaroo, bail it up, then kill it. 

Dingoes typically hunt large kangaroos by having lead dingoes chase the quarry toward the paths of their pack mates, which are skilled at cutting corners in chases. The kangaroo becomes exhausted and is then killed. This same tactic is used by wolves, African wild dogs, and hyenas. Another tactic shared with African wild dogs is a relay pursuit until the prey is exhausted. A pack of dingoes is three times as likely to bring down a kangaroo than an individual because the killing is done by those following the lead chaser, which has also become exhausted. 

Two patterns are seen for the final stage of the attack. An adult or juvenile kangaroo is nipped at the hamstrings of the hind legs to slow it before an attack to the throat. A small adult female or juvenile is bitten on the neck or back by dingoes running beside it. In one area of Central Australia, dingoes hunt kangaroos by chasing them into a wire fence, where they become temporarily immobilised. 

The largest male red kangaroos tend to ignore dingoes, even when the dingoes are hunting the younger males and females. A large eastern grey kangaroo successfully fought off an attack by a single dingo that lasted over an hour. Wallabies are hunted in a similar manner to kangaroos, the difference being that a single dingo hunts using scent rather than sight and the hunt may last several hours.

Dingo packs may attack young cattle and buffalo, but never healthy, grown adults. They focus on the sick or injured young. The tactics include harassing a mother with young, panicking a herd to separate the adults from the young, or watching a herd and looking for any unusual behaviour that might then be exploited. 

One 1992 study in the Fortescue River region observed that cattle defend their calves by circling around the calves or aggressively charging dingoes. In one study of 26 approaches, 24 were by more than one dingo and only four resulted in calves being killed. 

Dingoes often revisited carcasses. They did not touch fresh cattle carcasses until these were largely skin and bone, and even when these were plentiful, they still preferred to hunt kangaroos. 

Of 68 chases of sheep, 26 sheep were seriously injured, but only eight were killed. The dingoes could outrun the sheep and the sheep were defenceless. However, the dingoes in general appeared not to be motivated to kill sheep, and in many cases just loped alongside the sheep before veering off to chase another sheep. For those that did kill and consume sheep, a large quantity of kangaroo was still in their diet, indicating once again a preference for kangaroo. 
Lone dingoes can run down a rabbit, but are more successful by targeting kits near rabbit warrens. Dingoes take nestling birds, in addition to birds that are moulting and therefore cannot fly. Predators often use highly intelligent hunting techniques. Dingoes on Fraser Island have been observed using waves to entrap, tire, and help drown an adult swamp wallaby and an echidna. In the coastal wetlands of northern Australia, dingoes depend on magpie geese for a large part of their diet and a lone dingo sometimes distracts these while a white-breasted sea eagle makes a kill that is too heavy for it to carry off, with the dingo then driving the sea eagle away. They also scavenge on prey dropped from the nesting platforms of sea eagles. Lone dingoes may hunt small rodents and grasshoppers in grass by using their senses of smell and hearing, then pouncing on them with their forepaws.

===Competitors===
Dingoes and their hybrids co-exist with the native quoll. They also co-occur in the same territory as the introduced European red fox and feral cat, but little is known about the relationships between these three. Dingoes and their hybrids can drive off foxes from sources of water and occasionally eat feral cats. Dingoes can be killed by feral water buffalo and cattle goring and kicking them, from snake bite, and predation on their pups (and occasionally adults) by wedge-tailed eagles.

==Communication==
Like all domestic dogs, dingoes tend towards phonetic communication. However, in contrast to domestic dogs, dingoes howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight sound classes with 19 sound types have been identified.

===Barking===
Compared to most domestic dogs, the bark of a dingo is short and monosyllabic, and is rarely used. Barking was observed to make up only 5% of vocalisations. Dog barking has always been distinct from wolf barking. Australian dingoes bark mainly in swooshing noises or in a mixture of atonal and tonal sounds. In addition, barking is almost exclusively used for giving warnings. Warn-barking in a homotypical sequence and a kind of &quot;warn-howling&quot; in a heterotypical sequence have also been observed. The bark-howling starts with several barks and then fades into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably (similar to coughing) used to warn the puppies and members of the pack. Additionally, dingoes emit a sort of &quot;wailing&quot; sound, which they mostly use when approaching a watering hole, probably to warn already present dingoes.

According to the present state of knowledge, getting Australian dingoes to bark more frequently by putting them in contact with other domestic dogs is not possible. However, German zoologist Alfred Brehm reported a dingo that learned the more &quot;typical&quot; form of barking and how to use it, while its brother did not. Whether dingoes bark or bark-howl less frequently in general is not certain.

===Howling===
Dingoes have three basic forms of howling (moans, bark-howls, and snuffs) with at least 10 variations. Usually, three kinds of howls are distinguished: long and persistent, rising and ebbing, and short and abrupt.

Observations have shown that each kind of howling has several variations, though their purpose is unknown. The frequency of howling varies with the season and time of day, and is also influenced by breeding, migration, lactation, social stability, and dispersal behaviour. Howling can be more frequent in times of food shortage, because the dogs become more widely distributed within their home range.

Additionally, howling seems to have a group function, and is sometimes an expression of joy (for example, greeting-howls). Overall, howling was observed less frequently in dingoes than among grey wolves. It may happen that one dog will begin to howl, and several or all other dogs will howl back and bark from time to time. In the wilderness, dingoes howl over long distances to attract other members of the pack, to find other dogs, or to keep intruders at bay. Dingoes howl in chorus with significant pitches, and with increasing number of pack members, the variability of pitches also increases. Therefore, dingoes are suspected to be able to measure the size of a pack without visual contact. Moreover, their highly variable chorus howls have been proposed to generate a confounding effect in the receivers by making pack size appear larger.

=== Other forms ===
Growling, making up about 65% of the vocalisations, is used in an context for dominance, and as a defensive sound. Similar to many domestic dogs, a reactive usage of defensive growling is only rarely observed. Growling very often occurs in combination with other sounds, and has been observed almost exclusively in swooshing noises (similar to barking).

During observations in Germany, dingoes were heard to produce a sound that observers have called &quot;Schrappen&quot;. It was only observed in an agonistic context, mostly as a defence against obtrusive pups or for defending resources. It was described as a bite intention, during which the receiver is never touched or hurt. Only a clashing of the teeth could be heard.

Aside from vocal communication, dingoes communicate, like all domestic dogs, via scent marking specific objects (for example, &quot;Spinifex&quot;) or places (such as waters, trails, and hunting grounds) using chemical signals from their urine, feces, and scent glands. Males scent mark more frequently than females, especially during the mating season. They also scent rub, whereby a dog rolls its neck, shoulders, or back on something that is usually associated with food or the scent markings of other dogs.

Unlike wolves, dingoes can react to social cues and gestures from humans.

==Behaviour==
Dingoes tend to be nocturnal in warmer regions, but less so in cooler areas. Their main period of activity is around dusk and dawn, making them a crepuscular species in the colder climates. The periods of activity are short (often less than 1 hour) with short times of resting. Dingoes have two kinds of movement: a searching movement (apparently associated with hunting) and an exploratory movement (probably for contact and communication with other dogs). According to studies in Queensland, the wild dogs (dingo hybrids) there move freely at night through urban areas and cross streets and seem to get along quite well.

===Social behaviour===
The dingo&#x27;s social behaviour is about as flexible as that of a coyote or grey wolf, which is perhaps one of the reasons the dingo was originally believed to have descended from the Indian wolf. While young males are often solitary and nomadic in nature, breeding adults often form a settled pack. However, in areas of the dingo&#x27;s habitat with a widely spaced population, breeding pairs remain together, apart from others. Dingo distributions are a single dingo, 73%; two dingoes, 16%; three dingoes, 5%; four dingoes, 3%; and packs of five to seven dingoes, 3%. A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.

Where conditions are favourable among dingo packs, the pack is stable with a distinct territory and little overlap between neighbours. The size of packs often appears to correspond to the size of prey available in the pack&#x27;s territory. Desert areas have smaller groups of dingoes with a more loose territorial behaviour and sharing of the water sites. The average monthly pack size was noted to be between three and 12 members.

Similar to other canids, a dingo pack largely consists of a mated pair, their current year&#x27;s offspring, and occasionally a previous year&#x27;s offspring. Dominance hierarchies exist both between and within males and females, with males usually being more dominant than females. However, a few exceptions have been noted in captive packs. During travel, while eating prey, or when approaching a water source for the first time, the breeding male will be seen as the leader, or alpha. Subordinate dingoes approach a more dominant dog in a slightly crouched posture, ears flat, and tail down, to ensure peace in the pack. Establishment of artificial packs in captive dingoes has failed.

===Reproduction===
Dingoes breed once annually, depending on the estrous cycle of the females, which according to most sources, only come in heat once per year. Dingo females can come in heat twice per year, but can only be pregnant once a year, with the second time only seeming to be pregnant.

Males are virile throughout the year in most regions, but have a lower sperm production during the summer in most cases. During studies on dingoes from the Eastern Highlands and Central Australia in captivity, no specific breeding cycle could be observed. All were potent throughout the year. The breeding was only regulated by the heat of the females. A rise in testosterone was observed in the males during the breeding season, but this was attributed to the heat of the females and copulation. In contrast to the captive dingoes, captured dingo males from Central Australia did show evidence of a male breeding cycle. Those dingoes showed no interest in females in heat (this time other domestic dogs) outside the mating season (January to July) and did not breed with them.

The mating season usually occurs in Australia between March and May (according to other sources between April and June). During this time, dingoes may actively defend their territories using vocalisations, dominance behaviour, growling, and barking.

Most females in the wild start breeding at the age of 2 years. Within packs, the alpha female tends to go into heat before subordinates and actively suppresses mating attempts by other females. Males become sexually mature between the ages of 1 and 3 years. The precise start of breeding varies depending on age, social status, geographic range, and seasonal conditions. Among dingoes in captivity, the pre-estrus was observed to last 10–12 days. However, the pre-estrus may last as long as 60 days in the wild.
In general, the only dingoes in a pack that successfully breed are the alpha pair, and the other pack members help with raising the pups. Subordinates are actively prevented from breeding by the alpha pair and some subordinate females have a false pregnancy. Low-ranking or solitary dingoes can successfully breed if the pack structure breaks up.

The gestation period lasts for 61–69 days and the size of the litter can range from 1 to 10 (usually 5) pups, with the number of males born tending to be higher than that of females. Pups of subordinate females usually get killed by the alpha female, which causes the population increase to be low even in good times. This behaviour possibly developed as an adaptation to the fluctuating environmental conditions in Australia. Pups are usually born between May and August (the winter period), but in tropical regions, breeding can occur at any time of the year.

At the age of 3 weeks, the pups leave the den for the first time, and leave it completely at 8 weeks. Dens are mostly underground. Reports exist of dens in abandoned rabbit burrows, rock formations, under boulders in dry creeks, under large spinifex, in hollow logs, and augmented burrows of monitor lizards and wombat burrows. The pups usually stray around the den within a radius of , and are accompanied by older dogs during longer travels. The transition to consuming solid food is normally accomplished by all members of the pack during the age of 9 to 12 weeks. Apart from their own experiences, pups also learn through observation. Young dingoes usually become independent at the age of 3–6 months or they disperse at the age of 10 months, when the next mating season starts.

===Migration===
Dingoes usually remain in one area and do not undergo seasonal migrations. However, during times of famine, even in normally &quot;safe&quot; areas, dingoes travel into pastoral areas, where intensive, human-induced control measures are undertaken. In Western Australia in the 1970s, young dogs were found to travel for long distances when necessary. About 10% of the dogs captured—all younger than 12 months—were later recaptured far away from their first location. Among these, the average travelled distance for males was and for females . Therefore, travelling dingoes had lower chances of survival in foreign territories, and they are apparently unlikely to survive long migrations through occupied territories. The rarity of long migration routes seemed to confirm this. During investigations in the Nullarbor Plain, even longer migration routes were recorded. The longest recorded migration route of a radio-collared dingo was about .

===Attacks on humans===
Dingoes generally avoid conflict with humans, but they are large enough to be dangerous. Most attacks involve people feeding wild dingoes, particularly on K&#x27;gari (formerly Fraser Island), which is a special centre of dingo-related tourism. The vast majority of dingo attacks are minor in nature, but some can be major, and a few have been fatal: the death of two-month-old Azaria Chamberlain in the Northern Territory in 1980 is one of them. Many Australian national parks have signs advising visitors not to feed wildlife, partly because this practice is not healthy for the animals, and partly because it may encourage undesirable behaviour, such as snatching or biting by dingoes, kangaroos, goannas, and some birds.

==Impact==
=== Ecological ===
====Extinction of thylacines====

Some researchers propose that the dingo caused the extirpation of the thylacine, the Tasmanian devil, and the Tasmanian native hen from mainland Australia because of the correlation in space and time with the dingo&#x27;s arrival. Recent studies have questioned this proposal, suggesting that climate change and increasing human populations may have been the cause. Dingoes do not seem to have had the same ecological impact that invasive red foxes have in modern times. This might be connected to the dingo&#x27;s way of hunting and the size of their favoured prey, as well as to the low number of dingoes in the time before European colonisation.

In 2017, a genetic study found that the population of the northwestern dingoes had commenced expanding since 4,000—6,000 years ago. This was proposed to be due either to their first arrival in Australia or to the commencement of the extinction of the thylacine, with the dingo expanding into the thylacine&#x27;s former range.

==== Interactions with humans ====

The first British colonists who settled at Port Jackson, in 1788, recorded the dingo living with indigenous Australians, and later at Melville Island, in 1818. Furthermore, they were noted at the lower Darling and Murray rivers in 1862, indicating that the dingo was possibly semi-domesticated (or at least utilised in a &quot;symbiotic&quot; manner) by aboriginal Australians. When livestock farming began expanding across Australia, in the early 19th century, dingoes began preying on sheep and cattle. Numerous population-control measures have been implemented since then, including a nation-wide fencing project, with only limited success.

Dingoes can be tame when they come in frequent contact with humans. Furthermore, some dingoes live with humans. Many indigenous Australians and early European settlers lived alongside dingoes. Indigenous Australians would take dingo pups from the den and tame them until sexual maturity and the dogs would leave. 

According to David Jenkins, a research fellow at Charles Sturt University, the breeding and reintroduction of pure dingoes is no easy option and, as of 2007, there were no studies that seriously dealt with this topic, especially in areas where dingo populations are already present.

====Interactions with other animals====

Much of the present place of wild dogs in the Australian ecosystem, especially in the urban areas, remains unknown. Although the ecological role of dingoes in Northern and Central Australia is well understood, the same does not apply to the role of wild dogs in the east of the continent. In contrast to some claims, dingoes are assumed to have a positive impact on biodiversity in areas where feral foxes are present.

Dingoes are regarded as apex predators and possibly perform an ecological key function. Likely (with increasing evidence from scientific research), they control the diversity of the ecosystem by limiting the number of prey and keeping the competition in check. Wild dogs hunt feral livestock such as goats and pigs, as well as native prey and introduced animals. The low number of feral goats in Northern Australia is possibly caused by the presence of the dingoes, but whether they control the goats&#x27; numbers is still disputable. Studies from 1995 in the northern wet forests of Australia found the dingoes there did not reduce the number of feral pigs, but their predation only affects the pig population together with the presence of water buffaloes (which hinder the pigs&#x27; access to food).

Observations concerning the mutual impact of dingoes and red fox and cat populations suggest dingoes limit the access of foxes and cats to certain resources. As a result, a disappearance of the dingoes may cause an increase of red fox and feral cat numbers, and therefore, a higher pressure on native animals. These studies found the presence of dingoes is one of the factors that keep fox numbers in an area low, and therefore reduces pressure on native animals, which then do not disappear from the area. The countrywide numbers of red foxes are especially high where dingo numbers are low, but other factors might be responsible for this, depending on the area. Evidence was found for a competition between wild dogs and red foxes in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, since many overlaps occurred in the spectrum of preferred prey, but only evidence for local competition, not on a grand scale, was found.

Also, dingoes can live with red foxes and feral cats without reducing their numbers in areas with sufficient food resources (for example, high rabbit numbers) and hiding places. Nearly nothing is known about the relationship of wild dogs and feral cats, except both mostly live in the same areas. Although wild dogs also eat cats, whether this affects the cat populations is not known.

Additionally, the disappearance of dingoes might increase the prevalence of kangaroo, rabbit, and Australian brushturkey numbers. In the areas outside the Dingo Fence, the number of emus is lower than in the areas inside. However, the numbers changed depending on the habitat. Since the environment is the same on both sides of the fence, the dingo was assumed to be a strong factor for the regulation of these species. Therefore, some people demand that dingo numbers should be allowed to increase or dingoes should be reintroduced in areas with low dingo populations to lower the pressure on endangered populations of native species and to reintroduce them in certain areas. In addition, the presence of the Australian brushturkey in Queensland increased significantly after dingo baiting was conducted.

The dingo&#x27;s habitat covers most of Australia, but they are absent in the southeast and Tasmania, and an area in the southwest (see map). As Australia&#x27;s largest extant terrestrial predators, dingoes prey on mammals up to the size of the large red kangaroo, in addition to the grey kangaroo, wombat, wallaby, quoll, possum and most other marsupials; they frequently pursue birds, lizards, fish, crabs, crayfish, eels, snakes, frogs, young crocodiles, larger insects, snails, carrion, human refuse, and sometimes fallen fruits or seeds.

Dingoes can also be of potential benefit to their environment, as they will hunt Australia&#x27;s many introduced and invasive species. This includes human-introduced animals such as deer and their offspring (sambar, chital, and red deer) and water buffalo, in addition to the highly invasive rabbits, red foxes, feral and domestic cats, some feral dogs, sheep, and calves. Rarely, a pack of dingoes will pursue the larger and more dangerous dromedary camel, feral donkey, or feral horse; unattended young animals, or sick, weak, or elderly individuals are at greatest risk.

=== Cultural ===

Cultural opinions about the dingo are often based on its perceived &quot;cunning&quot;, and the idea that it is an intermediate between civilisation and wildness.

Some of the early European settlers looked on dingoes as domestic dogs, while others thought they were more like wolves. Over the years, dingoes began to attack sheep, and their relationship to the Europeans changed very quickly; they were regarded as devious and cowardly, since they did not fight bravely in the eyes of the Europeans, and vanished into the bush. Additionally, they were seen as promiscuous or as devils with a venomous bite or saliva, so they could be killed unreservedly. Over the years, dingo trappers gained some prestige for their work, especially when they managed to kill hard-to-catch dingoes. Dingoes were associated with thieves, vagabonds, bushrangers, and parliamentary opponents. From the 1960s, politicians began calling their opponents &quot;dingo&quot;, meaning they were cowardly and treacherous, and it has become a popular form of attack since then. Today, the word &quot;dingo&quot; still stands for &quot;coward&quot; and &quot;cheat&quot;, with verb and adjective forms used, as well.

The image of the dingo has ranged among some groups from the instructive to the demonic.

Ceremonies (like a keen at the Cape York Peninsula in the form of howling) and dreamtime stories are connected to the dingo, which were passed down through the generations.

The dingo plays a prominent role in the Dreamtime stories of indigenous Australians, but it is rarely depicted in their cave paintings when compared with the extinct thylacine. One of the tribal elders of the people of the Yarralin, Northern Territory region tells that the Dreamtime dingo is the ancestor of both dingoes and humans. The dingoes &quot;are what we would be if we were not what we are.&quot;

Similar to how Europeans acquired dingoes, the Aboriginal people of Australia acquired dogs from the immigrants very quickly. This process was so fast that Francis Barrallier (surveyor on early expeditions around the colony at Port Jackson) discovered in 1802 that five dogs of European origin were there before him. One theory holds that other domestic dogs adopt the role of the &quot;pure&quot; dingo. Introduced animals, such as the water buffalo and the domestic cat, have been adopted into the indigenous Aboriginal culture in the forms of rituals, traditional paintings, and dreamtime stories.

Most of the published myths originate from the Western Desert and show a remarkable complexity. In some stories, dingoes are the central characters, while in others, they are only minor ones. One time, an ancestor from the Dreamtime created humans and dingoes or gave them their current shape. Stories mention creation, socially acceptable behaviour, and explanations why some things are the way they are. Myths exist about shapeshifters (human to dingo or vice versa), &quot;dingo-people&quot;, and the creation of certain landscapes or elements of those landscapes, like waterholes or mountains.

=== Economic ===
Livestock farming expanded across Australia from the early 1800s, which led to conflict between the dingo and graziers. Sheep, and to a lesser extent cattle, are an easy target for dingoes. The pastoralists and the government bodies that support this industry have shot, trapped, and poisoned dingoes or destroyed dingo pups in their dens. After two centuries of persecution, the dingo or dingo–dog hybrids can still be found across most of the continent.

Research on the real extent of the damage and the reason for this problem only started recently. Livestock can die from many causes, and when the carcass is found, determining with certainty the cause of death is often difficult. Since the outcome of an attack on livestock depends to a high degree on the behaviour and experience of the predator and the prey, only direct observation is certain to determine whether an attack was by dingoes or other domestic dogs. Even the existence of remnants of the prey in the scat of wild dogs does not prove they are pests, since wild dogs also eat carrion.

The cattle industry can tolerate low to moderate, and sometimes high, numbers of wild dogs (therefore dingoes are not so easily regarded as pests in these areas). In the case of sheep and goats, a zero-tolerance attitude is common. The biggest threats are dogs that live inside or near the paddock areas. The extent of sheep loss is hard to determine due to the wide pasture lands in some parts of Australia.

In 2006, cattle losses in the Northern Territory rangeland grazing areas were estimated to be up to 30%.

Therefore, factors such as availability of native prey, as well as the defending behaviour and health of the cattle, play an important role in the number of losses. A study in Central Australia in 2003 confirmed that dingoes only have a low impact on cattle numbers when a sufficient supply of other prey (such as kangaroos and rabbits) is available. In some parts of Australia, the loss of calves is assumed to be minimised if horned cattle are used instead of polled. The precise economic impact is not known, and the rescue of some calves is unlikely to compensate for the necessary costs of control measures. Calves usually suffer less lethal wounds than sheep due to their size and the protection by adult cattle, so they have a higher chance of surviving an attack. As a result, the evidence of a dog attack may only be discovered after the cattle have been herded back into the enclosure, and signs such as bitten ears, tails, and other wounds are discovered.

The opinions of cattle owners regarding dingoes are more variable than those of sheep owners. Some cattle owners believe that the weakened mother losing her calf is better in times of drought so that she does not have to care for her calf, too. Therefore, these owners are more hesitant to kill dingoes. The cattle industry may benefit from the predation of dingoes on rabbits, kangaroos, and rats. Furthermore, the mortality rate of calves has many possible causes, and discriminating between them is difficult. The only reliable method to assess the damage would be to document all pregnant cows, then observe their development and those of their calves. The loss of calves in observed areas where dingoes were controlled was higher than in other areas. Loss of livestock is, therefore, not necessarily caused by the occurrence of dingoes and is independent from wild dogs. One researcher has stated that for cattle stations where dingoes were controlled, kangaroos were abundant, and this affects the availability of grass.

Domestic dogs are the only terrestrial predators in Australia that are big enough to kill fully grown sheep, and only a few sheep manage to recover from the severe injuries. In the case of lambs, death can have many causes apart from attacks by predators, which are blamed for the deaths because they eat from the carcasses. Although attacks by red foxes are possible, such attacks are more rare than previously thought. The fact that the sheep and goat industry is much more susceptible to damage caused by wild dogs than the cattle industry is mostly due to two factors – the flight behaviour of the sheep and their tendency to flock together in the face of danger, and the hunting methods of wild dogs, along with their efficient way of handling goats and sheep.

Therefore, the damage to the livestock industry does not correlate to the numbers of wild dogs in an area (except that no damage occurs where no wild dogs occur).

According to a report from the government of Queensland, wild dogs cost the state about $30 million annually due to livestock losses, the spread of diseases, and control measures. Losses for the livestock industry alone were estimated to be as high as $18 million. In Barcaldine, Queensland, up to one-fifth of all sheep are killed by dingoes annually, a situation which has been described as an &quot;epidemic&quot;. According to a survey among cattle owners in 1995, performed by the Park and Wildlife Service, owners estimated their annual losses due to wild dogs (depending on the district) to be from 1.6% to 7.1%.

In 2018, a study in northern South Australia indicates that fetal/calf loss averages 18.6%, with no significant reduction due to dingo baiting. The calf losses did not correlate with increased dingo activity, and the cattle diseases pestivirus and leptospirosis were a major cause. Dingoes then scavenged on the carcasses. There was also evidence of dingo predation on calves.

Among the indigenous Australians, dingoes were also used as hunting aids, living hot water bottles, and camp dogs. Their scalps were used as a kind of currency, their teeth were traditionally used for decorative purposes, and their fur for traditional costumes.

Sometimes &quot;pure&quot; dingoes are important for tourism, when they are used to attract visitors. However, this seems to be common only on Fraser Island, where the dingoes are extensively used as a symbol to enhance the attraction of the island. Tourists are drawn to the experience of personally interacting with dingoes. Pictures of dingoes appear on brochures, many websites, and postcards advertising the island.

==Legal status==

The dingo is recognised as a native animal under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions. Australia has over 500 national parks of which all but six are managed by the states and territories. , the legal status of the dingo varies between these jurisdictions and in some instances it varies between different regions of a single jurisdiction. some of these jurisdictions classify dingoes as an invasive native.
* Australian government: Section 528 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 defines a native species as one that was present in Australia before the year 1400. The dingo is protected in all Australian government managed national parks and reserves, World Heritage Areas, and other protected areas.
* Australian Capital Territory: The dingo is listed as a &quot;pest animal&quot; outside national parks and reserves in the Pest Plants and Animals (Pest Animals) Declaration 2016 (No 1) made under the Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005, which calls for a management plan for pest animals. The Nature Conservation Act 2014 protects native animals in national parks and reserves but excludes this protection to &quot;pest animals&quot; declared under the Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005.
* New South Wales: The dingo falls under the definition of &quot;wildlife&quot; under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 however it also becomes &quot;unprotected fauna&quot; under Schedule 11 of the act. The Wild Dog Destruction Act (1921) applies only to the western division of the state and includes the dingo in its definition of &quot;wild dogs&quot;. The act requires landowners to destroy any wild dogs on their property and any person owning a dingo or half-bred dingo without a permit faces a fine. In other parts of the state, dingoes can be kept as pets under the Companion Animals Act 1998 as a dingo is defined under this act as a &quot;dog&quot;. The dingo has been proposed for listing under the Threatened Species Conservation Act because it is argued that these dogs had established populations before the arrival of Europeans, but no decision has been made.
* Northern Territory: The dingo is a &quot;vertebrate that is indigenous to Australia&quot; and therefore &quot;protected wildlife&quot; under the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2014. A permit is required for all matters dealing with protected wildlife.
* Queensland: The dingo is listed as &quot;least concern wildlife&quot; in the Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 2006 under the Nature Conservation Act 1992, therefore the dingo is protected in National Parks and conservation areas. The dingo is listed as a &quot;pest&quot; in the Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Regulation 2003 under the Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002, which requires land owners to take reasonable steps to keep their lands free of pests.
* South Australia: The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 defines a protected animal as one that is indigenous to Australia but then lists the dingo as an &quot;unprotected species&quot; under Schedule 11. The purpose of the Dog Fence Act 1946 is to prevent wild dogs entering into the pastoral and agricultural areas south of the dog-proof fence. The dingo is listed as a &quot;wild dog&quot; under this act, and landowners are required to maintain the fence and destroy any wild dog within the vicinity of the fence by shooting, trapping or baiting. The dingo is listed as an &quot;unprotected species&quot; in the Natural Resources Management Act 2004, which allows landowners to lay baits &quot;to control animals&quot; on their land just north of the dog fence.
* Tasmania: Tasmania does not have a native dingo population. The dingo is listed as a &quot;restricted animal&quot; in the Nature Conservation Act 2002 and cannot be imported without a permit. Once imported into Tasmania, a dingo is listed as a dog under the Dog Control Act 2000. 
* Victoria: The dingo is a &quot;vertebrate taxon&quot; that is &quot;indigenous&quot; to Australia and therefore &quot;wildlife&quot; under the Wildlife Act 1975, which protects wildlife. The act mandates that a permit is required to keep a dingo, and that this dingo must not be cross-bred with a dog. The act allows an order to be made to unprotect dingoes in certain areas of the state. The Order in Council made on the 28 September 2010 includes the far north-west of the state and all of the state north-east of Melbourne. It was made to protect stock on private land. The order allows dingoes to be trapped, shot or baited by any person on private land in these regions, while protecting the dingo on state-owned land.
* Western Australia: Dingoes are considered as &quot;unprotected&quot; native fauna under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act. The dingo is recorded as a &quot;declared pest&quot; on the Western Australian Organism List. This list records those species that have been declared as pests under the Biosecurity and Agriculture Management Act 2007, and these are regarded as pests across all of Western Australia. Landowners must take the prescribed measures to deal with declared pests on their land. The policy of the WA government is to promote eradication of dingoes in the livestock grazing areas but leave them undisturbed in the rest of the state.

==Control measures==

Dingo attacks on livestock led to widescale efforts to repel them from areas with intensive agricultural usage, and all states and territories have enacted laws for the control of dingoes. In the early 20th century, fences were erected to keep dingoes away from areas frequented by sheep, and a tendency to routinely eradicate dingoes developed among some livestock owners. Established methods for the control of dingoes in sheep areas entailed the employment of specific workers on every property. The job of these people (who were nicknamed &quot;doggers&quot;) was to reduce the number of dingoes by using steel traps, baits, firearms and other methods. The responsibility for the control of wild dogs lay solely in the hands of the landowners. At the same time, the government was forced to control the number of dingoes. As a result, a number of measures for the control of dingoes developed over time. It was also considered that dingoes travel over long distances to reach areas with richer prey populations, and the control methods were often concentrated along &quot;paths&quot; or &quot;trails&quot; and in areas that were far away from sheep areas. All dingoes were regarded as a potential danger and were hunted.

Apart from the introduction of the poison 1080 (extensively used for 40 years and nicknamed &quot;doggone&quot;), the methods and strategies for controlling wild dogs have changed little over time. Information concerning cultural importance to indigenous people and the importance of dingoes and the impact of control measures on other species is also lacking in some areas. Historically, the attitudes and needs of indigenous people were not taken into account when dingoes were controlled. Other factors that might be taken into account are the genetic status (degree of interbreeding) of dingoes in these areas, ownership and land usage, as well as a reduction of killing measures to areas outside the zones. However, most control measures and the appropriate studies are there to minimise the loss of livestock and not to protect dingoes.

Increasing pressure from environmentalists against the random killing of dingoes, as well as the impact on other animals, demanded that more information needed to be gathered to prove the necessity of control measures and to disprove the claim of unnecessary killings. Today, permanent population control is regarded as necessary to reduce the impact of all wild dogs and to ensure the survival of the &quot;pure&quot; dingo in the wild.

===Guardian animals===
To protect livestock, livestock guardian dogs (for example, Maremmas), donkeys, alpacas and llamas are used.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilddogs/dingo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dingo Fence===

In the 1920s, the Dingo Fence was erected on the basis of the &quot;Wild Dog Act (1921)&quot; and, until 1931, thousands of miles of Dingo Fences had been erected in several areas of South Australia. In the year 1946, these efforts were directed to a single goal, and the Dingo Fence was finally completed. The fence connected with other fences in New South Wales and Queensland. The main responsibilities in maintaining the Dingo Fence still lies with the landowners whose properties border on the fence and who receive financial support from the government.

===Reward system===
A reward system (local, as well from the government) was active from 1846 to the end of the 20th century, but there is no evidence that – despite the billions of dollars spent – it was ever an efficient control method. Therefore, its importance declined over time.

Dingo scalping commenced in 1912 with the passage of the Wild Dogs Act by the government of South Australia. In an attempt to reduce depredation on livestock, that government offered a bounty for dingo skins, and this program was later repeated in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. One writer argues that this new legislation and economic driver had significant impacts on Aboriginal society in the region. This act was followed by updates and amendments, including 1931, 1938, and 1948.

===Poisoning===
Baits with the poison 1080 are regarded as the fastest and safest method for dog control, since they are extremely susceptible. Even small amounts of poison per dog are sufficient (0.3 mg per kg). The application of aerial baiting is regulated in the Commonwealth by the &quot;Civil Aviation Regulations (1988)&quot;. The assumption that the tiger quoll might be damaged by the poison led to the dwindling of areas where aerial baiting could be performed. In areas where aerial baiting is no longer possible, it is necessary to put down baits.

From 2004, cyanide-ejectors and protection collars (filled with 1080 on certain spots) have been tested.

In 2016, controversy surrounded a plan to inject a population of dingoes on Pelorus Island, off the coast of northern Queensland, Australia, with pills that would release a fatal dose of 1080 poison two years after the dingoes were to be intentionally released to help eradicate goats. The dingoes were dubbed &#x27;death-row dingoes&#x27;, and the plan was blocked due to concerns for a locally threatened shorebird.

===Neutering===
Owners of dingoes and other domestic dogs are sometimes asked to neuter their pets and keep them under observation to reduce the number of stray/feral dogs and prevent interbreeding with dingoes.

===Efficiency of measures===
The efficiency of control measures was questioned in the past and is often questioned today, as well as whether they stand in a good cost-benefit ratio. The premium system proved to be susceptible to deception and to be useless on a large scale, and can therefore only be used for getting rid of &quot;problem-dogs&quot;. Animal traps are considered inhumane and inefficient on a large scale, due to the limited efficacy of baits. Based on studies, it is assumed that only young dogs that would have died anyway can be captured. Furthermore, wild dogs are capable of learning and sometimes are able to detect and avoid traps quite efficiently. In one case, a dingo bitch followed a dogger and triggered his traps one after another by carefully pushing her paw through the sand that covered the trap.

Poisonous baits can be very effective when they are of good meat quality; however, they do not last long and are occasionally taken by red foxes, quolls, ants and birds. Aerial baiting can nearly eliminate whole dingo populations. Livestock guardian dogs can effectively minimise livestock losses, but are less effective on wide open areas with widely distributed livestock. Furthermore, they can be a danger to the livestock or be killed by control measures themselves when they are not sufficiently supervised by their owners. Fences are reliable in keeping wild dogs from entering certain areas, but they are expensive to build, need permanent maintenance, and only cause the problem to be relocated.

Control measures mostly result in smaller packs and a disruption of pack structure. The measures seem to be rather detrimental to the livestock industry because the empty territories are taken over by young dogs and the predation then increases. Nonetheless, it is regarded as unlikely that the control measures could completely eradicate the dingo in Central Australia, and the elimination of all wild dogs is not considered a realistic option.

It has been shown that culling a small percentage of immature dingoes on Fraser Island had little significant negative impact on the overall island population, though this is being disputed.

==Conservation of purebreds==
Until 2004, the dingo was categorised as of &quot;least concern&quot; on the Red List of Threatened Species. In 2008, it was recategorised as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, following the decline in numbers to around 30% of &quot;pure&quot; dingoes, due to crossbreeding with domestic dogs. In 2018, the IUCN regarded the dingo as a feral dog and discarded it from the Red List.

Dingoes are reasonably abundant in large parts of Australia, but there is some argument that they are endangered due to interbreeding with other dogs in many parts of their range. Dingoes receive varying levels of protection in conservation areas such as national parks and natural reserves in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Victoria, Arnhem Land and other Aboriginal lands, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the whole of the Australian Capital Territory. In some states, dingoes are regarded as declared pests and landowners are allowed to control the local populations. Throughout Australia, all other wild dogs are considered pests.

Fraser Island is a 1,840 square kilometre World Heritage Site located off Australia&#x27;s eastern coast. The island is home to a genetically distinct population of dingoes that are free of dog introgression, estimated to number 120. These dingoes are unique because they are closely related to the southeastern dingoes but share a number of genes with the New Guinea singing dog and show some evidence of admixture with the northwestern dingoes. Because of their conservation value, in February 2013, a report on Fraser Island dingo management strategies was released, with options including ending the intimidation of dingoes, tagging practice changes and regular veterinarian checkups, as well as a permanent dingo sanctuary on the island. According to DNA examinations from 2004, the dingoes of Fraser Island are &quot;pure&quot;, as opposed to dingo—dog hybrids. However, skull measurements from the mid-1990s had a different result. A 2013 study showed that dingoes living in the Tanami Desert are among the &quot;purest&quot; in Australia.

Groups that have devoted themselves to the conservation of the &quot;pure&quot; dingo by using breeding programs include the &quot;Australian Native Dog Conservation Society&quot; and the &quot;Australian Dingo Conservation Association&quot;. Presently, the efforts of the dingo conservation groups are considered to be ineffective because most of their dogs are untested or are known to be hybrids.

Dingo conservation efforts focus primarily on preventing interbreeding between dingoes and other domestic dogs in order to conserve the population of pure dingoes. This is extremely difficult and costly. Conservation efforts are hampered by the fact that it is not known how many pure dingoes still exist in Australia. Steps to conserve the pure dingo can only be effective when the identification of dingoes and other domestic dogs is absolutely reliable, especially in the case of living specimens. Additionally, conservation efforts are in conflict with control measures.

Conservation of pure and survivable dingo populations is promising in remote areas, where contact with humans and other domestic dogs is rare. Under New South Wales state policy in parks, reserves and other areas not used by agriculture, these populations are only to be controlled when they pose a threat to the survival of other native species. The introduction of &quot;dog-free&quot; buffer zones around areas with pure dingoes is regarded as a realistic method to stop interbreeding. This is enforced to the extent that all wild dogs can be killed outside the conservation areas. However, studies from the year 2007 indicate that even an intensive control of core areas is probably not able to stop the process of interbreeding.

According to the Dingo Discovery Sanctuary and Research Centre, many studies are finding a case for the re-introduction of the dingo into previously occupied areas in order to return some balance to badly degraded areas as a result of &quot;unregulated and ignorant farming practices&quot;.

Dingo densities have been measured at up to 3 per square kilometre (0.8/sq mi) in both the Guy Fawkes River region of New South Wales and in South Australia at the height of a rabbit plague.

===Hybridisation===


In 2023, a study of 402 wild and captive dingoes using 195,000 points across the dingo genome indicates that past studies of hybridisation were over-estimated and that pure dingoes are more common than they were originally thought to be.

In 2021, DNA testing of over 5,000 wild-living canines from across Australia found that 31 were feral domestic dogs and 27 were first generation hybrids. This finding challenges the perception that dingoes are nearly extinct and have been replaced by feral domestic dogs.

Coat colour cannot be used to distinguish hybrids. Dingo-like domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids can be generally distinguished by the more dog-typical kind of barking that exists among the hybrids, and differences in the breeding cycle, certain skull characteristics, and genetic analyses can be used for differentiation. Despite all the characteristics that can be used for distinguishing between dingoes and other domestic dogs, there are two problems that should not be underestimated. First, there is no real clarity regarding at what point a dog is regarded as a &quot;pure&quot; dingo, and, secondly, no distinguishing feature is completely reliable — it is not known which characteristics permanently remain under the conditions of natural selection.

There are two main opinions regarding this process of interbreeding. The first, and likely most common, position states that the &quot;pure&quot; dingo should be preserved via strong controls of the wild dog populations, and only &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;nearly-pure&quot; dingoes should be protected. The second position is relatively new and is of the opinion that people must accept that the dingo has changed and that it is impossible to bring the &quot;pure&quot; dingo back. Conservation of these dogs should therefore be based on where and how they live, as well as their cultural and ecological role, instead of concentrating on precise definitions or concerns about &quot;genetic purity&quot;. Both positions are controversially discussed.

Due to this interbreeding, there is a wider range of fur colours, skull shapes and body size in the modern-day wild dog population than in the time before the arrival of the Europeans. Over the course of the last 40 years, there has been an increase of about 20% in the average wild dog body size. It is currently unknown whether, in the case of the disappearance of &quot;pure&quot; dingoes, remaining hybrids would alter the predation pressure on other animals. It is also unclear what kind of role these hybrids would play in the Australian ecosystems. However, it is unlikely that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will be excessively disturbed by this process.

In 2011, a total of 3,941 samples were included in the first continent-wide DNA study of wild dogs. The study found that 46% were pure dingoes which exhibited no dog alleles (gene expressions). There was evidence of hybridisation in every region sampled. In Central Australia only 13% were hybrids; however, in southeastern Australia 99% were hybrids or feral dogs. Pure dingo distribution was 88% in the Northern Territory, intermediate numbers in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and 1% in New South Wales and Victoria. Almost all wild dogs showed some dingo ancestry, with only 3% of dogs showing less than 80% dingo ancestry. This indicates that domestic dogs have a low survival rate in the wild or that most hybridisation is the result of roaming dogs that return to their owners. No populations of feral dogs have been found in Australia.

In 2016, a three dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the skulls of dingoes, dogs and their hybrids found that dingo-dog hybrids exhibit morphology closer to the dingo than to the parent group dog. Hybridisation did not push the unique &quot;Canis dingo&quot; cranial morphology towards the wolf phenotype, therefore hybrids cannot be distinguished from dingoes based on cranial measures. The study suggests that the wild dingo morphology is dominant when compared with the recessive dog breed morphology, and concludes that although hybridisation introduces dog DNA into the dingo population, the native cranial morphology remains resistant to change.

<text>The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheepdog capable of mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.

The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie. The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for its working ability.

==History==

The ancestors of most Kelpies were British dogs known loosely as collies (sometimes spelled colleys). These were mostly black, or very dark brown, dogs – hence the name collie, which has the same root as coal. (The official collie breeds were not formed until about 10 or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, and the first recognised Border Collie was not brought to Australia until after the Federation in 1901). Some collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred with other types of dogs – usually with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision.

For much of the 20th century and early 21st century it was claimed that kelpies were partly descended from dingoes. In 2019, it was widely reported that a genomic study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney indicated that the kelpie had no dingo ancestry although this is still uncertain. Claire Wade, co-author of the study&#x27;s paper, said that she has never suggested there was &quot;no dingo blood in the Kelpie breed&quot; as the media reported. Wade explained:

The first dog known as a Kelpie was a black and tan female pup with floppy ears bought by Jack Gleeson about 1872 from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot. This dog was named after the kelpie, a mythological shapeshifting water spirit of Celtic folklore. In later years she was referred to as &quot;(Gleeson&#x27;s) Kelpie&quot;, to differentiate her from &quot;(King&#x27;s) Kelpie&quot;, her daughter.

The second &quot;Kelpie&quot; was &quot;(King&#x27;s) Kelpie&quot;, another black and tan bitch out of &quot;Kelpie&quot; by &quot;Caesar&quot;, a pup from two sheepdogs imported from Scotland. &quot;(King&#x27;s) Kelpie&quot; tied for the prestigious Forbes Trial in 1879, and the strain was soon popularly referred to as &quot;Kelpie&#x27;s pups&quot;, or just Kelpies. The King brothers joined another breeder, McLeod, to form a dog breeding partnership whose dogs dominated trials during 1900 to 1920.

An early Kelpie, Sally, was mated to Moss, a Smooth Collie, and she produced a black pup that was named Barb after The Barb, a black horse which had won the Melbourne Cup in 1866. Consequently, black Kelpies became known as Barb Kelpies or Barbs.

There were a number of Kelpies named Red Cloud. The first and most famous was John Quinn&#x27;s Red Cloud in the early 20th century. In the 1960s, another Red Cloud became well known in Western Australia. This started the tradition in Western Australia of calling all Red or Red and Tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies. Other notable specimens include Gunner and Red Dog (c. 1971 – 21 November 1979), a Kelpie mix which was the subject of a movie, &quot;Red Dog&quot;, released in 2011.

Kelpies have been exported to many countries including Argentina, Canada, Italy, Korea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States for various pursuits.

By 1990, Kelpies had been trained as scent dogs with good success rates. In Sweden they have been widely used for tracking and rescue work.

==Appearance==
The Kelpie is a soft-coated, medium-sized dog, usually with prick ears and an athletic appearance. Their coat colours include black, black and tan, red, red and tan, blue, blue and tan, fawn, fawn and tan, cream, black and blue, and white and gold. The Kelpie generally weighs and measures at the withers. They can reach a maximum weight of .

=== Breed standards ===
Robert Kaleski published the first standard for the Kelpie in 1904. The standard was accepted by leading breeders of the time and adopted by the Kennel Club of New South Wales. Contemporary breed standards vary depending on whether the registry is for working or show Kelpies. It is possible for a dog to both work and show, but options for competition in conformation shows might be limited depending on ancestry and the opinions of the kennel clubs or breed clubs involved.

In Australia, there are two separate registries for Kelpies. Working Kelpies are registered with the Working Kelpie Council (WKC) and/or the Australian Sheepdog Workers Association. The WKC encourages breeding for working ability, and allows a wide variety of coat colours. Show Kelpies are registered with the Australian National Kennel Council, which encourages breeding for a certain appearance and limits acceptable colours. The wide standards allowed by the WKC mean that many Working Kelpies do not meet the standard for showing.

In the US, the Kelpie is not recognised as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC). However, the United Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club recognise the Kelpie and allow them to compete in official events. As of 2015, Australian Kelpies have been accepted by the AKC as Herding Dogs allowed to compete in AKC sanctioned Sheep Herding Trials.

=== Working Kelpie ===
The Working Kelpie comes in three coat types: short, smooth and rough. The coat can be almost any colour from black to light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.

Working Kelpies vary in size, ranging from about and . 
A Working Kelpie can be a cheap and efficient worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good Working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from moving away from the stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie&#x27;s signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.

===Show Kelpie===
Kelpies that are bred under the ANKC registrations are registered for show (Main Register) only in the following colours: Black, Chocolate, Red, Smoky Blue, Fawn, Black and Tan, and Red and Tan. They have a double coat and pricked ears. The other colours can be registered as pets and sporting dogs (Limited Register): Blue and Tan, Fawn and Tan and Yellow/Cream. Kelpies were first exhibited in the early 20th century, at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. ANKC &quot;Show&quot; Kelpies are now becoming very popular both nationally and internationally as family pets, companion dogs, running mates and sport dogs due to their trainability, good nature and low maintenance of care and can be found all over the world.

==Temperament==
Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia.

Kelpies are intelligent and easy to train dogs making them good-tempered and good pets, especially with children. However they require a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation, otherwise they can become bored and hence be disruptive by constantly barking or digging, or by chewing on objects. Working Kelpies are often described as &quot;workaholics&quot;, with a strong drive to herd.

==Health==
Kelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems, but they are susceptible to disorders common to all breeds, such as cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy and luxating patella. Research is underway to find the genetic marker for cerebellar abiotrophy in the breed. 

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12 years based on a sample of 49 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==Notable Kelpies==
A Kelpie owned by a Victorian dairy farmer, Maggie, was thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest dog at her time of death.

On the Ludo show &quot;Bluey&quot; one of Bluey&#x27;s classmates is a red Kelpie named Rusty. Rusty is featured in the Season Three episode of Bluey called &quot;Cricket&quot;.

<doc id="62896" wikidata="Q331742" url="?curid=62896" title="George McGovern">
<text>George Stanley McGovern (July 19, 1922 – October 21, 2012) was an American politician and historian who was a U.S. representative and three-term U.S. senator from South Dakota, and the Democratic Party presidential nominee in the 1972 U.S. presidential election.

McGovern grew up in Mitchell, South Dakota, where he became a renowned debater. He volunteered for the U.S. Army Air Forces upon the country&#x27;s entry into World War II. As a B-24 Liberator pilot, he flew 35 missions over German-occupied Europe from a base in Italy. Among the medals he received was a Distinguished Flying Cross for making a hazardous emergency landing of his damaged plane and saving his crew. After the war, he earned degrees from Dakota Wesleyan University and Northwestern University, culminating in a PhD, and served as a history professor. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956 and re-elected in 1958. After a failed bid for the U.S. Senate in 1960, he was a successful candidate in 1962.

As a senator, McGovern was an example of modern American liberalism. He became most known for his outspoken opposition to the growing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 U.S. presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by increasing the number of caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern&#x27;s long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern&#x27;s credibility. In the general election, McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. electoral history. Although re-elected to the Senate in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in his bid for a fourth term in 1980.

Beginning with his experiences in war-torn Italy and continuing throughout his career, McGovern was involved in issues related to agriculture, food, nutrition, and hunger. As the first director of the Food for Peace program in 1961, McGovern oversaw the distribution of U.S. surpluses to the needy abroad and was instrumental in the creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme. As sole chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs from 1968 to 1977, McGovern publicized the problem of hunger within the United States and issued the &quot;McGovern Report&quot;, which led to a new set of nutritional guidelines for Americans. McGovern later served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture from 1998 to 2001 and was appointed the first UN global ambassador on world hunger by the World Food Programme in 2001. The McGovern–Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program has provided school meals for millions of children in dozens of countries since 2000 and resulted in McGovern&#x27;s being named World Food Prize co‑laureate in 2008.

==Early years and education==
McGovern was born in the 600‑person farming community of Avon, South Dakota. His father, the Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph, the son of an alcoholic who had immigrated from Ireland, had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but had given it up due to his teammates&#x27; heavy drinking, gambling, and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George&#x27;s mother was the former Frances McLean, born and initially raised in Ontario, Canada; her family had later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota looking for work as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern&#x27;s salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form of potatoes, cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.

When George was about three years old, the family moved to Calgary for a while to be near Frances&#x27;s ailing mother, and he formed memories of events such as the Calgary Stampede. When George was six, the family returned to the United States and moved to Mitchell, South Dakota, a community of 12,000. McGovern attended public schools there and was an average student. He was painfully shy as a child and was afraid to speak in class during first grade. His only reproachable behavior was going to see movies, which were among the worldly amusements forbidden to good Wesleyan Methodists. Otherwise he had a normal childhood marked by visits to the renowned Mitchell Corn Palace and what he later termed &quot;a sense of belonging to a particular place and knowing your part in it&quot;. He would long remember the Dust Bowl storms and grasshopper plagues that swept the prairie states during the Great Depression. The McGovern family lived on the edge of the poverty line for much of the 1920s and 1930s. Growing up so close to privation gave young George a lifelong sympathy for underpaid workers and struggling farmers. He was influenced by the currents of populism and agrarian unrest, as well as the &quot;practical divinity&quot; teachings of cleric John Wesley that sought to fight poverty, injustice, and ignorance.

McGovern attended Mitchell High School, where he was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern&#x27;s interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern&#x27;s life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.

McGovern enrolled at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell and became a star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II under way overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot&#x27;s license through the government&#x27;s Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: &quot;Frankly, I was scared to death on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing off the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off.&quot; In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had pre-marital sex with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941 McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.

McGovern was listening to a radio broadcast of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for a sophomore-year music appreciation class when he heard the news of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. In January 1942 he drove with nine other students to Omaha, Nebraska, and volunteered to join the United States Army Air Forces. The military accepted him, but they did not yet have enough airfields, aircraft, or instructors to start training all the volunteers, so McGovern stayed at Dakota Wesleyan. George and Eleanor became engaged, but initially decided not to marry until the war was over. During his sophomore year, McGovern won the statewide intercollegiate South Dakota Peace Oratory Contest with a speech called &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, which was later selected by the National Council of Churches as one of the nation&#x27;s twelve best orations of 1942. Smart, handsome, and well liked, McGovern was elected president of his sophomore class and voted &quot;Glamour Boy&quot; during his junior year. In February 1943, during his junior year, he and a partner won a regional debate tournament at North Dakota State University that featured competitors from thirty-two schools across a dozen states; upon his return to campus, he discovered that the Army had finally called him up.

==Military service==

===Groundschool and trainers===
Soon thereafter McGovern was sworn in as a private at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. He spent a month at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri and then five months at Southern Illinois Normal University in Carbondale, Illinois, for ground school training. McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced. He spent two months at a base in San Antonio, Texas, and then went to Hatbox Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for basic flying school, training in a single-engined PT‑19. McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943, during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer). His father presided over the ceremony at the Methodist church in Woonsocket.
After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to Coffeyville Army Airfield in Kansas for a further three months of training on the BT‑13. Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at Pampa Army Airfield in Texas for twin-engine training on the AT‑17 and AT‑9. Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good depth perception aiding him. Eleanor McGovern followed him to these duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a second lieutenant.

===Training in the B-24===
McGovern was assigned to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: &quot;Learning how to fly the B‑24 was the toughest part of the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because in the early part of the war they didn&#x27;t have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that&#x27;s about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time.&quot; Eleanor was constantly afraid. Accidents while training claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war.

This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others, owing to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern&#x27;s crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.

===Italy===
In September 1944 McGovern joined the 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, stationed at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There he and his crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35 missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the &quot;Dakota Queen&quot; after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshaling yards, all as part of the U.S. strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared with earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.

On McGovern&#x27;s December 15 mission over Linz, his second as pilot, a piece of shrapnel from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day on a mission to Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern&#x27;s plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

In January 1945 McGovern used R&amp;R time to see every sight that he could in Rome, and to participate in an audience with the pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to first lieutenant. On March 14 McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event that haunted McGovern. Four decades later, after McGovern related the incident during an Austrian television program and indicated he was still haunted by it, the owner of the farm called the television station to say that his farm was hit by that bomb but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern said finding this out was &quot;an enormous release&quot;.

On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern&#x27;s 35th mission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force&#x27;s requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said, &quot;Hell can&#x27;t be any worse than that&quot; – and the &quot;Dakota Queen&quot; was hit multiple times, resulting in 110 holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern&#x27;s waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique. According to a McGovern associate speaking after McGovern&#x27;s passing, sometime during his wartime experiences in Europe, McGovern had an extramarital affair and fathered a child with an unknown woman.

===Postwar relief===
In May and June 1945, following the end of the European war, McGovern continued with the 741st Bomb Squadron delivering surplus food and supplies near Trieste in Northeastern Italy; this was then trucked to the hungry in nearby locations, including to German prisoners of war. McGovern liked making these relief flights, as it gave a way to address the kinds of deprivations he had witnessed when first arriving in Italy. He then flew back to the United States with his crew. McGovern was discharged from the Army Air Forces in July 1945, with the rank of first lieutenant. He was also awarded the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, one instance of which was for the safe landing on his final mission.

==Later education and early career==
Upon coming home, McGovern returned to Dakota Wesleyan University, aided by the G.I. Bill, and graduated from there in June 1946 with a B.A. degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. For a while he suffered from nightmares about flying through flak barrages or his plane being on fire. He continued with debate, again winning the state Peace Oratory Contest with a speech entitled &quot;From Cave to Cave&quot; that presented a Christian-influenced Wilsonian outlook. The couple&#x27;s second daughter, Susan, was born in March 1946.

McGovern switched from Wesleyan Methodism to less fundamentalist regular Methodism. Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. Among Methodist seminaries, Garrett tended towards social involvement paired with a theologically liberal approach, and many of the students there leaned towards pacifism. McGovern was influenced by the weekly sermons of a well-known local minister, Ernest Fremont Tittle, and the ideas of Boston personalism. McGovern preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by the minutiae of his pastoral duties. In late 1947 McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, where he also worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was among the best in the country, and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.

McGovern then returned to his alma mater, Dakota Wesleyan, and became a professor of history and political science. With the assistance of a Hearst fellowship for 1949–50, he continued pursuing graduate studies during summers and other free time. The couple&#x27;s third daughter, Teresa, was born in June 1949. Eleanor McGovern began to suffer from bouts of depression but continued to assume the large share of household and child-rearing duties. McGovern earned a Ph.D. in history from Northwestern University in 1953. His 450-page dissertation, &quot;The Colorado Coal Strike, 1913–1914&quot;, was a sympathetic account of the miners&#x27; revolt against Rockefeller interests in the Colorado Coalfield War. His thesis advisor, noted historian Arthur S. Link, later said he had not seen a better student than McGovern in 26 years of teaching. McGovern was influenced not only by Link and the &quot;Consensus School&quot; of American historians but also by the previous generation of &quot;progressive&quot; historians. Most of his future analyses of world events would be informed by his training as a historian, as well as his personal experiences during the Great Depression and World War II. Meanwhile, McGovern had become a popular if politically outspoken teacher at Dakota Wesleyan, with students dedicating the college yearbook to him in 1952.

Nominally a Republican growing up, McGovern began to admire Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War II, even though he supported Roosevelt&#x27;s opponent Thomas Dewey in the 1944 U.S. presidential election. At Northwestern, his exposure to the work of China scholars John King Fairbank and Owen Lattimore had convinced him that unrest in Southeast Asia was homegrown and that U.S. foreign policy toward Asia was counterproductive. Discouraged by the onset of the Cold War, and never thinking well of incumbent president Harry S. Truman, in the 1948 U.S. presidential election McGovern was attracted to the campaign of former vice president and secretary of agriculture Henry A. Wallace. He wrote columns supporting Wallace in the &quot;Mitchell Daily Republic&quot; and attended the Wallace Progressive Party&#x27;s first national convention as a delegate. There he became disturbed by aspects of the convention atmosphere, decades later referring to &quot;a certain rigidity and fanaticism on the part of a few of the strategists.&quot; He remained a public supporter of Wallace and the Progressive Party afterward. As Wallace was kept off the ballot in Illinois where McGovern was now registered, McGovern did not vote in the general election.

By 1952, McGovern was coming to think of himself as a Democrat. He was captivated by a radio broadcast of Governor Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s speech accepting the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention. He immediately dedicated himself to Stevenson&#x27;s campaign, publishing seven articles in the &quot;Mitchell Daily Republic&quot; newspaper outlining the historical issues that separated the Democratic Party from the Republicans. The McGoverns named their only son, Steven, born immediately after the convention, after his new hero. Although Stevenson lost the election, McGovern remained active in politics, believing that &quot;the engine of progress in our time in America is the Democratic Party.&quot; In early 1953, McGovern left a tenure-track position at the university to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party, the state chair having recruited him after reading his articles. Democrats in the state were at a low, holding no statewide offices and only 2 of the 110 seats in the state legislature. Friends and political figures had counseled McGovern against making the move, but despite his mild, unassuming manner, McGovern had an ambitious nature and was intent upon starting a political career of his own.

McGovern spent the following years rebuilding and revitalizing the party, building up a large list of voter contacts via frequent travel around the state. Democrats showed improvement in the 1954 elections, winning 25 seats in the state legislature. From 1954 to 1956 he also was on a political organization advisory group for the Democratic National Committee. The McGoverns&#x27; fifth and final child, Mary, was born in 1955.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1956, McGovern sought elective office himself, and ran for the House of Representatives from South Dakota&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which consisted of the counties east of the Missouri River. He faced four-term incumbent Republican Party representative Harold O. Lovre. Aided by the voter lists he had earlier accumulated, McGovern ran a low-budget campaign, spending $12,000 while borrowing $5,000. His quiet personality appealed to voters he met, while Lovre suffered from a general unhappiness over Eisenhower administration farm policy. When polls showed McGovern gaining, Lovre&#x27;s campaign implied that McGovern&#x27;s support for admitting the People&#x27;s Republic of China to the United Nations and his past support for Henry Wallace meant that McGovern was a communist appeaser or sympathizer. In his closing speech, McGovern responded: &quot;I have always despised communism and every other ruthless tyranny over the mind and spirit of man.&quot; McGovern staged an upset victory, gaining 116,516 votes to his opponent&#x27;s 105,835, and became the first Democrat elected to Congress from South Dakota in 22 years. The McGoverns established a home in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern became a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a representative, McGovern was attentive to his district. He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices, farm price supports, grain storage programs, and beef import controls, believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies. He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957 he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the American Christian Palestine Committee. McGovern first allied with the Kennedy family by supporting a House version of Senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s eventually unsuccessful labor reform bill.

In his 1958 reelection campaign, McGovern faced a strong challenge from South Dakota&#x27;s two-term Republican governor and World War II Medal of Honor recipient Joe Foss, who was initially considered the favorite to win. McGovern ran an effective campaign that showcased his political strengths of having firm beliefs and the ability to articulate them in debates and on the stump. He prevailed with a slightly larger margin than two years before. In the 86th United States Congress, McGovern was assigned to the House Committee on Agriculture. The longtime chairman of the committee, Harold D. Cooley, would subsequently say, &quot;I cannot recall a single member of Congress who has fought more vigorously or intelligently for American farmers than Congressman McGovern.&quot; He helped pass a new food-stamp law. He was one of nine representatives from Congress to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly conferences of 1958 and 1959. Along with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, McGovern strongly advocated a reconstruction of Public Law 480 (an agricultural surplus act that had come into being under Eisenhower) with a greater emphasis on feeding the hungry around the world, the establishment of an executive office to run operations, and the goal of promoting peace and stability around the world. During his time in the House, McGovern was regarded as a liberal overall, and voted in accordance with the rated positions of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) 34 times and against 3 times. Two of the themes of his House career, improvements for rural America and the war on hunger, would be defining ones of his legislative career and public life.

McGovern did not vote on the initial House bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but voted in favor of the Senate amendment to the bill in August 1957. McGovern voted in favor initial House bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1960, but did not vote on the Senate amendment to the bill in April 1960. In 1960, McGovern decided to run for the U.S. Senate and challenge the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite. The race centered mostly on rural issues, but John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Catholicism was a drawback at the top of the ticket in the mostly Protestant state. McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, &quot;It was my worst campaign. I hated [Mundt] so much I lost my sense of balance.&quot; McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt&#x27;s 160,579, but the margin was one third of Kennedy&#x27;s loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state&#x27;s presidential contest.

==Food for Peace director==

Having relinquished his House seat to run for the Senate, McGovern was available for a position in the new Kennedy administration. McGovern was picked to become a special assistant to the president and first director of Kennedy&#x27;s high-priority Food for Peace program, which realized what McGovern had been advocating in the House. McGovern assumed the post on January 21, 1961.

As director, McGovern urged the greater use of food to enable foreign economic development, saying, &quot;We should thank God that we have a food abundance and use the over-supply among the underprivileged at home and abroad.&quot; He found space for the program in the Executive Office Building rather than be subservient to either the State Department or Department of Agriculture. McGovern worked with deputy director James W. Symington and Kennedy advisor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in visiting South America to discuss surplus grain distribution, and attended meetings of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In June 1961, McGovern became seriously ill with hepatitis, contracted from an infected White House dispensary needle used to give him inoculations for his South American trip; he was hospitalized and unable to come to his office for two months; his campaign disguised the condition by saying it was a mild kidney infection.

By the close of 1961, the Food for Peace program was operating in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw an expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace. Subsequently, one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it; by mid-1962, it fed 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern&#x27;s work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota&#x27;s wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern was instrumental in the creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to affected regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.

Administration was never McGovern&#x27;s strength, and he was restless for another try at the Senate. With the approval of President Kennedy, McGovern resigned his post on July 18, 1962. Kennedy said that under McGovern the program had &quot;become a vital force in the world&quot;, improving living conditions and economies of allies and creating &quot;a powerful barrier to the spread of Communism&quot;. Columnist Drew Pearson wrote that it was one of the &quot;most spectacular achievements of the young Kennedy administration&quot;, while Schlesinger would later write that Food for Peace had been &quot;the greatest unseen weapon of Kennedy&#x27;s third-world policy&quot;.

==U.S. Senator==

===1962 election and early years as a senator===
In April 1962, McGovern announced he would run for election to South Dakota&#x27;s other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former lieutenant governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race, and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White&#x27;s classic &quot;The Making of the President 1960,&quot; and for the first time began thinking about running for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern&#x27;s 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.

When he joined the Senate in January 1963 for the 88th Congress, McGovern was seated on the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee and Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. On the Agriculture Committee, McGovern supported high farm prices, full parity, and controls on beef importation, as well as the administration&#x27;s Feed Grains Acreage Diversion Program. McGovern had a fractious relationship with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, who was less sympathetic to farmers; McGovern&#x27;s 1966 resolution to informally scold Freeman made the senator popular back in his home state. Fellow new senator Edward M. Kennedy saw McGovern as a serious voice on farm policy and often sought McGovern&#x27;s guidance on agriculture-related votes. McGovern was largely inactive on the Interior Committee until 1967, when he was given the chairmanship of the subcommittee on Indian affairs; however, Interior Committee chairman Henry M. Jackson, who did not get along with McGovern personally or politically, refused to allow McGovern his own staff, limiting his effectiveness. McGovern regretted not accomplishing more for South Dakota&#x27;s 30,000 Sioux Indians, although after a McGovern-introduced resolution on Indian self-determination passed in 1969, the Oglala Sioux named McGovern &quot;Great White Eagle.&quot;

In his first speech on the Senate floor in March 1963, McGovern praised Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress initiative but spoke out against U.S. policy toward Cuba, saying that it suffered from &quot;our Castro fixation&quot;. In August 1963 McGovern advocated reducing the $53 billion defense budget by $5 billion; influenced by advisor Seymour Melman, he held a special antipathy toward the doctrine of nuclear &quot;overkill&quot;. McGovern would try to reduce defense appropriations or limit military expenditures in almost every year during the 1960s. He also voted against many weapons programs, especially missile and antimissile systems, and also opposed military assistance to foreign nations. In 1964 McGovern published his first book, &quot;War Against Want: America&#x27;s Food for Peace Program&quot;. In it he argued for expanding his old program, and a Senate measure he introduced was eventually passed, adding $700 million to the effort&#x27;s funding.

Preferring to concentrate on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and he developed a reputation among some other senators for &quot;not doing his homework&quot;. Described as &quot;a very private, unchummy guy&quot;, he was not a member of the Senate &quot;club&quot; nor did he want to be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Relatively few pieces of legislation bore his name, and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others&#x27; bills. In his political beliefs, McGovern fit squarely within modern American liberalism; through 1967 he had voted in accordance with the rated positions of the ADA 92 percent of the time, and when lacking specific knowledge on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, &quot;What are the liberals doing?&quot;

===Opposition to Vietnam War===

In a speech on the Senate floor in September 1963, McGovern became the first member to challenge the growing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Bothered by the Buddhist crisis and other recent developments, and with concerns influenced by Vietnam historian Bernard Fall, McGovern said:
As the speech was little noticed, McGovern backed away from saying anything publicly for over a year afterward, partly because of the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though more skeptical about it than most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which turned out to be an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander in chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently, he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes because of Senator J. William Fulbright&#x27;s urging to stand behind Johnson politically. The day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of &quot;very interesting, but very belated.&quot; This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.

In January 1965 McGovern made his first major address on Vietnam, saying that &quot;We are not winning in South Vietnam ... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of extending the war to the north.&quot; McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UN presence to guarantee security and fair treatment. The speech gave McGovern national visibility as one of the &quot;doves&quot; in the debate over Vietnam; however, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S. forces and criticizing antiwar draft-card burnings as &quot;immature, impractical, and illegal&quot;. He eschewed personal criticism of Johnson. In November 1965 McGovern traveled to South Vietnam for three weeks. The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply upset him, and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced than ever that Vietnam was a political, not military, problem. Now he was ready, as he later said, &quot;not merely to dissent, but to crusade&quot; against the war.

McGovern voted in favor of Vietnam military appropriations in 1966 through 1968, not wanting to deprive U.S. forces of necessary equipment. Nevertheless, his antiwar rhetoric increased throughout 1967. Over the years, Johnson had invited McGovern and other Senate doves to the White House for attempts to explain the rationale for his actions in Vietnam; McGovern came away from the final such visit, in August 1967, shaken by the sight of a president &quot;tortured and confused ... by the mess he has gotten into in Vietnam.&quot;

===1968 presidential and Senate campaigns===
In August 1967 activist Allard K. Lowenstein founded the Dump Johnson movement, and soon it was seeking a Democratic Party figure to make a primaries campaign challenge against Johnson in the 1968 U.S. presidential election. The group&#x27;s first choice was Senator Robert Kennedy, who declined, as did another, and by late September 1967 they approached McGovern. After much deliberation McGovern declined, largely because he feared such a run would significantly damage his own chances for reelection to his Senate seat in 1968. A month later the anti-Johnson forces were able to persuade Senator Eugene McCarthy to run; he was one of the few &quot;dove&quot; senators not up for reelection that year.

In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy staged a strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey joined the field. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were both from the neighboring state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, which resulted in a strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.

Within days, some of Kennedy&#x27;s aides were urging McGovern to run in his place; their antipathy toward McCarthy and ideological opposition to Humphrey made them unwilling to support either candidate. McGovern delayed making a decision, making sure that Bobby&#x27;s brother Ted Kennedy did not want to enter, and with his staff still concerned about the senator&#x27;s own reelection prospects. McGovern&#x27;s voting had changed during 1968, with his ADA rating falling to 43 as he sought more middle-of-the-road stances. In late July, McGovern&#x27;s decision became more complicated when his daughter Teresa was arrested in Rapid City on marijuana possession charges. She had led a troubled life since her teenage years, developing problems with alcohol and depression and suffering the consequences of a relationship with an unstable neighborhood boy. On the basis of a recently enacted strict state drugs law, Terry now faced a minimum five-year prison sentence if found guilty. McGovern was also convinced that the socially conservative voters of South Dakota would reject him owing to his daughter&#x27;s arrest. Charges against her were subsequently dropped because of an invalid search warrant.

McGovern formally announced his candidacy on August 10, 1968, in Washington, two weeks in advance of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, committing himself to &quot;the goals for which Robert Kennedy gave his life.&quot; Asked why he was a better choice than McCarthy, he said, &quot;Well – Gene really doesn&#x27;t want to be president, and I do.&quot; At the convention in Chicago, Humphrey was the near-certain choice, while McGovern became the initial rallying point for around 300 leaderless Kennedy delegates. The chaotic circumstances of the convention found McGovern denouncing the Chicago police tactics against demonstrators as &quot;police brutality.&quot; Given the internal politics of the party, it was difficult for McGovern to gain in delegate strength, and black protest candidate Channing E. Phillips drew off some of his support. In the actual roll call, McGovern came in third with 146½ delegates, far behind Humphrey&#x27;s 1760¼ and McCarthy&#x27;s 601.

McGovern endorsed Humphrey at the convention, to the dismay of some antiwar figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter&#x27;s arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago; however, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57 percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.

===Middle Senate years and continued opposition to the Vietnam War===
During the 1968 Democratic Convention, a motion had been passed to establish a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969 McGovern was named chairman of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, also known as the McGovern–Fraser Commission; owing to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process. The commission&#x27;s 1970 report, &quot;Mandate for Reform&quot;, was approved by the Democratic National Committee in 1971. It required that delegates be selected either by a party primary where delegate preferences were indicated on the ballot or by a state convention process where the first stage was open caucuses. It also mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. The new rules had an immediate effect; in 1972, a third more primaries were held in the Democratic nomination process than in 1968 and those primaries produced half again as many delegates. Over the next few presidential election cycles, this trend towards holding primaries increased in both parties, with eventually over 80 percent of delegates being chosen via primaries; whereas before McGovern–Fraser, two-thirds of all delegates were chosen by state conventions controlled by party elites. Thus the U.S. presidential nominating process has been different ever since the McGovern–Fraser reforms, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.

In the wake of several high-profile reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chairman. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress during much of the next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.

McGovern generally lacked both interest and expertise in economics, but was outspoken in reaction to Nixon&#x27;s imposition of wage and price controls in 1971. McGovern declared: &quot;This administration, which pledged to slow inflation and reduce unemployment, has instead given us the highest rate of inflation and the highest rate of unemployment in a decade.&quot; Regarding another heated domestic issue, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; included McGovern in a 1971 report about liberal politicians and journalists who advocated integrated schooling while avoiding it for their children.
But most of all, McGovern was known for his continued opposition to the Vietnam War. In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president&#x27;s policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves. The ongoing diversion to South Vietnam of much of Food for Peace&#x27;s aid, where it was used to subsidize that country&#x27;s budget, when there were countries around the world affected by drought and food shortages, upset him. By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year. In October 1969 McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000 demonstrators in Boston at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/Mobilization&#x27;s antiwar march to the Washington Monument. Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized antiwar figures such as Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Huey Newton, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin as &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot;.

Instead, McGovern focused on legislative means to bring the war to an end. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican Mark Hatfield of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina by the end of 1970. It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971. In May 1970 McGovern obtained a second mortgage on his Washington home in order to fund a half-hour televised panel discussion on the amendment on NBC. The broadcast brought in over $500,000 in donations that furthered work on passage, and eventually the amendment gained the support of the majority of the public in polls. The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by White House aide Charles Colson, which called McGovern and Hatfield &quot;apostles of retreat and defeat&quot; and &quot;salesmen of surrender&quot; and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy. The amendment was defeated in September 1970 by a 55–39 vote, just short of what McGovern had hoped would constitute at least a moral victory. During the floor debate, McGovern criticized his colleagues opposing the measure:
The Senate reacted in startled, stunned silence, and some faces showed anger and fury; when one member told McGovern he had been personally offended by the speech, McGovern said, &quot;That&#x27;s what I meant to do.&quot; McGovern believed Vietnam an immoral war that was destroying much of what was pure, hopeful, and different about America&#x27;s character as a nation.

The defeat of the amendment left McGovern embittered and somewhat more radicalized. He accused the vice president of South Vietnam, Nguyen Cao Ky, of running a heroin trafficking operation that was addicting American soldiers. In a retort to the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis&#x27;s suggestion that U.S. troops might have to return to Cambodia, McGovern declared, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to fight. If he wants to use American ground troops in Cambodia, let him lead the charge himself.&quot; He denounced Nixon&#x27;s policy of Vietnamization as &quot;subsidiz[ing] the continued killing of the people of Indochina by technology and mercenaries.&quot; In a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he said that Ho Chi Minh was the North Vietnamese George Washington.

McGovern–Hatfield was put up for a vote again in 1971, with somewhat weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.

===1972 presidential campaign===
McGovern announced his candidacy on January 18, 1971, during a televised speech from the studios of KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference Gallup Poll. The earliest such entry since Andrew Jackson, it was designed to give him time to overcome the large lead of the frontrunner, Maine senator Edmund Muskie. By January 1972, McGovern had only 3 percent national support among Democrats in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage. McGovern&#x27;s campaign manager Gary Hart decided on a guerrilla-like insurgency strategy of battling Muskie in only selected primaries, not everywhere, so as to focus the campaign&#x27;s organizational strength and resources.

Muskie fell victim to inferior organizing, an over-reliance on party endorsements, and Nixon&#x27;s &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operatives, and in the March 7, 1972, New Hampshire primary, did worse than expected with McGovern coming in a close second. As Muskie&#x27;s campaign funding and support dried up, Hubert Humphrey, who had rejoined the Senate, became McGovern&#x27;s primary rival for the nomination, with Alabama governor George Wallace also in the mix after dominating the March 14 primary in Florida. McGovern won a key breakthrough victory over Humphrey and Wallace on April 4 in Wisconsin, where he added blue-collar economic populism to his appeal. He followed that by dominating the April 25 primary in Massachusetts. At that point, McGovern had become the frontrunner. A late decision to enter the May 2 Ohio primary, considered a Humphrey stronghold, paid dividends when McGovern managed a very close second there amid charges of election fraud by pro-Humphrey forces. The other two leading candidates for the nomination also won primaries, but Wallace&#x27;s campaign in effect ended when he was seriously wounded in a May assassination attempt, and McGovern&#x27;s operation was effective in garnering delegates in caucus states.

The climactic contest took place in California, with Humphrey attacking McGovern in several televised debates; in the June 6 vote, McGovern defeated him by five percentage points and claimed all the delegates due to the state&#x27;s winner-take-all rules. He then appeared to clinch the nomination with delegates won in the New York primary on June 20. Humphrey&#x27;s attacks on McGovern as being too radical began a downward slide in the latter&#x27;s poll standing against Nixon. McGovern became tagged with the label &quot;amnesty, abortion, and acid&quot;, supposedly reflecting his positions. During his primary victories, McGovern used an approach that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He capitalized on support from antiwar activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and had only a modest edge over Wallace.

McGovern ran on a platform that advocated withdrawal from the Vietnam War in exchange for the return of American prisoners of war and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country. McGovern&#x27;s platform also included an across-the-board 37-percent reduction in defense spending over three years. He proposed a &quot;demogrant&quot; program that would give a $1,000 payment to every citizen in the United States. Based around existing ideas such as the negative income tax and intended to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs, it nonetheless garnered considerable derision as a poorly thought-out &quot;liberal giveaway&quot; and was dropped from the platform in August.

An &quot;Anybody But McGovern&quot; coalition, led by southern Democrats and organized labor, formed in the weeks following the final primaries. McGovern&#x27;s nomination did not become ensured until the first night of the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, where, following intricate parliamentary maneuverings led by campaign staffer Rick Stearns, a Humphrey credentials challenge regarding the California winner-take-all rules was defeated. Divisive arguments over the party platform then followed; what resulted was arguably the most liberal one of any major U.S. party. On July 12, 1972, McGovern officially won the Democratic nomination. In doing so and in taking over the party&#x27;s processes and platform, McGovern produced what &quot;The New York Times&quot; termed &quot;a stunning sweep.&quot; The convention distractions led to a hurried process to pick a vice presidential running mate. Turned down by his first choice, Ted Kennedy, as well as by several others, McGovern selected – with virtually no vetting – Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton. On the final night of the convention, procedural arguments over matters such as a new party charter, and a prolonged vice presidential nomination process that descended into farce, delayed the nominee&#x27;s acceptance speech. As a result, McGovern delivered his speech, &quot;Come home America!&quot;, at three o&#x27;clock in the morning, reducing his television audience from about 70 million people to about 15 million.

Just over two weeks after the convention, it was revealed that Eagleton had been hospitalized and received electroshock therapy for &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot; and &quot;depression&quot; several times during the early to mid-1960s. Years later, Eagleton&#x27;s diagnosis was refined to bipolar II disorder. McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry&#x27;s battles with mental illness. He was additionally sympathetic due to his wife Eleanor having experienced depression; and he was also harboring a secret about his own past, that being an undisclosed child. On the following day, July 26, McGovern stated publicly, &quot;I am 1,000 percent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket.&quot; Though many people still supported Eagleton&#x27;s candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign&#x27;s ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern&#x27;s consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton&#x27;s offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice presidential nominee has been forced off the ticket. Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern&#x27;s offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie. (Larry O&#x27;Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named U.S. ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern&#x27;s 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging made him look both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would long view the Eagleton affair as having been &quot;catastrophic&quot; for his campaign.

The general election campaign did not go well for McGovern. Nixon did little campaigning; he was buoyed by the success of his visit to China and arms-control-signing summit meeting in the Soviet Union earlier that year, and shortly before the election Henry Kissinger&#x27;s somewhat premature statement that &quot;peace is at hand&quot; in Vietnam. Top Republican figures attacked McGovern for being weak on defense issues and &quot;encouraging the enemy&quot;; Nixon asserted that McGovern was for &quot;peace at any price&quot; in Vietnam rather than the &quot;peace with honor&quot; that Nixon said he would bring about. McGovern chose to not emphasize his own war record during the campaign. The McGovern Commission changes to the convention rules marginalized the influence of establishment Democratic Party figures, and McGovern struggled to get endorsements from figures such as former President Johnson and Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley. The AFL–CIO remained neutral, after having always endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate in the past. Some southern Democrats, led by former Texas governor John Connally, switched their support to the Republican incumbent through a campaign effort called Democrats for Nixon. Nixon outspent McGovern by more than two-to-one.

Nixon directly requested that his aides use government records to try to dig up dirt on McGovern and his top contributors. McGovern was publicly attacked by Nixon surrogates and was the target of various operations of the Nixon &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign. The infamous Watergate break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972 was an alternate target after bugging McGovern&#x27;s headquarters was explored. The full dimensions of the subsequent Watergate scandal did not emerge during the election; the vast majority of the press focused on McGovern&#x27;s difficulties and other news rather than the break-in or who was behind it, and a majority of voters were unaware of Watergate. In the end, Nixon&#x27;s covert operations had little effect in either direction on the election outcome.

By the final week of the campaign, McGovern knew he was going to lose. While he was appearing in Battle Creek, Michigan, on November 2, a Nixon admirer heckled him. McGovern told the heckler, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a secret for you&quot;, then said softly into his ear, &quot;Kiss my ass.&quot; The incident was overheard and reported in the press, and became part of the tale of the campaign.

In the general election on November 7, 1972, the McGovern–Shriver ticket suffered a 61 percent to 37 percent defeat to Nixon – at the time, the second biggest landslide in American history, with an Electoral College total of 520 to 17. McGovern&#x27;s two electoral vote victories came in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, and he failed to win his home state of South Dakota, which had gone Democratic in only three of the previous eighteen presidential elections and would continue to go Republican in presidential elections to come. Over the nation as a whole he carried a mere 135 counties. At just over four percent of the nation&#x27;s counties, McGovern&#x27;s county wins remain the fewest by almost a factor of three for any major-party nominee.
===Remaining Senate years===

After this loss, McGovern remained in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife, Eleanor, took it even worse; during the winter of 1972–1973, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon&#x27;s presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered.

To get past the &quot;bitterness and self-pity&quot; he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, &quot;For many years, I wanted to run for the presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did.&quot; Emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 because of the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald Ford&#x27;s subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand, given that Nixon&#x27;s subordinates were going to prison.

McGovern displayed the political resiliency he had shown in the past. In 1974, he faced possible political peril because of his having neglected the state during his long presidential campaign, and by May 1973, he had already begun campaigning for re-election. An Air Force pilot and Medal of Honor recipient, Leo K. Thorsness, had just been repatriated after six years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam; he publicly accused McGovern of having given aid and comfort to the enemy and of having prolonged his time as a POW. McGovern replied that if there had been no war, there would have been no POWs, and that everything he had done had been toward the goal of ending the war sooner. Thorsness became the Republican nominee against McGovern, but despite the two men&#x27;s different roles in it, the war did not become a significant issue. Instead, the campaign was dominated by farm policy differences and economic concerns over the 1973–75 recession. Thorsness charged McGovern with being a &quot;part-time senator&quot; more concerned with national office and with spending over $2 million on his re‑election bid, while McGovern labeled Thorsness a carpetbagger owing to his having grown up in Minnesota. In a year in which Democrats were advantaged by the aftereffects of the Watergate scandal, McGovern won re-election in November 1974 with 53 percent of the vote.

Following the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975, McGovern attributed the outcome not to Congressional refusal to fund more military aid to South Vietnam, as President Ford had wanted. Instead, McGovern said, the regime of Nguyễn Văn Thiệu &quot;fell because the leadership was corrupt and decadent and did not have the support of its own people.&quot; Regarding the Indochina refugee crisis that soon developed, McGovern introduced legislation in early May 1975 to enable Vietnamese refugees who had left the country in panic fearing a post-war bloodbath to return to the country. He said, &quot;Ninety percent of the refugees would be better off going back to their own land. And I say that in a humanitarian spirit. ... The [new] Saigon government has already given orders that the people are not to be molested ... that is more respect than Thieu&#x27;s army frequently demonstrated. ... our program for dealing with these refugees should include as the highest priority steps to facilitate their early return to Vietnam.&quot; McGovern&#x27;s stance brought immediate criticism from some quarters; syndicated columnist John D. Lofton, Jr. said it proved that McGovern was &quot;the most immoral hypocrite on the American political scene today.&quot; McGovern objected to what he termed distorted interpretations of his proposal, but newspaper publisher Creed C. Black considered the criticism fair.

Following his Senate re-election victory, McGovern harbored thoughts of running in the 1976 U.S. presidential election. Given the magnitude of his defeat in 1972, very few in the Democratic Party wanted him as a presidential candidate again. Unfamiliar and uncomfortable with Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter, McGovern secretly voted for Ford instead. McGovern&#x27;s view on intervention in Southeast Asia took a turn in 1978 in reaction to the ongoing Cambodian genocide. Noting that it affected a percentage of the population that made &quot;Hitler&#x27;s operation look tame&quot;, he advocated an international military intervention in Cambodia to put the Khmer Rouge regime out of power.

McGovern&#x27;s Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs expanded its scope to include national nutrition policy. In 1977, it issued a new set of nutritional guidelines for Americans that sought to combat leading killer health conditions. Titled &quot;Dietary Goals for the United States&quot;, but also known as the &quot;McGovern Report&quot;, it suggested that Americans eat less fat, less cholesterol, less refined and processed sugars, and more complex carbohydrates and fiber. While many public health officials had said all of this for some time, the committee&#x27;s issuance of the guidelines gave it higher public profile. The recommendations proved controversial with the cattle, dairy, egg, and sugar industries, including from McGovern&#x27;s home state. The McGovern committee guidelines led to reorganization of some federal executive functions and became the predecessor to the more detailed Dietary Guidelines for Americans later issued twice a decade by the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.

In 1980, McGovern was one of several liberal Democratic senators targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), which put out a year&#x27;s worth of negative advertising about McGovern. It and other anti-abortion groups especially focused on McGovern&#x27;s support for abortion rights laws. McGovern faced a Democratic primary challenge for the first time, from a pro-life candidate. McGovern&#x27;s Republican opponent was James Abdnor, a four-term incumbent congressman who held identical positions to McGovern&#x27;s on farm issues, was solidly conservative on national issues, and was well liked within the state. Abdnor&#x27;s campaign focused on both McGovern&#x27;s liberal voting record and what it said was McGovern&#x27;s lack of involvement in South Dakota affairs. McGovern made an issue of NCPAC&#x27;s outside involvement, and that group eventually withdrew from the campaign after Abdnor denounced a letter it had sent out. Far behind in the polls earlier, McGovern outspent Abdnor two-to-one and repeatedly criticized Abdnor&#x27;s refusal to debate him, thereby drawing attention to a slight speech defect Abdnor had. Showing the comeback pattern of some of his past races in the state, McGovern closed the gap for a while. In November 1980, McGovern was defeated for re-election, winning only 39 percent of the vote to Abdnor&#x27;s 58 percent. In what became known as the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot;, McGovern was one of many Democratic casualties of that year&#x27;s Republican sweep.

==Post-Senate life and 1984 presidential campaign==

McGovern did not mourn leaving the Senate. Although being rejected by his own state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt out of touch with the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982 he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run again for president.

McGovern also began teaching and lecturing at a number of universities in the U.S. and Europe, accepting one-year contracts or less. From 1981 to 1982, McGovern replaced historian Stephen Ambrose as a professor at the University of New Orleans. McGovern also began making frequent speeches, earning several hundred thousand dollars a year. McGovern attempted another presidential run in the 1984 Democratic primaries. Friends and political admirers of McGovern initially feared the effort would prove an embarrassment, and McGovern knew that his chances of winning were remote, but he felt compelled to try to influence the intraparty debate in a liberal direction. Freed from the practical concerns of trying to win, McGovern outlined a ten-point program of sweeping domestic and foreign policy changes; because he was not seen as a threat, fellow competitors did not attack his positions, and media commentators praised him as the &quot;conscience&quot; of the Democratic Party.

Despite enjoying good name recognition, McGovern had little funding or staff, although he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, and when he came in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former vice president Walter Mondale, he kept his word. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 14, 1984. McGovern addressed the party&#x27;s platform committee, and his name was placed in nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he delivered a speech that strongly criticized President Reagan and praised Democratic unity. He received the votes of four delegates. He actively supported the Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro ticket, whose eventual landslide defeat bore some similarities to his own in 1972.

During the 1980s McGovern was a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Washington, D.C. In September 1987, McGovern lectured at the inaugural Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. In January 1988, McGovern said that he was considering entering the 1988 Democratic primaries in the event that a front-runner did not emerge in the race. Ultimately, he did not enter. McGovern had made several real estate investments in the D.C. area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, with the goal of providing a hotel, restaurant, and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992 McGovern published his reflections on the experience in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News&quot;. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state, and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, &quot;I ... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.&quot; His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.

Although he briefly explored another presidential run in the 1992 contest, McGovern instead became president of the Middle East Policy Council (a nonprofit organization that seeks to educate American citizens and policymakers about the political, economic and security issues impacting U.S. national interests in the Middle East) in July 1991; he had previously served on its board since 1986. He held this position until 1997, when he was replaced by Charles W. Freeman Jr. On the night of December 12–13, 1994, McGovern&#x27;s daughter Teresa fell into a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, while heavily intoxicated and died of hypothermia. Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had been in and out of many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, &quot;Terry: My Daughter&#x27;s Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism&quot;; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment that he and the rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had made things worse for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems. He would later say that Terry&#x27;s death was by far the most painful event in his life: &quot;You never get over it, I&#x27;m sure of that. You get so you can live with it, that&#x27;s all.&quot;

==Ambassador to food agencies and other later activities==
In April 1998 McGovern returned to public service when he began a three-year stint as United States ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, serving in Rome, Italy, after having been named to the post by President Bill Clinton. The announcement that Clinton was choosing McGovern for the role had come on February 19, McGovern&#x27;s appointment had been confirmed by voice vote of the Senate on March 6, had become official on March 10, and he presented his credentials to the UN in Rome on April 14. The 75-year-old McGovern said he had not been seeking the position, but that &quot;it&#x27;s ideal for someone my age because it carries full ambassadorial rank without the hassle of running a big embassy.&quot;

In an effort to meet the UN&#x27;s goal of reducing the number of hungry people in the world by half by 2015, Ambassador McGovern formulated detailed plans, urging delivery of more surplus food to foreign school-lunch programs and the establishment of specific targets such as had been done in old American programs. He began working again with fellow former senator Bob Dole to persuade the Senate to support this effort, as well as expanded school lunch, food stamps, and nutritional help for pregnant women and poor children in the United States.

The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program that was created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, would go on to provide more than 22 million meals to children in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who were more likely to be allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern&#x27;s service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern&#x27;s book &quot;The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger in Our Time&quot; was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.

In October 2001, McGovern was appointed as the first UN global ambassador on world hunger by the World Food Programme, the agency he had helped found forty years earlier. He was still active in this goodwill ambassador position as of 2011 and remained in it until his death. McGovern was an honorary life member of the board of Friends of the World Food Program. McGovern also served as a senior policy advisor at Olsson Frank Weeda, a food and drug regulatory counseling law and lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., where he specialized on issues of food, nutrition, and agriculture. McGovern&#x27;s wartime story was at the center of Ambrose&#x27;s 2001 best-selling profile of the men who flew B‑24s over Germany in World War II, &quot;The Wild Blue&quot;. It was the first time much of the public became familiar with that part of his life; throughout his political career, McGovern had rarely mentioned his war service or the medals he had won.
McGovern continued to lecture and make public appearances, sometimes appearing with Dole on college campuses. McGovern and Dole contributed essays to the 2005 volume &quot;Ending Hunger Now: A Challenge to Persons of Faith&quot;. From around 2003 to 2005, McGovern owned a bookstore in his summer home of Stevensville in Montana&#x27;s Bitterroot Valley, until deciding to sell it because of lack of sufficient market. In 2003, the McGoverns became part-time residents of Marco Island, Florida; by then, Eleanor was struggling with heart disease.

In October 2006, the $8.5 million George and Eleanor McGovern Library and Center for Leadership and Public Service was dedicated at Dakota Wesleyan University. The couple had helped raise the funds for it. It seeks to prepare the college&#x27;s best students for future careers in public service through classes, seminars, research, and internships, and also to raise the visibility of the university. The dignitaries in attendance were led by former president Clinton.
McGovern&#x27;s wife Eleanor was too ill to attend the ceremony, and she died of heart disease on January 25, 2007, at their home in Mitchell.
Later in 2007, several events were held at Dakota Wesleyan and in Washington, D.C., to celebrate McGovern&#x27;s 85th birthday and the 35th anniversary of his nomination for president. Hundreds of former staff, volunteers, supporters and friends attended, along with public officials.

McGovern still sought to have his voice heard in the American political scene. He became an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, likening U.S. involvement in that country to that of the failed Vietnam effort, and in 2006 co-wrote the book &quot;Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for Withdrawal Now&quot;. In January 2004, McGovern campaigned for Wesley Clark in his presidential bid, citing him as the candidate best suited to win in the general election. In January 2008, McGovern wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney, saying they had violated the U.S. Constitution, transgressed national and international law, and repeatedly lied to the American people. The subtitle of the article read &quot;Nixon Was Bad. These Guys Are Worse.&quot; In the tumultuous 2008 Democratic Party presidential nomination campaign, he first endorsed U.S. senator Hillary Clinton and then later switched to Senator Barack Obama after concluding Clinton could no longer win. On October 16, 2008, McGovern and Dole were made World Food Prize laureates for their efforts to curb hunger in the world and in particular for their joint program for school feeding and enhanced school attendance.

==Final years and death==
By 2009, McGovern had moved to St. Augustine Beach, Florida. McGovern&#x27;s seventh book (as author, co-author, or contributing editor) issued in the first decade of the 2000s, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, was published by Times Books and released at the close of 2008. Throughout 2009, McGovern embarked on a book tour, including a prominent visit to the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.

He was treated for exhaustion during 2011 and then was hospitalized after a serious fall in December 2011 on his way to participate in a live C-SPAN program about his 1972 presidential campaign. By January 2012 he was promoting his latest book, &quot;What It Means to Be a Democrat&quot;. He was hospitalized again in April 2012 owing to fainting spells. McGovern&#x27;s 90th birthday was celebrated on July 19, 2012, with a Washington event hosted by World Food Program USA and attended by many liberal Democratic politicians, along with (as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; termed it) &quot;one respectful conservative&quot;, South Dakota&#x27;s Republican senator John Thune. On July 27, 2012, McGovern&#x27;s son Steven died at age 60. McGovern&#x27;s daughter Ann said, &quot;Steve had a long struggle with alcoholism. We will all miss him deeply, but are grateful that he is now at peace.&quot; In August 2012, McGovern moved back to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to be nearer to his family. His final public appearance was on October 6, 2012, when he introduced his recorded narration for Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; with the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra.

On October 15, 2012, McGovern&#x27;s family announced he had entered Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls; his daughter Ann said, &quot;He&#x27;s coming to the end of his life.&quot; On the morning of October 21, 2012, McGovern died at the age of 90 at the Sioux Falls hospice, surrounded by family and lifelong friends. The family released this statement: &quot;We are blessed to know that our father lived a long, successful and productive life advocating for the hungry, being a progressive voice for millions and fighting for peace. He continued giving speeches, writing and advising all the way up to and past his 90th birthday, which he celebrated this summer.&quot; In addition to his three remaining children, he was survived by ten grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

President Obama paid tribute to McGovern as &quot;a champion for peace&quot; and a &quot;statesman of great conscience and conviction&quot;. At a memorial service in Sioux Falls, Vice President Joe Biden eulogized McGovern, addressing his World War II service and his opposition to the Vietnam War by saying to his family, &quot;Your father was a genuine hero. ... Had your father not been in the Senate, so much more blood, so much more treasure would have been wasted.&quot; His funeral was held in the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science in Sioux Falls, with his ashes to be buried alongside his wife and daughter Terry at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington.

On July 26, 2015, the &quot;Argus Leader&quot;, the daily newspaper in Sioux Falls, published an article detailing the extensive files on McGovern compiled through the years by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including letters and notations from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, revealing that Hoover had a direct interest in the FBI monitoring of McGovern. The newspaper also published the complete FBI file on McGovern that was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed shortly after McGovern&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
Owing to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 election and the causes behind it, &quot;McGovernism&quot; became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid. In 1992, nationally syndicated &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Bob Greene wrote, &quot;Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and out of touch with the American people.&quot; Conservatives used McGovern&#x27;s name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures. According to Daniel McCarthy of &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if &quot;every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy.&quot;

The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent, although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a pacifist and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II. McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: &quot;I am a liberal and always have been – just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be.&quot; He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast. He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with &quot;I&#x27;m what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like&quot;, and in 2006 asked, &quot;How the hell do you get elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you&#x27;re a wild-eyed radical?&quot;

In later decades, McGovern remained a symbol, or standard-bearer, of the American Left, particularly in relation to the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s when the country was torn by U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and the corruption and abuse of power of the Nixon administration. Throughout his career, McGovern&#x27;s positions reflected his own experiences as well as a personal synthesis of the traditions of American liberalism and progressivism. Southern Methodist University historian Thomas J. Knock wrote in 2003 that &quot;[McGovern&#x27;s] career was extraordinary and historic ... primarily because of his impress as searching and prophetic critic&quot; and that &quot;few political careers offer an alternative understanding of the American Century as compelling and instructive as McGovern&#x27;s.&quot;

As chairman of the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–1970, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that continue to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional changes taking place in both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women&#x27;s movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s &quot;New Politics&quot; found its culmination in McGovern&#x27;s nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, &quot;We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon as we did, half the Democrats walked out.&quot; The 2005 documentary film &quot;One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern&quot; captured some of these achievements and lamentations. SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had &quot;their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire ... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record.&quot; Half a century after McGovern&#x27;s 1972 winning nomination effort, writers were making extensive comparisons between it and the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.

Staffers who worked on McGovern&#x27;s 1972 campaign later became influential within the Democratic Party. Campaign manager Gary Hart staged his own presidential runs in 1984 and 1988. Future president Bill Clinton, with assistance from his future wife and politician, Hillary Rodham, had managed the McGovern campaign&#x27;s operations in Texas. Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern, while Clinton, and the Democratic Leadership Council movement of which he was a part, explicitly rejected McGovern&#x27;s ideology. There was still a legacy in terms of staffing, as the Clinton White House would be full of former &quot;McGovernites&quot;.

McGovern&#x27;s post-political career generally enhanced his reputation; Tom Brokaw, who referred to McGovern as part of the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;, wrote in 1998 that &quot;he remains one of the country&#x27;s most decent and thoughtful public servants.&quot; McGovern&#x27;s legacy also includes his commitment to combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. He said, &quot;After I&#x27;m gone, I want people to say about me: He did the best he could to end hunger in this country and the world.&quot; In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history. Responding to the Serenity Prayer&#x27;s desire to &quot;grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change&quot;, McGovern said simply that he rejected that notion: &quot;I keep trying to change them.&quot;

<text>The Sherden (Egyptian: &quot;šrdn&quot;, &quot;šꜣrdꜣnꜣ&quot; or &quot;šꜣrdynꜣ&quot;; Ugaritic: &quot;šrdnn(m)&quot; and &quot;trtn(m)&quot;; possibly Akkadian: &quot;šêrtânnu&quot;; also glossed &quot;Shardana&quot; or &quot;Sherdanu&quot;) are one of the several ethnic groups the Sea Peoples were said to be composed of, appearing in fragmentary historical and iconographic records (ancient Egyptian and Ugaritic) from the Eastern Mediterranean in the late 2nd millennium BC.

On reliefs, they are shown carrying round shields and spears, dirks or swords, perhaps of Naue II type. In some cases, they are shown wearing corslets and kilts, but their key distinguishing feature is a horned helmet, which, in all cases but three, features a circular accouterment at the crest. At Medinet Habu the corslet appears similar to that worn by the Philistines. The Sherden sword, it has been suggested by archaeologists since James Henry Breasted, may have developed from an enlargement of European daggers and been associated with the exploitation of Bohemian tin. Robert Drews suggested that use of this weapon by groups of Sherden and Philistine mercenaries made them capable of withstanding attacks by chariotry and so made them valuable allies in warfare, but Drews&#x27;s theory has been widely criticised by contemporary scholars.

==Early historical references==

The earliest known mention of the people called &quot;Srdn-w&quot;, more usually called &quot;Sherden&quot; or &quot;Shardana&quot;, is generally thought to be the Akkadian reference to the &quot;še-er-ta-an-nu&quot; in the Amarna Letters correspondence from Rib-Hadda, mayor (&quot;hazannu&quot;) of Byblos, to the Pharaoh Amenhotep III or Akhenaten in the 14th century BC. Though they have been referred to as sea raiders and mercenaries, who were prepared to offer their services to local employers, these texts do not provide any evidence of that association, and they shed no light on what the function of these &quot;širdannu-people&quot; was at the time.

The first certain mention of the Sherden is found in the records of Ramesses II (ruled 1279-1213 BC), who defeated them in his second year (1278 BC) when they attempted to raid Egypt&#x27;s coast. The pharaoh subsequently incorporated many of these warriors into his personal guard. An inscription by Ramesses II on a stele from Tanis that recorded the Sherden pirates&#x27; raid and subsequent defeat, speaks of the constant threat which they posed to Egypt&#x27;s Mediterranean coasts:
After Ramesses II succeeded in defeating the invaders and capturing some of them, Sherden captives are depicted in this Pharaoh&#x27;s bodyguard, where they are conspicuous by their helmets with horns with a ball projecting from the middle, their round shields and the great Naue II swords, with which they are depicted in inscriptions about the Battle of Kadesh, fought against the Hittites. Ramesses stated in his Kadesh inscriptions that he incorporated some of the Sherden into his own personal guard at the Battle of Kadesh.

Years later, other waves of Sea People, the Sherden included, were defeated by Merneptah, son of Ramesses II, and father of Ramesses III. An Egyptian work written around 1100 BC, the Onomasticon of Amenope, documents the presence of the Sherden in Canaan. After being defeated by Pharaoh Ramesses III, they, along with other &quot;Sea Peoples&quot;, would be allowed to settle in that territory, subject to Egyptian rule.

The Italian orientalist Giovanni Garbini identified the territory colonized by the Sherden as that occupied, according to the Bible, by the Israelite tribe of Zebulun going by the eponym of &quot;Sared&quot;, which had established themselves in the northern territory of Canaan. Archaeologist Adam Zertal suggests that some Sherden settled in what is now northern Israel. He hypothesizes that biblical Sisera was a Sherden general and that the archaeological site at el-Ahwat (whose architecture resembles nuraghe sites in Sardinia) was Sisera&#x27;s capital, Harosheth Haggoyim, though this theory has not received wide acceptance in the scholarly community.

== Connection to Sea Peoples ==
The Sherden seem to have been one of the more prominent groups of pirates that engaged in coastal raiding and the disruption of trade in the years around the 13th century BC. They are first mentioned by name in the Tanis II rhetorical stele of Ramesses II, which says in part, &quot;As for the Sherden of rebellious mind, whom none could ever fight against, who came bold-hearted, they sailed in, in warships from the midst of the Sea, those whom none could withstand; but he plundered them by the victories of his valiant arm, they being carried off to Egypt.&quot; It is possible that some of the Sherden captured in the battle recounted in Tanis II were pressed into Egyptian service, perhaps even as shipwrights or advisers on maritime technology, a role in which they may have assisted in the construction of the hybrid Egyptian warships seen on the monumental relief at Medinet Habu that shows the naval battle between Egyptians and Sea Peoples.

Michael Wood has suggested that their raids contributed greatly to the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. However, while some Aegean attributes can be seen in the material culture of the Philistines, one of the Sea Peoples who established cities on the southern coastal plain of Canaan at the beginning of the Iron Age, the association of the Sherden with this geographic area is based entirely on their association with that group and the Sea Peoples phenomenon writ large, rather than on physical or literary evidence (of which almost all testifies to their presence in Egypt, rather than their port of origin).

==Origins==
No mention of the Sherden has ever been found in Hittite or Greek legends or documents.

===Eastern origin theory===

English archaeologist Margaret Guido (1912–1994) concludes the evidence for the Sherden, Shekelesh, or Teresh coming from the western Mediterranean is flimsy. Guido in 1963 suggests that the Sherden may ultimately derive from Ionia, in the central west coast of Anatolia, in the region of Hermos, east of the island of Chios. It is suggested that Sardis, and the Sardinian plain nearby, may preserve a cultural memory of their name.

Until recently it was assumed that Sardis was only settled in the period after the Anatolian and Aegean Dark Age, but American excavations have shown the place was settled in the Bronze Age and was a site of a significant population. If this is so, the Sherden, pushed by Hittite expansionism of the Late Bronze Age and prompted by the famine that affected this region at the same time, may have been pushed to the Aegean Islands, where shortage of space led them to seek adventure and expansion overseas. It is suggested that from here they may have later migrated to Sardinia. Guido suggests that [if a] few dominating leaders arrived as heroes only a few centuries before Phoenician trading posts were established, several features of Sardinian prehistory might be explained as innovations introduced by them: Oriental types of armour, and fighting perpetuated in the bronze representation of warriors several centuries later; the arrival of the Cypriot copper ingots of the Serra Ilixi type; the sudden advance in and inventiveness of design of the Sardinian nuraghes themselves at about the turn of the first millennium; the introduction of certain religious practices such as the worship of water in sacred wells – if this fact was not introduced [later] by the Phoenician settlers.

It has been stated that the only weapons and armour similar to those of the Sherden found in Sardinia have been dated to several centuries after the period of the Sea Peoples, which mainly covered the 13th–12th centuries BC. If the theory that the Sherden moved to Sardinia only after their defeat around 1178–1175 BC by Ramesses III is true, then it could be inferred from this that the finds in Sardinia are survivals of earlier types of weapons and armour. On the other hand, if the Sherden only moved into the Western Mediterranean in the ninth century, associated perhaps with the movement of early Etruscans and even Phoenician seafaring peoples into the Western Mediterranean at that time, this would solve the problem of the late appearance of their military gear in Sardinia; but it would remain unknown where they were located between the period of the Sea Peoples and their eventual appearance in Sardinia.

===Western origin theory===

The theory that postulates a migration of peoples from the Eastern Mediterranean to Sardinia during the Late Bronze Age was firmly rejected by Italian archaeologists like Antonio Taramelli and Massimo Pallottino and by Vere Gordon Childe, and more recently by Giovanni Ugas, who instead identifies the Sherden with the indigenous Sardinian Nuragic civilization. He excavated the accidentally-discovered Hypogeum of Sant&#x27;Iroxi in Sardinia, where several arsenical bronze swords and daggers dating back to 1600 BC were found. The discovery suggested that the Nuragic tribes actually used these kind of weapons since the mid-2nd millennium BC, as is also demonstrated by the Nuragic bronze sculptures dating back to as far as 1200 BC and depicting warriors with a horned helmet and a round shield. Similar swords are also depicted on the statue menhir of Filitosa, in southern Corsica. Giovanni Lilliu noted that the period in which the Sherden are mentioned in the Egyptian sources coincides with the height of the Nuragic civilization. According to Robert Drews, Sardinians from the Gulf of Cagliari and the nearby areas were encouraged to become warriors and leave their island in order to improve their life conditions in the kingdoms of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Since 2008, the &quot;Shardana Project&quot; has been developed in Corsica and Sardinia by the Centre of Studies J.-Fr. Champollion on Egyptology and Coptic Civilization, based in Genoa in cooperation with the University of Genoa and the University of the Mediterranean in Taranto. The project aims to gather as many data available about the Sherden culture inside and outside the Pharaonic Egypt. The project, conducted by the Egyptologist Giacomo Cavillier, aims to verify the possible interconnections and contacts between the Sherden and the local culture of these islands, in a broader Mediterranenan view, and to reassess all data available on this phenomenon.

The identification of the Sherden with the Nuragic Sardinians has also been supported by Sebastiano Tusa in his last book and in its presentations, and by Carlos Roberto Zorea, from the Complutense University of Madrid.

Another one to support it has been the Cypriot archaeologist Vassos Karageorghis, that found Nuragic pottery in Cyprus and wrote about the Nuragic role in places like the Syrian city of Tell Kazel.It is most probable that among the Aegean immigrants there were also some refugees from Sardinia. This may corroborate the evidence from Medinet Habu that among the Sea Peoples there were also refugees from various part of the Mediterranean, some from Sardinia, the Shardana or Sherden. [...] It is probable that these Shardana went first to Crete and from there they joined a group of Cretans for an eastward adventure.

Adam Zertal, and more recently Bar Shay from Haifa University, have also argued that the Shardana were Nuragic Sardinians, and connected them to the site of El-Awat in Canaan.

When you look at plans of sites of the Shardana in Sardinia, in the second millennium BCE, throughout this entire period, you can see wavy walls, you can see corridors... you can see high heaps of stones, which were developed into the classical nuraghic culture of Sardinia. The only good architectural parallels are found in Sardinia and the Shardana culture

According to Malcolm H. Wiener &quot;some of the Sea Peoples are likely to have started from Sardinia, Sicily, Italy, or the Balkans. Sardinia has long been viewed as a likely or possible homeland of the Sherdana in light of the similarity in names and Egyptian depictions of helmets resembling helmets found in Sardinia&quot; while for the Austrian archeologist Reinhard Jung &quot;the hypothesis of a connection between Šardana and Nuragic Sardinians is as old as the archaeology, but it could not be proven so far.&quot; (2017).

Late Bronze Age Nuragic pottery had been found in the Aegean and in the Eastern Mediterranean particularly in Crete at Kommos and on the island of Cyprus, at Kokkinokremnos, a site attributed to the Sea Peoples, and Hala Sultan Tekke. Nuragic pottery were also found in a tomb of the Ugarit harbour of Minet el-Beida.

<text>Daphnia is a genus of small planktonic crustaceans, in length. &quot;Daphnia&quot; are members of the order Anomopoda, and are one of the several small aquatic crustaceans commonly called water fleas because their saltatory swimming style resembles the movements of fleas. &quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. live in various aquatic environments ranging from acidic swamps to freshwater lakes and ponds.

The two most commonly found species of &quot;Daphnia&quot; are &quot;D. pulex&quot; (small and most common) and &quot;D. magna&quot; (large). They are often associated with a related genus in the order Cladocera: &quot;Moina&quot;, which is in the Moinidae group instead of the Daphniidae, and is much smaller than &quot;D. pulex&quot; (roughly half the maximum length). 

== Appearance and characteristics ==

The body of a &quot;Daphnia&quot; species is usually long, and is divided into segments, although this division is not visible. The head is fused, and is generally bent down towards the body with a visible notch separating the two. In most species, the rest of the body is covered by a carapace, with a ventral gap in which the five or six pairs of legs lie. The most prominent features are the compound eyes, the second antennae, and a pair of abdominal setae. In many species, the carapace is translucent or nearly so, so they make excellent subjects for the microscope, as one can observe the beating heart.
Even under relatively low-power microscopy, the feeding mechanism can be observed, with immature young moving in the brood pouch; moreover, the eye being moved by the ciliary muscles can be seen, as well as blood cells being pumped around the circulatory system by the simple heart. The heart is at the top of the back, just behind the head, and the average heart rate is about 180 bpm under normal conditions. &quot;Daphnia&quot; spp., like many animals, are prone to alcohol intoxication, and make excellent subjects for studying the effects of the depressant on the nervous system due to the translucent exoskeleton and the visibly altered heart rate. They are tolerant of being observed live under a coverslip and appear to suffer no harm when returned to open water. This experiment can also be performed using nicotine, or adrenaline, each producing an increase in the heart rate. 

Due to its intermediate size, &quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. use both diffusion and circulatory methods, producing hemoglobin in low-oxygen environments.

==Systematics and evolution==

&quot;Daphnia&quot; is a large genus – comprising over 200 species – belonging to the cladoceran family Daphniidae. It is subdivided into several subgenera (&quot;Daphnia&quot;, &quot;Australodaphnia&quot;, &quot;Ctenodaphnia&quot;), but the division has been controversial and is still in development. Each subgenus has been further divided into a number of species complexes. The understanding of species boundaries has been hindered by phenotypic plasticity, hybridization, intercontinental introductions, and poor taxonomic descriptions. Modern members of &quot;Daphnia&quot; belonging to the subgenera &quot;Daphnia&quot; and &quot;Ctenodaphnia&quot; are known since the Cretaceous, though the genus likely originated prior to the beginning of the Cretaceous. There are numerous poorly studied and cryptic species among crustaceans of the genus &quot;Daphnia&quot;.

==Ecology and behaviour==
&quot;Daphnia&quot; species are normally &quot;r&quot;-selected, meaning that they invest in early reproduction, so have short lifespans. An individual &quot;Daphnia&quot; lifespan depends on factors such as temperature and the abundance of predators, but can be 13–14 months in some cold, oligotrophic, fish-free lakes. In typical conditions, however, the lifecycle is much shorter, not usually exceeding 5–6 months.

&quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. are typically filter feeders, ingesting mainly unicellular algae and various sorts of organic detritus including protists and bacteria Beating of the legs produces a constant current through the carapace, which brings such material into the digestive tract. The trapped food particles are formed into a food &quot;bolus&quot; which then moves down the digestive tract until voided through the anus located on the ventral surface of the terminal appendage. The second and third pairs of legs are used in the organisms&#x27; filter-feeding, ensuring large, unabsorbable particles are kept out, while the other sets of legs create the stream of water rushing into the organism.

Swimming is powered mainly by the second set of antennae, which are larger in size than the first set. The action of this second set of antennae is responsible for the jumping motion.

&quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. are known to show behavioral changes or modifications to their morphology in the presence of predator kairomones (chemical signals), including larger size at hatching, increased bulkiness, and the development of &quot;neck-teeth&quot;. For example, juveniles of &quot;D. pulex&quot; and &quot;D. magna&quot; have a larger size after hatching, along with developing neck-teeth at the back of the head, when in the presence of &quot;Chaoborus&quot; kairomones. These morphological defenses have shown to reduce mortality due to &quot;Chaoborus&quot; predation, which is a gape-limited predator. Chitin-related genes (deacetylases) are thought to play an important part in the expression/development of these morphological defenses in &quot;Daphnia&quot;. Chitin-modifying enzymes (chitin deacetylases) have been shown to catalyse the N-deacetylation of chitin to influence the protein-binding affinity of these chitin filaments. In case of &quot;D. magna&quot; it was shown that the response to different kairomones also differ: While the presence of fish kairomones up-regulated one specific gene in the folding of proteins, whereas &quot;Chaoborus&quot; kairomone down-regulated the same gene. Based on this the response is a reduction of size at first reproduction in response to kairomones from fish whereas it shows increased size when confronted with larvae of &quot;Chaoborus&quot;. With the same publication it was shown that genes for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme were up-regulated in the presence of microcystins in the food of &quot;D. magna&quot; and with this the enzymes of glycolysis and protein catabolism are significantly upgregulated when daphnids ingest these toxins.

==Life cycle==
Most &quot;Daphnia&quot; species have a lifecycle based on &quot;cyclical parthenogenesis&quot;, alternating between parthenogenetic (asexual) and sexual reproduction. For most of the growth season, females reproduce asexually. They produce a brood of diploid eggs every time they molt; these broods can contain as few as one or two eggs in smaller species, such as &quot;D. cucullata&quot;, but can be over 100 in larger species, such as &quot;D. magna&quot;. Under typical conditions, these eggs hatch after a day, and remain in the female&#x27;s brood pouch for around three days (at 20 °C). They are then released into the water, and pass through a further four to six instars over 5–10 days (longer in poor conditions) before reaching an age where they are able to reproduce. The asexually produced offspring are typically female.



Towards the end of the growing season, however, the mode of reproduction changes, and the females produce tough &quot;resting eggs&quot; or &quot;winter eggs&quot;. When environmental conditions deteriorate (e.g. crowding), some of the asexually produced offspring develop into males. The females start producing haploid sexual eggs, which the males fertilise. In species without males, resting eggs are also produced asexually and are diploid. In either case, the resting eggs are protected by a hardened coat (consisting of two chitinous plates) called the &quot;ephippium&quot;, and are cast off at the female&#x27;s next molt. The ephippia can withstand periods of extreme cold, drought, or poor food availability, and hatch – when conditions improve – into females (They are close to being classed as extremophiles) . 

==Parasites==
The diagram on the left shows the lifecycle of &quot;Pasteuria ramosa&quot;, a bacterial parasite of &quot;Daphnia&quot;. Susceptible hosts acquire the infection from spores in the sediment or in suspension. The parasite develops mainly in the host&#x27;s body cavity and muscle tissue, increasing in density and eventually expanding to occupy the entire host. Typical effects on the host are sterility and gigantism. Spores are released mainly after the host dies and sinks to the substrate, and sometimes directly to the water via clumsy predation.

==Conservation==
Several &quot;Daphnia&quot; species are considered threatened. These are listed as vulnerable by IUCN: &quot;Daphnia nivalis&quot;, &quot;Daphnia coronata&quot;, &quot;Daphnia occidentalis&quot;, and &quot;Daphnia jollyi&quot;. Some species are halophiles, and can be found in hypersaline lake environments, an example of which is the Makgadikgadi Pan.

==Uses==
&quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. are a popular live food in tropical and marine fish keeping. They are often fed to tadpoles or small species of amphibians such as the African dwarf frog (&quot;Hymenochirus boettgeri&quot;).

&quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. are used in scientific studies as a model organism. They may be used in certain environments to test the effects of toxins on an ecosystem, which makes them an indicator genus, particularly useful because of their short lifespans and reproductive capabilities. Because they are nearly transparent, their internal organs are easy to study in live specimens (e.g. to study the effect of temperature on the heart rate of these ectothermic organisms). Environmental toxicological testing may be undertaken with researchers assessing mortality rates or metabolic perturbations to assess ecological impacts. &quot;Daphnia&quot; is also commonly used for experiments to test climate change aspects, as UVB that seriously damages zooplankton species (e.g. decrease feeding activity).

Because of their thin membranes, which allow drugs to be absorbed, they are used to monitor the effects of certain drugs, such as adrenaline or capsaicin, on the heart.

==Invasive species==
Some species have developed permanent defenses against fish eating them, such as spines and long hooks on the body, which also cause them to become entangled on fishing lines and cloud water with their high numbers. Species such as &quot;Daphnia lumholtzi&quot; (native to east Africa, the Asian subcontinent of India, and east Australia) have these characteristics and great care should be taken to prevent them from spreading further in North American waters.

Some species of &quot;Daphnia&quot; native to North America can develop sharp spines at the end of their bodies and helmet-like structures on their heads when they detect predators, but this is overall temporary for such species and they do not completely overwhelm or discourage native predators from eating them. While &quot;Daphnia&quot; spp. are an important base of the food chain in freshwater lakes (and vernal pools), they become a nuisance when they are unable to be eaten by native macroscopic predators, and some concern exists that the original spineless and hookless water fleas and spp. end up outcompeted by the invasive ones. (This may not be the case, however, and the new invaders may mostly be a tangling and clogging nuisance.)

In the water bodies of the world, at least 15 species of &quot;Daphnia&quot; and hybrids are non-native species, many of which pose a great threat to aquatic ecosystems.

<text>Stuart Alan Kauffman (born September 28, 1939) is an American medical doctor, theoretical biologist, and complex systems researcher who studies the origin of life on Earth. He was a professor at the University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Calgary. He is currently emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania and affiliate faculty at the Institute for Systems Biology. He has a number of awards including a MacArthur Fellowship and a Wiener Medal.

He is best known for arguing that the complexity of biological systems and organisms might result as much from self-organization and far-from-equilibrium dynamics as from Darwinian natural selection, as discussed in his book &quot;Origins of Order&quot; (1993). In 1967 and 1969 he used random Boolean networks to investigate generic self-organizing properties of gene regulatory networks, proposing that cell types are dynamical attractors in gene regulatory networks and that cell differentiation can be understood as transitions between attractors. Recent evidence suggests that cell types in humans and other organisms are attractors. In 1971 he suggested that a zygote may not be able to access all the cell type attractors in its gene regulatory network during development and that some of the developmentally inaccessible cell types might be cancer cell types. This suggested the possibility of &quot;cancer differentiation therapy&quot;. He also proposed the self-organized emergence of collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers, specifically peptides, for the origin of molecular reproduction, which have found experimental support.

==Education and early career==
Kauffman graduated from Dartmouth in 1960, was awarded the BA (Hons) by Oxford University (where he was a Marshall Scholar) in 1963, and completed a medical degree (M.D.) at the University of California, San Francisco in 1968. After completing his internship, he moved into developmental genetics of the fruit fly, holding appointments first at the University of Chicago from 1969 to 1973, the National Cancer Institute from 1973 to 1975, and then at the University of Pennsylvania from 1975 to 1994, where he rose to professor of biochemistry and biophysics.

==Career==
Kauffman became known through his association with the Santa Fe Institute (a non-profit research institute dedicated to the study of complex systems), where he was faculty in residence from 1986 to 1997, and through his work on models in various areas of biology. These included autocatalytic sets in origin of life research, gene regulatory networks in developmental biology, and fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology. With Marc Ballivet, Kauffman holds the founding broad biotechnology patents in combinatorial chemistry and applied molecular evolution, first issued in France in 1987, in England in 1989, and later in North America.

In 1996, with Ernst and Young, Kauffman started BiosGroup, a Santa Fe, New Mexico-based for-profit company that applied complex systems methodology to business problems. BiosGroup was acquired by NuTech Solutions in early 2003. NuTech was bought by Netezza in 2008, and later by IBM.

From 2005 to 2009 Kauffman held a joint appointment at the University of Calgary in biological sciences, physics, and astronomy. He was also an adjunct professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Calgary. He was an iCORE (Informatics Research Circle of Excellence) chair and the director of the Institute for Biocomplexity and Informatics. Kauffman was also invited to help launch the Science and Religion initiative at Harvard Divinity School; serving as visiting professor in 2009.

In January 2009 Kauffman became a Finland Distinguished Professor (FiDiPro) at Tampere University of Technology, Department of Signal Processing. The appointment ended in December, 2012. The subject of the FiDiPro research project is the development of delayed stochastic models of genetic regulatory networks based on gene expression data at the single molecule level.

In January 2010 Kauffman joined the University of Vermont faculty where he continued his work for two years with UVM&#x27;s Complex Systems Center. From early 2011 to April 2013, Kauffman was a regular contributor to the NPR Blog 13.7, Cosmos and Culture, with topics ranging from the life sciences, systems biology, and medicine, to spirituality, economics, and the law.

In May 2013 he joined the Institute for Systems Biology, in Seattle, Washington. Following the death of his wife, Kauffman cofounded Transforming Medicine: The Elizabeth Kauffman Institute.

In 2014, Kauffman with Samuli Niiranen and Gabor Vattay was issued a founding patent on the &quot;poised realm&quot; (see below), an apparently new &quot;state of matter&quot; hovering reversibly between quantum and classical realms.

In 2015, he was invited to help initiate a general a discussion on rethinking economic growth for the United Nations. Around the same time, he did research with University of Oxford professor Teppo Felin.

==Fitness landscapes==

Kauffman&#x27;s NK model defines a combinatorial phase space, consisting of every string (chosen from a given alphabet) of length formula_1. For each string in this search space, a scalar value (called the &quot;fitness&quot;) is defined. If a distance metric is defined between strings, the resulting structure is a &quot;landscape&quot;.

Fitness values are defined according to the specific incarnation of the model, but the key feature of the NK model is that the fitness of a given string formula_2 is the sum of contributions from each locus formula_3 in the string:

:formula_4

and the contribution from each locus in general depends on the value of formula_5 other loci:

:formula_6

where formula_7 are the other loci upon which the fitness of formula_3 depends.

Hence, the fitness function formula_9 is a mapping between strings of length &quot;K&quot; + 1 and scalars, which Weinberger&#x27;s later work calls &quot;fitness contributions&quot;. Such fitness contributions are often chosen randomly from some specified probability distribution.

In 1991, Weinberger published a detailed analysis of the case in which formula_10 and the fitness contributions are chosen randomly. His analytical estimate of the number of local optima was later shown to be flawed. However, numerical experiments included in Weinberger&#x27;s analysis support his analytical result that the expected fitness of a string is normally distributed with a mean of approximately
formula_11
and a variance of approximately
formula_12.

==Recognition and awards==
Kauffman held a MacArthur Fellowship between 1987 and 1992. He also holds an Honorary Degree in Science from the University of Louvain (1997); He was awarded the Norbert Wiener Memorial Gold Medal for Cybernetics in 1973, the Gold Medal of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome in 1990, the Trotter Prize for Information and Complexity in 2001, and the Herbert Simon award for Complex Systems in 2013. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2009.

== Works ==

Kauffman is best known for arguing that the complexity of biological systems and organisms might result as much from self-organization and far-from-equilibrium dynamics as from Darwinian natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. With respect to molecular biology, Kauffman&#x27;s structuralist approach has been criticized for ignoring the role of energy in driving biochemical reactions in cells, which can fairly be called self-catalyzing but which do not simply self-organize. Some biologists and physicists working in Kauffman&#x27;s area have questioned his claims about self-organization and evolution. A case in point is some comments in the 2001 book &quot;Self-Organization in Biological Systems&quot;. Roger Sansom&#x27;s 2011 book &quot;Ingenious Genes: How Gene Regulation Networks Evolve to Control Development&quot; is an extended criticism of Kauffman&#x27;s model of self-organization in relation to gene regulatory networks.

Borrowing from spin glass models in physics, Kauffman invented &quot;N-K&quot; fitness landscapes, which have found applications in biology and economics. In related work, Kauffman and colleagues have examined subcritical, critical, and behavior in economic systems.

Kauffman&#x27;s work translates his biological findings to the mind-body problem and issues in neuroscience, proposing attributes of a new &quot;poised realm&quot; that hovers indefinitely between quantum coherence and classicality. He published on this topic in his paper &quot;Answering Descartes: beyond Turing&quot;. With Giuseppe Longo and Maël Montévil, he wrote (January 2012) &quot;No Entailing Laws, But Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere&quot;, which argued that evolution is not &quot;law entailed&quot; like physics.

Kauffman&#x27;s work is posted on Physics ArXiv, including &quot;Beyond the Stalemate: Mind/Body, Quantum Mechanics, Free Will, Possible Panpsychism, Possible Solution to the Quantum Enigma&quot; (October 2014) and &quot;Quantum Criticality at the Origin of Life&quot; (February 2015).

Kauffman has contributed to the emerging field of cumulative technological evolution by introducing a mathematics of the &quot;adjacent possible&quot;.

He has published over 350 articles and 6 books: &quot;The Origins of Order&quot; (1993), &quot;At Home in the Universe&quot; (1995), &quot;Investigations&quot; (2000), &quot;Reinventing the Sacred&quot; (2008), &quot;Humanity in a Creative Universe&quot; (2016), and &quot;A World Beyond Physics&quot; (2019).

In 2016, Kauffman wrote a children&#x27;s story, &quot;Patrick, Rupert, Sly &amp; Gus Protocells&quot;, a narrative about unprestatable niche creation in the biosphere, which was later produced as a short animated video.

In 2017, exploring the concept that reality consists of both ontologically real &quot;possibles&quot; (res potentia) and ontologically real &quot;actuals&quot; (res extensa), Kauffman co-authored, with Ruth Kastner and Michael Epperson, &quot;Taking Heisenberg&#x27;s Potentia Seriously&quot;.

<text>Albertville (; Arpitan: &quot;Arbèrtvile&quot;) is a subprefecture of the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Southeastern France. 
It is best known for hosting the 1992 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. In 2018, the commune had a population of 19,214; its urban area had 39,780 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Albertville is one of two subprefectures of the Savoie department, alongside Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne.

Albertville is situated on the river Arly, close to the confluence with the river Isère. Its altitude ranges from . Nearby mountains include: Belle Étoile, Dent de Cons, Négresse, Roche Pourrie, Mirantin, Pointe de la Grande Journée, Chaîne du Grand Arc. Nearby mountain ranges include the Bauges, the Beaufortain and the beginning of the Vanoise.

==History==
The modern city of Albertville was formed in 1836 by King Charles Albert of Sardinia, who merged the medieval town of Conflans, which had buildings dating to the 14th century, with the town of L&#x27;Hôpital. Since then, Albertville has fostered trade between France, Italy and Switzerland. Industries such as paper mills and hydroelectricity are found along its river.

The 1992 Winter Olympics were organised in the Savoie region, with Albertville hosting it. Some of the sports venues were later adapted for other uses. Some sports venues still remain, such as the ice rink, La halle de glace Olympique, designed by the architect Jacques Kalisz. Despite this, the town remains more industrial than touristic.

In 2003, the town was labelled a &quot;Town of Art and History&quot;.

<text>The Pont d&#x27;Arc (French &quot;pont&quot; = bridge) is a large natural bridge, located in the Ardèche &quot;département&quot; in the south of France, 5 km from the town of Vallon-Pont-d&#x27;Arc.

The arch, formed when the river Ardèche broke through a narrow escarpment between its meander, is wide and high at the top of the opening. It is a very popular canoeing and kayaking area and is heavily visited by tourists. It is usually described as the natural entrance to the Ardèche Canyon.

In the near vicinity of the arch is the Chauvet-Pont-d&#x27;Arc Cave, containing one of the earliest known Paleolithic cave paintings, about 30,000 years old (featured in the 3D documentary &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot; by film director Werner Herzog).

<text>Montparnasse () is an area in the south of Paris, France, on the left bank of the river Seine, centred at the crossroads of the Boulevard du Montparnasse and the Rue de Rennes, between the Rue de Rennes and boulevard Raspail. It is split between the 6th, 14th, and 15th arrondissements of the city. Montparnasse has been part of Paris 

The area also gives its name to:

* Gare Montparnasse: trains to Brittany, TGV to Rennes, Tours, Bordeaux, Le Mans; rebuilt as a modern TGV station;
* The large Montparnasse – Bienvenüe métro station;
* Cimetière du Montparnasse: the Montparnasse Cemetery, where, among other celebrities, Charles Baudelaire, Constantin Brâncuși, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Man Ray, Samuel Beckett, Serge Gainsbourg and Susan Sontag are buried;
* Tour Montparnasse, a lone skyscraper.

Students in the 17th century who came to recite poetry in the hilly neighbourhood nicknamed it after &quot;Mount Parnassus&quot;, home to the nine Muses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology. The hill was levelled to construct the Boulevard Montparnasse in the 18th century. During the French Revolution many dance halls and cabarets opened their doors, becoming gathering points for artists. The area is also known for cafés and bars, such as the Breton restaurants specialising in crêpes (thin pancakes) located a few blocks from the Gare Montparnasse. The Pasteur Institute is located in the area. Beneath the ground are tunnels of the Catacombs of Paris.

==Artistic hub==

In the 18th century, students recited poems at the foot of an artificial hillock of rock rubble from the Catacombs of Paris. Ironically, they decided to baptise this mound &quot;Mount Parnassus&quot;, named after the Mount Parnassus celebrated in Ancient Greek literature. In the early 20th century, many Bretons who were driven out of their region by poverty arrived by train at Gare Montparnasse, in the heart of the Montparnasse district, and settled nearby. Montparnasse became famous in the Roaring Twenties, referred to as &quot;les Années Folles&quot; (the Crazy Years), and the 1930s as the heart of intellectual and artistic life in Paris. From 1910 to the start of World War II, Paris&#x27; artistic circles migrated to Montparnasse as the alternative to the Montmartre district which had been the intellectual breeding ground for the previous generation of artists. The Paris of Charles Baudelaire, Robert de Montesquiou, Zola, Manet, France, Degas, Fauré typically indulged in the Bohemianism cultural refinements of Dandyism.

The cultural scene during the late-1920s for expatriates in Montparnasse and the 6th arrondissement is described in John Glassco&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;Memoirs of Montparnasse&quot;. Virtually penniless painters, sculptors, writers, poets and composers came from around the world to thrive in the creative atmosphere of Montparnasse and for the cheap rent at artist communes, such as La Ruche. Living without running water, in damp, unheated Ateliers, many sold their works for a few Francs just to buy food. Jean Cocteau once said that poverty was a luxury in Montparnasse. First promoted by art dealers such as Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, today works by those artists sell for millions of euros.


In post-World War I Paris, Montparnasse was a euphoric meeting place for the artistic world. Fernand Léger wrote of that period: &quot;man...relaxes and recaptures his taste for life, his frenzy to dance, to &quot;spend money&quot;...an explosion of &quot;life-force fills the world&quot;.&quot; They came to Montparnasse from all over the globe - from Europe, including Russia, Hungary and Ukraine, from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, and from as far away as Japan. Manuel Ortiz de Zárate, Camilo Mori and others made their way from Chile where the profound innovations in art spawned the formation of the Grupo Montparnasse in Santiago. A few of the other artists who gathered in Montparnasse were Jacob Macznik, Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire,Ossip Zadkine, Julio Gonzalez, Moise Kisling, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Marios Varvoglis, Marc Chagall, Nina Hamnett, Jean Rhys, Fernand Léger, Jacques Lipchitz, Max Jacob, Blaise Cendrars, Chaïm Soutine, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel, Michel Kikoine, Pinchus Kremegne, Amedeo Modigliani, Ford Madox Ford, Toño Salazar, Ezra Pound, Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti, Henri Rousseau, Constantin Brâncuși, Eva Kotchever, Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore, Paul Fort, Juan Gris, Diego Rivera, Federico Cantú, Angel Zarraga, Marevna, Tsuguharu Foujita, Marie Vassilieff, Léon-Paul Fargue, Alberto Giacometti, René Iché, André Breton, Alfonso Reyes, Pascin, Nils Dardel, Salvador Dalí, Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Emil Cioran, Reginald Gray, Endre Ady, Joan Miró, Hilaire Hiler and, in his declining years, Edgar Degas.

Montparnasse was a community where creativity was embraced with all its oddities, each new arrival welcomed unreservedly by its existing members. When Tsuguharu Foujita arrived from Japan in 1913 not knowing a soul, he met Chaïm Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani, Jules Pascin and Fernand Léger virtually the same night and within a week became friends with Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. In 1914, when the English painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse, on her first evening the smiling man at the next table at Café de la Rotonde graciously introduced himself as &quot;Modigliani, painter and Jew&quot;. They became good friends and Hamnett later recounting how she once borrowed a jersey and corduroy trousers from Modigliani, then went to La Rotonde and danced in the street all night.

Between 1921 and 1924, the number of Americans in Paris swelled from 6,000 to 30,000. While most of the artistic community gathered here were struggling to eke out an existence, well-heeled American socialites such as Peggy Guggenheim, and Edith Wharton from New York City, Harry Crosby from Boston and Beatrice Wood from San Francisco were caught in the fever of creativity. Robert McAlmon, and Maria and Eugene Jolas came to Paris and published their literary magazine &quot;Transition&quot;. Harry Crosby and his wife Caresse would establish the Black Sun Press in Paris in 1927, publishing works by such future luminaries as D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, James Joyce, Kay Boyle, Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, William Faulkner, Dorothy Parker and others. As well, Bill Bird published through his &quot;Three Mountains Press&quot; until British heiress Nancy Cunard took it over.

The cafés, bistros and bars of Montparnasse were a meeting place where cultural ideas and connections were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse&#x27;s night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. 

In Montparnasse&#x27;s heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés &quot;Le Dôme&quot;, &quot;Closerie des Lilas&quot;, &quot;La Rotonde&quot;, &quot;Le Select&quot;, and &quot;La Coupole&quot;—all of which are still in business—were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few &quot;centimes&quot;. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fueled by intellect, others by alcohol, and if there were fights (and there often were) the police were never summoned. If you could not pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde&#x27;s proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café&#x27;s walls were littered with a collection of artworks.

There were many areas where the artists congregated, one of them being near Le Dôme at no. 10 rue Delambre called the Dingo Bar. It was the hang-out of artists and ex-patriate Americans and the place where Canadian writer Morley Callaghan, who came with his friend Ernest Hemingway, both still unpublished writers, met the already-established writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. When Man Ray&#x27;s friend and Dadaist, Marcel Duchamp, left for New York City, Man Ray set up his first studio at l&#x27;Hôtel des Ecoles at no. 15 rue Delambre. This is where his career as a photographer began, and where James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Kiki of Montparnasse, Jean Cocteau and the others filed in and posed in black and white.

The &quot;rue de la Gaité&quot; in Montparnasse was the site of many of the great music-hall theatres, in particular the famous &quot;Bobino&quot;.
On their stages, using then-popular single name pseudonyms or one birth name only, Damia, Kiki, Mayol and Georgius, sang and performed to packed houses. And here too, Les Six was formed, creating music based on the ideas of Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau.

The poet Max Jacob said he came to Montparnasse to &quot;sin disgracefully&quot;, but Marc Chagall summed it up differently when he explained why he had gone to Montparnasse: &quot;I aspired to see with my own eyes what I had heard of from so far away: this revolution of the eye, this rotation of colours, which spontaneously and astutely merge with one another in a flow of conceived lines. That could not be seen in my town. The sun of Art then shone only on Paris.&quot;

While the area attracted people who came to live and work in the creative, bohemian environment, it also became home for political exiles such as Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Porfirio Diaz, and Simon Petlyura. But, World War II forced the dispersal of the artistic society, and after the war Montparnasse never regained its splendour. Wealthy socialites like Peggy Guggenheim, an art collector who married artist Max Ernst, lived in the Hôtel Lutetia and frequented the artist studios of Montparnasse, acquiring pieces that would come to be recognized as masterpieces now in the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, Italy.

The Musée du Montparnasse opened in 1998 at 21 Avenue du Maine and closed in 2015. Although operating with a tiny city grant, the museum was a non-profit operation. The Gallery of Montparnasse was one of the first to introduce abstract expressionism in France in the 1940s, and still holds contemporary art exhibitions today.

==Economy==
SNCF, the French rail company, has its head office in Montparnasse near the 14th arrondissement.

Prior to the completion of the current Air France head office in Tremblay-en-France in December 1995, Air France had its headquarters in a tower located next to the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Montparnasse and in the 15th arrondissement; Air France had its headquarters in the tower for about 30 years.

==Education==
The Vandamme Library (Bibliothèque Vandamme) is located in the neighbourhood.

<text>An auction is usually a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bids, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder or buying the item from the lowest bidder. Some exceptions to this definition exist and are described in the section about different types. The branch of economic theory dealing with auction types and participants&#x27; behavior in auctions is called auction theory.

The open ascending price auction is arguably the most common form of auction and has been used throughout history. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid being higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, while bidders submit bids vocally or electronically.

Auctions are applied for trade in diverse contexts. These contexts include antiques, paintings, rare collectibles, expensive wines, commodities, livestock, radio spectrum, used cars, real estate, online advertising, vacation packages, emission trading, and many more.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;auction&quot; is derived from &quot;auctus&quot;, the past participle of the Latin verb &quot;&quot;, (&quot;I increase&quot;).

==History==
===Classical antiquity===

Auctions have been recorded as early as 500 BC. According to Herodotus, in Babylon, auctions of women for marriage were held annually. The auctions began with the woman the auctioneer considered to be the most beautiful and progressed to the least beautiful. It was considered illegal to allow a daughter to be sold outside of the auction method. Attractive maidens were offered in a forward auction to determine the price to be paid by a swain, while unattractive maidens required a reverse auction to determine the price to be paid to a swain.

Auctions took place in Ancient Greece, other Hellenistic societies, and also in Rome. During the Roman Empire, after a military victory, Roman soldiers would often drive a spear into the ground around which the spoils of war were left, to be auctioned off. Slaves, often captured as the &quot;spoils of war&quot;, were auctioned in the Forum under the sign of the spear, with the proceeds of sale going toward the war effort.

The Romans also used auctions to liquidate the assets of debtors whose property had been confiscated. For example, Marcus Aurelius sold household furniture to pay off debts, the sales lasting for months. One of the most significant historical auctions was in 193 AD, when the entire Roman Empire was put on the auction block by the Praetorian Guard. On 28 March 193, the Praetorian Guard first killed emperor Pertinax, then offered the empire to the highest bidder. Didius Julianus won the auction at the price of 6,250 drachmas per guard, an act that initiated a brief civil war. Didius was beheaded two months later when Septimius Severus conquered Rome.

From the end of the Roman Empire to the 18th century, auctions lost favor in Europe, while they had never been widespread in Asia. In China, the personal belongings of deceased Buddhist monks were sold at auction as early as the seventh century AD.

===Modern revival===
The first mention of &quot;auction&quot;, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, appeared in 1595. In some parts of England during the 17th and 18th centuries, auctions by candle began to be used for the sale of goods and leaseholds. In a candle auction, the end of the auction was signaled by the expiration of a candle flame, which was intended to ensure that no one could know exactly when the auction would end and make a last-second bid. Sometimes, other unpredictable events, such as a footrace, were used instead of the expiration of a candle. This type of auction was first mentioned in 1641 in the records of the House of Lords. The practice rapidly became popular, and in 1660 Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary recorded two occasions when the Admiralty sold surplus ships &quot;by an inch of candle&quot;. Pepys also relates a hint from a highly successful bidder who had observed that, just before expiring, a candle-wick always flares up slightly: on seeing this, he would shout his final – and winning – bid.

The &quot;London Gazette&quot; began reporting on the auctioning of artwork in the coffeehouses and taverns of London in the late 17th century.
The first known auction house in the world was the Stockholm Auction House, Sweden (&quot;Stockholms Auktionsverk&quot;), founded by Baron Claes Rålamb in 1674. Sotheby&#x27;s, currently the world&#x27;s second-largest auction house, was founded in London on 11 March 1744, when Samuel Baker presided over the disposal of &quot;several hundred scarce and valuable&quot; books from the library of an acquaintance. Christie&#x27;s, now the world&#x27;s largest auction house, was founded by James Christie in 1766 in London and published its first auction catalog that year, although newspaper advertisements of Christie&#x27;s sales dating from 1759 have been found.

Other early auction houses that are still in operation include Göteborgs Auktionsverk (1681), Dorotheum (1707), Uppsala auktionskammare (1731), Mallams (1788), Bonhams (1793), Phillips de Pury &amp; Company (1796), Freeman&#x27;s (1805) and Lyon &amp; Turnbull (1826).

By the end of the 18th century, auctions of art works were commonly held in taverns and coffeehouses. These auctions were held daily, and auction catalogs were printed to announce available items. In some cases, these catalogs were elaborate works of art themselves, containing considerable detail about the items being auctioned. At the time, Christie&#x27;s established a reputation as a leading auction house, taking advantage of London&#x27;s status as the major centre of the international art trade after the French Revolution. The Great Slave Auction took place in 1859 and is recorded as the second largest single sale of enslaved people in U.S. history — with 436 men, women and children being sold. During the American Civil War, goods seized by armies were sold at auction by the Colonel of the division. Thus, some of today&#x27;s auctioneers in the U.S. carry the unofficial title of &quot;colonel&quot;. Tobacco auctioneers in the southern United States in the late 19th century had a style that mixed traditions of 17th century England with chants of slaves from Africa.

===Rise of the internet===
The development of the internet has led to a significant rise in the use of auctions, as auctioneers can solicit bids via the internet from a wide range of buyers in a much larger variety of commodities than was previously practical. 
In the 1990s, the multi-attribute auction was invented to negotiate extensive conditions of construction and electricity contracts via auction. Also during this time, OnSale.com developed the Yankee auction as its trademark. In the early 2000s, the Brazilian auction was invented as a new type of auction to trade gas through electronic auctions for Linde plc in Brazil.
With the emergence of the internet, online auctions have developed, with eBay being the most typical example. For example, if someone owns a rare item, they can display the item through an online auction platform. Interested parties may place bids, with the highest bidder winning the opportunity to purchase the item. Online auctions allow more people to participate and also make traditional auction theory more complex.

==Economic significance==
By increasing visibility of an item and therefore demand, auctions can make an extremely rare item more likely to sell for a higher price.

In 2008, the US National Auctioneers Association reported that the gross revenue of the auction industry for that year was approximately $268.4 billion, with the fastest growing sectors being agricultural, machinery, equipment, and residential real estate auctions.

The auctions with the largest revenue for the government are often spectrum auctions (typical revenue is estimated in billions of euros) and quota auctions. In 2019, Russia&#x27;s crab quota was auctioned for €2 billion. Between 1999 and 2002, the British government auctioned off their gold reserves, raising approximately $3.5 billion.

The most expensive item to ever be sold in an auction is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; in 2017 ($450.3 million).

In 2018, the yearly revenues of the two biggest auction houses were $5 billion (Christie&#x27;s) and $4 billion (Sotheby&#x27;s).

==Types==

Auctions come in a variety of types and categories, which are sometimes not mutually exclusive. Typification of auctions is considered to be a part of Auction theory. The economists Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for the introduction of new auction types (or formats). Auction types share features, which can be summarized into the following list.

===Participants=== 

Auctions can differ in the number and type of participants. There are two types of participants: a buyer and a seller. A buyer pays to acquire a certain good or service, while a seller offers goods or services for money or barter exchange. There can be single or multiple buyers and single or multiple sellers in an auction. If just one seller and one buyer are participating, the process is not considered to be an auction. 

The forward auction is the most common type of auction — a seller offers item(s) for sale and expects the highest price. A reverse auction is a type of auction in which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary objective to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions and buyer-determined auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers&#x27; offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. A reverse price auction is not necessarily &#x27;descending-price&#x27; — the reverse Dutch auction is an ascending-price auction because forward Dutch auctions are descending. By revealing the competing bids in real-time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote &quot;information transparency&quot;. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.

A double auction is a combination of both forward and reverse auctions. A Walrasian auction or &quot;Walrasian tâtonnement&quot; is a double auction in which the auctioneer takes bids from both buyers and sellers in a market of multiple goods. The auctioneer progressively either raises or drops the current proposed price depending on the bids of both buyers and sellers, the auction concluding when supply and demand exactly balance. As a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price somewhere in the middle where supply and demand will match. A Barter double auction is an auction where every participant has a demand and an offer consisting of multiple attributes and no money is involved. For the mathematical modelling of satisfaction level, Euclidean distance is used, where the offer and demand are treated as vectors.

===Price development===
Auctions can be categorized into three types of procedures for auctions depending on the occurrence of a price development during an auction run and its causes.

====Driven by bidders only====

* English auction, also known as an &quot;open ascending price auction&quot;. This type of auction is arguably the most common form of auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In some cases a maximum bid might be left with the auctioneer, who may bid on behalf of the bidder according to the bidder&#x27;s instructions. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which point the highest bidder pays their bid. Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance (the &#x27;reserve&#x27; price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item will remain unsold. Sometimes the auctioneer sets a minimum amount, sometimes known as a bidding increment, by which the next bid must exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to potential bidders, although at that time there may be higher absentee bids held by the auctioneer which are not known to potential bidders. The English auction is commonly used for selling goods, most prominently antiques and artwork, but also secondhand goods and real estate.
* Auction by the candle. A type of auction, used in England for selling ships, in which the highest bid laid on the table wins after a burning candle goes out.
* Scottish auction is an auction where all bidding should be completed within a certain time interval, which allows bidders an appropriate amount of time for consideration and avoids precipitate actions.

====Partially driven by time====

* Dutch auction also known as an &quot;open descending price auction&quot;. In the traditional Dutch auction the auctioneer begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is willing to accept the auctioneer&#x27;s price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller&#x27;s reserve price is met. If the first bidder does not purchase the entire lot, the auctioneer continues lowering the price until all of the items have been bid for or the reserve price is reached. Items are allocated based on bid order; the highest bidder selects their item(s) first followed by the second highest bidder, etc. In a modification, all of the winning participants pay only the last announced price for the items that they bid on. The Dutch auction is named for its best known example, the Dutch tulip auctions. (&quot;Dutch auction&quot; is also sometimes used to describe online auctions where several identical goods are sold simultaneously to an equal number of high bidders). In addition to cut flower sales in the Netherlands, Dutch auctions have also been used for perishable commodities such as fish and tobacco. The Dutch auction is not widely used, except in market orders in stock or currency exchanges, which are functionally identical.
* Japanese auction is a variation of the Dutch auction with a low initial price that increases over time. As the price rises, participants must either signal intent to continue bidding or drop out of the auction, and no participant may enter or re-enter the auction once it has begun. Once only one participant remains in the auction, the auction ends and that participant wins the item at the current price. It has similarities to the ante in Poker.

====Single shot====
* , or a sealed-bid first-price auction/blind auction, is a type of auction where all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays the price they submitted. This type of auction is distinct from the English auction, in that bidders can only submit one bid each. Furthermore, as bidders cannot see the bids of other participants they cannot adjust their own bids accordingly. From the theoretical perspective, this kind of bid process has been argued to be strategically equivalent to the Dutch auction. However, empirical evidence from laboratory experiments has shown that Dutch auctions with high clock speeds yield lower prices than FPSB auctions. What are effectively sealed first-price auctions are commonly called &quot;tendering&quot; for procurement by companies and organisations, particularly for government contracts and auctions for mining leases.
* Vickrey auction, also known as a sealed-bid second-price auction. This is identical to the sealed first-price auction except that the winning bidder pays the second-highest bid rather than their own. Vickrey auctions are extremely important in auction theory, and commonly used in automated contexts such as real-time bidding for online advertising, but rarely in non-automated contexts.

===Properties of auctioned goods===

Multiunit auctions sell more than one identical item at a time, rather than having separate auctions for each. This type can be further classified as either a uniform price auction or a discriminatory price auction. An example for them is spectrum auctions.

A combinatorial auction is any auction for the simultaneous sale of more than one item where bidders can place bids on an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; basis on &quot;packages&quot; rather than just individual items. That is, a bidder can specify that they will pay for items A and B, but only if they get &quot;both&quot;. In combinatorial auctions, determining the winning bidder(s) can be a complex process where even the bidder with the highest individual bid is not guaranteed to win. For example, in an auction with four items (W, X, Y and Z), if Bidder A offers $50 for items W &amp; Y, Bidder B offers $30 for items W &amp; X, Bidder C offers $5 for items X &amp; Z and Bidder D offers $30 for items Y &amp; Z, the winners will be Bidders B &amp; D while Bidder A misses out because the &quot;combined&quot; bids of Bidders B &amp; D is higher ($60) than for Bidders A and C ($55). Deferred-acceptance auction is a special case of a combinatorial auction.

Another special case of a combinatorial auction is the combinatorial clock auction (CCA), which combines a clock auction, during which bidders may provide their confirmations in response to the rising prices, with a subsequantial sealed bid auction, in which bidders submit sealed package bids. The auctioneer uses the final bids to compute the best value allocation and the Vickrey payments.

Generalized first-price auctions and Generalized second-price auctions offer slots for multiple bidders instead of making a single deal. The bidders get the slots according to the ranking of their bids. The second-price ruling is derived from the Vickrey auction and means the final deal sealing for the number one bidder is based on the second bidder&#x27;s price.

===Reserve price===

A No-reserve auction (NR), also known as an &quot;absolute auction&quot;, is an auction in which the item for sale will be sold regardless of price. From the seller&#x27;s perspective, advertising an auction as having no reserve price can be desirable because it potentially attracts a greater number of bidders due to the possibility of a bargain. If more bidders attend the auction, a higher price might ultimately be achieved because of heightened competition from bidders. This contrasts with a &quot;reserve auction&quot;, where the item for sale may not be sold if the final bid is not high enough to satisfy the seller. In practice, an auction advertised as &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;no-reserve&quot; may nonetheless still not sell to the highest bidder on the day, for example, if the seller withdraws the item from the auction or extends the auction period indefinitely, although these practices may be restricted by law in some jurisdictions or under the terms of sale available from the auctioneer.

A reserve auction is an auction where the item for sale may not be sold if the final bid is not high enough to satisfy the seller; that is, the seller &quot;reserves&quot; the right to accept or reject the highest bid. In these cases, a set &#x27;reserve&#x27; price known to the auctioneer, but not necessarily to the bidders, may have been set, below which the item may not be sold. If the seller announces to the bidders the reserve price, it is a public reserve price auction. In contrast, if the seller does not announce the reserve price before the sale, it is a secret reserve price auction. However, potential bidders may be able to deduce an approximate reserve price, if one exists at all, from any estimate given in advance by the auction house. The reserve price may be &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;discretionary&quot;. In the latter case, the decision to accept a bid is deferred to the auctioneer, who may accept a bid that is marginally below it. A reserve auction is safer for the seller than a no-reserve auction as they are not required to accept a low bid, but this could result in a lower final price if less interest is generated in the sale.

===Price of bidding===

An all-pay auction is an auction in which all bidders must pay their bids regardless of whether they win. The highest bidder wins the item. All-pay auctions are primarily of academic interest, and may be used to model lobbying or bribery (bids are political contributions) or competitions such as a running race. Bidding fee auction, a variation of all-pay auction, also known as a penny auction, often requires that each participant must pay a fixed price to place each bid, typically one penny (hence the name) higher than the current bid. When an auction&#x27;s time period expires, the highest bidder wins the item and must pay a final bid price. Unlike in a conventional auction, the final price is typically much lower than the value of the item, but all bidders (not just the winner) will have paid for each bid placed; the winner will buy the item at a very low price (plus price of rights-to-bid used), all the losers will have paid, and the seller will typically receive significantly more than the value of the item. A senior auction is a variation on the all-pay auction, and has a defined loser in addition to the winner. The top two bidders must pay their full final bid amounts, and only the highest wins the auction. The intent is to make the high bidders bid above their upper limits. In the final rounds of bidding, when the current losing party has hit their maximum bid, they are encouraged to bid over their maximum (seen as a small loss) to avoid losing their maximum bid with no return (a very large loss). Another variation of all-pay auction, the top-up auction is primarily used for charity events. Losing bidders must pay the difference between their bid and the next lowest bid. The winning bidder pays the amount bid for the item, without top-up. In a Chinese auction, bidders make sealed bids in advance and their probability of winning grows with the relative size of their bids.

===Structure of a bid===

In usual auctions like the English one, bids are prices. In Dutch and Japanese auctions, the bids are confirmations. In a version of the Brazilian auction, bids are numbers of units being traded. Structure elements of a bid are called attributes. If a bid is one number like price, it is a single-attribute auction. If bids consists of multiple-attributes, it is a multi-attribute auction.

A Yankee auction is a single-attribute multiunit auction running like a Dutch auction, where the bids are the portions of a total amount of identical units. The amount of auctioned items is firm in a Yankee auction unlike a Brazilian auction. The portions of the total amount, bidders can bid, are limited to lower numbers than the total amount. Therefore, only a portion of the total amount will be traded for the best price and the rest to the suboptimal prices.

===Visibility of bids===

In an English auction, all current bids are visible to all bidders and in a sealed-bid auction, bidders only get to know if their bid was the best. Best/not best auctions are sealed-bid auctions with multiple bids, where the bidders submit their prices like in English auction and get responses about the leadership of their bid. Rank auction is an extension of best/not best auction, where the bidders also see the rank of their bids. Traffic-light auction shows traffic lights to bidders as a response to their bids. These traffic lights depend on the position of the last bid in the distribution of all bids.

===Buyout option===

A buyout auction is an auction with an additional set price (the &#x27;buyout&#x27; price) that any bidder can accept at any time during the auction, thereby immediately ending the auction and winning the item. This means that if an item offers its buyout price at the beginning, one participant can stop all other potential participants from bidding at all, or stop the bidding process before the bid price has reached the buyout price. If no bidder chooses to utilize the buyout option before the end of bidding, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid. Buyout options can be either &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;permanent&quot;. In a temporary-buyout auction the option to buy out the auction is not available after the first bid is placed. In a permanent-buyout auction the buyout option remains available throughout the entire auction until the close of bidding. The buyout price can either remain the same throughout the entire auction, or vary throughout according to rules or simply as decided by the seller.

===Winner selection===

The winner selection in most auctions selects the best bid. Unique bid auctions offer a special winner selection: the winner is the bidder with the lowest unique bid. The Chinese auction selects a winner partially based on randomness.

The final price for the selected winner is not always conducted according to their final bid. In the case of the second-price ruling as in a Vickrey auction, the final price for the winner is based on the second bidder&#x27;s price. A Proxy bid is a special case of second-price ruling used by eBay, where a predefined increment is added to the second highest bid in response to a yet higher bid.

Auctions with more than one winner are called multi-winner auctions. Multiunit auction, Combinatorial auction, Generalized first-price auction and Generalized second-price auction are multi-winner auctions.

===Cascading===

Auctions can be cascaded, one after the other. For instance, an Amsterdam auction is a type of premium auction which begins as an English auction. Once only two bidders remain, each submits a sealed bid. The higher bidder wins, paying either the first or second price. Both finalists receive a premium: a proportion of the excess of the second price over the third price (at which English auction ended). An Anglo-Dutch auction starts as an English or Japanese auction and then continues as a Dutch auction with a reduced number of bidders. A French auction is a preliminary sealed-bid auction before the actual auction, whose reserve price it determines. A sequential auction is an auction where the bidders can participate in a sequence of auctions. A Calcutta auction is a subtype of sequential auction, where the ordering in the sequence is determined by random. A simultaneous ascending auction is an opposite of a sequential auction, where the auctions are run in parallel.

===Other features===

The is a variant of the English auction in which bids are written on a sheet of paper. At the predetermined end of the auction, the highest listed bidder wins the item. This auction is often used in charity events, with many items auctioned simultaneously and &quot;closed&quot; at a common finish time. The auction is &quot;silent&quot; in that there is no auctioneer selling individual items; the bidders write their bids on a bidding sheet often left on a table near the item. At charity auctions, bid sheets usually have a fixed starting amount, predetermined bid increments, and a &quot;guaranteed bid&quot; amount which works the same as a &quot;buy now&quot; amount. Other variations of this type of auction may include sealed bids. The highest bidder pays the price they submitted.

In private value auctions, every bidder has their own valuation of the auctioned good. A common value auction is opposite, where the valuation of the auctioned good is identical among the bidders.

==Contexts==

The range of auctions&#x27; contexts is extremely wide and one can buy almost anything, from a house to an endowment policy and everything in between. Some of the recent developments have been the use of the Internet both as a means of disseminating information about various auctions and as a vehicle for hosting auctions themselves.

===Human commodity auctions===
As already mentioned in the history section, auctions have been used to trade commodified people from the very first. Auctions have been used in slave markets throughout history until modern times in the post-Gaddafi era Libya. The word for slave auction in the Atlantic slave trade was scramble. A child auction is a Swedish and Finnish historical practice of selling children into slavery-like conditions by authorities using a descending English auction. Fattigauktion is a similar Swedish practice involving poor people being auctioned to church organizations. Trade of wives by auctions was also a common practice throughout history. For instance, in the old English custom of wife selling, a wife was divorced by selling her in a public auction for the highest bid. ISIS conducted slave auctions to sell up to 7,000 Yazidi women as reported in 2020.

A virginity auction is the voluntary practice of individuals seeking to sell their own virginity to the highest bid. Cricket players are routinely put up for auction, whereby cricket teams can bid for their services. Indian Premier League (IPL) started annual public auctioning of cricket players in 2008 as an entertainment for mass consumption. Also, Bangladesh Premier League conducts cricket player auctions, starting in 2012.

===Real estate auctions===
In some countries, such as Australia, auctioning is a common method for the sale of real estate. Auctions were traditionally used as an alternative to the private sale/treaty method to sell property that, due to their unique characteristics, were difficult to determine a price for. The law does not require a vendor to disclose their reserve price prior to the auction. During the 1990s and 2000s, auctions became the primary method for the sale of real estate in the two largest cities, Melbourne and Sydney. This was largely due to the fact that in a private sale the vendor has disclosed the price that they want, and potential purchasers would attempt to low-ball the price, whereas in an auction purchasers do not know what the vendor wants, and thus need to keep lifting the price until the reserve price is reached.

The method has been the subject of increased controversy during the twenty-first century as house prices sky-rocketed. The rapidly rising housing market saw many homes, especially in Victoria and New South Wales, selling for significantly more than both the vendors&#x27; reserve price and the advertised price range. Subsequently, the auction systems&#x27; lack of transparency about the value of the property was brought into question, with estate agents and their vendor clients being accused of &quot;under-quoting&quot;. Significant attention was given to the matter by the Australian media, with the government in Victoria eventually bowing to pressure and implementing changes to legislation in an effort to increase transparency.

In the UK, historically, auction houses were perceived to sell properties which may have been where a home owner fails to make regular mortgage or were probate sales family home being sold by the heirs). However, more recently, selling at auction has become an alternative to a normal property sale, due to the speedy nature of the entire process.

In China, land auctions are under the sole control of local government officials. Because some developers may use bribes to please government officials to obtain the right to purchase the land, the central government requires that future land auctions be conducted using a spectrum auction in order to prevent the spread of corruption. Although this method cannot completely solve the problem of corruption, it is still a significant contribution to the auction.

===Auctions by authorities===
A government auction is simply an auction held on behalf of a government body generally at a general sale. Items for sale are often surplus needed to be liquidated. Auctions ordered by estate executors enter the assets of individuals who have perhaps died intestate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. In legal contexts where forced auctions occur, as when one&#x27;s farm or house is sold at auction on the courthouse steps. Property seized for non-payment of property taxes, or under foreclosure, is sold in this manner. Police auctions are generally held at general auctions, although some forces use online sites including eBay, to dispose of lost and found and seized goods. Debt auctions, in which governments issue and sell debt obligations, such as bonds, to investors. The auction is usually sealed and the uniform price paid by the investors is typically the best non-winning bid. In most cases, investors can also place so-called &quot;non-competitive bids&quot;, which indicates interest to purchase the debt obligation at the resulting price, whatever it may be. Some states use courts to run such auctions. In spectrum auctions conducted by the government, companies purchase licenses to use portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for communications (e.g., mobile phone networks). In certain jurisdictions, if a storage facility&#x27;s tenant fails to pay rent, the contents of their locker(s) may be sold at a public auction. Several television shows focus on such auctions, including &quot;Storage Wars&quot; and &quot;Auction Hunters&quot;.

===Commodity auctions===

Auctions are used to trade commodities; for example, fish wholesale auctions. In wool auctions, wool is traded in the international market. The wine auction business offers serious collectors an opportunity to gain access to rare bottles and mature vintages, which are not typically available through retail channels. In livestock auctions, sheep, cattle, pigs and other livestock are sold. Sometimes very large numbers of stock are auctioned, such as the regular sales of 50,000 or more sheep during a day in New South Wales. In timber auctions, companies purchase licenses to log on government land. In timber allocation auctions, companies purchase timber directly from the government. In electricity auctions, large-scale generators and distributors of electricity bid on generating contracts. Produce auctions link growers to localized wholesale buyers (buyers who are interested in acquiring large quantities of locally grown produce).

===Online auctions===

Online auctions are a form of E-commerce that relies on the advantages of a digital platform&#x27;s ability to overcome geographical constraints, provide real-time information and reduce transaction costs, bringing greater convenience to people and allowing more people to participate as bidders, as well as being able to view a greater selection of auctions. Websites like eBay provide a potential market of millions of bidders to sellers. Established auction houses, as well as specialist internet auctions, sell many things online, from antiques and collectibles to holidays, air travel, brand new computers, and household equipment. Private electronic markets use combinatorial auction techniques to continuously sell commodities (coal, iron ore, grain, water, etc.) online to a pre-qualified group of buyers (based on price and non-price factors). Furthermore, online auctions facilitate the process for prospective bidders to discover and evaluate items by enabling searches across numerous auctions and employing filters to refine their selections.

On the other hand, an alternative perspective suggests that the format of online auctions could also give rise to collusive conduct and other types of market manipulation, potentially skewing the market and diminishing its efficiency. Firstly, online auctions might enable bidders to obscure their identities, such as utilizing pseudonyms or multiple accounts to maintain anonymity. This concealment could simplify collusion without detection. Secondly, online auctions might ease the implementation of collusive arrangements among bidders. The accessibility of bidding data in online auctions, for instance, allows colluding bidders to monitor each other&#x27;s bids, guarantee adherence to their agreements, and penalize non-compliance. This enhanced oversight capacity strengthens the stability of collusive agreements.

===Unique item auctions===
* Motor vehicle and car auctions – Here one can buy anything from an accident-damaged car to a brand new top-of-the-range model; from a run-of-the-mill family saloon to a rare collector&#x27;s item.
* Antiques and collectibles auctions give an opportunity for viewing a huge array of items. The sale of collectibles includes items such as stamps, coins, vintage toys &amp; trains, classic cars, and fine art. 
* On-site auctions – Sometimes when the stock or assets of a company are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to transport to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction within the confines of the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still plugged in, and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as they can do it or at least supervise the activity.
* Second-hand goods – For the sale of consumer second-hand goods of all kinds, particularly farm (equipment) and house clearances and online auctions.
* Sale of industrial machinery, both surplus or through insolvency.
* Thoroughbred horses, where yearling horses and other bloodstock are auctioned.
* Travel tickets – One example is SJ AB in Sweden auctioning surplus at Tradera (Swedish eBay).
* Holidays – A variety of holidays are available for sale online particularly via eBay. Vacation rentals appear to be the most common. Many holiday auction websites have launched but failed.
* Mystery auction – An auction where bidders bid for boxes or envelopes containing unspecified or underspecified items, usually on the hope that the items will be humorous, interesting, or valuable. In the early days of eBay&#x27;s popularity, sellers began promoting boxes or packages of random and usually low-value items not worth selling by themselves.
* Some rare CryptoKitties, which are tokens representing virtual cats, have been sold over automated blockchain auctions for more than $200,000.

===Other contexts===
* Charity auctions – Used by nonprofits, higher education, and religious institutions as a method to raise funds for a specific mission or cause both through the act of bidding itself, and by encouraging participants to support the cause and make personal donations. Often, these auctions are linked with another charity event like a benefit concert.
* Insurance policies – Auctions are held for second-hand endowment policies. The attraction is that someone else has already paid substantially to set up the policy in the first place, and one will be able (with the help of a financial calculator) to calculate its real worth and decide whether it is worth taking on. Lloyd&#x27;s, the world&#x27;s reinsurance market, runs auctions of syndicate capacity for the underwriting.
* Private treaty sales – Occasionally, when looking at an auction catalog some of the items have been withdrawn. Usually, these goods have been sold by &#x27;private treaty&#x27;. This means that the goods have already been sold off, usually to a trader or dealer on a private, behind-the-scenes basis before they have had a chance to be offered at the auction sale. These goods are rarely in single lots – photocopiers or fax machines would generally be sold in bulk lots.
* Environmental auctions, in which companies bid for licenses to avoid being required to decrease their environmental impact. These include auctions in emissions trading schemes.

==Bidding strategy==
===By the bidders===

Katehakis and Puranam provided the first model
for the problem of optimal bidding for a firm that in each period procures items to meet a random demand by participating in a finite sequence of auctions. In this model an item valuation derives from the sale of the acquired items via their demand distribution, sale price, acquisition cost, salvage value and lost sales. They established monotonicity properties for the value function and the optimal dynamic bid policy. They also provided a model
for the case in which the buyer must acquire a fixed number of items either at a fixed buy-it-now price in the open market or by participating in a sequence of auctions. The objective of the buyer is to minimize their expected total cost for acquiring the fixed number of items.

During an auction, the seller might possess more comprehensive knowledge regarding the item on offer compared to the buyer, creating an information asymmetry. This lack of information could lead the bidder to overvalue the item and consequently pay a higher price, resulting in the winner&#x27;s curse. Nevertheless, bidders may also choose to employ bid shading as a strategy to circumvent this predicament. Bid shading is placing a bid which is below the bidder&#x27;s actual value for the item. Such a strategy risks losing the auction but has the possibility of winning at a low price. Bid shading can also be a strategy to avoid the winner&#x27;s curse. In either case, the allocation of resources may be inefficient, as the product will not ultimately be acquired by the individual who values it the most. Instead, it will go to the person who either overvalues it the most or effectively employs bid shading.

Auction cancellation hunters bid minimal amounts on multiple auctions and expect them to be cancelled. If an auction is cancelled by the seller, they will claim for damages in the amount of the difference between the maximum bid at the time of the auction cancellation and the price of a replacement purchase of the offered item in the auction, when the market is in equilibrium, even if the seller has not sold any of the items, the shadow of bidding still exists. This is the self-protection instinct of the auction market. In order to make this transaction fairer. Auction sniping is the practice of placing a bid at the last moment of the auction. According to the analysis of auction data from eBay, in general, experienced bidders are more likely to snipe in auctions, and those who snipe in auctions are more likely to win. Jump bidding is an aggressive tactic of increasing every bid by high amounts. Calor licitantis is also known as &quot;auction fever&quot; and describes the irrational behavior of bidders at auctions. Suicide bidding is practice in reverse auctions, whereby a bidder submits a bid, which ends up in a loss for this bidder.

====Collusion====
Whenever bidders at an auction are aware of the identity of the other bidders there is a risk that they will form a &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;pool&quot; and thus manipulate the auction result, a practice known as collusion or more specially bid-rigging. By agreeing to bid only against outsiders, never against members of the &quot;ring&quot;, competition becomes weaker, which may dramatically affect the final price level. After the end of the official auction, an unofficial auction may take place among the &quot;ring&quot; members. The difference in price between the two auctions could then be split among the members. This form of a ring was used as a central plot device in the opening episode of the 1979 British television series &quot;The House of Caradus&quot;, &#x27;For Love or Money&#x27;, uncovered by Helena Caradus on her return from Paris.

In the UK, this auction practice is illegal. It jeopardizes competition on the auction and can demotivate other bidders from participating. It robs the seller of the true value of their good and reduces the auctioneer&#x27;s commission.

Beyond explicit collusion, a tacit coordination of bidders to keep bids low is at least theoretically possible. In case of spectrum auctions, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) experimented with precautions restricting visibility of bids, limiting the number of bids, click-box bidding, and anonymous bidding in order to prevent bidders from signalling bidding information by embedding it into digits of the bids. Actions within the auction mechanism serve as a communication channel for collusive behavior, once no other channels are legal.

===By the auctioneer===
====Chandelier or rafter bidding====
This is the practice, especially by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial times in the bidding in order to create the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix their gaze at a point in the auction room that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry. In the United States, chandelier bidding is not illegal. In fact, an auctioneer may bid up the price of an item to the reserve price, which is a threshold below which the consignor may refuse to sell the item. However, the auction house is required to disclose this information.

In the United Kingdom this practice is legal on property auctions up to but not including the reserve price, and is also known as off-the-wall bidding.

====Collusion involving auctioneer====
A ring can also be used to increase the price of an auction lot, in which the owner of the object being auctioned may increase competition by taking part in the bidding themself, but drop out of the bidding just before the final bid. This form of a ring was used as a central plot device in an episode of the British television series &quot;Lovejoy&quot; (series 4, episode 3), in which the price of a watercolour by the (fictional) Jessie Webb is inflated so that others by the same artist could be sold for more than their purchase price. In an English auction, a dummy bid is a bid made by a dummy bidder acting in collusion with the auctioneer or vendor, designed to deceive genuine bidders into paying more. In a first-price auction, a dummy bid is an unfavourable bid designed so as not to become the winning bid. (The bidder does not want to win this auction, but they want to make sure to be invited to the next auction).

In Britain and many other countries, rings and other forms of bidding on one&#x27;s own object are illegal. In Australia, a dummy bid or also a shill is a criminal offence, but a vendor bid or a co-owner bid below the reserve price is permitted if clearly declared as such by the auctioneer. These are all official legal terms in Australia but may have other meanings elsewhere. A co-owner is one of two or several owners (who disagree among themselves). In Sweden and many other countries, there are no legal restrictions, but it will severely hurt the reputation of an auction house that knowingly permits any other bids except genuine bids. If the reserve is not reached this should be clearly declared. In South Africa, auctioneers can use their staff or any bidder to raise the price as long as it is disclosed before the auction sale. Rael Levitt&#x27;s companies &quot;The Auction Alliance&quot; controversy focused on vendor bidding and led to its downfall in 2012.

====Suggested opening bid (SOB)====

There will usually be an estimate of what price the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction, it is considered important to get at least a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, the auctioneer must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted by one of the bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there will indeed be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to the increase in the number of bidders attracted by the low SOB.

A chi-squared distribution shows many low bids but few high bids. Bids &quot;show up together&quot;; without several low bids there will not be any high bids.

Another approach to choosing a SOB: The auctioneer may achieve good success by asking the expected final sales price for the item, as this method suggests to the potential buyers the item&#x27;s particular value. For instance, an auctioneer is about to sell a $1,000 car at a sale. Instead of asking $100, hoping to entice wide interest, the auctioneer may suggest an opening bid of $1,000; although the first bidder may begin bidding at a mere $100, the final bid may more likely approach $1,000.

==Terminology==

* Absentee bids – this is when a prospective buyer places a bid on an item without attending the sale. This is sometimes referred to instead as a commission bid because the auctioneer is effectively commissioned to enter bids on the potential buyer&#x27;s behalf. The bid is submitted prior to the auction by whatever means the auctioneer has stipulated.
* Appraisal – an estimate of an item&#x27;s worth, usually performed by an expert in that particular field.
* – a raised platform on which the auctioneer shows the items to be auctioned; it can also be slang for the auction itself.
* Auction chant – a rhythmic repetition of numbers and &quot;filler words&quot; spoken by an auctioneer in the process of conducting an auction.
* Auction fever – an emotional state elicited in the course of one or more auctions that causes a bidder to deviate from an initially chosen bidding strategy.
* Auction house – the company operating the auction (i.e., establishing the date and time of the auction, the auction rules, determining which items are to be included in the auction, registering bidders, taking payments, and delivering the goods to the winning bidders).
* – the person conducting the actual auction. They announce the rules of the auction and the items being auctioned, call and acknowledge bids made, and announce the winner.
**The auctioneer can sometimes just be the owner of the business, in which case they may hire a bid caller/s to announce the rules and call bids. 
**The auctioneer may operate their own auction house (and thus perform the duties of both auctioneer and auction house), or work for another house.
**Auctioneers are frequently regulated by governmental entities, and in those jurisdictions must meet certain criteria to be licensed (be of a certain age, have no disqualifying criminal record, attend auction school, pass an examination, and pay a licensing fee).
**Auctioneers may or may not (depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and the policies of the auction house) bid for their own account, or if they do, must disclose this to bidders at the auction; similar rules may apply for employees of the auctioneer or the auction house.
* Bidding – the act of participating in an auction by offering to purchase an item for sale.
* Bid Construction Problem (BCP) – also known as the Bid Generation Problem (BGP), BCP is a NP-Hard combinatorial problem addressed and solved by the bidder to determine the bid packages to bid on and their corresponding bidding prices.
* Buyer&#x27;s premium – a fee paid by the buyer to the auction house; it is typically calculated as a percentage of the winning bid and added to it. Depending on the jurisdiction, the buyer&#x27;s premium, in addition to the sales price, may be subject to VAT or sales tax.
* Buyout price – a price that, if accepted by a bidder, immediately ends the auction and awards the item to them (an example is eBay&#x27;s &quot;Buy It Now&quot; feature).
* Choice – a form of bidding whereby a number of identical or similar items are bid at a single price for each item.
* Clearance rate – the percentage of items that sell over the course of the auction.
* Commission – a fee paid by a consignor/seller to the auction house; it is typically calculated as a percentage of the winning bid and deducted from the gross proceeds due to the consignor/seller.
* Consignee and consignor – as pertaining to auctions, the consignor (also called the seller, and in some contexts the vendor) is the person owning the item to be auctioned or the owner&#x27;s representative, while the consignee is the auction house. The consignor maintains title until such time that an item is purchased by a bidder and the bidder pays the auction house.
* Dummy bid (a/k/a &quot;ghost bid&quot;) – a false bid, made by someone in collusion with the seller or auctioneer, designed to create a sense of increased interest in the item (and, thus, increased bids).
* Dynamic closing – a mechanism used to prevent auction sniping, by which the closing time is extended for a small period to allow other bidders to increase their bids.
* eBidding – electronic bidding, whereby a person may make a bid without being physically present at an auction (or where the entire auction is taking place on the Internet).
* Earnest money deposit (a/k/a &quot;caution money deposit&quot; or &quot;registration deposit&quot;) – a payment that must be made by prospective bidders ahead of time in order to participate in an auction.
**The purpose of this deposit is to deter non-serious bidders from attending the auction; by requiring the deposit, only bidders with a genuine interest in the items being sold will participate.
**This type of deposit is most often used in auctions involving high-value goods (such as real estate).
**The winning bidder has their earnest money applied toward the final selling price; the non-winners have theirs refunded to them.
* Escrow – an arrangement in which the winning bidder pays the amount of their bid to a third party, who in turn releases the funds to the seller under agreed-upon terms.
* Estimate - auction houses typically give an estimate (or guide price), often a range, for lots. This is a rather conservative indication of the price they expect the lot to reach at auction, decided by the auction house, perhaps after consulting outside experts. If an auction is going well, most lots will achieve a price near the top of the estimate, or some 20 or 30% over it. But some lots may fetch double or more the estimate, for various reasons; others much less than the lower end of the estimate. 
* Hammer price – the nominal price at which a lot is sold; the buyer, and often the seller, may have to pay additional fees, &quot;premiums&quot;, and taxes on top of this amount.

* – a minimum amount by which a new bid must exceed the previous bid. An auctioneer may decrease the increment when it appears that bidding on an item may stop, so as to get a higher hammer price. Alternatively, a participant may offer a bid at a smaller increment, which the auctioneer has the discretion to accept or reject.
* Thumb Auction - Olden Auction type where bid were hidden and the bidders used to tell auctioneer their bibs by placing their fingers unger a cloth and touch the fingers with an dedicated amount.
*Lot – either a single item being sold, or a group of items (which may or may not be similar or identical, such as a &quot;job lot&quot; of manufactured goods) that are bid on as one unit.
**If the lot is for a group of items, the price paid is for the entire lot and the winning bidder must take all the items sold.
**Variants on a group lot bid include &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;times the money&quot; (see definitions for each).
***Example: An auction has five bath fragrance gift baskets where bidding is &quot;lot&quot;, and the hammer price is $5. The winner must pay $5 (as the price is for the whole lot) and must take all five baskets.
* Maiden bid – a single bid which wins the lot being offered for sale, with no other bids made.
* Minimum bid – the smallest opening bid that will be accepted.
**A minimum bid can be as little as $0.01 (one cent) depending on the auction.
**If no one bids at the initial minimum bid, the auctioneer may lower the minimum bid so as to create interest in the item.
**The minimum bid differs from a reserve price (see definition), in that the auctioneer sets the minimum bid, while the seller sets the reserve price (if desired).
* &quot;New money&quot; – a new bidder, joining bidding for an item after others have bid against each other.
* No reserve auction (a/k/a &quot;absolute auction&quot;) – an auction in which there is no minimum acceptable price; so long as the winning bid is at least the minimum bid, the seller must honor the sale.
* Outbid – to bid higher than another bidder.
* Opening bid – the first bid placed on a particular lot. The opening bid must be at least the minimum bid, but may be higher (e.g., a bidder may shout out a considerably larger bid than minimum, to discourage other bidders from bidding).
* Paddle – a numbered instrument used to place a bid
* Protecting a market – when a dealer places a bid on behalf of an artist they represent or otherwise have a financial interest in ensuring a high price. Artists represented by major galleries typically expect this kind of protection from their dealers.
* Proxy bid (also called an absentee bid) – a bid placed by an authorized representative of a bidder who is not physically present at the auction.
**Proxy bids are common in auctions of high-end items, such as art sales (where the proxy represents either a private bidder who does not want to be disclosed to the public, or a museum bidding on a particular item for its collection).
**If the proxy is outbid on an item during the auction, the proxy (depending on the instructions of the bidder) may either increase the bid (up to a set amount established by the bidder) or be required to drop out of the bidding for that item.
**A proxy may also be limited by the bidder in the total amount to spend on items in a multi-item auction.
* Relisting – re-selling an item that has already been sold at auction, but where the buyer did not take possession of the item (for example, in a real estate auction, the buyer did not provide payment by the closing date).
* Reserve (price) – a minimum acceptable price established by the seller prior to the auction, which may or may not be disclosed to the bidders.
**If the winning bid is below the reserve price, the seller has the right to reject the bid and withdraw the item or items being auctioned.
**The reserve price differs from a minimum bid (see definition), in that the seller sets the reserve price (if desired), while the auctioneer sets the minimum bid.
* – a submitted bid whose value is unknown to competitors.
* Sniping – the act of placing a bid just before the end of a timed auction, thus giving other bidders no time to enter new bids.
* Soft close – When a bidder places a bid in the last set amount of minutes and the auction is automatically extended for a set period of time. Soft closes prevent sniping. 
* Specialist – on-staff trained professionals, often specialising in specific objects (for example, porcelain) who put together the auction.
* The &quot;three Ds&quot; (death, divorce, or debt) – sometimes a reason for an item to be sold at an auction.
* Vendor bid – a bid by the person selling the item. The bid is sometimes a dummy bid (see definition) but not always.
* White glove sale – an auction in which every single lot is sold.

<text>Aqua regia (; from Latin, &quot;regal water&quot; or &quot;royal water&quot;) is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a fuming liquid. Freshly prepared aqua regia is colorless, but it turns yellow, orange or red within seconds from the formation of nitrosyl chloride and nitrogen dioxide. It was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve noble metals like gold and platinum, though not all metals.

== Preparation and decomposition ==
Upon mixing of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid, chemical reactions occur. These reactions result in the volatile products nitrosyl chloride and chlorine gas:

as evidenced by the fuming nature and characteristic yellow color of aqua regia. As the volatile products escape from solution, aqua regia loses its potency. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) can further decompose into nitric oxide (NO) and elemental chlorine ():

This dissociation is equilibrium-limited. Therefore, in addition to nitrosyl chloride and chlorine, the fumes over aqua regia also contain nitric oxide (NO). Because nitric oxide readily reacts with atmospheric oxygen, the gases produced also contain nitrogen dioxide, (red fume):

==Applications==
Aqua regia is primarily used to produce chloroauric acid, the electrolyte in the Wohlwill process for refining the highest purity (99.999%) gold.

Aqua regia is also used in etching and in specific analytic procedures. It is also used in some laboratories to clean glassware of organic compounds and metal particles. This method is preferred among most over the more traditional chromic acid bath for cleaning NMR tubes, because no traces of paramagnetic chromium can remain to spoil spectra. While chromic acid baths are discouraged because of the high toxicity of chromium and the potential for explosions, aqua regia is itself very corrosive and has been implicated in several explosions due to mishandling.

Because its components react quickly, resulting in its decomposition, aqua regia quickly loses its effectiveness (yet remains a strong acid), so its components are usually only mixed immediately before use.

==Chemistry==
===Dissolving gold===
Aqua regia dissolves gold, although neither constituent acid will do so alone. Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizer, which will dissolve a very small quantity of gold, forming gold(III) ions (). The hydrochloric acid provides a ready supply of chloride ions (), which react with the gold ions to produce tetrachloroaurate(III) anions (), also in solution. The reaction with hydrochloric acid is an equilibrium reaction that favors formation of tetrachloroaurate(III) anions. This results in a removal of gold ions from solution and allows further oxidation of gold to take place. The gold dissolves to become chloroauric acid. In addition, gold may be dissolved by the chlorine present in aqua regia. Appropriate equations are:

: Au + 3  + 4 HCl + 3  + + 2 
or
: Au + + 4 HCl + NO + + .

Solid tetrachloroauric acid may be isolated by evaporating the excess aqua regia, and decomposing the residual nitric acid by repeatedly heating the solution with additional hydrochloric acid. That step reduces nitric acid (see decomposition of aqua regia). If elemental gold is desired, it may be selectively reduced with reducing agents such as sulfur dioxide, hydrazine, oxalic acid, etc. The equation for the reduction of oxidized gold () by sulfur dioxide () is the following:



===Dissolving platinum===
Similar equations can be written for platinum. As with gold, the oxidation reaction can be written with either nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide as the nitrogen oxide product:
:

The oxidized platinum ion then reacts with chloride ions resulting in the chloroplatinate ion:

Experimental evidence reveals that the reaction of platinum with aqua regia is considerably more complex. The initial reactions produce a mixture of chloroplatinous acid () and nitrosoplatinic chloride (). The nitrosoplatinic chloride is a solid product. If full dissolution of the platinum is desired, repeated extractions of the residual solids with concentrated hydrochloric acid must be performed:
and

The chloroplatinous acid can be oxidized to chloroplatinic acid by saturating the solution with molecular chlorine () while heating:

Dissolving platinum solids in aqua regia was the mode of discovery for the densest metals, iridium and osmium, both of which are found in platinum ores and are not dissolved by aqua regia, instead collecting as insoluble metallic powder (elemental Ir, Os) on the base of the vessel.

===Precipitating dissolved platinum===
As a practical matter, when platinum group metals are purified through dissolution in aqua regia, gold (commonly associated with PGMs) is precipitated by treatment with iron(II) chloride. Platinum in the filtrate, as hexachloroplatinate(IV), is converted to ammonium hexachloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. This ammonium salt is extremely insoluble, and it can be filtered off. Ignition (strong heating) converts it to platinum metal:

Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) is reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues.

===Reaction with tin===
Aqua regia reacts with tin to form tin(IV) chloride, containing tin in its highest oxidation state:

===Reaction with other substances===
It can react with iron pyrite to form Iron(III) chloride:

==History==
Aqua regia first appeared in the &quot;De inventione veritatis&quot; (&quot;On the Discovery of Truth&quot;) by pseudo-Geber (after ), who produced it by adding sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) to nitric acid. The preparation of aqua regia by directly mixing hydrochloric acid with nitric acid only became possible after the discovery in the late sixteenth century of the process by which free hydrochloric acid can be produced.
The third of Basil Valentine&#x27;s keys () shows a dragon in the foreground and a fox eating a rooster in the background. The rooster symbolizes gold (from its association with sunrise and the sun&#x27;s association with gold), and the fox represents aqua regia. The repetitive dissolving, heating, and redissolving (the rooster eating the fox eating the rooster) leads to the buildup of chlorine gas in the flask. The gold then crystallizes in the form of gold(III) chloride, whose red crystals Basil called &quot;the rose of our masters&quot; and &quot;the red dragon&#x27;s blood&quot;. The reaction was not reported again in the chemical literature until 1895.

Antoine Lavoisier called aqua regia nitro-muriatic acid in 1789.

When Germany invaded Denmark in World War II, Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold Nobel Prizes of German physicists Max von Laue (1914) and James Franck (1925) in aqua regia to prevent the Nazis from confiscating them. The German government had prohibited Germans from accepting or keeping any Nobel Prize after jailed peace activist Carl von Ossietzky had received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935. De Hevesy placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was subsequently ignored by the Nazis who thought the jar—one of perhaps hundreds on the shelving—contained common chemicals. After the war, de Hevesy returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The gold was returned to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Nobel Foundation. They re-cast the medals and again presented them to Laue and Franck.

<text>Manley Lanier &quot;Sonny&quot; Carter Jr., M.D. (August 15, 1947 – April 5, 1991), (Capt, USN), was an American chemist, physician, professional soccer player, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and NASA astronaut who flew on STS-33.

==Early life and education==
Carter was born on August 15, 1947, to parents Manley L. Carter and Elizabeth C. Carter in Macon, Georgia, but considered Warner Robins, Georgia to be his hometown. He graduated from Lanier High School in Macon in 1965, and during his high school years was actively involved in the Macon-based Troop 19 of the Boy Scouts of America, where he also served a term as Senior Patrol Leader, the highest leadership position for a young man in that BSA troop, and earned its highest rank of Eagle Scout.

Carter received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from Emory University in Atlanta in 1969, and a Doctor of Medicine degree from there in 1973. During his time at Emory, Carter was a brother in the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. After completing Emory University School of Medicine in 1973, Carter completed internship in internal medicine at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

==Athletic career==
Carter played collegiate soccer and ran track while an undergraduate at Emory University. During his senior season, he was captain and most valuable player of the soccer team. In addition to his intercollegiate athletic career, Carter was an intramural wrestling champion. He played professional soccer while he attended medical school. In 1970, he signed with the Atlanta Chiefs of the North American Soccer League (NASL), for which he played three seasons.

==Navy service==
In 1974, Carter entered the U.S. Navy and completed flight surgeon school in Pensacola, Florida. After serving tours as a flight surgeon with the 1st and 3rd Marine Aircraft Wings, he returned to flight training at Beeville, Texas, and was designated a Naval Aviator on April 28, 1978. He was assigned as the senior medical officer of the aircraft carrier , and in March 1979 completed F-4 training at VMFAT-101 in Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. He was subsequently reassigned as a fighter pilot, flying F-4 Phantoms with Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 333 (VMFA-333) at MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina. In 1981, he completed a nine-month Mediterranean cruise aboard USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; with VMFA-115. In September 1982, he attended U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) and then served as the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing standardization officer and F-4 combat readiness evaluator at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. He then attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, graduating in June 1984.

Carter logged 3,000 flying hours and 160 carrier landings.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in May 1984, Carter became an astronaut in June 1985, qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews.

===Space Shuttle program===
Carter was assigned as Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) Representative for the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office when selected to the crew of STS-33. The STS-33 crew launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at night on November 22, 1989, aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a hard surface landing on Runway 04 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Carter logged 120 hours in space.

At the time of his death in April 1991, Carter was assigned as mission specialist 3 on the crew of STS-42 &quot;Discovery&quot;, the first International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-1). His place was taken by Dave Hilmers.

==Death==

Carter died in the April 5, 1991, crash of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 in Brunswick, Georgia. He was aboard the commercial airplane traveling for NASA. His wife Dana and two daughters, Olivia Elizabeth (born May 27, 1974) and Meredith Corvette (born December 3, 1976), were not on the flight. Among the others who also died in the plane crash was John Tower, a former Senator from Texas.

Carter&#x27;s death occurred on the same day as the launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on mission STS-37.

==Organizations==
Carter was a member of the Society of U.S. Naval Flight Surgeons, Sigma Delta Psi, Alpha Omega Alpha, Alpha Tau Omega, the Marine Corps Aviation Association, the Tailhook Association, and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

==Special honors==
*Air Medal
*Meritorious Service Medal
*Navy Achievement Medal
*Meritorious Unit Citation
*Marine Corps Aviation Association Special Category Award (1982)
*NASA Meritorious Service Medal (1988)
*NASA Space Flight Medal (1989)

Carter was the Guest of Honor at the 215th Marine Corps Birthday Ball.

==Legacy==

Having died in the line of duty for NASA, Carter&#x27;s name was added to the Space Mirror Memorial at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. His name was the first added after the memorial&#x27;s original construction.

After his death, his name was given to the Sonny Carter Training Facility Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, NASA&#x27;s underwater astronaut training facility, for which he had developed training techniques.

In 1989, Emory University inducted him in its Athletic Hall of Fame. The university holds The Sonny Carter Invitational each year in his honor. A plaque also honors his memory in the library of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house at Emory, in which he was a Brother.

In 1992 he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.

Sonny Carter Elementary School in Macon, Georgia, which opened in 1993, was named for Carter. The school motto is: &quot;To Challenge the Edge of the Universe.&quot;

The Society of United States Naval Flight Surgeons (SUSNFS) bestows an annual &quot;Sonny Carter Memorial Award&quot; to the nominee with the most significant contribution to the health, safety and welfare of the operational forces by promoting communication and teamwork amongst the aeromedical community.

<text>The Burma Railway, also known as the Siam–Burma Railway, Thai–Burma Railway and similar names, or as the Death Railway, is a railway between Ban Pong, Thailand, and Thanbyuzayat, Burma (now called Myanmar). It was built from 1940 to 1943 by Southeast Asian civilians abducted and forced to work by the Japanese and a smaller group of captured Allied soldiers, to supply troops and weapons in the Burma campaign of World War II. It completed the rail link between Bangkok, Thailand, and Rangoon, Burma. The name used by the Imperial Japanese Government was &quot;Tai–Men Rensetsu Tetsudō&quot; (), which means Thailand-Burma-Link-Railway.

At least 250,000 Southeast Asian civilians were subjected to forced labour to ensure the construction of the Death Railway and more than 90,000 civilians died building it, as did around 12,000 Allied soldiers. The workers on the Thai side of the railway were Tamils, Malays, and fewer Chinese civilians from Malaya.

Most of these civilians were moved to ‘rest camps’ after October 1943, they remained in these camps after the end of the war as they watched the Allied POWs being evacuated. Survivors were still living in the camps in 1947. They were British subjects who, without access to food or medical care, continued to die of malaria, dysentery and malnutrition. They had survived the ordeal of the Railway only to die in the ‘rest camps’. No compensation or reparations have been provided to the Southeast Asian victims.

Most of the railway was dismantled shortly after the war. Only the first of the line in Thailand remained, with trains still running as far north as Nam Tok.

== History ==

A railway route between Burma and Thailand, crossing Three Pagodas Pass and following the valley of the Khwae Noi river in Thailand, had been surveyed by the British government of Burma as early as 1885, but the proposed course of the line – through hilly jungle terrain divided by many rivers – was considered too difficult to undertake.

Thailand was a neutral country at the onset of World War II. On 8 December 1941, Japan invaded Thailand, which quickly surrendered. Thailand was forced to accept an alliance, and was used as a staging point for the attack on Singapore.

In early 1942, Japanese forces invaded Burma and British forces quickly surrendered. To supply their forces in Burma, the Japanese depended upon the sea, bringing supplies and troops to Burma around the Malay Peninsula and through the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. This route was vulnerable to attack by Allied submarines, especially after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. To avoid a hazardous sea journey around the Malay Peninsula, a railway from Bangkok to Rangoon seemed a feasible alternative. The Japanese began this project in June 1942.


The project aimed to connect Ban Pong in Thailand with Thanbyuzayat in Burma, linking up with existing railways at both places. Its route was through Three Pagodas Pass on the border of Thailand and Burma. of the railway were in Burma and the remaining were in Thailand. After preliminary work of airfields and infrastructure, construction of the railway began in Burma and Thailand on 16 September 1942. The projected completion date was December 1943. Much of the construction material, including tracks and sleepers, was brought from dismantled branches of Malaya&#x27;s Federated Malay States Railway network and the East Indies&#x27; various rail networks.

The railway was completed ahead of schedule. On 17 October 1943, groups of civilians violently transported from Burma were forced to commence working south, meeting up with groups of civilians taken from Thailand who were working in a northerly direction. The two sections of the line met at kilometre 263, about south of the Three Pagodas Pass at Konkoita (nowadays: Kaeng Khoi Tha, Sangkhla Buri District, Kanchanaburi Province). A holiday was declared for 25 October, which was chosen as the ceremonial opening of the line. The Japanese staff would travel by train C56 31 from Nong Pladuk, Thailand to Thanbyuzayat, Burma. A copper spike was driven at the meeting point by commanding General Eiguma Ishida, and a memorial plaque was revealed.

The Japanese Army transported 500,000 tonnes of freight over the railway during the course of the war. Construction camps housing at least 1,000 workers each were established every 5–10 miles (8–17 km) of the route. Workers were moved up and down the railway line as needed. The construction camps consisted of open-sided barracks built of bamboo poles with thatched roofs. The barracks were about long with sleeping platforms raised above the ground on each side of an earthen floor. Two hundred people were housed in each barracks, giving each person a two-foot wide space in which to live and sleep. Camps were usually named after the kilometre where they were located. The worst months of the construction period were known as the &quot;Speedo&quot; (mid-spring to mid-October 1943).

=== Post-war ===
Within a year of the Second World War, Britain, while facing bankruptcy, retook Burma, Malaya, Singapore and the Straits Settlements. On 16 January 1946, the British ordered Japanese Prisoners of War to remove a four-kilometre stretch of rail between Nikki (Ni Thea) and Sonkrai. The railway link between Thailand and Burma was to be separated again for protecting British interests in Singapore. After that, the Burma section of the railway was sequentially removed, the rails were gathered in Mawlamyine, and the roadbed was returned to the jungle.

In October 1946, the Thai section of the line was sold to the Government of Thailand for £1,250,000 (50 million baht; ). The money was used to compensate neighbouring countries and colonies for material stolen by Japan during the construction of the railway. On 1 February 1947, two people—including Momluang , the Thai Minister of Transport—were killed on an inspection tour because the bridge near Konkoita had collapsed. After the accident, it was decided to end the line at Nam Tok and reuse the remainder to rehabilitate the line.

After the war, the railway was in poor condition and needed reconstruction for use by the Royal Thai Railway system. On 24 June 1949, the portion from Kanchanaburi to Nong Pla Duk (Thai หนองปลาดุก) was finished; on the first of April 1952, the next section up to Wang Pho (Wangpo) was done. The two curved spans of the bridge which collapsed due to the British air attack were replaced by angular truss spans provided by Japan as part of their postwar reparations, thus forming the iconic bridge now seen today. Finally, on 1 July 1958, the rail line was completed to Nam Tok (Thai น้ำตก, &#x27;waterfall&#x27;, referring to the nearby Sai Yok Noi Waterfall) The portion in use today is some long. The line was abandoned beyond Nam Tok Sai Yok Noi; the steel rails were salvaged for reuse in expanding the Bang Sue railway yard, reinforcing the Bangkok–Ban Phachi Junction double track, rehabilitating the track from Thung Song Junction to Trang, and constructing both the Nong Pla Duk–Suphan Buri and Ban Thung Pho–Khiri Rat Nikhom branch lines. Parts of the abandoned route have been converted into a walking trail.

Since the 1990s various proposals have been made to rebuild the complete railway, but these plans had not been realised. Since the upper part of the Khwae valley is now flooded by the Vajiralongkorn Dam, and the surrounding terrain is mountainous, it would take extensive tunnelling to reconnect Thailand with Burma by rail.

== Labourers ==

===Japanese===
Japanese soldiers, 12,000 of them, including 800 Koreans, were employed on the railway as engineers, guards, and supervisors of the POW and civilian labourers. Although working conditions were far better for the Japanese than the POWs and civilian workers, about 1,000 (eight percent) of them died during construction. Many remember Japanese soldiers as being cruel and indifferent to the fate of Allied military prisoners and the Southeast Asian civilians. Many men in the railway workforce bore the brunt of pitiless or uncaring guards. Cruelty could take different forms, from extreme violence and torture to minor acts of physical punishment, humiliation, and neglect.

=== Trafficked civilians ===

Over 180,000 Southeast Asian civilians were forcibly conscripted to work on the Death railway. Limited record keeping on the civilian populations under British occupation has led to incomplete and insufficient recording of the names and families of individuals who were trafficked. Javanese, Malayan Tamils, Burmese, Malayan Chinese, Thai, and other Southeast Asians were trafficked by the Imperial Japanese Army to work on the railway, dying in its construction. During the initial stages of the construction of the railway, Burmese and Thais were employed in their respective countries, but the number of workers recruited was insufficient. In Malaya, plantation families were forced by Japanese officers to send their children to the railway and young healthy men were often abducted and trafficked to the railway.

In early 1943, the Japanese advertised for workers in Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies, promising good wages, short contracts, and housing for families. When that failed to attract sufficient workers, they resorted to more violent methods, rounding up civilians, including children and imprisoning them, especially in Malaya. Approximately 90,000 Burmese and 75,000 Malayans worked on the railroad. More than 100,000 Malayan Tamils were brought into the project and around 60,000 perished. Southeast Asian workers were used to build the Kra Isthmus Railway from Chumphon to Kra Buri, and the Sumatra or Palembang Railway from Pekanbaru to Muaro. Those left to maintain the lines after the completion of the Death Railway suffered from appalling living conditions as well as increasing Allied bombing.

===Prisoners of war===
The movement of captured British soldiers northward from Changi Prison in Singapore and other prison camps in Southeast Asia began in May 1942. On 23 June 1942, 600 British soldiers arrived at Camp Nong Pladuk, Thailand to build a camp to serve as a transit camp for the work camps along the railway. The first prisoners of war, 3,000 Australians, left Changi Prison in Singapore on 14 May 1942 and journeyed by sea to near Thanbyuzayat (သံဖြူဇရပ် in the Burmese language; in English &#x27;Tin Shelter&#x27;), the northern terminus of the railway. They worked on airfields and other infrastructure initially before beginning construction of the railway in October 1942. In Thailand, 3,000 British soldiers left Changi by train in June 1942 to Ban Pong, the southern terminus of the railway. Some captured British soldiers were taken from Singapore and the Dutch East Indies as construction advanced.

== Atrocities ==

===Conditions during construction===

The records of the civilian workers have not survived due to the limitations on birth and death records kept during pre- and post-war colonisation of the region. One soldier said they &quot;found themselves at the bottom of a social system that was harsh, punitive, fanatical, and often deadly.&quot; The living and working conditions on the Burma Railway were often described as &quot;horrific&quot;, with maltreatment, sickness, and starvation.

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk by artists such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, John Mennie, Ashley George Old, and Ronald Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the &quot;canvas&quot;. Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals. Many are now held by the Australian War Memorial, State Library of Victoria, and the Imperial War Museum in London.

One of the accounts from the British military perspective was John Coast&#x27;s &quot;Railroad of Death&quot;, first published in 1946 and republished in a new edition in 2014. Coast&#x27;s work is noted for its detail on the brutality of some Japanese and Korean guards as well as the humanity of others. It also describes the living and working conditions, together with the culture of the Thai towns and countryside that became many POWs&#x27; homes after leaving Singapore. Coast also details the camaraderie, pastimes, and humour of the soldiers in the face of adversity. Allied soldiers were often given more freedom than their civilian counterparts, to play guitar or accordion, or lead a group sing-along, or request camp comedians to tell some jokes or put on a skit.

After the railway was completed, most of the British soldiers were moved to hospital and relocation camps where they could be available for maintenance crews or sent to Japan. In maintenance camps entertainment flourished, theatres of bamboo and attap (palm fronds) were built, sets, lighting, costumes and makeup devised, and an array of entertainment produced that included music halls, variety shows, cabarets, plays, and musical comedieseven pantomimes. These activities engaged numerous soldiers as actors, singers, musicians, designers, technicians, and female impersonators.

The construction of the Burma Railway is counted as a war crime committed by Japan in Asia.

=== Death rates and causes ===

In addition to malnutrition and physical abuse, malaria, cholera, dysentery and tropical ulcers were common contributing factors in the death of workers on the Burma Railway. The labourers that suffered the highest casualties were Burmese and Indian Tamils from Malaya and Myanmar, as well as many Javanese.

A lower death rate among Dutch POWs and internees, relative to those from the UK and Australia, has been linked to the fact that many personnel and civilians taken prisoner in the Dutch East Indies had been born there, were long-term residents and/or had Eurasian ancestry; they tended thus to be more resistant to tropical diseases and to be better acclimatized than other Western Allied personnel.

The quality of medical care received by different groups of prisoners varied enormously. One factor was that many European and US doctors had little experience with tropical diseases. For example, a group of 400 Dutch prisoners, which included three doctors with extensive tropical medicine experience, suffered no deaths at all. Another group, numbering 190 US personnel, to whom &quot;Lieutenant&quot; Henri Hekking, a Dutch medical officer with experience in the tropics was assigned, suffered only nine deaths. Another cohort of 450 US personnel suffered 100 deaths.

Weight loss among Allied officers who worked on construction was, on average, 9–14 kg (20–30 lb) less than that of enlisted personnel. Workers in more isolated areas suffered a much higher death rate than did others.

=== War crimes trials ===
At the end of World War II, 111 Japanese military officials were tried for war crimes for their brutality during the construction of the railway. Thirty-two of them were sentenced to death. The most important trial was against the general staff. Lieutenant General Eiguma Ishida, overall commander of the Burma Railway, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. His subordinates Colonel Shigeo Nakamura, Colonel Tamie Ishii and Lieutenant-Colonel Shoichi Yanagita were sentenced to death. Major Sotomatsu Chida was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Hiroshi Abe, a first lieutenant who supervised construction of the railway at Sonkrai where 600 British prisoners out of 1,600 died of cholera and other diseases, was sentenced to death, later commuted to life in prison, as a B/C class war criminal. He served 11 years.

== Features of the Railway ==

===Bridge 277: Bridge on the River Khwae ===
A key feature of the line is Bridge 277 built over a stretch of the river then known as part of the Mae Klong River. The greater part of the Thai section of the river&#x27;s route followed the valley of the Khwae Noi River (: (), &#x27;stream, river&#x27; or &#x27;tributary&#x27;; (), &#x27;small&#x27;. was frequently mispronounced by the British as (), or &#x27;buffalo&#x27; in Thai). This gave rise to the name of &quot;River Kwai&quot; amongst the British. In 1960, the portion of the Mae Klong which passes under the bridge was renamed the Khwae Yai (, &#x27;big tributary&#x27;).

On 26 October 1942, British prisoners of war arrived at Tamarkan to construct the bridge. Initially, 1,000 prisoners worked on the bridge, led by Colonel Philip Toosey. In February 1943, 1,000 Dutch prisoners of war were added to Tamarkan. Chinese, Malay and Tamil civilians also worked on the bridge.

The first wooden railroad bridge over the Khwae Yai was finished in February 1943, which was soon accompanied by a more modern ferro-concrete bridge in June 1943, with both bridges running in a NNE–SSW direction across the river. The steel and concrete bridge consisted of eleven curved-truss bridge spans brought by the Japanese from Java in 1942. This is the bridge that still remains today.

====Bombardments of Bridge 277====


In 1945 a planned US attack was cancelled due to bad weather. The two bridges were bombed on 13 February 1945 by RAF aircraft. The forced labourers repaired the bridge and by April the wooden bridge in operation. A 3 April 1945, a USAAF Liberator attack damaged the wooden railroad bridge. Repair work continued and both bridges were operational again by the end of May. On 24 June 1945 the RAF destroyed the railroad bridges, putting the railway line out of commission for the rest of the war.

The railway line did not fully connect with the Burmese railroad network as no railroad bridges were built that crossed the river between Moulmein and Martaban.

=== Hellfire Pass ===
Hellfire Pass in the Tenasserim Hills was the largest rock cutting on the railway, built in a remote area, without appropriate construction tools by Chinese, Thai, Malay, and Tamil civilian prisoners and Allied soldiers.

=== Significant bridges ===


==Cemeteries and memorials==

In 1946, the remains of most of the Allied military war dead were moved from former camps, burial grounds and lone graves along the rail line to official war cemeteries.

The mass graves of the Southeast Asian civilian dead were exhumed from along the rail line and beside former rest camps for reburial at Wat Thaworn Wararam, a Buddhist temple in Ban Tai, Thailand in the 1950s. A pagoda was erected over the burial site and plaques in both Chinese and Tamil text have been added to commemorate the dead. The names of the thousands of civilians buried at the site are unknown.

Three cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) are for the Allied military personnel who died on the Burma Railway. Kanchanaburi War Cemetery, in the city of Kanchanaburi, contains the graves of 6,982 Allied military personnel comprising: 3,585 British, 1,896 Dutch, 1,362 Australians, 12 members of the British Indian Army (including British officers), 2 New Zealanders, 2 Danes and 8 Canadians.

A memorial plaque at the Kanchanaburi cemetery lists 11 other members of the British Indian Army, these Indian officers are buried in nearby Muslim cemeteries.

Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery, at Thanbyuzayat, 65 kilometres south of Moulmein, Myanmar (Burma) has the graves of 3,617 soldiers who died on the Burmese portion of the line: 1,651 British, 1,335 Australians, 621 Dutch, 15 members of the British Indian Army (including British officers), 3 New Zealanders and 1 Canadian.
Chungkai War Cemetery, near Kanchanaburi, has a further 1,693 Allied war graves: 1,373 British, 314 Dutch and 6 members of the British Indian Army (including British officers)

The remains of United States armed forces personnel were repatriated. Of the 668 US personnel forced to work on the railway, 133 died. This included personnel from USS &quot;Houston&quot; and the 131st Field Artillery Regiment of the Texas Army National Guard. The Americans were called the Lost Battalion as their fate was unknown to the United States for more than two years after their capture.

Several museums are dedicated to those who perished building the railway. The largest of these is at Hellfire Pass (north of the current terminus at Nam Tok), a cutting where the greatest number of people died. An Australian memorial is at Hellfire Pass. One museum is in Myanmar side Thanbyuzayat, and two other museums are in Kanchanaburi: the Thailand–Burma Railway Centre, opened in January 2003, and the JEATH War Museum. There is a memorial plaque at the Kwai bridge itself, and an historic wartime steam locomotive is on display.

A preserved section of line has been rebuilt at the National Memorial Arboretum in England.

==Notable accounts==
Accounts of the construction include &quot;A Baba Boyhood: Growing up during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore&quot; by William Gwee Thian Hock and an anthology of the experiences of survivors in &quot;Revisiting the Death Railway: The Survivors’ Accounts&quot; by Sasidaran Sellappah. &quot;The Japanese Occupation of Malaya: A Social and Economic History&quot; by Paul H. Kratosk and &quot;The Thai Resistance Movement during the Second World War&quot; by Eiji Murashima provide a social and economic analysis of the railway&#x27;s construction and its civilian builders. The book &quot;Through the Valley of the Kwai&quot; is an autobiography of British Army captain Ernest Gordon. Flanagan&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; centres on a group of Australian POWs and their experiences building the railway, and was awarded the 2014 Man Booker Prize. James D. Hornfischer&#x27;s book &quot;Ship of Ghosts: The Story of the USS Houston, FDR&#x27;s Legendary Lost Cruiser and the Epic Saga of Her Survivors&quot; depicts the construction of the railway from the point of view of the survivors of the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Houston&quot;, which was sunk at the Battle of Sunda Strait in 1942.

==Death Railway Interest Group (DRIG)==
The Death Railway Interest Group (DRIG) is a Malaysian NGO that leads on the collection of Asian survivor accounts in Malaysia and Thailand, working to update records and presenting these at Australian and New-Zealand based humanitarian events. DRIG aims to identify at least one mass grave along the railway and build a monument to the horrors these victims went through, as well as their surviving families.

DRIG led the development of a further memorial to the civilian labourers at Wat Tavorn Wararam, which manages the Wat Yuan Cemetery in Kanchanaburi, opened on 3 June 2023. This is in addition to the pagoda built over the remains of thousands of workers. The temple had undertaken the task of recovering the dead and burying them in the Wat Yuan Cemetery.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
In 2016, R.AGE, the youth news and lifestyle platform of &quot;The Star&quot; (Malaysia) interviewed one of the last-known Asian survivors in &quot;Surviving Thailand&#x27;s infamous &#x27;Death Railway&#x27;: Arumugam Kandasamy&quot;.

The film &quot;The Railway Man&quot; (based on the book of the same name) gives the insight of a POW into the conditions inflicted upon the workers who built the railway. The 2001 film &quot;To End All Wars&quot; is based on the autobiography of British Army captain Ernest Gordon. The construction of the railway was the subject of a fictional award-winning 1957 film, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (itself an adaptation of the French language novel &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot;); a novel, &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; by Richard Flanagan.

Michael Whitehall brought his son, comic Jack Whitehall, there in 2017 for the first season of &quot;Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father&quot;.

<text>Count Claus von Stauffenberg (; 15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944) was a German army officer who is best known for his failed attempt on 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair, part of Operation Valkyrie, a plan that would have seen the arrest of Nazi leadership in the wake of Hitler&#x27;s death and an early end to World War II.

As a military officer from a noble background, Stauffenberg took part in the Invasion of Poland, the 1941–42 invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa and the Tunisian campaign during the Second World War. Alongside Major Generals Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he became a key figure in the German resistance to Nazism within the .

On 20 July 1944, Stauffenberg&#x27;s assassination attempt failed, the explosive he had placed only dealing Hitler minor injuries. The conspirators were arrested, and many of them executed, including Stauffenberg on the day after the attempt. His wife Nina was also arrested, giving birth to their fifth child Konstanze while imprisoned. Their children also included Berthold, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a military man, and politician Franz-Ludwig. Konstanze&#x27;s son Philipp von Schulthess would become an actor and play a supporting role in &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, a 2008 American film about the 20 July 1944 assassination with Stauffenberg as main character, portrayed by Tom Cruise.

==Family history==

Stauffenberg was born in Stauffenberg Castle, Jettingen on 15 November 1907 and baptised as Claus Philipp Maria Justinian. Born into the ancient House of Stauffenberg, he was the third of four sons of Count Alfred Schenk von Stauffenberg (1860–1936), the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of Württemberg and his wife, Countess Caroline von Üxküll-Gyllenband (1875–1956), the daughter of Count Alfred Richard August von Üxküll-Gyllenband (1838–1877) and Countess Valerie von Hohenthal (1841–1878).

From birth, Stauffenberg inherited the hereditary titles of Graf and Schenk, leaving him referred to by his first name and Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg until the 1919 Weimar Constitutional Law abolished privileges of nobility&quot;.&quot; His maternal ancestors included Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.

==Early life==
Stauffenberg grew up in Bavaria, where he and his brothers were members of the , a German Scout association and part of the German Youth movement. Though he and his brothers were carefully educated, and Stauffenberg was inclined towards literature, he eventually took up a military career, fitting with his family&#x27;s traditional expectations. In 1926, he joined the family&#x27;s traditional regiment, the Reiterregiment 17 (17th Cavalry Regiment) in Bamberg.

Around the beginning of his time in Bamberg, Albrecht von Blumenthal introduced the three brothers to the poet Stefan George&#x27;s influential circle, &quot;Georgekreis&quot;, from which many notable members of the German resistance later emerged. George dedicated &quot;Das neue Reich&quot; (&quot;the new Empire&quot;) in 1928, including the &quot;Geheimes Deutschland&quot; (&quot;secret Germany&quot;) written in 1922, to Berthold.

By 1930, Stauffenberg had been commissioned as a (second lieutenant), studying modern weapons at the in Berlin, but remaining focused on the use of horses – which continued to carry out a large part of transportation duties throughout World War II—in modern warfare. His regiment became part of the German 1st Light Division under General Erich Hoepner, another later member of the covert German Resistance, and the unit was among the Wehrmacht troops that moved into Sudetenland following its annexation to the Reich as per the Munich Agreement.

=== Early views on Nazism ===
Though Stauffenberg had supported the German colonization of Poland and had made extremist remarks regarding Polish Jews, he refrained from joining the Nazi Party. However, during the 1932 German presidential election, he voiced tentative support for Hitler:

Stauffenberg&#x27;s views of Hitler were conflicted during this period. He vacillated between a strong dislike of Hitler&#x27;s policies and a respect for what he perceived to be Hitler&#x27;s military acumen, before becoming more disassociated with the party after The Night of the Long Knives and Kristallnacht which he saw as proof Hitler had no intentions to pursue justice. As a practising Catholic, it was noted that the growing systematic ill-treatment of Jews and suppression of religion had offended Stauffenberg&#x27;s strong sense of Catholic morality and justice.

Even though Stauffenberg joined the covert resistance movement within the Wehrmacht, like many members of the Nazi Party, he displayed a tentative opposition to parliamentary democracy.

==Second World War==
===Activities in 1939–40===
Following the outbreak of war in 1939, Stauffenberg and his regiment took part in the Invasion of Poland. During this time, he was a strong supporter of Poland&#x27;s occupation, and the Nazi Party&#x27;s colonisation, exploitation and use of Pole slave workers to bring about German prosperity. Stauffenberg himself noted, &quot;It is essential that we begin a systemic colonisation in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur&quot;. After the Invasion, Stauffenberg&#x27;s unit was reorganised into the 6th Panzer Division, and he served as an officer on its General Staff in the Battle of France, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.

While his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, together with Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, had approached Stauffenberg to join the resistance movement against the Hitler regime, it was only after the Polish campaign that Stauffenberg began to consider the offer. Peter Yorck von Wartenburg and Ulrich Schwerin von Schwanenfeld had urged him to become the adjutant of Walther von Brauchitsch, then Supreme Commander of the Army, to facilitate a coup against Hitler. Though, Stauffenberg declined at the time, reasoning that all German soldiers had pledged allegiance not to the institution of the presidency of the German , but to the person of Adolf Hitler, due to the introduced in 1934.

=== Operation Barbarossa, 1941–42 ===
During the quieter months of 1940 to 1941, Stauffenberg was transferred to the organisational department of the (&quot;Army High Command&quot;; OKH), which was directing the German invasion of the Soviet Union and operations on the Eastern Front. Though Stauffenberg did not engage in any coup plotting at this time, his brothers Berthold and Alexander maintained contact with anti-regime figures such as the Kreisau Circle and former commanders such as Hoepner.

Hoffman, in citing Brigadier Oskar Alfred-Berger&#x27;s letters, noted Stauffenberg had commented openly on the ill-treatment of the Jews when he &quot;expressed outrage and shock on this subject to fellow officers in the General Staff Headquarters in Vinnitsa, Ukraine during the summer of 1942.&quot; When Stauffenberg&#x27;s friend, Major Joachim Kuhn, was captured by the Red Army, during interrogation on 2 September 1944, Kuhn claimed that Stauffenberg had told him in August 1942 that &quot;They are shooting Jews in masses. These crimes must not be allowed to continue.&quot;

=== Tunisia, 1943 ===
In November 1942, the Allies landed in French North Africa, and the 10th Panzer Division occupied Vichy France (Case Anton) before being transferred to fight in the Tunisian campaign, as part of the . In 1943, Stauffenberg was promoted to (lieutenant-colonel of the general staff), and was sent to Africa to join the 10th Panzer Division as its Operations Officer in the General Staff (Ia). On 19 February, Rommel launched his counter-offensive against British, American and French forces in Tunisia. The Axis commanders hoped to rapidly break through either the Sbiba or Kasserine Pass into the rear of the British First Army. The assault at Sbiba was halted, so Rommel concentrated on the Kasserine Pass where primarily the Italian 7th Bersaglieri Regiment and 131st Armoured Division Centauro had defeated the American defenders. During the fighting, Stauffenberg drove up to be with the leading tanks and troops of the 10th Panzer Division. The division, together with the 21st Panzer Division, took up defensive positions near Mezzouna on 8 April.

On 7 April 1943, Stauffenberg was involved in driving from one unit to another, directing their movement. Near Mezzouna, his vehicle was part of a column strafed by P-40 Kittyhawk fighter bombers of the Desert Air Force – most likely from No. 3 Squadron RAAF – and he received multiple severe wounds. Stauffenberg spent three months in a hospital in Munich, where he was treated by Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Stauffenberg lost his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. He jokingly remarked to friends never to have really known what to do with so many fingers when he still had all of them. For his injuries, Stauffenberg was awarded the Wound Badge in Gold on 14 April and for his courage the German Cross in Gold on 8 May.

===In the resistance, 1943–44===
For rehabilitation, Stauffenberg was sent to his home, Schloss Lautlingen (today a museum), then still one of the Stauffenberg castles in southern Germany. The Torfels near Meßstetten Bueloch had been visited many times. Initially, he felt frustrated not to be in a position to stage a coup himself. But by the beginning of September 1943, after a somewhat slow recovery from his wounds, he was propositioned by the conspirators and was introduced to Henning von Tresckow as a staff officer to the headquarters of the (&quot;Replacement Army&quot; – charged with training soldiers to reinforce first line divisions at the front), located on the (later ) in Berlin.

There, one of Stauffenberg&#x27;s superiors was General Friedrich Olbricht, a committed member of the resistance movement. The had a unique opportunity to launch a coup, as one of its functions was to have Operation Valkyrie in place. This was a contingency measure to let it assume control of the in the event that internal disturbances blocked communications to the military high command. The &quot;Valkyrie&quot; plan had been agreed to by Hitler but was secretly changed to sweep the rest of his regime from power in the event of his death. In 1943, Henning von Tresckow was deployed on the Eastern Front, giving Stauffenberg control of the resistance. (Tresckow never returned to Germany, as he committed suicide at Królowy Most, Poland, in 1944, after learning of the plot&#x27;s failure.)
A detailed military plan was developed not only to occupy Berlin, but also to take the different headquarters of the German army and of Hitler in East Prussia by military force after the suicide assassination attempt by Axel von dem Bussche in late November 1943. Stauffenberg had von dem Bussche transmit these written orders personally to Major Kuhn once he had arrived at &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; (Wolf&#x27;s Lair) near Rastenburg, East Prussia. However, von dem Bussche had left the Wolfsschanze for the eastern front, after the meeting with Hitler was cancelled, and the attempt could not be made.

Kuhn became a prisoner of war of the Soviets after the 20 July plot. He led the Soviets to the hiding place of the documents in February 1945. In 1989, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev presented these documents to German chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl. The conspirators&#x27; motivations have been a matter of discussion for years in Germany since the war. Many thought the plotters wanted to kill Hitler in order to end the war and to avoid the loss of their privileges as professional officers and members of the nobility.

On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the Allies had landed in France. Stauffenberg, like most other German professional military officers, had absolutely no doubt that the war was lost. Only an immediate armistice could avoid more unnecessary bloodshed and further damage to Germany, its people, and other European nations. However, in late 1943, he had written out demands with which he felt the Allies had to comply in order for Germany to agree to an immediate peace. These demands included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of Wielkopolska and Poznań. 

Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as Austria and the Sudetenland within the Reich, giving autonomy to Alsace-Lorraine and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as Bozen and Meran. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of &quot;nations to deal with its own criminals.&quot; These proposals were directed to only the Western Allies – Stauffenberg wanted Germany to retreat from only the western, southern, and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east.

==20 July plot==
As early as September 1942, Stauffenberg was considering Hans Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt, author of &quot;Unser Weg zum Meer&quot;, as a replacement for Hitler.
From the beginning of September 1943 until 20 July 1944, Stauffenberg was the driving force behind the plot to assassinate Hitler and take control of Germany. His resolve, organizational abilities, and radical approach put an end to inactivity caused by doubts and long discussions on whether military virtues had been made obsolete by Hitler&#x27;s behaviour. With the help of his friend Henning von Tresckow, he united the conspirators and drove them into action.

Stauffenberg was aware that, under German law, he was committing high treason. He openly told young conspirator Axel von dem Bussche in late 1943, (&quot;I am committing high treason with all means at my disposal...&quot;). He justified himself to Bussche by referring to the right under natural law () to defend millions of people&#x27;s lives from the criminal aggressions of Hitler.

Only after the conspirator General Hellmuth Stieff on 7 July 1944 had declared himself unable to assassinate Hitler on a uniforms display at Klessheim castle near Salzburg, did Stauffenberg decide to personally kill Hitler and to run the plot in Berlin. By then, Stauffenberg had great doubts about the possibility of success. Tresckow convinced him to go on with it even if it had no chance of success at all, &quot;The assassination must be attempted. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin&quot;, as this was the only way to prove to the world that the Hitler regime and Germany were not one and the same and that not all Germans supported the regime.

Stauffenberg&#x27;s part in the original plan required him to stay at the Bendlerstraße offices in Berlin, so he could phone regular army units all over Europe in an attempt to convince them to arrest leaders of Nazi political organisations such as the (SD) and the Gestapo. When General Hellmuth Stieff, Chief of Operation at Army High Command, who had regular access to Hitler, backtracked from his earlier commitment to assassinate Hitler, Stauffenberg was forced to take on two critical roles: kill Hitler far from Berlin trigger the military machine in Berlin during office hours of the very same day. Beside Stieff, he was the only conspirator who had regular access to Hitler (during his briefings) by mid-1944, as well as being the only officer among the conspirators thought to have the resolve and persuasiveness to convince German military leaders to throw in with the coup once Hitler was dead. This requirement, alone, greatly increased the chance of a successful coup.

===Assassination attempt===
After several unsuccessful attempts by Stauffenberg to encounter Hitler, Göring, and Himmler at the same time, he went ahead with the attempt at the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; on 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg entered the briefing room carrying a briefcase containing two small bombs. The location had unexpectedly been changed from the to Albert Speer&#x27;s wooden hut due to the heat on this summer&#x27;s day. He left the room to arm the first bomb with specially adapted pliers. This was a difficult task for him as he had lost his right hand and had only three fingers on his left hand. A guard knocked and opened the door, urging him to hurry as the meeting was about to begin. As a result, Stauffenberg was able to arm only one of the bombs. He left the second bomb with his , Werner von Haeften, and returned to the briefing room, where he placed the briefcase under the conference table, as close as he could to Hitler. Some minutes later, he received a planned phone call. He then excused himself and left the room. After his exit, the briefcase was moved by Colonel Heinz Brandt.

When the explosion tore through the hut, Stauffenberg was convinced that no one in the room could have survived. Although four people were killed and almost all survivors were injured, Hitler himself was shielded from the blast by the heavy, solid-oak conference table leg, which Colonel Brandt had placed the briefcase bomb behind, and was only slightly wounded and burned.

Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly left and drove to the nearby airfield. After his return to Berlin, Stauffenberg immediately began to motivate his friends to initiate the second phase: the military coup against the Nazi leaders. Joseph Goebbels announced by radio that Hitler had survived and later, after Hitler spoke on the state radio, the conspirators realised that the coup had failed. They were tracked to their offices and overpowered after a brief shoot-out, during which Stauffenberg was wounded in the shoulder.

===Execution===
In an ultimately failed attempt to save his own life, co-conspirator General Friedrich Fromm, Commander-in-Chief of the Replacement Army present in the Bendlerblock (Headquarters of the Army), charged other conspirators in an impromptu court martial and condemned the ringleaders of the conspiracy to death. Stauffenberg, his aide 1st Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, General Friedrich Olbricht and Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim were executed before 1:00 in the morning (21 July 1944) by a makeshift firing squad in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which was lit by the headlights of a truck.


Stauffenberg was third in line to be executed, with Lieutenant von Haeften after. However, when it was Stauffenberg&#x27;s turn, Lieutenant von Haeften placed himself between the firing squad and Stauffenberg, and received the bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn came, Stauffenberg spoke his last words, (&quot;Long live sacred Germany!&quot;), or, possibly, (&quot;Long live secret Germany!&quot;), in reference to Stefan George and the anti-Nazi circle. 

Fromm ordered that the executed officers (his former co-conspirators) receive an immediate burial with military honours in the Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof in Berlin&#x27;s Schöneberg district. The next day, however, Stauffenberg&#x27;s body was exhumed by the SS, stripped of his medals and insignia, and cremated.

Another central figure in the plot was Stauffenberg&#x27;s eldest brother, Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. On 10 August 1944, Berthold was tried before Judge-President Roland Freisler in the special &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; (). This court was established by Hitler for political offences. Berthold was one of eight conspirators executed by slow strangulation at Plötzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day. Before he was killed, Berthold was throttled and then revived multiple times. The entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure.

More than 200 were condemned in show trials and executed. Hitler used the 20 July Plot as an excuse to eliminate anyone he feared would oppose him. The traditional military salute was replaced with the Nazi salute. Eventually, over 20,000 Germans were killed or sent to concentration camps in the purge.

==Assessment==

One of the few surviving members of the German resistance, Hans Bernd Gisevius, portrayed Colonel Stauffenberg, whom he had met in July 1944, as a man driven by reasons which had little to do with Christian ideals or repugnance of Nazi ideology. In his autobiographical &quot;Bis zum bitteren Ende&quot; (&quot;To the Bitter End&quot;), Gisevius wrote:
Historian Peter Hoffman questions Gisevius&#x27;s evaluations based on the latter&#x27;s brief acquaintance with Stauffenberg, misreporting of Stauffenberg&#x27;s actions, and apparent rivalry with him:
British historian Richard J. Evans, in his books on the Third Reich, covered various aspects of Stauffenberg&#x27;s beliefs and philosophy. He wrote an article originally published in &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, 23 January 2009. entitled &quot;Why did Stauffenberg plant the bomb?&quot; which states, &quot;Was it because Hitler was losing the war? Was it to put an end to the mass murder of the Jews? Or was it to save Germany&#x27;s honour? The overwhelming support, toleration, or silent acquiescence&quot; from the people of his country for Hitler, which was also being heavily censored and constantly fed propaganda, meant any action must be swift and successful. Evans writes, &quot;Had Stauffenberg&#x27;s bomb succeeded in killing Hitler, it is unlikely that the military coup planned to follow it would have moved the leading conspirators smoothly into power&quot;.

However, Karl Heinz Bohrer, a cultural critic, literary scholar, and publisher, criticized Evans&#x27; views in an article originally published in the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, 30 January 2010. Although agreeing that Evans is historically correct in much of his writing, Bohrer feels that Evans twists time lines and misrepresents certain aspects. He wrote of Evans, &quot;In the course of his problematic argument he walks into two traps: 1. by contesting Stauffenberg&#x27;s &quot;moral motivation&quot;; 2. by contesting Stauffenberg&#x27;s suitability as role model.&quot; He further writes, &quot;If then, as Evans notes with initial objectivity, Stauffenberg had a strong moral imperative – whether this stemmed from an aristocratic code of honour, Catholic doctrine or Romantic poetry – then this also underpinned his initial affinity for National Socialism which Stauffenberg misinterpreted as &#x27;spiritual renewal&#x27;&quot;.

In 1980, the German government established a memorial for the failed anti-Nazi resistance movement in a part of the Bendlerblock, the remainder of which currently houses the Berlin offices of the German Ministry of Defense (whose main offices remain in Bonn). The was renamed the , and the Bendlerblock now houses the Memorial to the German Resistance, a permanent exhibition with more than 5,000 photographs and documents showing the various resistance organisations at work during the Hitler era. The courtyard where the officers were shot on 21 July 1944 is now a memorial site, with a plaque commemorating the events and a bronze figure of a young man with his hands symbolically bound which resembles Count von Stauffenberg.

==Family==

Stauffenberg married Elisabeth Magdalena &quot;Nina&quot; Freiin von Lerchenfeld on 26 September 1933 in Bamberg. Born into an old Bavarian nobility, House of Lerchenfeld, she was third cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Elizabeth II. They had five children: Berthold, Heimeran, Franz-Ludwig, Valerie, and Konstanze, who was born in Frankfurt on the Oder seven months after Stauffenberg&#x27;s execution. Stauffenberg lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee. Berthold, Heimeran, Franz-Ludwig, Valerie and Kostanze, who were not told of their father&#x27;s deed, were placed in a foster home for the remainder of the war and were forced to use new surnames, as was considered taboo.

Nina died at the age of 92 on 2 April 2006 at Kirchlauter near Bamberg and was buried there on 8 April. Berthold went on to become a general in West Germany&#x27;s post-war . Franz-Ludwig became a member of both the German and European parliaments, representing the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. In 2008, her youngest daughter, Konstanze Alexandra Ruth Maria von Schulthess-Rechberg (b. 1945) wrote a best-selling book about her mother, &quot;Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg&quot;.

==Legacy==
After the war, a United States intelligence officer, Ernie Blake, who was involved in interrogation of Nazi officers, went on to establish a ski area in Taos, New Mexico. He named a ski run on the West Basin Ridge &quot;Stauffenberg&quot;, after von Stauffenberg (as well as three other runs after the names of other German officers who took part in the assassination attempt: Oster, von Tresckow, and Fabian).

==In media==
Dramas with portrayals of Stauffenberg include &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967; Gérard Buhr), the Russian film series &quot;Liberation&quot; &quot;(Освобождение)&quot; released in 1970 and 1971, directed by Yuri Ozerov and with East German actors, Alfred Struwe played Stauffenberg, the third film, Part 2 (Direction of the Main Blow), depicts the plot; &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988, Sky du Mont), &quot;The Plot to Kill Hitler&quot; (1990, Brad Davis),&quot; Stauffenberg&quot; (2004, Sebastian Koch), and &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008, Tom Cruise).

<doc id="62936" wikidata="Q191750" url="?curid=62936" title="Perejil Island">
<text>Perejil Island, also known as Parsley Island, is a small, uninhabited rocky islet located off the coast of Morocco. It is administered by Spain as one of the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot;, and its sovereignty is disputed by Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Isla de Perejil&quot; literally means &quot;Parsley Island&quot; in Spanish. Its original Berber name is Tura, meaning &quot;empty&quot;. It is sometimes referred to in Arabic as &quot;Jazirat al-Ma&#x27;danus&quot; (), which is a translation of &quot;Parsley Island&quot;.

In Moroccan historical references, it is only known as &quot;Tura&quot;. In his speech to the Moroccan people commemorating the &quot;Throne Day&quot; on 30 July 2002, the King of Morocco used the name &quot;Tura&quot; exclusively, when he mentioned the armed incident with Spain over the island.

== Geography ==
The island lies off the coast of Morocco, from the border of the territory of the Spanish city of Ceuta, to Ceuta itself and from mainland Spain. The island is about in size, with an area of 15 ha or . It has a maximum height of above sea level.

== History ==
V. Bérnard identified Perejil with the mythical island of Ogygia where one of the daughters of Atlas, Calypso, detained Odysseus for seven years, according to the myth.

In 1415, Portugal, along with the reconquest of Ceuta (Part of the old Hispania Tangeriana), took possession of the nearby islet from the Marinid Sultanate, a predecessor to the current state of Morocco. In 1580, Portugal came under the sovereignty of Philip I of Portugal, who was also King of Spain, creating an Iberian Union under one king, without unifying the countries. When the Union split in 1640, Ceuta remained under Spanish sovereignty.

== Spain-Morocco disputes ==

The islet&#x27;s sovereignty is disputed by Morocco and Spain. Local Moroccan shepherds used it for grazing livestock, but the vast majority of Spaniards and Moroccans had not heard of the islet until 11 July 2002, when a group of Moroccan soldiers set up a base on the islet. The Moroccan government said that they set foot on the island in order to monitor illegal immigration, a justification the Spanish government rejected as there had been little co-operation on the matter at the time (a repeated source of complaint from Spain). After protests from the Spanish government, led by Prime Minister José María Aznar, Morocco replaced the soldiers with cadets from the Moroccan Navy, who then installed a fixed base on the island. This further angered the Spanish government and both countries restated their claims to the islet. Almost all European Union member states fully supported Spain&#x27;s objections, with the exception of France and Portugal, whose government issued a statement regretting the incident. Morocco&#x27;s claims had official support from the Arab League, except for Algeria, which restated its recognition of Spanish sovereignty over the exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

On the morning of 18 July 2002, Spain launched Operation Romeo-Sierra, a military attempt to take over the island. The operation was successful, and within hours the Spanish had taken control of the island and custody of the Moroccan naval cadets, who had not resisted the Spanish commando attack force, Grupo de Operaciones Especiales III. The operation was launched in conjunction with the Spanish Navy and Spanish Air Force. The Spanish transferred the captured Moroccans by helicopter to the headquarters of the Guardia Civil in Ceuta, who then transported the cadets to the Moroccan border. Over the course of the day, the Spanish Legion replaced the commandos and remained on the island until Morocco, after mediation by the United States, led by Colin Powell, agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted.

== Sovereignty ==
Perejil Island has no permanent human population. Goats are pastured there, and the Moroccan government expressed worries that smugglers and terrorists, in addition to illegal immigrants, were using the island. The island is well monitored from both sides in order to maintain the status quo that leaves it deserted and virtually a no man&#x27;s land.

Morocco wants to control the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla along with several small rocks and islets off the coast of Morocco. The crisis over Perejil Island was seen by the Spanish government as a way for Morocco to test the waters in regard to Spain&#x27;s will to defend Ceuta and Melilla.

== Migration ==
In June 2014, Spain requested that the Moroccan forces enter the island to expel sub-Saharan migrants.

== Popular culture ==
The international incident is recounted in a 2016 film, &quot;La Isla&quot;, which is largely based on the facts of the dispute.

<doc id="62948" wikidata="Q51727" url="?curid=62948" title="Count Dooku">
<text>Count Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He was introduced in the prequel film trilogy, first appearing in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and then returning in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). He is portrayed by Christopher Lee in both films, and is voiced by Corey Burton in most of the video games and animated productions in which he appears. The animated productions include the series &quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008–2014; 2020), and &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; (2022). Lee voices Dooku in the 2008 animated film &quot;The Clone Wars.&quot; Dooku also appears in novels and comics.

Dooku is the Count of Serenno, his home planet. He is also a former Jedi Master who was trained by Yoda. He becomes disillusioned with the Galactic Senate and the Jedi Order, and eventually turns to the dark side of the Force. He becomes an apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and plays a pivotal role in his master&#x27;s rise to power. Dooku leads the Confederacy of Independent Systems throughout the Clone Wars, all the while engineering the creation of the Republic&#x27;s clone army. Although he hopes to eventually overthrow Sidious, Dooku is ultimately betrayed by his master, who arranges his death at the hands of Anakin Skywalker.

== Appearances ==
===Films===
====&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;====
Count Dooku was introduced in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) as a former Jedi Master who had left the Jedi due to him having lost faith in the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic the Jedi served. He became the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a confederation of planetary systems rebelling against the Republic. Dooku believes that the Republic is corrupt and gives excessive taxation, that its politicians are more interested in maintaining the bureaucracy and enriching themselves than in properly representing their people, as well as believing that they&#x27;re more focusing in the Republic-centric Core Worlds and neglecting the others.

Dooku recruits the bounty hunter Jango Fett to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant, but the attempt is foiled by her Jedi protectors. Dooku captures the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on Geonosis, and tells him that thousands of senators are under the influence of a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious. Dooku asserts that he is attempting to save the Republic, and tries to convince Obi-Wan to join him. When Padmé and Anakin Skywalker arrive on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan, Dooku captures them as well and sentences all three to death.

A Jedi strike team eventually arrives to rescue the trio, and are soon joined by the Republic&#x27;s new clone army, resulting in a large-scale battle between the Republic and Separatist forces. Dooku tries to flee, but Obi-Wan and Anakin follow him and engage him in a lightsaber duel. Dooku subdues Anakin with Force lightning, wounds Obi-Wan, then cuts off Anakin&#x27;s arm. Dooku&#x27;s former master Yoda then arrives and the two duel. Unable to match Yoda&#x27;s prowess, Dooku distracts him by using the Force to dislodge a large pillar and send it falling toward Anakin and Obi-Wan. While Yoda is saving the two injured Jedi, Dooku escapes the planet. He brings the designs for the Death Star to his master Darth Sidious, informing him that the war has begun and that their plan is working.

====&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;====
&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) takes place three years after &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Dooku and the Separatist commander General Grievous have kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine—Sidious&#x27;s alter ego—as part of a plan orchestrated by Palpatine to lure Anakin to the dark side of the Force. Unknown to Dooku, Sidious desired Anakin to replace him as his Sith apprentice due to how powerful he was, and as such, intended for Anakin to kill Dooku in order to lure him to the dark side. Anakin and Obi-Wan board Grievous&#x27;s ship and confront Dooku, who knocks Obi-Wan unconscious. Anakin then overpowers Dooku and severs both of his hands. Palpatine then betrays his apprentice by ordering Anakin to kill him, much to the horror of Dooku. Despite Anakin&#x27;s reluctance as killing an unarmed prisoner is not Jedi way, Palpatine&#x27;s urging leads to Anakin killing and decapitating the helpless Count.

In a deleted scene, Dooku claims that he arranged for Tusken Raiders to kidnap and kill Anakin&#x27;s mother, as seen in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;.

In the 2008 animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, take place after the events of &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Dooku plots to bring Jabba the Hutt into the folds of the Confederacy. He orchestrates the kidnapping of Jabba&#x27;s son Rotta by Jabba&#x27;s uncle Ziro. When Jabba requests Jedi assistance to rescue his son, Dooku plans to frame the Jedi for the kidnapping. Dooku duels Anakin for the first time since their encounter in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. The duel ends in a draw, and Anakin and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano eventually foil Dooku&#x27;s plan.

===Television===
====&quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008–2014)====
In the 2008 animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, set between &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Dooku is the political leader of the Separatists, and the main antagonist. In addition to sending Grievous and Ventress on missions to antagonize the Republic, he works with the terrorist group Death Watch to give the Republic a reason to send a military presence to Mandalore, which would play in his favor. The plan falls through when Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore urges the Galactic Senate to hold off a military force.

In the third season, Dooku is forced to eliminate his apprentice Ventress to prove his loyalty to Darth Sidious. Ventress survives, however, and works with Mother Talzin to kill Dooku by giving him Savage Opress as a replacement apprentice. During a confrontation between Dooku and Ventress, Savage turns on both. In the fourth season, Dooku defeats Anakin in three separate lightsaber duels, and gets his revenge on Ventress by having General Grievous order the systematic genocide of the Nightsisters. In the fifth season, Dooku plays minor roles via hologram in guiding King Rash of Onderon and Grievous taking over Florrum.

In the sixth season, Dooku finds out the clone trooper Tup executed Order 66 prematurely due to a malfunction in his inhibitor chip, which he and Sidious had instilled in the Clones from the start in order to compel the Clone Troopers to turn against the Jedi at the right time. Not wanting the Jedi to discover his and Sidious&#x27;s plans, he works behind the scenes to stop the Republic&#x27;s investigation. He then manipulates the Banking Clan and its representative Rush Clovis into putting all their resources in the hands of the Sith, bringing war to the planet Scipio. Later, the Jedi find a lightsaber belonging to deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas—whom Dooku betrayed and murdered years earlier—and start an investigation. Sidious forces Dooku to clean up their trail. Dooku confronts Anakin and Obi-Wan on Oba Diah, revealing his alter-ego Darth Tyranus to the Jedi, and they realize that it was he who created the clone army. Some further investigation by Yoda prompts Dooku and Sidious to perform a Sith ritual in an unsuccessful attempt to break the Jedi Master; in a vision experienced by Yoda, Dooku fights Anakin, who swiftly defeats and executes him, in a manner very similar to his eventual demise.

Count Dooku does not directly appear in the seventh season. However, as the events of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; are concurrent with the season&#x27;s final arc, Ahsoka Tano is informed of his demise at Anakin&#x27;s hands by Obi-Wan, who tells her that it is important to capture Maul, being the only way the Jedi can discover the true identity of Darth Sidious after Dooku&#x27;s death.

====&quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; (2022)====
A younger Count Dooku serves as one of the two protagonists of animated miniseries &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;, voiced once again by Corey Burton. He is the focus of the second, third, and fourth episodes, which depict his life as a Jedi, his increasing dissatisfaction with the corruption in the Jedi Order and the Senate, and his eventual fall to the Dark Side. The miniseries also focuses on Dooku&#x27;s friendship with his padawan Qui-Gon Jinn, with original actor Liam Neeson returning to voice the character in the episode set concurrently to &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.

===Novels===
====&quot;Dark Disciple&quot; (2015)====
An unfinished sixth season arc of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; was adapted into the 2015 novel &quot;Dark Disciple&quot; by Christie Golden. In the story, Dooku commands a genocidal attack on the planet Mahranee, leading the Jedi Council to send Master Quinlan Vos on a mission to assassinate Dooku. Vos partners with Dooku&#x27;s former apprentice Asajj Ventress for the mission. The two confront Dooku on the planet Raxus Secundus, where Dooku was being awarded at a ceremony, but are no match for the Sith Lord, who captures Vos and forces Ventress to flee. Dooku takes Vos to Serenno, where he tortures him, eventually turning him to the dark side. Sometime later, the Jedi Council liberates Vos with the assistance of Ventress. However, upon deducing that he has turned to the dark side, the Council sends him to face Dooku again as a test of loyalty, with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker tailing him. Vos defeats Dooku, but spares his life and instead demands Dooku to lead him to Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan and Anakin arrest them both. Vos and Dooku escape aboard Ventress&#x27;s ship, killing two Jedi and many clone troopers in the process. They are shot down and crash-land on Christophsis, where they seek refuge in a Separatist tower, which is soon under attack by Jedi and Republic forces. Dooku attempts to kill Vos with Force lightning, but Ventress sacrifices her life and saves Vos. After killing Ventress, Dooku escapes the planet.

====&quot;Dooku: Jedi Lost&quot; (2017)====
In the audiobook &quot;&quot; by Cavan Scott, Dooku meets his sister Jenza, brother Ramil, and father Count Gora, when he visits his homeworld of Serenno as a Jedi Initiate. Dooku begins corresponding with Jenza, keeping their communications a secret for years. The audiobook also details several adventures Dooku has with his best friend, Sifo-Dyas, and Dyas&#x27;s Jedi Master, Lene Kostana. During one mission, Dooku sees visions of many different futures through the Force, which shake him to the core. Eventually, Dooku becomes a Jedi Knight, trains two Padawans (one being Qui-Gon) to knighthood, and joins the Jedi Council, hoping to bring about real change in the Republic. However, after he saves his homeworld of Serenno from invaders, he decides to remain to help his planet rebuild, leaving the Jedi Order and becoming Count Dooku of Serenno.

====&quot;Thrawn: Alliances&quot; (2018)====
In &quot;&quot;, Dooku is mentioned by Duke Solha and Padmé Amidala while they fight at Mokivj. Solha establishes that the Count had dispatched him and his siblings to Mokivj to produce cortosis B2 super battle droids for the Clone Wars.

====&quot;Master &amp; Apprentice&quot; (2019)====
The novel &quot;Master &amp; Apprentice&quot; by Claudia Gray recounts several adventures from Qui-Gon Jinn&#x27;s apprenticeship under Dooku, as well as Dooku&#x27;s obsession with Jedi prophecies and seeming use of Force lightning during a mission. The novel also reveals that Dooku had one other apprentice before Qui-Gon, Rael Averross.

== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ==
Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

=== Comics ===
In the &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot; series, set during the Clone Wars, Dooku trains multiple Dark Jedi apprentices, most of whom he uses as minions. His apprentices include Ventress, Tol Skorr and renegade Jedi Quinlan Vos. Vos initially intended to infiltrate the Separatists as a spy for the Jedi Council but instead nearly falls to the dark side.

=== Novels ===
In Jude Watson&#x27;s &quot;Legacy of the Jedi&quot;, Dooku appears in Parts 1, 2, and 4, and is mentioned in Part 3. In Part 1, he is first tempted by the dark side of the Force as a child when his best friend and fellow Padawan Lorian Nod steals an ancient Sith Holocron from the Jedi Archives. When Nod is caught, Nod lies and says that the theft was Dooku&#x27;s idea. However, Dooku manages to convince the Jedi Council of the truth, and Nod is then expelled from the Jedi Order. It is later implied that Dooku himself steals the Holocron because he is intrigued by the Sith&#x27;s open embrace of power. In Part 2, set 13 years later, he is a Jedi Knight, and takes Qui-Gon Jinn as his Padawan apprentice. He encounters Nod while defending a Senator from space pirates, and defeats him in combat, almost executing him. However, Qui-Gon convinces him to spare Nod&#x27;s life, and he and Dooku turn Nod over to the authorities. In Part 3, set 32 years later, Qui-Gon, now a Jedi Knight, remarks that he has not seen Dooku in years, noting that their relationship was never friendly. Finally in Part 4, set in the midst of the Clone Wars, Dooku, now a Sith, kills Nod after his former friend refuses to join the Separatists.

In Sean Stewart&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Dooku attempts to trap Yoda by offering to negotiate an end to the Clone Wars. Dooku attempts unsuccessfully to sway Yoda to his cause, while Yoda nearly convinces Dooku to return to the Jedi Order. When Anakin and Obi-Wan appear unexpectedly, Dooku believes that Yoda was trying to set him up to be captured, and renounces his former master once and for all. In the novel, it is also revealed that Dooku always resented his parents for &quot;giving him away&quot; to the Jedi Order.

In James Luceno&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth of Evil&quot;, Dooku engineers Grievous&#x27;s transformation into a cyborg and trains him in lightsaber combat. He then schemes with Sidious to invade Coruscant in what he believes to be a plot to kill Obi-Wan and initiate Anakin into the Sith.

Matthew Stover&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; expands upon Dooku&#x27;s character; it portrays him as an evil man who sees others as mere objects to be used and discarded, and who despises the galaxy&#x27;s non-human species and plans to exterminate and enslave them once in power. It also explains that Dooku believes that Palpatine&#x27;s staged kidnapping is part of a plan to kill Obi-Wan and turn Anakin to the dark side. In this scenario, once the Republic becomes the Galactic Empire, Dooku and Palpatine will rule the galaxy together, while Anakin will command a &quot;Sith Army&quot; formed from the remains of the Jedi. The novelization depicts Dooku&#x27;s death scene from his point of view after realizing that Sidious has betrayed and used him. In his final moments, he realizes that Palpatine used him as a means to engineer the war and as a placeholder for Anakin, whom he intended to be his apprentice all along. He ultimately realizes that everything he has done has been all for nothing, before being ruthlessly executed by Skywalker.

=== &quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003–2005) ===
During the 2003 animated micro-series &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;, Count Dooku leads the Separatists from behind the scenes, taking the dark assassin Asajj Ventress as his apprentice while training General Grievous in lightsaber combat. In the final episode, he plays a part in Grievous&#x27;s attack on Coruscant and kidnapping Palpatine, setting the stage for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

===Toys===
A number of toys based on Count Dooku have been produced, including the Lego set &quot;Lego Star Wars: Duel on Geonosis&quot; which recreates the duel between Yoda and Dooku portrayed in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, and a Hasbro Count Dooku lightsaber.

<doc id="62950" wikidata="Q1056486" url="?curid=62950" title="Ternary numeral system">
<text>A ternary numeral system (also called base 3 or trinary) has three as its base. Analogous to a bit, a ternary digit is a trit (trinary digit). One trit is equivalent to log2 3 (about 1.58496) bits of information.

Although &quot;ternary&quot; most often refers to a system in which the three digits are all non–negative numbers; specifically , , and , the adjective also lends its name to the balanced ternary system; comprising the digits −1, 0 and +1, used in comparison logic and ternary computers.

== Comparison to other bases ==

Representations of integer numbers in ternary do not get uncomfortably lengthy as quickly as in binary. For example, decimal 365 or senary corresponds to binary (nine bits) and to ternary (six digits). However, they are still far less compact than the corresponding representations in bases such as decimal – see below for a compact way to codify ternary using nonary (base 9) and septemvigesimal (base 27).




As for rational numbers, ternary offers a convenient way to represent as same as senary (as opposed to its cumbersome representation as an infinite string of recurring digits in decimal); but a major drawback is that, in turn, ternary does not offer a finite representation for (nor for , , etc.), because 2 is not a prime factor of the base; as with base two, one-tenth (decimal, senary ) is not representable exactly (that would need e.g. decimal); nor is one-sixth (senary , decimal ).

=== Sum of the digits in ternary as opposed to binary ===
The value of a binary number with &quot;n&quot; bits that are all 1 is .

Similarly, for a number &quot;N&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) with base &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; digits, all of which are the maximal digit value , we can write:
: 
: and
: , so
: , or

Then
: 

For a three-digit ternary number, .

=== Compact ternary representation: base 9 and 27 ===
Nonary (base 9, each digit is two ternary digits) or septemvigesimal (base 27, each digit is three ternary digits) can be used for compact representation of ternary, similar to how octal and hexadecimal systems are used in place of binary.

==Practical usage==

In certain analog logic, the state of the circuit is often expressed ternary. This is most commonly seen in CMOS circuits, and also in transistor–transistor logic with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open (high-&quot;Z&quot;). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.

A rare &quot;ternary point&quot; in common use is for defensive statistics in American baseball (usually just for pitchers), to denote fractional parts of an inning. Since the team on offense is allowed three outs, each out is considered one third of a defensive inning and is denoted as .1. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus achieving 2 outs in the 7th inning, his innings pitched column for that game would be listed as 3.2, the equivalent of (which is sometimes used as an alternative by some record keepers). In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.

Ternary numbers can be used to convey self-similar structures like the Sierpinski triangle or the Cantor set conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1. Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last non-zero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example: 0.1020 is equivalent to 0.1012222... because the expansions are the same until the &quot;two&quot; of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.

Ternary is the integer base with the lowest radix economy, followed closely by binary and quaternary. This is due to its proximity to the mathematical constant &quot;e&quot;. It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency. It is also used to represent three-option &quot;trees&quot;, such as phone menu systems, which allow a simple path to any branch.

A form of redundant binary representation called a binary signed-digit number system, a form of signed-digit representation, is sometimes used in low-level software and hardware to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate carries.

===Binary-coded ternary===
Simulation of ternary computers using binary computers, or interfacing between ternary and binary computers, can involve use of binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, with two or three bits used to encode each trit. BCT encoding is analogous to binary-coded decimal (BCD) encoding. If the trit values 0, 1 and 2 are encoded 00, 01 and 10, conversion in either direction between binary-coded ternary and binary can be done in logarithmic time. A library of C code supporting BCT arithmetic is available.

===Tryte===
Some ternary computers such as the Setun defined a tryte to be six trits or approximately 9.5 bits (holding more information than the &quot;de facto&quot; binary byte).

<doc id="62951" wikidata="Q170550" url="?curid=62951" title="Pope Adeodatus I">
<text>Pope Adeodatus I (570 – 8 November 618), also called Deodatus I or Deusdedit, was the bishop of Rome from 19 October 615 to his death. He was the first priest to be elected pope since John II in 533. The first use of lead seals or &quot;bullae&quot; on papal documents is attributed to him. His feast day is 8 November.

==Biography==
Adeodatus was born in Rome, the son of a subdeacon named Stephanus or Stephen. He served as a priest for 40 years before his election and was the first priest to be elected pope since John II in 533.

==Pontificate==
Almost nothing is known about Adeodatus I&#x27;s pontificate. It represents the second wave of opposition to Gregory the Great&#x27;s papal reforms, the first being the pontificate of Sabinian. He reversed the practice of his predecessor, Boniface IV, of filling the papal administrative ranks with monks by recalling the clergy to such positions and by ordaining some 14 priests, the first ordinations in Rome since Gregory&#x27;s pontificate. According to tradition, Adeodatus was the first pope to use lead seals (&quot;bullae&quot;) on papal documents, which in time came to be called &quot;papal bulls&quot;. One &quot;bulla&quot; dating from his reign is still preserved, the obverse of which represents the Good Shepherd in the midst of His sheep, with the letters Alpha and Omega underneath, while the reverse bears the inscription: Deusdedit Papæ.

In August 618, an earthquake struck Rome, followed by an outbreak of scabies. Adeodatus died 8 November 618, and was eventually succeeded by Boniface V. His feast day is 8 November. He is also a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church as one of the pre-Schism &quot;Orthodox Popes of Rome&quot;.

<doc id="62952" wikidata="Q51736" url="?curid=62952" title="Qui-Gon Jinn">
<text>Qui-Gon Jinn () is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He was introduced as a Jedi Master in the prequel film &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), and is portrayed by Liam Neeson. He appears in the series &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;, and is featured as a Force spirit in the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008) and the live-action miniseries &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; (2022). Qui-Gon also appears in novels, comics and video games.

In &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Qui-Gon and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi are tasked with protecting Padmé Amidala, the queen of Naboo. On the planet Tatooine, they encounter a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, whom Qui-Gon believes is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; destined to bring balance to the Force. When Qui-Gon is fatally wounded in a lightsaber duel, he asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin. The 2005 film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; reveals that Qui-Gon learned how to become a Force spirit after death, an ability which he later taught to Obi-Wan and Yoda.

==Creation==
George Lucas created the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, and wrote and directed &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. He created the character Qui-Gon Jinn for the film. Although Qui-Gon is the master of Obi-Wan Kenobi and is older than him, Lucas had considered making Qui-Gon the younger Jedi. Lucas described the character as independent and &quot;always testing the rules&quot;. He said Qui-Gon refuses to &quot;go along with the program&quot;.

Lucas originally envisioned an American actor in the role of Qui-Gon, but ultimately cast the Northern Irish actor Liam Neeson. He described Neeson as a &quot;master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands&quot;. Neeson described Qui-Gon as wise, confident, philosophical and very skilled in martial arts. He said the Jedi Master has &quot;a magical quality that enables him to see into the future. He&#x27;s not really a rebel, but he has his own code.&quot;

Qui-Gon Jinn&#x27;s name is derived from the Chinese word &quot;qigong&quot; (simplified Chinese: 气功; traditional Chinese: 氣功), and the Arabic word &quot;jinn&quot; (جِنّ). Qigong is a system of breathing and exercise designed to support physical and mental health, while a jinn is a type of spirit found in Arabian mythology. &quot;Qui-Gon Jinn&quot; can be translated as &quot;Guardian Spirit of the Living Force.&quot; &quot;Jinn&quot; also resembles the Chinese word for power, &quot;jin&quot; (勁), and the martial arts concept &quot;fa jin&quot;, which is the explosive release of internal strength or power.

==Appearances==
===Prequel trilogy===

Qui-Gon is introduced in the first film of the prequel trilogy, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999). He is portrayed by Liam Neeson. Qui-Gon and his Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to Naboo to resolve a conflict involving the Trade Federation, a business conglomerate that has blockaded the planet for political leverage. When the two Jedi arrive, the Federation attempts to assassinate them. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan retreat to Naboo, rescue its besieged queen, Padmé Amidala, then leave for Coruscant, the galactic capital. During the journey, they land on Tatooine to repair their ship. Qui-Gon encounters a nine-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, whose potential with the Force is the highest ever detected. The Jedi Master becomes intrigued when Anakin&#x27;s mother tells him that the boy had no father. Believing that Anakin could be the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of Jedi prophecy destined to bring balance to the Force, Qui-Gon secures the boy&#x27;s freedom and decides to bring him before the Jedi Council on Coruscant. Before leaving Tatooine, Qui-Gon duels with a mysterious warrior dressed in black.

On Coruscant, Qui-Gon asks the Council to allow Anakin to be trained as a Jedi. Master Yoda senses fear in the boy, and the Council denies the request. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows that he will train Anakin himself. Padmé, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan return to Naboo, where they once again encounter the dark warrior, who reveals himself to be the Sith Lord Darth Maul. During a ferocious lightsaber battle, Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan responds by killing Maul, then promises his dying master that he will train Anakin. 

In the second film, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), Neeson provides the voice of Qui-Gon. When Anakin is slaughtering the Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, the Jedi Master&#x27;s voice can be heard. Near the end of the third film, &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that he has been communicating with the spirit of Qui-Gon.

===&quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;===
Neeson provides the voice of Qui-Gon in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). After Rey collapses during her confrontation with the resurrected Darth Sidious, she hears the voices of various deceased Jedi, including Qui-Gon. The Jedi give her the strength to continue the battle.

===Television===
Qui-Gon is voiced by Neeson in the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008–2014; 2020). In season three, he informs Obi-Wan and Anakin about three beings who share his belief that Anakin is the Chosen One. These beings are known as the Father (the unifying Force manifestation), the Daughter (the light side incarnation) and the Son (the dark side embodiment). In the sixth season of the series, Qui-Gon&#x27;s disembodied voice instructs Yoda to learn the secret of Force immortality.

Qui-Gon returns in the 2022 miniseries &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;. An older version of the character is voiced by Liam Neeson, while a younger version is voiced by Neeson&#x27;s son, Micheál Richardson. In the second episode, the young Qui-Gon serves as Padawan to Count Dooku, and helps to investigate a mysterious kidnapping on an impoverished planet. When Qui-Gon stops Dooku from losing his temper and killing a corrupt senator, Dooku commends him for his wisdom. In the fourth episode of the series, Jedi Master Qui-Gon and Dooku discuss the Jedi Council&#x27;s refusal to believe that Darth Maul is a Sith Lord. After Qui-Gon&#x27;s death, a grieving Dooku remembers how, as a boy, Qui-Gon was fascinated by the tree in the Jedi Temple.

Early in the 2022 miniseries &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, the titular Jedi tries unsuccessfully to reach out to Qui-Gon&#x27;s Force spirit. In the final episode, Qui-Gon finally appears to Obi-Wan. Neeson reprises his role as the Jedi Master.

===Novels===
The 2019 novel &quot;Master and Apprentice&quot; features Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.

==&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;==
Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

===Novels===
Qui-Gon&#x27;s life prior to &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is detailed in the &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; series. In &quot;The Rising Force&quot;, Yoda encourages the Jedi Knight to take a new Padawan learner. Qui-Gon&#x27;s previous apprentice, Xanatos, had turned to the dark side of the Force. Qui-Gon observes a lightsaber tournament among a group of the Temple&#x27;s older students, which includes the twelve-year-old Obi-Wan. He takes note of Obi-Wan&#x27;s skills, but refuses to train him due to his uncontrolled anger. On a mission to Bandomeer, Qui-Gon again encounters Obi-Wan, who is being sent to the planet to begin life as an agricultural laborer. During the journey, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan defend a group of Arcona from the criminal organization Offworld Corporation. When they arrive on Bandomeer, Qui-Gon receives a letter from Xanatos.

In &quot;The Dark Rival&quot;, it is revealed that Xanatos is now the leader of Offworld. Qui-Gon meets his former apprentice to negotiate an agreement between Offworld and Bandomeer, but ends up dueling with Xanatos instead. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan end Offworld&#x27;s business on Bandomeer, but Xanatos escapes. During the encounter with Xanatos, Qui-Gon realizes Obi-Wan&#x27;s potential and accepts him as his Padawan. In &quot;The Captive Temple&quot;, Xanatos nearly assassinates Yoda, but Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan thwart his plans. When they chase Xanatos back to his homeworld in &quot;The Day of Reckoning&quot;, the fallen Jedi refuses to surrender and commits suicide.

In &quot;Legacy of the Jedi&quot;, an apprentice Qui-Gon accompanies his master Dooku on a diplomatic assignment. Their ship is infiltrated by space pirates led by the rogue Jedi Lorian Nod, a former friend of Dooku&#x27;s. The two battle and Dooku is overcome by anger, but Qui-Gon prevents his master from violating the Jedi Code by committing cold-blooded murder. Years later, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan encounter Nod again and imprison him for his crimes. In &quot;Secrets of the Jedi&quot;, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan embark on a mission with the Jedi Master Adi Gallia and her Padawan Siri Tachi. Qui-Gon and Adi become separated from Obi-Wan and Siri, which leads to the discovery of romantic feelings between the two apprentices. Sensing these feelings in Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon shares the story of his relationship with Tahl, a female Jedi whose murder nearly pushed Qui-Gon to the dark side.

&quot;Cloak of Deception&quot; is set a year before &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight a terrorist organization called the Nebula Front, which is secretly following the orders of Darth Sidious. At the Trade Federation conference on Eriadu, the two Jedi successfully defend Chancellor Valorum but cannot prevent the Neimoidian takeover of the Federation.

===Comics===
In the comic series &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot;, Qui-Gon and other Jedi fight in the Stark Hyperspace War. Qui-Gon saves the life of Nute Gunray, the future Trade Federation viceroy.

===&quot;Clone Wars&quot;===
The animated television series &quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003–2005) was removed from canon in 2014 and placed in the &quot;Legends&quot; universe. Qui-Gon makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Chapter 21&quot;. During Yoda&#x27;s Force dream, Qui-Gon tells Anakin to enter a cave on Dagobah where he will see a vision of his future.

==Other appearances==
Qui-Gon appears in the video games &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Obi-Wan&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&quot;, multiple &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; games, and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; via downloadable content. A bird version of Qui-Gon, called &quot;Quail-Gon&quot;, is playable in &quot;Angry Birds Star Wars II&quot;.

==Reception==
In his review of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Colin Kennedy of &quot;Empire&quot; said that Neeson &quot;manfully carrie[s] the action on his shoulders&quot; throughout the film. He felt that Qui-Gon&#x27;s final words to Obi-Wan—&quot;Promise me you will train the boy&quot;—provide the film with its only emotional weight. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Neeson &quot;holds &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; together&quot;. He said that Qui-Gon is &quot;commanding&quot;, and gives the film &quot;its only hints of emotional dynamism&quot;. For his portrayal of Qui-Gon, Neeson was nominated for the 2000 Saturn Award for Best Actor.

<doc id="62982" wikidata="Q482402" url="?curid=62982" title="Gulf of Tonkin incident">
<text>The Gulf of Tonkin incident () was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It consisted of a confrontation on 2 August 1964, when United States forces were carrying out covert amphibious operations close to North Vietnamese territorial waters, which triggered a response from North Vietnamese forces. The United States government falsely claimed that a second incident occurred on 4 August, between North Vietnamese and United States ships in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Originally, US military claims blamed North Vietnam for the confrontation and the ostensible, but in fact imaginary, incident on 4 August. Later investigation revealed that the second attack never happened. The National Security Agency, an agency of the US Defense Department, had deliberately skewed intelligence to create the impression that an attack had been carried out.

On 2 August, the destroyer , while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was approached by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. &quot;Maddox&quot; fired warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. In the ensuing engagement, one U.S. aircraft (which had been launched from aircraft carrier ) was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties. &quot;Maddox&quot; was &quot;unscathed except for a single bullet hole from a [North] Vietnamese machine gun round&quot;.

On 3 August, destroyer joined &quot;Maddox&quot; and the two destroyers continued the DESOTO mission. On the evening of 4 August, the ships opened fire on radar returns that had been preceded by communications intercepts, which US forces claimed meant an attack was imminent. The commander of the &quot;Maddox&quot; task force, Captain John Herrick, reported that the ships were being attacked by North Vietnamese boats when, in fact, there were no North Vietnamese boats in the area. While Herrick soon reported doubts regarding the task force&#x27;s initial perceptions of the attack, the Johnson administration relied on the wrongly interpreted National Security Agency communications intercepts to conclude that the attack was real.

While doubts regarding the perceived second attack have been expressed since 1964, it was not until years later that it was shown conclusively never to have happened. In the 2003 documentary &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, the former United States Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, admitted that there was no attack on 4 August. In 1995, McNamara met with former North Vietnamese Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on 4 August 1964. &quot;Absolutely nothing&quot;, Giáp replied. Giáp confirmed that the attack had been imaginary. In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that &quot;Maddox&quot; had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on 2 August, but that the incident of 4 August was based on bad naval intelligence and misrepresentations of North Vietnamese communications. The official US government claim is that it was based mostly on erroneously interpreted communications intercepts.

The outcome of the incident was the passage by U.S. Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by communist aggression. The resolution served as Johnson&#x27;s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces to South Vietnam and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.

==Background==

The Geneva Conference in 1954 was intended to settle outstanding issues following the end of hostilities between France and the Viet Minh at the end of the First Indochina War. Neither the United States nor the State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. The accords, which were signed by other participants including the Viet Minh, mandated a temporary ceasefire line, which separated southern and northern Vietnam to be governed by the State of Vietnam and the Viet Minh respectively. The accords called for a general election by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. The accords allowed free movement of the population between the north and south for three hundred days. They also forbade the political interference of other countries in the area, the creation of new governments without the stipulated elections, and foreign military presence. By 1961, South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem faced significant discontent among some quarters of the southern population, including some Buddhists who were opposed to the rule of Diem&#x27;s Catholic supporters. Viet Minh political cadres, who were legally campaigning for the promised elections between 1955 and 1957, were suppressed by the government. In March 1956, the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956. A communist-led uprising began against Diem&#x27;s government in April 1957. The North Vietnamese Communist Party approved a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; on the South at a session in January 1959, and on 28 July, North Vietnamese forces invaded Laos to maintain and upgrade the Ho Chi Minh trail, in support of insurgents in the south. The rebellion, headed by the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong) under the direction of North Vietnam, had intensified by 1961. About 40,000 communist soldiers infiltrated the south from 1961 to 1963.

The Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred during the first year of the Johnson administration. While U.S. President John F. Kennedy had originally supported the policy of sending military advisers to Diem, he had begun to alter his thinking by September 1963, because of what he perceived to be the ineptitude of the Saigon government and its inability and unwillingness to make needed reforms (which led to a U.S.-supported coup which resulted in the death of Diem). Shortly before Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he had begun a limited withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. forces before the end of 1963. Johnson&#x27;s views were likewise complex, but he had supported military escalation as a means of challenging what was perceived to be the Soviet Union&#x27;s expansionist policies. The Cold War policy of containment was to be applied to prevent the fall of Southeast Asia to communism under the precepts of the domino theory. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Johnson ordered in more U.S. forces to support the Saigon government, beginning a protracted United States presence in Southeast Asia.

A highly classified program of covert actions against North Vietnam, known as Operation Plan 34-Alpha, in conjunction with the DESOTO operations, had begun under the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1961. In 1964, the program was transferred to the Defense Department and conducted by the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). For the maritime portion of the covert operation, a set of fast patrol boats had been purchased quietly from Norway and sent to South Vietnam. In 1963, three young Norwegian skippers traveled on a mission in South Vietnam. They were recruited for the job by the Norwegian intelligence officer Alf Martens Meyer. Martens Meyer, who was head of department at the military intelligence staff, operated on behalf of U.S. intelligence. The three skippers did not know who Meyer really was when they agreed to a job that involved them in sabotage missions against North Vietnam.

Although the boats were crewed by South Vietnamese naval personnel, approval for each mission conducted under the plan came directly from Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp Jr., CINCPAC in Honolulu, who received his orders from the White House. After the coastal attacks began, Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam, lodged a complaint with the International Control Commission (ICC), which had been established in 1954 to oversee the terms of the Geneva Accords, but the U.S. denied any involvement. Four years later, Secretary McNamara admitted to Congress that the U.S. ships had in fact been cooperating in the South Vietnamese attacks against North Vietnam. 

In 1962, the U.S. Navy began an electronic warfare support measures (intelligence gathering) program, conducted by destroyer patrols in the western Pacific, with the cover name DESOTO. The first missions in the Tonkin Gulf began in February 1964. While intelligence collected by DESOTO missions could be used by OPLAN-34A planners and commanders, they were separate programs not known to coordinate mission planning except to warn DESOTO patrols to stay clear of 34A operational areas.

On July 29, 1964, the night before it launched actions against North Vietnamese facilities on Hòn Mê and Hòn Ngư islands, the MACV-SOG had launched a covert long-term agent team into North Vietnam, which was promptly captured. On 1 and 2 August, flights of CIA-sponsored Laotian fighter-bombers (piloted by Thai mercenaries) attacked border outposts well within southwestern North Vietnam. According to Edwin Moïse, the Hanoi government (which, unlike the U.S. government, had to give permission at the highest levels for the conduct of such missions) probably assumed that they were all a coordinated effort to escalate military actions against North Vietnam.

==Incident==
Daniel Ellsberg, who was on duty in the Pentagon the night of 4 August, receiving messages from , reported that she was on a DESOTO mission near Northern Vietnamese territorial waters. On 31 July 1964, &quot;Maddox&quot; had begun her mission in the Gulf of Tonkin. Captain George Stephen Morrison was in command of local American forces from his flagship . &quot;Maddox&quot; was under orders not to approach closer than eight miles (13 km) from North Vietnam&#x27;s coast and four miles (6 km) from Hon Nieu island. When a MACV-SOG commando raid was being carried out against Hon Nieu, the ship was away from the attacked area.

===First attack===
In July 1964, &quot;the situation along North Vietnam&#x27;s territorial waters had reached a near boil&quot;, because of South Vietnamese commando raids and airborne operations that inserted intelligence teams into North Vietnam, as well as North Vietnam&#x27;s military response to these operations. On the night of July 30, 1964, South Vietnamese commandos attacked a North Vietnamese radar station on Hòn Mê island. According to Hanyok, &quot;it would be attacks on these islands, especially Hòn Mê, by South Vietnamese commandos, along with the proximity of the &quot;Maddox&quot;, that would set off the confrontation&quot;, although the &quot;Maddox&quot; did not participate in the commando attacks. In this context, on July 31, &quot;Maddox&quot; began patrols of the North Vietnamese coast to collect intelligence, coming within a few miles of Hòn Mê island. A U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, was also stationed nearby.


By 1 August, North Vietnamese patrol boats were tracking &quot;Maddox&quot;, and several intercepted communications indicated that they were preparing to attack. &quot;Maddox&quot; retreated, but the next day, &quot;Maddox&quot;, which had a top speed of 28 knots, resumed her routine patrol, and three North Vietnamese P-4 torpedo boats with a top speed of 50 knots began to follow &quot;Maddox&quot;. The boats were from Squadron 135, commanded by Le Duy Khoai, with the boats commanded by brothers Van Bot, Van Tu, and Van Gian. Intercepted communications indicated that the vessels intended to attack &quot;Maddox&quot;. As the ships approached from the southwest, &quot;Maddox&quot; changed course from northeasterly to southeasterly and increased speed to 25 knots.

As the torpedo boats neared, &quot;Maddox&quot; fired three warning shots. The North Vietnamese boats then attacked, and &quot;Maddox&quot; radioed she was under attack from the three boats, closing to within , while located away from the North Vietnamese coast in international waters. &quot;Maddox&quot; stated she had evaded a torpedo attack and opened fire with its five-inch (127 mm) guns, forcing the torpedo boats away. Two of the torpedo boats had come as close as and released one torpedo each, but neither one was effective, coming no closer than about after &quot;Maddox&quot; evaded them. Another P-4 received a direct hit from a five-inch shell from &quot;Maddox&quot;; its torpedo malfunctioned at launch. Four USN F-8 Crusader jets launched from &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and 15 minutes after &quot;Maddox&quot; had fired her initial warning shots, attacked the retiring P-4s, claiming one was sunk and one heavily damaged. &quot;Maddox&quot; suffered only minor damage from a single 14.5 mm bullet from a P-4&#x27;s KPV heavy machine gun into her superstructure. Retiring to South Vietnamese waters, &quot;Maddox&quot; was joined by the destroyer .

The original account from the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; has been revised in light of a 2001 internal NSA historical study, which states:

&quot;Maddox&quot;, when confronted, was approaching Hòn Mê Island, three to four nautical miles (nmi) (6 to 7 km) inside the limit claimed by North Vietnam. This territorial limit was unrecognized by the United States. After the skirmish, Johnson ordered &quot;Maddox&quot; and &quot;Turner Joy&quot; to stage daylight runs into North Vietnamese waters, testing the limit and North Vietnamese resolve. These runs into North Vietnamese territorial waters coincided with South Vietnamese coastal raids and were interpreted as coordinated operations by the North, which officially acknowledged the engagements of August.

Others, such as Admiral Sharp, maintained that U.S. actions did not provoke the incident. He claimed that the North Vietnamese had tracked &quot;Maddox&quot; along the coast by radar and were thus aware that the destroyer had not actually attacked North Vietnam and that Hanoi (or the local commander) had ordered its craft to engage &quot;Maddox&quot; anyway. North Vietnamese general Phùng Thế Tài later claimed that &quot;Maddox&quot; had been tracked since 31 July and that she had attacked fishing boats on August 2 forcing the North Vietnamese Navy to &quot;fight back&quot;.

Sharp also noted that orders given to &quot;Maddox&quot; to stay off the North Vietnamese coast put the ship in international waters, as North Vietnam claimed only a limit as its territory (or off of its off-shore islands). In addition, many nations had previously carried out similar missions all over the world, and the destroyer had earlier conducted an intelligence-gathering mission in similar circumstances without incident.

Sharp&#x27;s claims, however, included some factually incorrect statements. North Vietnam did not adhere to an 8-kilometer (5 mi) limit for its territorial waters; instead it adhered to a limit claimed by French Indochina in 1936. Moreover it officially claimed a 12 nmi limit, which is practically identical to the old 20 km French claim, after the incidents of August, in September 1964. The North Vietnamese stance is that they always considered a 12 nautical mile limit, consistent with the positions regarding the law of the sea of both the Soviet Union and China, their main allies.

===Second alleged attack===
On 4 August, another DESOTO patrol off the North Vietnamese coast was launched by &quot;Maddox&quot; and &quot;Turner Joy&quot;, to &quot;show the flag&quot; after the first incident. This time their orders indicated that the ships were to close to no less than from the coast of North Vietnam. During an evening of rough weather and heavy seas, the destroyers received radar, sonar, and radio signals that they believed signaled another attack by the North Vietnamese navy. For some two hours (from about 21:40 to about 23:35, local time) the ships fired on radar targets and maneuvered vigorously amid electronic and visual reports of enemies. Despite the Navy&#x27;s claim that two attacking torpedo boats had been sunk, there was no wreckage, bodies of dead North Vietnamese sailors, or other physical evidence present at the scene of the alleged engagement.

At 01:27 local time (13:27 Washington time), Herrick sent a cable in which he acknowledged that the second attack may not have happened and that there may actually have been no Vietnamese craft in the area: &quot;Review of action makes many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by &quot;Maddox&quot;. Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken.&quot;

One hour later, Herrick sent another cable, stating, &quot;Entire action leaves many doubts except for apparent ambush at beginning. Suggest thorough reconnaissance in daylight by aircraft.&quot; In response to requests for confirmation, at around 16:00 Washington time, Herrick cabled, &quot;Details of action present a confusing picture although certain that the original ambush was bona fide.&quot; It is likely that McNamara did not inform either the president or Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. about Herrick&#x27;s misgivings or Herrick&#x27;s recommendation for further investigation. At 18:00 Washington time (05:00 in the Gulf of Tonkin), Herrick cabled yet again, this time stating, &quot;the first boat to close the &quot;Maddox&quot; probably launched a torpedo at the &quot;Maddox&quot; which was heard but not seen. All subsequent &quot;Maddox&quot; torpedo reports are doubtful in that it is suspected that sonarman was hearing the ship&#x27;s own propeller beat&quot;.

In the face of growing uncertainties over the course of the day regarding whether the attack had occurred, the Johnson administration ended up basing its conclusion mostly on communications intercepts erroneously assessed to be North Vietnamese preparations to carry out an attack and a North Vietnamese after action report. Later analysis showed those communications to have concerned the recovery of torpedo boats damaged in the 2 August attack and North Vietnamese observations of (but not participation in) the 4 August U.S. actions.

==United States&#x27; response==

===Johnson&#x27;s speech to the American people===
Shortly before midnight, on 4 August, Johnson interrupted national television to make an announcement in which he described an attack by North Vietnamese vessels on two U.S. Navy warships, &quot;Maddox&quot; and &quot;Turner Joy&quot;, and requested authority to undertake a military response. Johnson&#x27;s speech repeated the theme that &quot;dramatized Hanoi/Hồ Chí Minh as the aggressor and which put the United States into a more acceptable defensive posture.&quot; Johnson also referred to the attacks as having taken place &quot;on the high seas&quot;, suggesting that they had occurred in international waters.

He emphasized commitment to both the American people, and the South Vietnamese government. He also reminded Americans that there was no desire for war. &quot;A close scrutiny of Johnson&#x27;s public statements ... reveals no mention of preparations for overt warfare and no indication of the nature and extent of covert land and air measures that already were operational.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s statements were short to &quot;minimize the U.S. role in the conflict; a clear inconsistency existed between Johnson&#x27;s actions and his public discourse.&quot;

Within thirty minutes of the incident, Johnson had decided on retaliatory attacks (dubbed &quot;Operation Pierce Arrow&quot;). That same day he used the &quot;hot line&quot; to Moscow, and assured the Soviets he had no intent in opening a broader war in Vietnam. Early on 5 August, Johnson publicly ordered retaliatory measures stating, &quot;The determination of all Americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of South Vietnam will be redoubled by this outrage.&quot; One hour and forty minutes after his speech, aircraft launched from U.S. carriers reached North Vietnamese targets. On 5 August, at 10:40, these planes bombed four torpedo boat bases and an oil-storage facility in Vinh.

===Reaction from Congress===
While Johnson&#x27;s final resolution was being drafted, U.S. Senator Wayne Morse attempted to hold a fundraiser to raise awareness about possible faulty records of the incident involving &quot;Maddox&quot;. Morse supposedly received a call from an informant who has remained anonymous urging Morse to investigate official logbooks of &quot;Maddox&quot;. These logs were not available before Johnson&#x27;s resolution was presented to Congress. After urging Congress that they should be wary of Johnson&#x27;s coming attempt to convince Congress of his resolution, Morse failed to gain enough cooperation and support from his colleagues to mount any sort of movement to stop it. Immediately after the resolution was read and presented to Congress, Morse began to fight it. He contended in speeches to Congress that the actions taken by the United States were actions outside the constitution and were &quot;acts of war rather than acts of defense.&quot; Morse&#x27;s efforts were not immediately met with support, largely because he revealed no sources and was working with very limited information. It was not until after the United States became more involved in the war that his claim began to gain support throughout the United States government.

==Distortion of the event==
The U.S. government was still seeking evidence on the night of 4 August when Johnson gave his address to the American public on the incident; messages recorded that day indicate that neither Johnson nor McNamara was certain of an attack. Various news sources, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, published articles throughout August on the Tonkin Gulf incident. &quot;Time&quot; reported: &quot;Through the darkness, from the West and south ... intruders boldly sped ... at least six of them ... they opened fire on the destroyers with automatic weapons, this time from as close as 2,000 yards.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; stated that there was &quot;no doubt in Sharp&#x27;s mind that the U.S. would now have to answer this attack&quot;, and that there was no debate or confusion within the administration regarding the incident.

The use of the set of incidents as a pretext for escalation of U.S. involvement followed the issuance of public threats against North Vietnam, as well as calls from American politicians in favor of escalating the war. On 4 May 1964, William Bundy had called for the U.S. to &quot;drive the communists out of South Vietnam&quot;, even if that meant attacking both North Vietnam and communist China. Even so, the Johnson administration in the second half of 1964 focused on convincing the American public that there was no chance of war between the United States and North Vietnam.

North Vietnam&#x27;s General Giáp suggested that the DESOTO patrol had been sent into the gulf to provoke North Vietnam into giving the U.S. an excuse for escalation of the war. Various government officials and men aboard &quot;Maddox&quot; have suggested similar theories. U.S. Undersecretary of State George Ball told a British journalist after the war that &quot;at that time ... many people ... were looking for any excuse to initiate bombing&quot;. George Ball stated that the mission of the destroyer warship involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident &quot;was primarily for provocation.&quot;

According to Ray McGovern, CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990, the CIA, &quot;not to mention President Lyndon Johnson, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy all knew full well that the evidence of any armed attack [...] was highly dubious... During the summer of 1964, President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were eager to widen the war in Vietnam. They stepped up sabotage and hit-and-run attacks on the coast of North Vietnam.&quot; &quot;Maddox&quot;, carrying electronic spying gear, was to collect signals intelligence from the North Vietnamese coast, and the coastal attacks were seen as a helpful way to get the North Vietnamese to turn on their coastal radars. For this purpose, it was authorized to approach the coast as close as 13 kilometers (8 mi) and the offshore islands as close as four; the latter had already been subjected to shelling from the sea.

In his book, &quot;Body of Secrets&quot;, James Bamford, who spent three years in the United States Navy as an intelligence analyst, writes that the primary purpose of the &quot;Maddox&quot; &quot;was to act as a seagoing provocateur—to poke its sharp gray bow and the American flag as close to the belly of North Vietnam as possible, in effect shoving its five-inch cannons up the nose of the communist navy. ... The &quot;Maddox″&quot; mission was made even more provocative by being timed to coincide with commando raids, creating the impression that the Maddox was directing those missions ...&quot; Thus, the North Vietnamese had every reason to believe that &quot;Maddox&quot; was involved in these actions.

John McNaughton suggested in September 1964 that the U.S. prepare to take actions to provoke a North Vietnamese military reaction, including plans to use DESOTO patrols North. William Bundy&#x27;s paper dated 8 September 1964, suggested more DESOTO patrols as well.

==Consequences==

By early afternoon of 4 August, Washington time, Herrick had reported to the Commander in Chief Pacific in Honolulu that &quot;freak weather effects&quot; on the ship&#x27;s radar had made such an attack questionable. In fact, Herrick stated in a message sent at 1:27 pm Washington time that no North Vietnamese patrol boats had actually been sighted. Herrick proposed a &quot;complete evaluation before any further action taken.&quot;

McNamara later testified that he had read the message after his return to the Pentagon that afternoon. But he did not immediately call Johnson to tell him that the whole premise of his decision at lunch to approve McNamara&#x27;s recommendation for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam was highly questionable. Johnson had fended off proposals from McNamara and other advisers for a policy of bombing North Vietnam on four occasions since becoming president.

Although &quot;Maddox&quot; had been involved in providing intelligence support for South Vietnamese attacks at Hòn Mê and Hòn Ngư, Johnson denied, in his testimony before Congress, that the U.S. Navy had supported South Vietnamese military operations in the Gulf. He thus characterized the attack as &quot;unprovoked&quot; since the ship had been in international waters. As a result of his testimony, on 7 August, Congress passed a joint resolution (H.J. RES 1145), titled the Southeast Asia Resolution, which granted Johnson the authority to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without the benefit of a declaration of war. The resolution gave Johnson approval &quot;to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.&quot;

The Gulf of Tonkin Incident also had impacts in China, where it increased perceptions among Chinese Communist Party leadership that the United States would eventually invade China. This triggered greater support among leadership for Mao Zedong&#x27;s Third Front Construction campaign to develop heavy industry and defense industry in China&#x27;s interior where it would be more protected in the event of foreign invasion.

==Later statements about the incident==
Johnson commented privately: &quot;For all I know, our navy was shooting at whales out there.&quot;

In 1967, former naval officer John White wrote a letter to the editor of the &quot;New Haven (CT) Register&quot;. He asserts &quot;I maintain that President Johnson, Secretary McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave false information to Congress in their report about US destroyers being attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin.&quot; White continued his whistleblowing activities in the 1968 documentary &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot;.

In 1981, Captain Herrick and journalist Robert Scheer re-examined Herrick&#x27;s ship&#x27;s log and determined that the first torpedo report from August 4, which Herrick had maintained had occurred—the &quot;apparent ambush&quot;—was in fact unfounded. Although information obtained well after the fact supported Captain Herrick&#x27;s statements about the inaccuracy of the later torpedo reports as well as the 1981 Herrick and Scheer conclusion about the inaccuracy of the first, indicating that there was no North Vietnamese attack that night, at the time U.S. authorities and all of the &quot;Maddox&quot;″s crew stated that they were convinced that an attack had taken place. As a result, planes from the aircraft carriers &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and were sent to hit North Vietnamese torpedo boat bases and fuel facilities during Operation Pierce Arrow.

Squadron Commander James Stockdale was one of the U.S. pilots flying overhead during the second alleged attack. Stockdale writes in his 1984 book &quot;Love and War&quot;: &quot;[I] had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets—there were no PT boats there ... There was nothing there but black water and American fire power.&quot; Stockdale at one point recounts seeing &quot;Turner Joy&quot; pointing her guns at &quot;Maddox&quot;. Stockdale said his superiors ordered him to keep quiet about this. After he was captured, this knowledge became a heavy burden. He later said he was concerned that his captors would eventually force him to reveal what he knew about the second incident.

In 1995, retired Vietnamese defense minister, Võ Nguyên Giáp, meeting with former Secretary McNamara, denied that Vietnamese gunboats had attacked American destroyers on 4 August, while admitting to the attack on 2 August. A taped conversation of a meeting several weeks after passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was released in 2001, revealing that McNamara expressed doubts to Johnson that the attack had even occurred.

In the fall of 1999, retired Senior CIA Engineering Executive S. Eugene Poteat wrote that he was asked in early August 1964 to determine if the radar operator&#x27;s report showed a real torpedo boat attack or an imagined one. He asked for further details on time, weather and surface conditions. No further details were forthcoming. In the end he concluded that there were no torpedo boats on the night in question, and that the White House was interested only in confirmation of an attack, not that there was no such attack.

In 2014, as the incident&#x27;s 50th anniversary approached, John White wrote &quot;The Gulf of Tonkin Events—Fifty Years Later: A Footnote to the History of the Vietnam War&quot;. In the foreword, he notes &quot;Among the many books written on the Vietnamese war, half a dozen note a 1967 letter to the editor of a Connecticut newspaper which was instrumental in pressuring the Johnson administration to tell the truth about how the war started. The letter was mine.&quot; The story discusses Lt. White reading Admiral Stockdale&#x27;s &quot;In Love and War&quot; in the mid 1980s, then contacting Stockdale who connected White with Joseph Schaperjahn, chief sonarman on &quot;Turner Joy&quot;. Schaperjahn confirmed White&#x27;s assertions that &quot;Maddox&quot;″s sonar reports were faulty and the Johnson administration knew it prior to going to Congress to request support for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. White&#x27;s book explains the difference between lies of commission and lies of omission. Johnson was guilty of willful lies of omission. White was featured in the August 2014 issue of &quot;Connecticut Magazine&quot;.

==NSA report==
In October 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Robert J. Hanyok, a historian for the NSA, concluded that the NSA distorted intelligence reports passed to policy makers regarding the 4 August incident. The NSA historian said agency staff deliberately skewed the evidence to make it appear that an attack had occurred. Hanyok&#x27;s conclusions were initially published in the Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition of &quot;Cryptologic Quarterly&quot; about five years before the &quot;Times&quot; article. According to intelligence officials, the view of government historians that Hanyok&#x27;s report should become public was rebuffed by policy makers concerned that comparisons might be made to intelligence used to justify the Iraq War (Operation Iraqi Freedom) which commenced in 2003.

Reviewing the NSA&#x27;s archives, Hanyok concluded that the 4 August incident began at Phu Bai Combat Base, where intelligence analysts mistakenly believed the destroyers would soon be attacked. This would have been communicated back to the NSA along with evidence supporting such a conclusion, but in fact the evidence did not do that. Hanyok attributed this to the deference that the NSA would have likely given to the analysts who were closer to the event. As the evening progressed, further signals intelligence (SIGINT) did not support any such ambush, but the NSA personnel were apparently so convinced of an attack that they ignored the 90% of SIGINT that did not support that conclusion, and that was also excluded from any reports they produced for the consumption by the president.

On 30 November 2005, the NSA released a first installment of previously classified information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident, including a moderately sanitized version of Hanyok&#x27;s article. The Hanyok article states that intelligence information was presented to the Johnson administration &quot;in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events.&quot; Instead, &quot;only information that supported the claim that the communists had attacked the two destroyers was given to Johnson administration officials.&quot;

With regard to why this happened, Hanyok writes:
Hanyok included his study of Tonkin Gulf as one chapter in an overall history of NSA involvement and American SIGINT, in the Indochina Wars. A moderately sanitized version of the overall history was released in January 2008 by the National Security Agency and published by the Federation of American Scientists.

<doc id="62983" wikidata="Q159549" url="?curid=62983" title="Medicago">
<text>Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family (Fabaceae). It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean Basin, and extending across temperate Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (&quot;M. sativa&quot;), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, , from Median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (&quot;M. arborea&quot;) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in &quot;Medicago&quot; range from 2&quot;n&quot; = 14 to 48.

The species &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot; is a model legume due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450–500 Mbp), short generation time (about 3 months), and ability to reproduce both by outcrossing and selfing.

Comprehensive descriptions of the genus are Lesinš and Lesinš 1979 and Small and Jomphe 1989. Major collections are SARDI (Australia), USDA-GRIN (United States), ICARDA (Syria), and INRA (France).

==Evolution==
&quot;Medicago&quot; diverged from &quot;Glycine&quot; (soybean) about 53–55 million years ago (in the early Eocene), from &quot;Lotus&quot; (deervetch) 49–51 million years ago (also in the Eocene), and from &quot;Trigonella&quot; 10–22 million years ago (in the Miocene).

==Ecological interactions with other organisms==
===Symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia===
Béna &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) constructed a molecular phylogeny of 23 &quot;Sinorhizobium&quot; strains and tested the symbiotic ability of six strains with 35 &quot;Medicago&quot; species. Comparison of these phylogenies indicates many transitions in the compatibility of the association over evolutionary time. Furthermore, they propose that the geographical distribution of strains limits the distribution of particular &quot;Medicago&quot; species.

===Agricultural uses===
Agronomic research has been conducted on species of the Medicago genus. Other than alfalfa, several of the prostrate members of the family (such as &quot;Medicago lupulina&quot; and &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot;) have been used as forage crops. Select species in the Medicago genus naturally develop spiney pods during the reproductive phase of growth (such as &quot;Medicago intertexta&quot; and &quot;Medicago polymorpha&quot;). Despite having high levels of agronomic performance, these are typically viewed as undesirable in sheep based farming systems due to their ability to become lodged in wool, reducing fleece value. Breeding efforts in the 1990&#x27;s have yielded spineless varieties of &quot;burr medic&quot;, providing valuable production amongst farming systems in low rainfall (&lt;300mm annual), free draining, alkaline soils.

===Insect herbivores===
&quot;Medicago&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the common swift, flame, latticed heath, lime-speck pug, nutmeg, setaceous Hebrew character, and turnip moths and case-bearers of the genus &quot;Coleophora&quot;, including &quot;C. frischella&quot; (recorded on &quot;M. sativa&quot;) and &quot;C. fuscociliella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;Medicago&quot; spp.).
