<text>Canna or canna lily is a genus of flowering plants consisting of 10 species. It is the only genus in the family Cannaceae. All of the genus&#x27;s species are native to the American tropics and were naturalized in Europe, India and Africa in the 1860s. Although they grow native to the tropics, most cultivars have been developed in temperate climates and are easy to grow in most countries of the world, as long as they receive at least 6–8 hours average sunlight during the summer, and are moved to a warm location for the winter. See the &quot;Canna&quot; cultivar gallery for photographs of &quot;Canna&quot; cultivars.

Cannas are not true lilies, but have been assigned by the APG II system of 2003 to the order Zingiberales in the monocot clade Commelinids, together with their closest relatives, the gingers, spiral gingers, bananas, arrowroots, heliconias, and birds of paradise.

The plants have large foliage, so horticulturists have developed selected forms as large-flowered garden plants. Cannas are also used in agriculture as a source of starch for human and animal consumption. &quot;C. indica&quot; and &quot;C. glauca&quot; have been grown into many cultivars in India and Africa.

== Description ==

The plants are large tropical and subtropical herbaceous perennials with a rhizomatous rootstock. The broad, flat, alternate leaves that are such a feature of these plants, grow out of a stem in a long, narrow roll and then unfurl. The leaves are typically solid green, but some cultivars have glaucose, brownish, maroon, or even variegated leaves.

The flowers are asymmetric and composed of three sepals and three petals that are small, inconspicuous, and hidden under extravagant stamens. What appear to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower &quot;petal&quot; is the pistil, which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.

The flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, or any combination of those colours, and are aggregated in inflorescences that are spikes or panicles (thyrses). The main pollinators of the flowers are bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and bats. The pollination mechanism is conspicuously specialized. Pollen is shed on the style while still in the bud, and in the species and early hybrids, some is also found on the stigma because of the high position of the anther, which means that they are self-pollinating. Later cultivars have a lower anther, and rely on pollinators alighting on the labellum and touching first the terminal stigma, and then the pollen.

The wild species often grow to at least in height, but wide variation in size exists among cultivated plants; numerous cultivars have been selected for smaller stature.

Cannas grow from swollen underground stems, correctly known as rhizomes, which store starch, and this is the main attraction of the plant to agriculture, having the largest starch grains of all plant life.

&quot;Canna&quot; is the only member of the Liliopsida class (monocot group) in which hibernation of seed is known to occur, due to its hard, impenetrable seed covering.
==Taxonomy==
===History===
The name &quot;Canna&quot; originates from the Latin word for a cane or reed.

&quot;Canna indica&quot;, commonly called &quot;achira&quot; in Latin America, has been cultivated by Native Americans in tropical America for thousands of years, and was one of the earliest domesticated plants in the Americas. The starchy root is edible.

The first species of &quot;Canna&quot; introduced to Europe was &quot;C. indica&quot;, which was imported from the East Indies, though the species originated from the Americas. Charles de l&#x27;Ecluse, who first described and sketched &quot;C. indica&quot;, indicated this origin, and stated that it was given the name &quot;indica&quot;, not because the plant is from India, in Asia, but because this species was originally transported from America: &quot;Quia ex America primum delata sit&quot;; and at that time, one described the tropical areas of that part of the globe as the West Indies.

Much later, in 1658, Willem Piso made reference to another species that he documented under the vulgar or common name of &#x27;Albara&#x27; and &#x27;Pacivira&#x27;, which resided, he said, in the &quot;shaded and damp places, between the tropics&quot;; this species is &quot;C. angustifolia&quot; L. (later reclassified as &quot;C. glauca&quot; L. by taxonomists).

=== Phylogeny ===

===Species===
Although most cannas grown these days are cultivars (see below), about 20 known species are of the wild form, and in the last three decades of the 20th century, &quot;Canna&quot; species have been categorized by two different taxonomists, Paul Maas, from the Netherlands and Nobuyuki Tanaka from Japan. Both reduced the number of species from the 50–100 accepted previously, assigning most as synonyms.

This reduction in species is also confirmed by work done by Kress and Prince at the Smithsonian Institution, but this only covers a subset of the species range.

==Distribution==

The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the New World, from the Southern United States (southern South Carolina west to southern Texas) and south to northern Argentina.

&quot;C. indica&quot; has become naturalized in many tropical areas around the world, is a difficult plant to remove, and is invasive in some places.

&quot;Canna&quot; cultivars are grown in most countries, even those with territory above the Arctic Circle, which have short summers, but long days, and the rapid growth rate of cannas makes them a feasible gardening plant, as long as they receive 6–8 hours of sunlight each day during the growing season and are protected from the cold of winter.

== Ecology ==
===Pests===
Cannas are largely free of pests. However, in the eastern and southern United States, plants sometimes fall victim to the canna leaf roller moth, with the resultant leaf damage, while not being fatal to the plant, can be most distressing to a keen gardener&#x27;s eye.

Slugs and snails are quite fond of cannas and their large, juicy leaves, potentially leaving unsightly holes where they have chewed on the plant—particularly during and after rainy periods (when mollusks become active). Slugs and snails tend to prefer tender, younger foliage, however. Red spider mites may also be a potential pest for cannas grown indoors, in dry areas, or that receive poor airflow.

For canna grown outside (in California or Texas, for example), mealybugs and scale insects are most drawn to the dense folds and creases between the leaves and the stem/petiole, where the foliage attaches to the plant. At times, if left unchecked, these sucking-insects may remain effectively concealed in these tight areas, only for older or dead leaves to be peeled off to reveal a small colony of white, fuzzy mealybugs congregated. Mealybugs are particularly prevalent in drier climates, such as the Southwestern US. Japanese beetles can also ravage the leaves if left uncontrolled.

These pests, while certainly able to drain a plant of its energy over time, and cause its eventual decline, are generally not lethal to the plant when dealt with immediately. The majority of insect pests on canna plants can be sprayed with a 70% isopropyl alcohol mist—diluted slightly—applied during non-sunny periods, as the alcohol may cause sunburn on the plant. Other effective options include insecticidal soap, neem and horticultural oils, and other commercially available spray treatments. Granulated systemic insecticides are also useful, and generally completely safe; when applied to the soil topically every few months, granulated or powdered systemics will prevent nearly all pest infestations (for the duration of effectiveness). Non-scented baby wipes or paper towels, moistened with rubbing alcohol or apple cider vinegar may be used to wipe any invisible eggs or larvae from the leaves.

===Disease===
Cannas are remarkably free of diseases, compared to many genera. However, they may fall victim to canna rust, a fungal disease resulting in orange spots on the plant&#x27;s leaves, caused by over-moist soil. They are also susceptible to certain plant viruses, some of which are &quot;Canna&quot;-specific, which may result in spotted or streaked leaves, in a mild form, but can finally result in stunted growth and twisted and distorted blooms and foliage.

The flowers are sometimes affected by a grey, fuzzy mold called botrytis. Under humid conditions, it is often found growing on the older flowers. Treatment is to simply remove the old flowers, so the mold does not spread to the new flowers.

==Cultivation==

Cannas grow best in full sun with moderate water in well-drained, rich or sandy soil. They grow from perennial rhizomes, but are frequently grown as annuals in temperate zones for an exotic or tropical look in the garden. In arid regions, cannas are often grown in the water garden, with the lower inch of pot submerged. In all areas, high winds tear the leaves, so shelter is advised.

The rhizomes are sensitive to frost and will rot if left unprotected in freezing conditions. In areas with winter temperatures below in the winter (&lt; USDA Zone 8b), the rhizomes can be dug up before freezing and stored (above ) for replanting in the spring. Otherwise, they should be protected by a thick layer of mulch over winter.

==Uses==
* Some species and many cultivars are widely grown in the garden in temperate and subtropical regions. Sometimes, they are also grown as potted plants. A large number of ornamental cultivars have been developed. They can be used in herbaceous borders, tropical plantings, and as a patio or decking plant.
* Internationally, cannas are one of the most popular garden plants, and a large horticultural industry depends on the plant.
* The rhizomes of cannas are rich in starch, and have many uses in agriculture. All of the plant material has commercial value, rhizomes for starch (consumption by humans and livestock), stems and foliage for animal fodder, young shoots as a vegetable, and young seeds as an addition to tortillas.
* The seeds are used as beads in jewelry.
* The seeds are used as the mobile elements of the kayamb, a musical instrument from Réunion, as well as the hosho, a gourd rattle from Zimbabwe, where the seeds are known as &quot;hota&quot; seeds.
* In more remote regions of India, cannas are fermented to produce alcohol.
* The plant yields a fibre from the stem, which is used as a jute substitute.
* A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making paper. The leaves are harvested in late summer after the plant has flowered, they are scraped to remove the outer skin, and are then soaked in water for two hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 24 hours with lye and then beaten in a blender. They make a light tan to brown paper.
* A purple dye is obtained from the seed.
* Smoke from the burning leaves is said to be insecticidal.
* Cannas are used to extract many undesirable pollutants in a wetland environment as they have a high tolerance to contaminants.
* In Thailand, cannas are a traditional gift for Father&#x27;s Day.
* In Vietnam, canna starch is used to make cellophane noodles known as &quot;miến dong&quot;.
* Cannas attract hummingbirds, so can be part of a pollinator and wildlife habitat strategy.

=== Horticultural varieties (cultivars) ===

Cannas became very popular in Victorian times as garden plants, and were grown widely in France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Some cultivars from this time, including a sterile hybrid, usually referred to as &quot;Canna&quot; × &quot;ehemannii&quot;, are still commercially available. &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;ehemannii&quot; is tall and green-leafed with terminal drooping panicles of hot pink iris-like flowers, looking somewhat like a cross between a banana and a fuchsia.

As tender perennials in northern climates, they suffered severe setbacks when two world wars sent the young gardening staff off to war. The genus &quot;Canna&quot; has recently experienced a renewed interest and revival in popularity. Once, hundreds of cultivars existed, but many are now extinct. In 1910, Árpäd Mühle, from Hungary, published his &quot;Canna&quot; book, written in German. It contained descriptions of over 500 cultivars.

In recent years, many new cultivars have been created, but the genus suffers severely from having many synonyms for many popular ones. Most of the synonyms were created by old varieties resurfacing without viable names, with the increase in popularity from the 1960s onwards. Research has accumulated over 2,800 &quot;Canna&quot; cultivar names, but many of these are simply synonyms. See List of &quot;Canna&quot; hybridists for details of the people and firms that created the current &quot;Canna&quot; legacy.

In the early 20th century, Professor Liberty Hyde Bailey defined, in detail, two &quot;garden species&quot; (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;generalis&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;orchiodes&quot;) to categorise the floriferous cannas being grown at that time, namely the Crozy hybrids and the orchid-like hybrids introduced by Carl Ludwig Sprenger in Italy and Luther Burbank in the U.S., at about the same time (1894). The definition was based on the genotype, rather than the phenotype, of the two cultivar groups. Inevitably over time, those two floriferous groups were interbred, the distinctions became blurred and overlapped, and the Bailey species names became redundant. Pseudo-species names are now deprecated by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants which, instead, provides Cultivar Groups for categorising cultivars (see groups at List of &quot;Canna&quot; cultivars).

*&#x27;Wyoming&#x27; (bright orange)
===Agricultural varieties===

The Canna Agriculture Group contains all of the varieties of &quot;Canna&quot; grown in agriculture. &quot;Canna achira&quot; is a generic term used in South America to describe the cannas that have been selectively bred for agricultural purposes, normally derived from &quot;C. discolor&quot;. It is grown especially for its edible rootstock from which starch is obtained, but the leaves and young seeds are also edible, and achira was once a staple food crop in Peru and Ecuador. Trials in Ecuador using a wide range of varieties have shown that achira can yield on average 56 tons of rhizomes and 7.8 tons of extractable starch per hectare. However, the crop needs 9–12 months to mature to full productivity.

Many more traditional kinds exist worldwide; they have all involved human selection, so are classified as agricultural cultivars. Traditionally, &quot;Canna edulis&quot; Ker Gawl. has been reputed to be the species grown for food in South America, but &quot;C. edulis&quot; probably is simply a synonym of &quot;C. discolor&quot;, which is also grown for agricultural purposes throughout Asia.

===Propagation===
====Sexual propagation====
Seeds are produced from sexual reproduction, involving the transfer of pollen from the stamen of the pollen parent onto the stigma of the seed parent. In the case of &quot;Canna&quot;, the same plant can usually play the roles of both pollen and seed parents, technically referred to as a hermaphrodite. However, the cultivars of the Italian group and triploids are almost always seed sterile, and their pollen has a low fertility level. Mutations are almost always totally sterile.

&quot;Canna&quot; seeds have a very hard seed coat, which contributes to their dormancy. Germination is facilitated by scarification of the seed coat, which can be accomplished by several techniques.

;Pollination
The species are capable of self-pollination, but most cultivars require an outside pollinator. All cannas produce nectar, so attract nectar-consuming insects, bats, and hummingbirds, that act as the transfer agent, spreading pollen between stamens and stigmas on the same or different flowers.

;Genetic changes
Since genetic recombination has occurred, a cultivar grown from seed will have different characteristics from its parent(s), thus should never be given a parent&#x27;s name. The wild species have evolved in the absence of other &quot;Canna&quot; genes and are usually true to type when the parents are of the same species, but a degree of variance still occurs. The species &quot;C. indica&quot; is an aggregate species, having many different and extreme forms ranging from the giant to miniature, from large foliage to small foliage, both green and dark foliage, and many differently coloured blooms of red, orange, pink, or yellow, and combinations of those colours.

====Asexual propagation====

;Division of plant parts
Outside of a laboratory, the only effective asexual propagation method is rhizome division. This uses material from a single parent, and as no exchange of genetic material occurs, it almost always produces plants that are identical to the parent. After a summer&#x27;s growth, the horticultural cultivars can be separated into typically four or five separate smaller rhizomes, each with a growing nodal point (growing eye). Without the growing point, which is composed of meristem material, the rhizome will not grow.

;Micropropagation
Micropropagation, also known as tissue culture, is the practice of rapidly multiplying stock plant material to produce a large number of progeny plants. Micropropagation uses &quot;in vitro&quot; division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the &quot;Island Series&quot; of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult micropropagation candidates.

Micropropagation techniques can be employed to disinfest plants of a virus. In the growing tip of a plant, cell division is so rapid that the younger cells may not have had time to be infected with the virus. The rapidly growing region of meristem cells producing the shoot tip is cut off and placed &quot;in vitro&quot;, with a very high probability of being uncontaminated by virus.

<text>Edward Hopper (July 22, 1882 – May 15, 1967) was an American realist painter and printmaker. He is one of America&#x27;s most renowned artists and known for his skill in capturing American life and landscapes through his art.

Born in Nyack, New York, to a middle-class family, Hopper&#x27;s early exposure to art was nurtured by his parents. He studied at the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri, where he developed his signature style, characterized by its emphasis on solitude, light, and shadow.

Hopper&#x27;s work, spanning oil paintings, watercolors, and etchings, predominantly explores themes of loneliness and isolation within American urban and rural settings. His most famous painting, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1942), epitomizes his interest in the quiet, introspective moments of everyday life. Despite a slow start, Hopper achieved significant recognition by the 1920s, with his work becoming a staple in major American museums. Hopper&#x27;s technique, marked by a composition of form and use of light to evoke mood, has been influential in the art world and popular culture. His paintings, often set in the architectural landscapes of New York or the serene environments of New England, convey a sense of narrative depth and emotional resonance, making him a pivotal figure in American Realism. Hopper created subdued drama out of commonplace subjects layered with a poetic meaning, inviting narrative interpretations. He was praised for &quot;complete verity&quot; in the America he portrayed.

In 1924, Hopper married Josephine Nivison, also an artist, who played a crucial role in managing his career and served as the model for many of his figures. The couple lived a modest life in New York City, with summers spent in Cape Cod, which influenced much of Hopper&#x27;s later work. Despite his success, Hopper remained a private and introspective individual, dedicated to exploring the subtleties of human experience and the American landscape. His depiction of the American scene, with its emphasis on isolation and contemplation, remains a defining aspect of his appeal and significance in the history of American art.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Hopper was born in 1882 in Nyack, New York, a yacht-building center on the Hudson River north of New York City. He was one of two children of a comfortably well-off family. His parents, of mostly Dutch ancestry, were Elizabeth Griffiths Smith and Garret Henry Hopper, a dry-goods merchant. Although not as successful as his forebears, Garret provided well for his two children with considerable help from his wife&#x27;s inheritance. He retired at age forty-nine. Edward and his sister, Marion, attended both private and public schools. They were raised in a strict Baptist home. His father had a mild nature, and the household was dominated by women: Hopper&#x27;s mother, grandmother, sister, and maid.

His birthplace and boyhood home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is now operated as the Edward Hopper House Museum &amp; Study Center, serving as a nonprofit community cultural center featuring exhibitions, workshops, lectures, performances, and special events.

Hopper was a good student in grade school, and by the time he was five his talent with drawing was already apparent. He readily absorbed his father&#x27;s intellectual tendencies and love of French and Russian cultures. He also demonstrated his mother&#x27;s artistic heritage. Hopper&#x27;s parents encouraged his art and kept him amply supplied with materials, instructional magazines, and illustrated books. 
Hopper first began signing and dating his drawings at the age of 10. Among the earliest of these drawings are charcoal sketches of geometric shapes, a vase, bowl, cup, and boxes. The detailed examination of light and shadow that continued throughout his career is already visible in these early works. By his teens, he was working in pen-and-ink, charcoal, watercolor, and oil—drawing from nature while also making political cartoons. In 1895, he created his first signed oil painting, &quot;Rowboat in Rocky Cove&quot;, which he copied from a reproduction in &quot;The Art Interchange&quot;, a popular journal for amateur artists. Hopper&#x27;s other earliest oils, such as &quot;Old ice pond at Nyack&quot; and his c.1898 painting &quot;Ships,&quot; have been identified as copies of paintings by artists including Bruce Crane and Edward Moran.

In his early self-portraits, Hopper tended to represent himself as skinny, ungraceful, and homely. Though a tall and quiet teenager, his prankish sense of humor found outlet in his art, sometimes in depictions of immigrants or of women dominating men in comical situations. Later in life, he mostly depicted women as the figures in his paintings. In high school (he graduated from Nyack High School in 1899), he carved wooden models of sailboats and barges and dreamed of becoming a naval architect, but after graduation declared his intention to pursue a career in art. Hopper&#x27;s parents insisted that he study commercial art to have a reliable means of income. In developing his self-image and individualistic philosophy of life, Hopper was influenced by the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. He later said, &quot;I admire him greatly...I read him over and over again.&quot;

Hopper began art studies with a correspondence course in 1899. Soon he transferred to the New York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of Parsons School of Design. There, he studied for six years with teachers including William Merritt Chase, who instructed him in oil painting. Early on, Hopper modeled his style after Chase and French Impressionist masters Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas. Sketching from live models, however, proved challenging and somewhat shocking for the conservatively raised Hopper.

Another of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri encouraged his students to use their art to &quot;make a stir in the world.&quot; He also advised his students, &quot;It isn&#x27;t the subject that counts but what you feel about it&quot; and &quot;Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life.&quot; In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as future artists George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. He encouraged them to imbue their work with a modern spirit. Some artists in Henri&#x27;s circle, including John Sloan, became members of &quot;The Eight&quot;, also known as the Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper&#x27;s first surviving oil painting to hint at his use of interiors as a theme was &quot;Solitary Figure in a Theater&quot; (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including self-portraits.

In 1905, Hopper landed a part-time job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines. Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s. He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study its art scene. In fact, he mostly worked alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later, he said he didn&#x27;t &quot;remember hearing of Picasso at all&quot;. He was highly impressed by Rembrandt, particularly his &quot;Night Watch&quot;, which he said was &quot;the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it&#x27;s past belief in its reality.&quot;
Hopper began painting urban and architectural scenes in a dark palette. Then he shifted to the lighter shades of the Impressionists before returning to the darker palette, with which he was most comfortable. He later said, &quot;I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of things I do now.&quot; Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he claimed few European influences other than Rembrandt, Goya and the French engraver Charles Meryon whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.

=== Years of struggle ===
After returning from his last European trip, Hopper rented a studio in New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had to knock on the doors of magazine and agency offices to find business. His painting languished: &quot;it&#x27;s hard for me to decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly.&quot; His fellow illustrator Walter Tittle described Hopper&#x27;s depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend &quot;suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting for days at a time before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell.&quot;

From February 22 to March 5, 1912, he was included in the exhibition of The Independents, a group of artists at the initiative of Robert Henri but did not make any sales.

In 1912, Hopper traveled to Gloucester, Massachusetts, to seek some inspiration and made his first outdoor paintings in America. He painted &quot;Squam Light&quot;, the first of many lighthouse paintings to come.

In 1913, at the Armory Show, Hopper earned $250 when he sold his first painting, &quot;Sailing&quot; (1911), to an American businessman Thomas F Vietor, which he had painted over an earlier self-portrait. Hopper was thirty-one, and although he hoped his first sale would lead to others in short order, his career would not catch on for many more years. He continued to participate in group exhibitions at smaller venues, such as the MacDowell Club of New York. Shortly after his father&#x27;s death that same year, Hopper moved to the 3 Washington Square North apartment in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan, where he would live for the rest of his life.
The following year he received a commission to create some movie posters and handle publicity for a movie company. Although he did not like the illustration work, Hopper was a lifelong devotee of the cinema and the theatre, both of which he treated as subjects for his paintings. Each form influenced his compositional methods.

At an impasse over his oil paintings, in 1915 Hopper turned to etching. By 1923 he had produced most of his approximately 70 works in this medium, many of urban scenes of both Paris and New York. He also produced some posters for the war effort, as well as continuing with occasional commercial projects. When he could, Hopper did some outdoor oil paintings on visits to New England, especially at the art colonies at Ogunquit, and Monhegan Island.

During the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition. They expressed some of his later themes, as in &quot;Night on the El Train&quot; (couples in silence), &quot;Evening Wind&quot; (solitary female), and &quot;The Catboat&quot; (simple nautical scene). Two notable oil paintings of this time were &quot;New York Interior&quot; (1921) and &quot;New York Restaurant&quot; (1922). He also painted two of his many &quot;window&quot; paintings to come: &quot;Girl at Sewing Machine&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Interior&quot;, both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or from the point of view from the outside looking in.
Although these were frustrating years, Hopper gained some recognition. In 1918, Hopper was awarded the U.S. Shipping Board Prize for his war poster, &quot;Smash the Hun&quot;. He participated in three exhibitions: in 1917 with the Society of Independent Artists, in January 1920 (a one-man exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club, which was the precursor to the Whitney Museum), and in 1922 (again with the Whitney Studio Club). In 1923, Hopper received two awards for his etchings: the Logan Prize from the Chicago Society of Etchers, and the W. A. Bryan Prize.

=== Marriage and breakthrough ===

By 1923, Hopper&#x27;s slow climb finally produced a breakthrough. He re-encountered Josephine Nivison, an artist and former student of Robert Henri, during a summer painting trip in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They were opposites: she was short, open, gregarious, sociable, and liberal, while he was tall, secretive, shy, quiet, introspective, and conservative. With Jo&#x27;s encouragement, Hopper turned to the medium of watercolor, producing numerous scenes of Gloucester. They married a year later with artist Guy Pène du Bois as their best man. Nivison once remarked: &quot;Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn&#x27;t thump when it hits bottom.&quot; She subordinated her career to his and shared his reclusive life style. The rest of their lives revolved around their spare walk-up apartment in the city and their summers in South Truro on Cape Cod. She managed his career and his interviews, was his primary model, and was his life companion.

With Nivison&#x27;s help, six of Hopper&#x27;s Gloucester watercolors were admitted to an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum in 1923. One of them, &quot;The Mansard Roof&quot;, was purchased by the museum for its permanent collection for the sum of $100. The critics generally raved about his work; one stated, &quot;What vitality, force and directness! Observe what can be done with the homeliest subject.&quot; Hopper sold all his watercolors at a one-man show the following year and finally decided to put illustration behind him.

The artist had demonstrated his ability to transfer his attraction to Parisian architecture to American urban and rural architecture. According to Boston Museum of Fine Arts curator Carol Troyen, &quot;Hopper really liked the way these houses, with their turrets and towers and porches and mansard roofs and ornament cast wonderful shadows. Hopper always said that his favorite thing was painting sunlight on the side of a house.&quot;

At forty-one, Hopper received further recognition for his work. He continued to harbor bitterness about his career, later turning down appearances and awards. With his financial stability secured by steady sales, Hopper would live a simple, stable life and continue creating art in his personal style for four more decades.

His &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot; (1927) sold for a personal record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make field trips to remote areas of New England. In 1929, he produced &quot;Chop Suey&quot; and &quot;Railroad Sunset&quot;. The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated &quot;House by the Railroad&quot; (1925) to the Museum of Modern Art, the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection. Hopper painted his last self-portrait in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, &quot;Jo Painting&quot; (1936).

Hopper fared better than many other artists during the Great Depression. His stature took a sharp rise in 1931 when major museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, paid thousands of dollars for his works. He sold 30 paintings that year, including 13 watercolors. The following year he participated in the first Whitney Annual, and he continued to exhibit in every annual at the museum for the rest of his life. In 1933, the Museum of Modern Art gave Hopper his first large-scale retrospective.

In 1930, the Hoppers rented a cottage in South Truro, on Cape Cod. They returned every summer for the rest of their lives, building a summer house there in 1934. From there, they would take driving trips into other areas when Hopper needed to search for fresh material to paint. In the summers of 1937 and 1938, the couple spent extended sojourns on Wagon Wheels Farm in South Royalton, Vermont, where Hopper painted a series of watercolors along the White River. These scenes are atypical among Hopper&#x27;s mature works, as most are &quot;pure&quot; landscapes, devoid of architecture or human figures. &quot;First Branch of the White River&quot; (1938), now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is the best-known of Hopper&#x27;s Vermont landscapes.
Hopper was very productive through the 1930s and early 1940s, producing among many important works &quot;New York Movie&quot; (1939), &quot;Girlie Show&quot; (1941), &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1942), &quot;Hotel Lobby&quot; (1943), and &quot;Morning in a City&quot; (1944). During the late 1940s, however, he suffered a period of relative inactivity. He admitted: &quot;I wish I could paint more. I get sick of reading and going to the movies.&quot; During the next two decades, his health faltered, and he had several prostate surgeries and other medical problems. But, in the 1950s and early 1960s, he created several more major works, including &quot;First Row Orchestra&quot; (1951); as well as &quot;Morning Sun&quot; and &quot;Hotel by a Railroad&quot;, both in 1952; and &quot;Intermission&quot; in 1963.

In 1966, Hopper was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture.

=== Death ===
Hopper died of natural causes in his studio near Washington Square in New York City on May 15, 1967. He was buried two days later in the family plot at Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack, New York, his place of birth. His wife died ten months later and is buried with him.

Edward Hopper&#x27;s wife, Josephine, bequeathed their joint collection of over three thousand pieces to the Whitney Museum. Arthayer Sanborn, a Baptist minister that frequently visited their home to care for Edward&#x27;s sister, Marion, came into possession of three hundred Hopper drawings and paintings. Art historian Gail Levin has highlighted that whereas the Whitney Museum has extensive documentation of how Josephine distributed their couple&#x27;s pieces, paintings acquired from Sanborn lack provenance proving the family willingly gifted the trove of pieces Sanborn reported finding in their attic. The Museum of Modern Art in New York, Des Moines Art Center, and Art Institute of Chicago all have significant collections of Hopper paintings.

=== Personality and vision ===
Always reluctant to discuss himself and his art, Hopper simply said, &quot;The whole answer is there on the canvas.&quot; Hopper was stoic and fatalistic—a quiet introverted man with a gentle sense of humor and a frank manner. Hopper was someone drawn to an emblematic, anti-narrative symbolism, who &quot;painted short isolated moments of configuration, saturated with suggestion&quot;. His silent spaces and uneasy encounters &quot;touch us where we are most vulnerable&quot;, and have &quot;a suggestion of melancholy, that melancholy being enacted&quot;. His sense of color revealed him as a pure painter as he &quot;turned the Puritan into the purist, in his quiet canvasses where blemishes and blessings balance&quot;. According to critic Lloyd Goodrich, he was &quot;an eminently native painter, who more than any other was getting more of the quality of America into his canvases&quot;.

Conservative in politics and social matters (Hopper asserted for example that &quot;artists&#x27; lives should be written by people very close to them&quot;), he accepted things as they were and displayed a lack of idealism. Cultured and sophisticated, he was well-read, and many of his paintings show figures reading. He was generally good company and unperturbed by silences, though sometimes taciturn, grumpy, or detached. He was always serious about his art and the art of others, and when asked would return frank opinions.

Hopper&#x27;s most systematic declaration of his philosophy as an artist was given in a handwritten note, titled &quot;Statement&quot;, submitted in 1953 to the journal &quot;Reality&quot;:

Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.

The inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm and does not concern itself alone with stimulating arrangements of color, form and design.

The term life used in art is something not to be held in contempt, for it implies all of existence and the province of art is to react to it and not to shun it.

Painting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature&#x27;s phenomena before it can again become great.
Though Hopper claimed that he didn&#x27;t consciously embed psychological meaning in his paintings, he was deeply interested in Freud and the power of the subconscious mind. He wrote in 1939: &quot;So much of every art is an expression of the subconscious that it seems to me most of all the important qualities are put there unconsciously, and little of importance by the conscious intellect.&quot;

=== Methods ===

Although he is best known for his oil paintings, Hopper initially achieved recognition for his watercolors and he also produced some commercially successful etchings. Additionally, his notebooks contain high-quality pen and pencil sketches, which were never meant for public viewing.

Hopper paid particular attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, &quot;It takes a long time for an idea to strike. Then I have to think about it for a long time. I don&#x27;t start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I&#x27;m all right when I get to the easel&quot;. He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as &quot;sad face of woman unlit&quot;, &quot;electric light from ceiling&quot;, and &quot;thighs cooler&quot;.

For &quot;New York Movie&quot; (1939), Hopper demonstrates his thorough preparation with more than 53 sketches of the theater interior and the figure of the pensive usherette.

The effective use of light and shadow to create mood is also central to Hopper&#x27;s methods. Bright sunlight (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, also play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot; (1930), &quot;Summertime&quot; (1943), &quot;Seven A.M.&quot; (1948), and &quot;Sun in an Empty Room&quot; (1963). His use of light and shadow effects have been compared to the cinematography of &quot;film noir&quot;.

Although a realist painter, Hopper&#x27;s &quot;soft&quot; realism simplified shapes and details. He used saturated color to heighten contrast and create mood.

=== Subjects and themes ===
Hopper derived his subject matter from two primary sources: one, the common features of American life (gas stations, motels, restaurants, theaters, railroads, and street scenes) and its inhabitants; and two, seascapes and rural landscapes. Regarding his style, Hopper defined himself as &quot;an amalgam of many races&quot; and not a member of any school, particularly the &quot;Ashcan School&quot;. Once Hopper achieved his mature style, his art remained consistent and self-contained, in spite of the numerous art trends that came and went during his long career.

Hopper&#x27;s seascapes fall into three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he combined these elements. Most of these paintings depict strong light and fair weather; he showed little interest in snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted the majority of the pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on Monhegan Island. Hopper&#x27;s &quot;The Long Leg&quot; (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his &quot;Ground Swell&quot; (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of Winslow Homer&#x27;s iconic &quot;Breezing Up&quot; (1876).

Urban architecture and cityscapes also were major subjects for Hopper. He was fascinated with the American urban scene, &quot;our native architecture with its hideous beauty, its fantastic roofs, pseudo-gothic, French Mansard, Colonial, mongrel or what not, with eye-searing color or delicate harmonies of faded paint, shouldering one another along interminable streets that taper off into swamps or dump heaps.&quot;

In 1925, he produced &quot;House by the Railroad&quot;. This classic work depicts an isolated Victorian wood mansion, partly obscured by the raised embankment of a railroad. It marked Hopper&#x27;s artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as &quot;one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism.&quot; The work is the first of a series of stark rural and urban scenes that uses sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted &quot;I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism.&quot; As if to prove the point, his late painting &quot;Sun in an Empty Room&quot; (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.

Most of Hopper&#x27;s figure paintings focus on the subtle interaction of human beings with their environment—carried out with solo figures, couples, or groups. His primary emotional themes are solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and resignation. He expresses the emotions in various environments, including the office, in public places, in apartments, on the road, or on vacation. As if he were creating stills for a movie or tableaux in a play, Hopper positioned his characters as if they were captured just before or just after the climax of a scene.

Hopper&#x27;s solitary figures are mostly women—dressed, semi-clad, and nude—often reading or looking out a window, or in the workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images: &quot;Girl at Sewing Machine&quot; (1921), &quot;New York Interior&quot; (another woman sewing) (1921), and &quot;Moonlight Interior&quot; (a nude getting into bed) (1923). &quot;Automat&quot; (1927) and &quot;Hotel Room&quot; (1931), however, are more representative of his mature style, emphasizing the solitude more overtly.

As Hopper scholar, Gail Levin, wrote of &quot;Hotel Room&quot;:
The spare vertical and diagonal bands of color and sharp electric shadows create a concise and intense drama in the night...Combining poignant subject matter with such a powerful formal arrangement, Hopper&#x27;s composition is pure enough to approach an almost abstract sensibility, yet layered with a poetic meaning for the observer.
Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Room in New York&quot; (1932) and &quot;Cape Cod Evening&quot; (1939) are prime examples of his &quot;couple&quot; paintings. In the first, a young couple appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes on the role of a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple&#x27;s lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with &quot;Excursion into Philosophy &quot; (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly on the edge of a bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, &quot;[T]he open book is Plato, reread too late&quot;.

Levin interprets the painting:
Plato&#x27;s philosopher, in search of the real and the true, must turn away from this transitory realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper&#x27;s painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.
In &quot;Office at Night&quot; (1940), another &quot;couple&quot; painting, Hopper creates a psychological puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing on his work papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman&#x27;s appeal or that he is working hard to ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several &quot;office&quot; pictures, but no others with a sensual undercurrent.
The best-known of Hopper&#x27;s paintings, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1942), is one of his paintings of groups. It shows customers sitting at the counter of an all-night diner. The shapes and diagonals are carefully constructed. The viewpoint is cinematic—from the sidewalk, as if the viewer were approaching the restaurant. The diner&#x27;s harsh electric light sets it apart from the dark night outside, enhancing the mood and subtle emotion. As in many Hopper paintings, the interaction is minimal. The restaurant depicted was inspired by one in Greenwich Village. Both Hopper and his wife posed for the figures, and Jo Hopper gave the painting its title. The inspiration for the picture may have come from Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s short story &quot;The Killers&quot;, which Hopper greatly admired, or from the more philosophical &quot;A Clean, Well-Lighted Place&quot;. The mood of the painting has sometimes been interpreted as an expression of wartime anxiety. In keeping with the title of his painting, Hopper later said, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness.

His second most recognizable painting after &quot;Nighthawks&quot; is another urban painting, &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot; (originally called &quot;Seventh Avenue Shops&quot;), which shows an empty street scene in sharp side light, with a fire hydrant and a barber pole as stand-ins for human figures. Originally Hopper intended to put figures in the upstairs windows but left them empty to heighten the feeling of desolation.

Hopper&#x27;s rural New England scenes, such as &quot;Gas&quot; (1940), are no less meaningful. &quot;Gas&quot; represents &quot;a different, equally clean, well-lighted refuge ... ke[pt] open for those in need as they navigate the night, traveling their own miles to go before they sleep.&quot; The work presents a fusion of several Hopper themes: the solitary figure, the melancholy of dusk, and the lonely road.

Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Rooms by the Sea&quot; (1951), shows an open door with a view of the ocean, without an apparent ladder or steps and no indication of a beach.

After his student years, Hopper&#x27;s nudes were all women. Unlike past artists who painted the female nude to glorify the female form and to highlight female eroticism, Hopper&#x27;s nudes are solitary women who are psychologically exposed. One audacious exception is &quot;Girlie Show&quot; (1941), where a red-headed strip-tease queen strides confidently across a stage to the accompaniment of the musicians in the pit. &quot;Girlie Show&quot; was inspired by Hopper&#x27;s visit to a burlesque show a few days earlier. Hopper&#x27;s wife, as usual, posed for him for the painting, and noted in her diary, &quot;Ed beginning a new canvas—a burlesque queen doing a strip tease—and I posing without a stitch on in front of the stove—nothing but high heels in a lottery dance pose.&quot;

Hopper&#x27;s portraits and self-portraits were relatively few after his student years. Hopper did produce a commissioned &quot;portrait&quot; of a house, &quot;The MacArthurs&#x27; Home&quot; (1939), where he faithfully details the Victorian architecture of the home of actress Helen Hayes. She reported later, &quot;I guess I never met a more misanthropic, grumpy individual in my life.&quot; Hopper grumbled throughout the project and never again accepted a commission. Hopper also painted &quot;Portrait of Orleans&quot; (1950), a &quot;portrait&quot; of the Cape Cod town from its main street.

Though very interested in the American Civil War and Mathew Brady&#x27;s battlefield photographs, Hopper made only two historical paintings. Both depicted soldiers on their way to Gettysburg. Also rare among his themes are paintings showing action. The best example of an action painting is &quot;Bridle Path&quot; (1939), but Hopper&#x27;s struggle with the proper anatomy of the horses may have discouraged him from similar attempts.

Hopper&#x27;s final oil painting, &quot;Two Comedians&quot; (1966), painted one year before his death, focuses on his love of the theater. Two French pantomime actors, one male and one female, both dressed in bright white costumes, take their bow in front of a darkened stage. Jo Hopper confirmed that her husband intended the figures to suggest they are taking their life&#x27;s last bows together as husband and wife.

Hopper&#x27;s paintings have often been seen by others as having a narrative or thematic content that the artist may not have intended. Much meaning can be added to a painting by its title, but the titles of Hopper&#x27;s paintings were sometimes chosen by others, or were selected by Hopper and his wife in a way that makes it unclear whether they have any real connection with the artist&#x27;s meaning. For example, Hopper once told an interviewer that he was &quot;fond of &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot;... but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily Sunday. That word was tacked on later by someone else.&quot;

The tendency to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper&#x27;s paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife. When Jo Hopper commented on the figure in &quot;Cape Cod Morning&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a woman looking out to see if the weather&#x27;s good enough to hang out her wash,&quot; Hopper retorted, &quot;Did I say that? You&#x27;re making it Norman Rockwell. From my point of view she&#x27;s just looking out the window.&quot; Another example of the same phenomenon is recorded in a 1948 article in &quot;Time&quot;:

Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Summer Evening&quot;, a young couple talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic&#x27;s suggestion that it would do for an illustration in &quot;any woman&#x27;s magazine.&quot; Hopper had the painting in the back of his head &quot;for 20 years and I never thought of putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light streaming down, and the night all around.&quot;
=== Place in American art ===

In focusing primarily on quiet moments, very rarely showing action, Hopper employed a form of realism adopted by another leading American realist, Andrew Wyeth, but Hopper&#x27;s technique was completely different from Wyeth&#x27;s hyper-detailed style. In league with some of his contemporaries, Hopper shared his urban sensibility with John Sloan and George Bellows but avoided their overt action and violence. Where Joseph Stella and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe glamorized the monumental structures of the city, Hopper reduced them to everyday geometrics and he depicted the pulse of the city as desolate and dangerous rather than &quot;elegant or seductive&quot;.

Charles Burchfield, whom Hopper admired and to whom he was compared, said of Hopper, &quot;he achieves such a complete verity that you can read into his interpretations of houses and conceptions of New York life any human implications you wish.&quot; He also attributed Hopper&#x27;s success to his &quot;bold individualism. ... In him we have regained that sturdy American independence which Thomas Eakins gave us, but which for a time was lost.&quot; Hopper considered this a high compliment since he considered Eakins the greatest American painter.

Hopper scholar Deborah Lyons writes, &quot;Our own moments of revelation are often mirrored, transcendent, in his work. Once seen, Hopper&#x27;s interpretations exist in our consciousness in tandem with our own experience. We forever see a certain type of house as a Hopper house, invested perhaps with a mystery that Hopper implanted in our own vision.&quot; Hopper&#x27;s paintings highlight the seemingly mundane and typical scenes in our everyday life and give them cause for epiphany. In this way Hopper&#x27;s art takes the gritty American landscape and lonely gas stations and creates within them a sense of beautiful anticipation.

Although compared to his contemporary Norman Rockwell in terms of subject matter, Hopper did not like the comparison. Hopper considered himself more subtle, less illustrative, and certainly not sentimental. Hopper also rejected comparisons with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton stating &quot;I think the American Scene painters caricatured America. I always wanted to do myself.&quot;

=== Influence ===
Hopper&#x27;s influence on the art world and pop culture is undeniable; see for numerous examples. Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including Willem de Kooning, Jim Dine, and Mark Rothko. An illustration of Hopper&#x27;s influence is Rothko&#x27;s early work &quot;Composition I&quot; (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Chop Suey&quot;.

Hopper&#x27;s cinematic compositions and dramatic use of light and dark have made him a favorite among filmmakers. For example, &quot;House by the Railroad&quot; is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Psycho&quot;. The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the Terrence Malick film &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;. The 1981 film &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; includes a tableau vivant of &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director Wim Wenders also cites Hopper influence. His 1997 film &quot;The End of Violence&quot; also incorporates a tableau vivant of &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director Dario Argento went so far as to recreate the diner and the patrons in &quot;Nighthawks&quot; as part of a set for his 1976 film &quot;Deep Red&quot; (aka &quot;Profondo Rosso&quot;). Ridley Scott has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, director Sam Mendes drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly &quot;New York Movie&quot;. The Austrian filmmaker Gustav Deutsch based a movie on 13 of Hopper’s paintings. 

Homages to &quot;Nighthawks&quot; featuring cartoon characters or famous pop culture icons such as James Dean and Marilyn Monroe are often found in poster stores and gift shops. The cable television channel Turner Classic Movies sometimes runs animated clips based on Hopper paintings prior to airing its films. Musical influences include singer-songwriter Tom Waits&#x27;s 1975 live-in-the-studio album titled &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot;, after the painting. In 1993, Madonna was inspired sufficiently by Hopper&#x27;s 1941 painting &quot;Girlie Show&quot; that she named her world tour after it and incorporated many of the theatrical elements and mood of the painting into the show. In 2004, British guitarist John Squire (formerly of The Stone Roses) released a concept album based on Hopper&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Marshall&#x27;s House&quot;. Each song on the album is inspired by, and shares its title with, a painting by Hopper. Canadian rock group The Weakerthans released their album Reunion Tour in 2007 featuring two songs inspired by and named after Hopper paintings, &quot;Sun in an Empty Room&quot;, and &quot;Night Windows&quot;, and have also referenced him in songs such as &quot;Hospital Vespers&quot;. Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Compartment C, Car 293&quot; inspired Polish composer Paweł Szymański&#x27;s &quot;Compartment 2, Car 7&quot; for violin, viola, cello and vibraphone (2003), as well as Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine&#x27;s song &quot;Compartiment C Voiture 293 Edward Hopper 1938&quot; (2011). Hopper&#x27;s work has influenced multiple recordings by British band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot; was the inspiration for the sleeve of &quot;Crush&quot; (1985). The same band&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Night Café&quot; was influenced by &quot;Nighthawks&quot; and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.

In poetry, numerous poems have been inspired by Hopper&#x27;s paintings, typically as vivid descriptions and dramatizations; this genre is known as ekphrasis. In addition to numerous individual poems inspired by Hopper, several poets have written collections based on Hopper&#x27;s paintings. The French poet Claude Esteban wrote a collection of prose poems, &quot;Soleil dans une pièce vide&quot; (&quot;Sun in an Empty room&quot;, 1991), based on forty-seven Hopper paintings from between 1921 and 1963, ending with &quot;Sun in an Empty room&quot; (1963), hence the title. The poems each dramatized a Hopper painting, imagining a story behind the scene; the book won the Prix France Culture prize in 1991. Eight of the poems – &quot;Ground Swell&quot;, &quot;Girl at Sewing Machine&quot;, &quot;Compartment C, Car 293&quot;, &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, &quot;South Carolina Morning&quot;, &quot;House by the Railroad&quot;, &quot;People in the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Roofs of Washington Square&quot; – were subsequently set to music by composer Graciane Finzi, and recorded with reading by the singer Natalie Dessay on her album &quot;Portraits of America&quot; (2016), where they were supplemented by selecting ten additional Hopper paintings, and songs from the American songbook to go with them. Similarly, the Spanish poet wrote a collection of fifty-one poems in Catalan, under the name &quot;Edward Hopper&quot; (2006, English translation 2010 by Lawrence Venuti), and James Hoggard wrote &quot;Triangles of Light: The Edward Hopper Poems&quot; (Wings Press, 2009). A collection by various poets was organized in &quot;The Poetry of Solitude: A Tribute to Edward Hopper&quot; 1995 (editor Gail Levin). Individual poems include Byron Vazakas (1957) and John Stone (1985) inspired by &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot;, and Mary Leader inspired by &quot;Girl at Sewing Machine&quot;.

=== Exhibitions ===

In 1980, the show &quot;Edward Hopper: The Art and the Artist&quot; opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art and visited London, Düsseldorf, and Amsterdam, as well as San Francisco and Chicago. For the first time ever, this show presented Hopper&#x27;s oil paintings together with preparatory studies for those works. This was the beginning of Hopper&#x27;s popularity in Europe and his large worldwide reputation.

In 2004, a large selection of Hopper&#x27;s paintings toured Europe, visiting Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, and the Tate Modern in London. The Tate exhibition became the second most popular in the gallery&#x27;s history, with 420,000 visitors in the three months it was open.

In 2007, an exhibition focused on the period of Hopper&#x27;s greatest achievements—from about 1925 to mid-century—and was presented at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The exhibit comprised fifty oil paintings, thirty watercolors, and twelve prints, including the favorites &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, and &quot;Lighthouse and Buildings&quot;. The exhibition was organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Art Institute of Chicago and sponsored by the global management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.

In 2010, the Fondation de l&#x27;Hermitage museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, held an exhibition that covered Hopper&#x27;s entire career, with works drawn largely from the Whitney Museum in New York City. It included paintings, watercolors, etchings, cartoons, posters, as well as some of the preparatory studies for selected paintings. The exhibition had previously been seen in Milan and Rome. In 2011, The Whitney Museum of American Art held an exhibition called &quot;Edward Hopper and His Times&quot;.

In 2012, an exhibition opened at the Grand Palais in Paris that sought to shed light on the complexity of his masterpieces, which is an indication of the richness of Hopper&#x27;s oeuvre. It was divided chronologically into two main parts: the first section covered Hopper&#x27;s formative years (1900–1924), comparing his work with that of his contemporaries and art he saw in Paris, which may have influenced him. The second section looked at the art of his mature years, from the first paintings emblematic of his personal style, such as &quot;House by the Railroad&quot; (1924), to his last works.

In 2020, Fondation Beyeler held an exhibition displaying Hopper&#x27;s art. The exhibition focused on Hopper&#x27;s &quot;iconic representations of the infinite expanse of American landscapes and cityscapes&quot;. This aspect has rarely been referred to in exhibitions, yet it is a key ingredient to understanding Hopper&#x27;s work.

From 2022 to 2023, his work was featured at the Whitney Museum in New York City, in an exhibition was entitled, &quot;Edward Hopper&#x27;s New York&quot;.

=== Art market ===
Works by Hopper rarely appear on the market. The artist was not prolific, painting just 366 canvases; during the 1950s, when he was in his 70s, he produced approximately five paintings a year. Hopper&#x27;s longtime dealer, Frank Rehn, who gave the artist his first solo show in 1924, sold &quot;Hotel Window&quot; (1956) to collector Olga Knoepke for $7,000 () in 1957. In 1999, the Forbes Collection sold it to actor Steve Martin privately for around $10 million. In 2006, Martin sold it for $26.89 million at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, an auction record for the artist.

In 2013, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia put Hopper&#x27;s &quot;East Wind Over Weehawken&quot; (1934) up for sale, hoping to garner the $22–$28 million at which the painting is valued, to establish a fund to acquire &quot;contemporary art&quot; that would appreciate in value. It is a street scene rendered in dark, earthy tones depicting the gabled house at 1001 Boulevard East at the corner of 49th Street in Weehawken, New Jersey, and is considered one of Hopper&#x27;s best works. It was acquired directly from the dealer handling the artist&#x27;s paintings in 1952, fifteen years before the death of the painter, at a very low price. The painting sold for a record-breaking $36 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York, to an anonymous telephone bidder.

In 2018, after the death of art collector Barney A. Ebsworth and subsequent auction of many of the pieces from his collection, &quot;Chop Suey&quot; (1929) was sold for $92 million, becoming the most expensive of Hopper&#x27;s work ever bought at auction.

== In popular culture ==

In addition to his influence (see ), Hopper is frequently referenced in popular culture.

In 1981, &quot;Hopper&#x27;s Silence&quot;, a documentary by Brian O&#x27;Doherty produced by the Whitney Museum of American Art, was shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall.

Austrian director Gustav Deutsch created the 2013 film &quot;Shirley – Visions of Reality&quot; based on 13 of Edward Hopper&#x27;s paintings.

Other works based on or inspired by Hopper&#x27;s paintings include Tom Waits&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot;, and a 2012 series of photographs by Gail Albert Halaban.

In the book (1985, 1998) and traveling exhibition called &quot;Hopper&#x27;s Places&quot;, Gail Levin located and photographed the sites for many of Hopper&#x27;s paintings. In her 1985 review of a related show organized by Levin, Vivien Raynor wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Miss Levin&#x27;s deductions are invariably enlightening, as when she infers that Hopper&#x27;s tendency to elongate structures was a reflection of his own great height.&quot;

New wave band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Crush&quot; features artwork inspired by several Hopper paintings, including &quot;Early Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; and &quot;Room in New York&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Night Cafe&quot; was influenced by &quot;Nighthawks&quot; and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.

The New York City Opera staged the East Coast premiere of Stewart Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Hopper&#x27;s Wife&quot; – a 1997 chamber opera about an imagined marriage between Edward Hopper and the gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, at Harlem Stage in 2016.

Irish novelist, Christine Dwyer Hickey, published a novel, &quot;The Narrow Land&quot;, in 2019 in which Edward and Jo Hopper were central characters.

Paul Weller included a song named &#x27;Hopper&#x27; on his 2017 album &quot;A Kind Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="65330" wikidata="Q2287198" url="?curid=65330" title="Infant formula">
<text>Infant formula, also called baby formula, simply formula (American English), formula milk, baby milk or infant milk (British English), is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as &quot;a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk&quot;.

Manufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother&#x27;s milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow&#x27;s milk whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. Modern infant formulas also contain human milk oligosaccharides, which are beneficial for immune development and a healthy gut microbiota in babies. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow&#x27;s milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow&#x27;s milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.

A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their &quot;Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding&quot;, which restated that &quot;processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission&quot;, and also warned that &quot;lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality&quot;.

In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. A formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with &quot;Cronobacter sakazakii&quot; and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. Although &quot;C. sakazakii&quot; can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of &quot;C. sakazakii&quot; infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.
==Uses, risks and controversies==

The use and marketing of infant formula has come under scrutiny. Breastfeeding, including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, is widely advocated as &quot;ideal&quot; for babies and infants, both by health authorities—and accordingly in ethical advertising of infant formula manufacturers.

Despite the recommendation that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, less than 40% of infants below this age are exclusively breastfed worldwide. The overwhelming majority of American babies are not exclusively breastfed for this period—in 2005 under 12% of babies were breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, with over 60% of babies of 2 months of age being fed formula, and approximately one in four breastfed infants having infant formula feeding within two days of birth.

Some studies have shown that use of formula can vary according to the parents&#x27; socio-economic status, ethnicity or other characteristics. For example, according to a research conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 82.9% of mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, but the number differed between Caucasians (91.6%) and non-Caucasians (56.8%), with the difference essentially attributed to marital status, education and family income. In the United States, mothers of lower socio-economic status have been found less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.

The use of hydrolysed cow milk baby formula versus standard milk baby formula does not appear to change the risk of allergies or autoimmune diseases.

===Use of infant formula===

In some cases, breastfeeding is medically contraindicated; these include:
* Mother&#x27;s health: The mother is infected with HIV or has active tuberculosis. She is extremely ill or has had certain kinds of breast surgery, which may have removed or disconnected all milk-producing parts of the breast. She is taking any kind of drug that could harm the baby, including both prescription drugs such as cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer treatments as well as illicit drugs.
** One of the main global risks posed by breast milk specifically is the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases. Breastfeeding by an HIV-infected mother poses a 5–20% chance of transmitting HIV to the baby. However, if a mother has HIV, she is more likely to transmit it to her child during the pregnancy or birth than during breastfeeding. A 2012 study conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine showed reduced HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice, due to components in the breast milk. Cytomegalovirus infection poses potentially dangerous consequences for pre-term babies. Other risks include mother&#x27;s infection with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (viruses that could cause T-cell leukemia in the baby), herpes simplex when lesions are present on the breasts, and chickenpox in the newborn when the disease manifested in the mother within a few days of birth. In some cases these risks can be mitigated by using heat-treated milk and nursing for a briefer time (e.g. 6 months, rather than 18–24 months), and can be avoided by using an uninfected woman&#x27;s milk, as via a wet-nurse or milk bank, or by using infant formula and/or treated milk.
** In balancing the risks, such as cases where the mother is infected with HIV, a decision to use infant formula versus exclusive breastfeeding may be made based on alternatives that satisfy the “AFASS” (Acceptable, Feasible, Affordable, Sustainable and Safe) principles.
* Baby is unable to breastfeed: The child has a birth defect or inborn error of metabolism such as galactosemia that makes breastfeeding difficult or impossible.
*Baby is considered at risk for malnutrition: In certain circumstances infants may be at risk for malnutrition, such as due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin D which may be less present in breast milk than needed at high latitudes where there is less sun exposure), or inadequate nutrition during transition to solid foods. Risks can often be mitigated with improved diet and education of mothers and caregivers, including availability of macro and micronutrients. For example, in Canada, marketed infant formulas are fortified with vitamin D, but Health Canada also recommends breastfed infants receive extra vitamin D in the form of a supplement.

Other reasons for not breastfeeding include:
* Personal preferences, beliefs, and experiences: The mother may dislike breast-feeding or find it inconvenient. In addition, breastfeeding can be difficult for victims of rape or sexual abuse; for example, it may be a trigger for posttraumatic stress disorder. Many families bottle feed to increase the father&#x27;s role in parenting his child.
*Mental health: The pressure to breastfeed in many cultures can be so much that the mother&#x27;s mental health may take a sharp decline. This can have physical effects such as poor latching as well as milk depletion and a lack of connection to the child. In some cases it is better for the child to be formula fed so that a better bond can be made between mother and child rather than the ‘special bond’ that comes from breastfeeding being tainted by negative breastfeeding experiences. The pressure to breastfeed in many cultures can increase the likelihood of postpartum depression.
* Absence of the mother: The child is adopted, orphaned, abandoned, or in the sole custody of a man or male same-sex couple. The mother is separated from her child by being in prison or a mental hospital. The mother has left the child in the care of another person for an extended period of time, such as while traveling or working abroad.
* Food allergies: The mother eats foods that may provoke an allergic reaction in the infant.
* Financial pressures: Maternity leave is unpaid, insufficient, or lacking. The mother&#x27;s employment interferes with breastfeeding. Mothers who breastfeed may experience a loss of earning power.
* Societal structure: Breastfeeding may be forbidden, discouraged or difficult at the mother&#x27;s job, school, place of worship or in other public places, or the mother may feel that breastfeeding in these places or around other people is immodest, unsanitary, or inappropriate.
* Social pressures: Family members, such as mother&#x27;s husband or boyfriend, or friends or other members of society may encourage the use of infant formula. For example, they may believe that breastfeeding will decrease the mother&#x27;s energy, health, or attractiveness. Conversely, societal pressures to breastfeed can also lead to mental health issues. A sense of shame from not being able to or struggling to do so equalling being a failure has a connection to Postpartum Depression 
* Lack of training and education: The mother lacks education and training from medical providers or community members. 
* Lactation insufficiency: The mother is unable to produce sufficient milk. In studies that do not account for lactation failure with obvious causes (such as use of formula and/or breast pumps), chronic lactation insufficiency affects around 10–15% of women. For about 5–8% of women, milk coming in (i.e., lactogenesis II) may not occur at all, and only drops are produced. Alternatively, despite a healthy supply, the woman or her family may incorrectly believe that her breast milk is of low quality or in low supply. These women may choose infant formula either exclusively or as a supplement to breastfeeding. New research is showing that mothers who report problems with milk production have physical markers indicating low milk production, calling into question the assumption (called “perceived insufficient milk supply” or PIMS) that mothers are incorrect about the quantity of milk they are producing.
*Fear of exposure to environmental contaminants: Certain environmental pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, can bioaccumulate in the food chain and may be found in humans including mothers&#x27; breast milk.
** However studies have shown that the greatest risk period for adverse effects from environmental exposures is prenatally. Other studies have further found that the levels of most persistent organohalogen compounds in human milk decreased significantly over the past three decades and equally did their exposure through breastfeeding.
**Research on risks from chemical pollution is generally inconclusive in terms of outweighing the benefits of breastfeeding. Studies supported by the WHO and others have found that neurological benefits of breast milk remain, regardless of dioxin exposure. 
**In developing countries, environmental contaminants associated with increased health risks from use of infant formula, particularly diarrhea due to unclean water and lack of sterile conditions – both prerequisites to the safe use of formula – often outweigh any risks from breastfeeding.
* Lack of other sources of breast milk:
** &quot;Lack of wet nurses:&quot; Wet nursing is illegal and stigmatized in some countries, and may not be available. It may also be socially unsupported, expensive, or health screening of wet nurses may not be available. The mother, her doctor, or family may not know that wet nursing is possible, or may believe that nursing by a relative or paid wet-nurse is unhygienic.
** &quot;Lack of milk banks:&quot; Human-milk banks may not be available, as few exist, and many countries cannot provide the necessary screening for diseases and refrigeration.

===Health risks===
Use of infant formula has been cited for association with numerous increased health risks. Studies have found infants in developed countries who consume formula are at increased risk for acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), eczema and necrotizing enterocolitis when compared to infants who are breastfed. Some studies have found an association between infant formula and lower cognitive development, including iron supplementation in baby formula being linked to lowered I.Q. and other neurodevelopmental delays; however other studies have found no correlation. Causation, however, has not been established for negative long-term health effects of infant formula; studies analyzing health outcomes for breastfed vs. formula fed babies are primarily observational in nature and are plagued with confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, and maternal preexisting conditions (such as obesity, which is associated with both low milk production and childhood obesity). When confounding factors are controlled for, differences between long-term health of breastfed and formula fed infants decrease.

====Melamine contamination====

In 2008, a case of melamine poisoning of infant formula was discovered in China, where milk was deliberately adulterated with the chemical, leading to the death of six babies, and illnesses in more than 300,000 infants, including cases of acute kidney failure. Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels. Some of those responsible for the poisoning were sentenced to death.

In November 2008, traces of melamine were reported to have been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firms — Abbott Laboratories, Nestlé and Mead Johnson — responsible for 90–99% of the infant formula market in that country. The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The safety data sheet for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161 mg/kg for a rat.

Health Canada conducted a separate test and also detected traces of melamine in infant formula available in Canada. The melamine levels were well below Health Canada&#x27;s safety limits, although concerns remain about the safety of manufactured food for infants and monitoring of potentially dangerous substances.

====Other health controversies====
* In 1985, Syntex Corporation was ordered to pay $27 million in compensation for the deaths of two American infants who suffered brain damage after drinking the company&#x27;s baby formula, called &quot;Neo-mull-soy&quot;. Formulas produced by Syntex had previously been subject to a major recall as they were found to have insufficient chloride to support normal infant growth and development.
* In 2003, baby plant-based formula manufactured by the German company &quot;Humana&quot; and sold in Israel under the brand &quot;Remedia&quot; caused severe vitamin deficiencies in babies. Babies who consumed the formula were hospitalized with cardiac and neurological symptoms. Three of them died, and at least twenty others were left with severe disabilities. An investigation revealed that the formula contained a much lower quantity of Thiamine than is needed for healthy infant development because of a manufacturing error. Humana&#x27;s chief food technologist received a 30-month prison sentence for negligent manslaughter in February 2013 over the case.
* In 2010, Abbott Laboratories issued a voluntary recall of about five million &quot;Similac&quot; brand powder infant formulas that were sold in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and some Caribbean countries. The recall was issued after the presence of a &#x27;small common beetle&#x27; was detected in the product.
*In Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere, public concerns have been raised over the continued sale and marketing of soy-based formulae potentially containing high levels of phytoestrogens, linked to abnormal child development including damage to babies&#x27; thyroid glands.
*In December 2011 Wal-Mart recalled a quantity of infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. &quot;We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy&#x27;s family as they try to come to grips with their loss,&quot; said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. &quot;As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation.&quot; Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. &quot;We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products – and the rigorous testing we put them through,&quot; said Chris Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.[Source CNN]

==Preparation and content==

===Variations===
Infant formulas come in powder, liquid concentrate, and ready-to-feed forms. They are designed to be prepared by the parent or caregiver in small batches and fed to the infant, usually with either a cup or a baby bottle.

Infant formulas come in a variety of types:
*Cow&#x27;s milk formula is the most commonly used type. The milk has been altered to resemble breast milk. 
*Soy protein based formulas are frequently used for infants allergic to cow&#x27;s milk or lactose. Soy-based formulas can also be useful if the parent wants to exclude animal proteins from the child&#x27;s diet.
*Protein hydrolysate formulas contain protein that&#x27;s been broken down into smaller sizes than are those in cow&#x27;s milk and soy-based formulas. Protein hydrolysate formulas are meant for babies who do not tolerate cow&#x27;s milk or soy-based formulas. 
*Specialized formulas are also available for premature infants and those with specific medical conditions.

Manufacturers and health officials advise it is very important to measure powders or concentrates accurately to achieve the intended final product concentration; otherwise, the child will be malnourished. It is advisable that all equipment that comes into contact with the infant formula be cleaned and sterilized before each use. Proper refrigeration is essential for any infant formula which is prepared in advance.

In developing countries, formula is frequently prepared improperly, resulting in high infant mortality due to malnutrition and diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. This is due to lack of clean water, lack of sterile conditions, lack of refrigeration, illiteracy (so written instructions cannot be followed), poverty (diluting formula so that it lasts longer), and lack of education of mothers by formula distributors. These problems and resulting disease and death are a key factor in opposition to the marketing and distribution of infant formula in developing countries by numerous public health agencies and NGOs (discussed in more detail at Nestlé boycott and International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes).

===Nutritional content===
Besides breast milk, infant formula is the only other milk product which the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable for infants under the age of one year (as opposed to cow&#x27;s milk, goat&#x27;s milk, or follow-on formula). Supplementing with solid food in addition to breast milk or formula begins during weaning, and most babies begin supplementing about the time their first teeth appear, usually around the age of six months.

Although cow&#x27;s milk is the basis of almost all infant formula, plain cow&#x27;s milk is unsuited for infants because of its high casein content and low whey content, and untreated cow&#x27;s milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition. To reduce the negative effect on the infant&#x27;s digestive system, cow&#x27;s milk used for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes steps to make protein more easily digestible and alter the whey-to-casein protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called &quot;fortification&quot;, see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.

Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow&#x27;s milk-based formulas, lactose is the main source of carbohydrates present, but lactose is not present in cow&#x27;s milk-based lactose-free formulas nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with milk protein sensitivity. Lactose is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without lactose will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and glucose, dextrins, and natural and modified starches. Lactose is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.

The nutrient content of infant formula for sale in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. The following must be included in all formulas produced in the U.S.:
*Protein
*Fat
*Linoleic acid
*Vitamins: A, C, D, E, K, thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), B6, B12, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid
*Minerals: calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, selenium, sodium, potassium, chloride

Non-milk-based formulas must also add the vitamins biotin, choline and inositol.

Additionally, manufacturers may choose to add additional ingredients to their formulas. These additional ingredients are often used to differentiate their products in the market, as the nutrient composition of formulas is otherwise highly similar between products. Not all additives are clearly beneficial according to current studies, either because no benefit has actually been demonstrated, or because the additives are too new to have received significant scientific scrutiny.

*Omega-3 fatty acids
**Omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA, are often added to infant formula, purportedly to support brain development, although studies have generally failed to find a significant effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Infants can synthesize DHA and other fatty acids from the linoleic acid in formula. As formula additives, these fatty acids are often derived from fish oil or similar sources.

*Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)
**HMOs are naturally occurring sugars found in human breast milk, and may work to improve the immune system and act as nutrients for beneficial gut bacteria. However, while human breastmilk contains dozens of different types of HMOs, commercial infant formula usually only includes a few of the more common types.

*Nucleotides
** Nucleotides are compounds found naturally in human breast milk. They are involved in critical metabolic processes, such as energy metabolism and enzymatic reactions. Also, as the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), they are essential for normal body functions. Compared to human breast milk, cow&#x27;s milk has lower levels of the nucleotides uridine, inosine, and cytidine. Therefore, several companies that produce infant formula have added nucleotides to their infant formulas.

Other commonly used ingredients:
*Emulsifiers and stabilizers: Ingredients added to prevent the separation of the oil from the water (and its soluble components) in the infant formula. Some commonly used emulsifiers include monoglycerides, diglycerides, and gums.
*Diluents: Skim milk is commonly used as the primary diluent in milk-based liquid formula to provide the bulk of the volume. In contrast, purified water is the most commonly used diluent in milk-free formulations.

==Policy, industry and marketing==
The policy, regulatory and industry environments surrounding the infant formula market vary tremendously between countries.

===International===

The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is an international health policy framework adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 1981 regarding infant formula marketing, including strict restrictions on advertising. Its implementation depends on the laws of different countries and the behavior of infant formula manufacturers – the code has no power itself. Legislation and corporate behavior vary significantly between countries: at least 84 countries have enacted national legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code and 14 countries have draft laws awaiting adoption; whereas elsewhere neither the Code nor its principles are followed by governments or formula manufacturers.

Practices that are banned in the Code include most advertising, claiming health benefits for formula, and giving free samples to women able to breastfeed – this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula, without proper education on ensuring continued breast stimulation while formula is being used. In many countries free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice; however, there is increasing criticism of the BFHI&#x27;s rigidity in limiting use of infant formula, which can be an appropriate treatment for common conditions such as suboptimal intake jaundice, and may cause mothers to feel pressured or guilted into breastfeeding.

===By country===

====Philippines====
Infant formula is one of the top three consumer commodities in the Philippines, and among the most imported products. Annual sales amount to some US$469 million annually. US$88 million is spent on advertising the product.

Infant formula marketing has been regulated since the 1987 Executive Order 51 or &quot;Milk Code&quot;, which regulated, but did not ban, practices such as advertising and providing free samples. Shortly after it was enacted, Wyeth introduced &quot;follow-on formula&quot;, which was not in the purview of the Milk Code which predated its market entry.

In 2006, the Department of Health banned the advertising of infant formula and the practice of providing free samples, regardless of intended age group (in the &quot;Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations&quot; of Executive Order 51, or RIRR). The new regulation was challenged by the infant formula industry in the Supreme Court. Initially the challenge was dismissed, but this decision was reversed following industry pressure and a controversial letter by American business leader Thomas Donahue, then President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, resulting in the regulation being suspended and advertising continuing.
&quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reports widespread illegal advertising and marketing of formula milk contrary to World Health Organization guidelines. Doctors and midwives are encouraged to promote feeding babies formula milk, advertising also targets mothers directly. Babies get sick and sometimes die because poor mothers cannot sterilize bottles.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, there is a move towards plain packaging of infant formula under R 991 of the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act; as of 6 December 2013, Regulation 7 (Sale and Promotion) is force, whereas Regulations 2-6 (primarily with respect to labelling) are scheduled to come into force on 6 December 2014.
One of the key requirements as per Regulation 3.1.A.iii is a conspicuous message stating “[t]his product shall only be used on the advice of a health professional”.

==== Thailand ====
In 2017, Thailand banned advertising for infant formula. Initially a ban on advertising for toddler formula was also proposed, but was dropped after the intervention of United States trade officials.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, infant formula advertising has been allowed since 1995; advertising for &quot;follow-on formula&quot; is legal, which has been cited as a loophole allowing advertising of similarly packaged formula.

==== United States ====

In the United States, infant formula is both heavily marketed—the country has not adopted the Code, nor is it being systematically implemented by manufacturers for domestic marketing—and even heavily subsidized by the government: at least one third of the American market is supported by the government, with over half of infant formula sold in the country provided through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (known as WIC).

According to surveys, over 70% of large U.S. hospitals dispense infant formula to all infants, a practice opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and in violation of the Code. The Gerber Products Company began marketing its brand of infant formula directly to the public in October 1989, while the Carnation Company began marketing &quot;Good Start&quot; infant formula directly to the public in January 1991.

Infant formula costs are a significant fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate. Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states. Meanwhile, breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients; this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to mothers in the WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status. Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants. In recent years WIC has been expanding its breastfeeding promotion strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use milk banks.

=== 2022 United States Baby Formula Shortages ===

Supply chain disruptions related to the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have been reported as responsible for causing widespread shortages of infant formula in the United States, as of May 2022. This contrasts with far less severe shortages of infant formula around the globe. Reason magazine reported that this was largely the result of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes delaying approval of otherwise safe infant formula from Europe or other sources abroad, which might otherwise have eased demand for infant formula tensions in the United States.

As a result of the shortages, on May 16, 2022, the FDA announced that it would temporarily ease enforcement of some labeling rules to allow the importation of foreign formulas. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf stated, &quot;Today&#x27;s action paves the way for companies who don&#x27;t normally distribute their infant formula products in the U.S. to do so efficiently and safely. We anticipate that those products that can quickly meet safety and nutrition standards could hit U.S. stores in a matter of weeks.&quot; Former FDA associate commissioner, Peter Pitts, asserts that the FDA&#x27;s regulatory scheme is at least partially to blame for the shortage. Pitts states, &quot;The difference between European baby formula and American baby formula, more or less, is that the labeling is different. The knot in getting that product into the U.S. isn&#x27;t safety, it&#x27;s a regulatory issue. I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s a nitty issue, but it&#x27;s certainly something the FDA could have jumped on a lot quicker.&quot;

Amid and prior to the formula shortages, Woman and Infant Children (WIC) centers in Georgia and North Carolina were disposing of infant formula. This was done under the USDA&#x27;s recommendation that unused, returned WIC infant formula were to be disposed of upon return. Despite an attempt by the USDA to walk back this recommendation by stating that it is a recommendation rather than a requirement, the USDA confirms that it will not reverse this recommendation, even amid the formula shortage. As a result, from October 2021 through May 2022, 16,459 cans of baby formula were destroyed by WIC clinics in Georgia and an unknown amount of baby formula cans were destroyed in North Carolina and other US States.

On July 6, 2022, the FDA announced that it would change its rules to allow foreign formula manufacturers to permanently import their goods into the U.S., potentially reducing the severity of the shortage. Critics of the FDA note that this does not remove the regulations entirely and that this shortage has been self-imposed by the FDA from the start. Additionally, critics note that if a formula maker passes EU regulations, this should be good enough for the FDA to allow importation of that formula.

Critics of the FDA&#x27;s regulatory policy note that the regulatory scheme surrounding European formulas is not borne from a science-based desire to protect children, but rather an influence that the US dairy industry has on the agency. Critics also note that if there were an issue with European formulas, the issue would be widespread among the European babies that regularly consume the formula.

The FORMULA Act is set to expire at the end of 2022, which will subsequently reinstate tariffs on foreign made formula. Experts worry that this will result in a repeat formula shortage for 2023. The CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, a lobbying organization for dairy producers, wrote in a letter to Congress and the Biden administration to allow for the reinstatement of tariffs on foreign baby formula to commence.

==History==
The Wabanaki and other Native American tribal nations of North America made an infant formula from nuts and cornmeal. Elizabeth Hanson was kidnapped by Wabanaki in 1725 and a Native American woman showed Hanson how to make this infant formula and she included this in her captivity narrative.

===Early infant foods===
In 1865, the first infant food was invented .
Throughout history, mothers who could not breastfeed their babies either employed a wet nurse or, less frequently, prepared food for their babies, a process known as &quot;dry nursing&quot;. Baby food composition varied according to region and economic status. In Europe and North America during the early 19th century, the prevalence of wet nursing began to decrease, while the practice of feeding babies mixtures based on animal milk rose in popularity. This trend was driven by cultural changes as well as increased sanitation measures, and it continued throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, with a notable increase after Elijah Pratt invented and patented the India-rubber nipple in 1845. As early as 1846, scientists and nutritionists noted an increase in medical problems and infant mortality was associated with dry nursing. In an attempt to improve the quality of manufactured baby foods, in 1867, Justus von Liebig developed the world&#x27;s first commercial infant formula, &quot;Liebig&#x27;s Soluble Food for Babies&quot;. The success of this product quickly gave rise to competitors such as Mellin&#x27;s Food, Ridge&#x27;s Food for Infants and Nestlé&#x27;s Milk.

===Raw milk formulas===
As physicians became increasingly concerned about the quality of such foods, medical recommendations such as Thomas Morgan Rotch&#x27;s &quot;percentage method&quot; (published in 1890) began to be distributed, and gained widespread popularity by 1907. These complex formulas recommended that parents mix cow&#x27;s milk, water, cream, and sugar or honey in specific ratios to achieve the nutritional balance believed to approximate human milk reformulated in such a way as to accommodate the believed digestive capability of the infant.
At the dawn of the 20th century in the United States, most infants were breastfed, although many received some formula feeding as well. Home-made &quot;percentage method&quot; formulas were more commonly used than commercial formulas in both Europe and the United States. They were less expensive and were widely believed to be healthier. However, formula-fed babies exhibited more diet-associated medical problems, such as scurvy, rickets and bacterial infections than breastfed babies. By 1920, the incidence of scurvy and rickets in formula-fed babies had greatly decreased through the addition of orange juice and cod liver oil to home-made formulas. Bacterial infections associated with formula remained a problem more prevalent in the United States than in Europe, where milk was usually boiled prior to use in formulas.

===Evaporated milk formulas===
In the 1920s and 1930s, evaporated milk began to be widely commercially available at low prices, and several clinical studies in the period suggested that breastfed babies and babies fed evaporated milk equally thrived.

These studies, accompanied by the affordable price of evaporated milk and the availability of the home icebox initiated a tremendous rise in the use of evaporated milk formulas. By the late 1930s, the use of evaporated milk formulas in the United States surpassed all commercial formulas, and by 1950 over half of all babies in the United States were reared on such formulas.

===Commercial formulas===
In parallel with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition. Maltose and dextrins were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the Mead Johnson Company released a milk additive called &quot;Dextri-Maltose&quot;. This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, milkfats were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats as part of the continued drive to closer simulate human milk. This formula was called SMA for &quot;simulated milk adapted.&quot;

In the late 1920s, Alfred Bosworth released &quot;Similac&quot; (for &quot;similar to lactation&quot;), and Mead Johnson released &quot;Sobee&quot;. Several other formulas were released over the next few decades, but commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with evaporated milk formulas until the 1950s. The reformulation and concentration of Similac in 1951, and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for &quot;infant milk&quot;) in 1959 were accompanied by marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians. By the early 1960s, commercial formulas were more commonly used than evaporated milk formulas in the United States, which all but vanished in the 1970s. By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.

When birth rates in industrial nations tapered off during the 1960s, infant formula companies heightened marketing campaigns in non-industrialized countries. The poor sanitation in these countries led to steeply increased mortality rates among infants fed the often contaminated formula. Additionally, a WHO has cited over-diluting formula preparations as resulting in infant malnourishment. Organized protests, the most famous of which was the Nestlé boycott of 1977, called for an end to unethical marketing. This boycott is ongoing, as the current coordinators maintain that Nestlé engages in marketing practices which violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.

===Generic brand formulas===
In addition to commercially marketed brands, generic brands (or store brands) of infant formula were introduced in the United States in 1997, first by PBM Products. These private label formulas are sold by many leading food and drug retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, Loblaws, and Walgreens. All infant formula brands in the United States are required to adhere to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. As reported by the Mayo Clinic: “as with most consumer products, brand-name infant formulas cost more than generic brands. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that brand-name [Similac, Nestle, Enfamil] formulas are better. Although manufacturers may vary somewhat in their formula recipes, the FDA requires that all formulas contain the same nutrient density.”

Similarly, in Canada all infant formulas regardless of brand are required to meet standards set by Health Canada.

===Follow-on, transition, and toddler formulas===
Follow-on or toddler formulas are sold for ages 6 months to 3 years (when infants are typically breastfed). In the US, a transition formula is marketed for children from age 9 to 24 months, and a toddler milk is sold for children age 12 to 26 months. In the UK, follow-on milk is marketed towards children 6-12 months, and toddler milk for children aged 2 to 3 years. Toddler milk marketed in the US contains powdered milk, corn syrup and other added sugars, vegetable oil, and salt.

Toddler formulas are not nutritionally complete, nor are they subject to the same regulations or food labeling laws as infant formula. Critics have argued that follow-on and toddler formulas were introduced to circumvent the regulations regarding infant formula and have resulted in confusing advertising.

An early example of follow-on formula was introduced by Wyeth in the Philippines in 1987, following the introduction in this country of regulations on infant formula advertising, but which did not address follow-on formulas (products that did not exist at the time of their drafting). Similarly, while infant formula advertising is illegal in the United Kingdom, follow-on formula advertising is legal, and the similar packaging and market results in follow-on advertisements frequently being interpreted as advertisements for formula. (See also industry and marketing, below.)

These products have also recently fallen under criticism for contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic in some developed countries due to their marketing and flavoring practices. The drinks are also expensive. Although usually not quite as expensive as infant formula, they can cost four times the price of cow&#x27;s milk.

===Usage since 1970s===
Since the early 1970s, industrial countries have witnessed a resurgence in breastfeeding among newborns and infants to 6 months of age. This upswing in breastfeeding has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of other foods (such as cow&#x27;s milk), resulting in increased use of both breastfeeding and infant formula between the ages of 3–12 months.

The global infant formula market has been estimated at $7.9 billion, with North America and Western Europe accounting for 33% of the market and considered largely saturated, and Asia representing 53% of the market. South East Asia is a particularly large fraction of the world market relative to its population. Infant formula is the largest segment of the baby food market, with the fraction given as between 40% and 70%.

Leading health organizations (e.g. WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Department of Health and Human Services) are attempting to reduce the use of infant formula and increase the prevalence of breastfeeding from birth through 12 to 24 months of age through public health awareness campaigns. The specific goals and approaches of these breastfeeding promotion programs, and the policy environment surrounding their implementation, vary by country. As a policy basic framework, the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, adopted by the WHO&#x27;s World Health Assembly in 1981, requires infant formula companies to preface their product information with statements that breastfeeding is the best way of feeding babies and that a substitute should only be used after consultation with health professionals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) also restricts use by hospitals of free formula or other infant care aids provided by formula companies. (See also Policy section below.) While the Code was intended to restrict inappropriate &quot;marketing&quot; of infant formula, not access to it, parents have complained of being lectured or made to sign waivers implying formula would harm their babies in BFHI hospitals.

==Infant formula processing==

=== History ===
=== Current general procedure ===
The manufacturing process may differ for different types of formula made; therefore the following is the general procedure for liquid-milk based formulas:

==== Mixing ingredients ====
Primary ingredients are blended in large stainless steel tanks and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60 °C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to pasteurization equipment when mixing is complete.

==== Pasteurization ====
This is a process that protects against spoilage by eliminating bacteria, yeasts and molds.
It involves quickly heating and then cooling of the product under controlled conditions which micro-organisms cannot survive. The batch is held at around 85–94 °C for approximately 30 seconds which is necessary to adequately reduce micro-organisms and prepare the formula for filling.

==== Homogenization ====
This is a process which increases emulsion uniformity and stability by reducing size of fat and oil particles in the formula. It is done with a variety of mixing equipment that applies shear to the product and this mixing breaks fat and oil particles into very small droplets.

==== Standardization ====
Standardization is used to ensure that the key parameters like pH, fat concentration and vitamins and mineral content are correct. If insufficient levels of these are found, the batch is reworked to achieve appropriate levels. After this step, the batch is ready to be packaged.

==== Packaging ====
Packaging depends on manufacturer and type of equipment used, but in general, liquid formula is filled into metal cans with lids crimped into place.

==== Heat treatment or sterilization ====
Finally, infant formulas are heat treated to maintain the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118 °C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142 °C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.

=== Recent and future potential new ingredients ===

==== Probiotics ====
Randomized, controlled trials completed in the 2000s have shown limited and short term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants&#x27; diet. A 2018 clinical study using the multistrain De Simone Formulation probiotic showed it helped some infants reduce symptoms of infant colic. The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe, though the research is preliminary and has yet to provide definitive conclusions.

==== Prebiotics ====
Prebiotics are undigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed to be an important factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of variety, variability, complexity and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human milk in a strictly structural fashion.

The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found evidence to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased in the number of bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no evidence to support major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.

==== Lysozyme and lactoferrin ====
Lysozyme is an enzyme that is responsible for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. Lactoferrin is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow&#x27;s milk has a signifactly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them into infant formulas.

====Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation====
Some manufacturers have begun supplementing formula milk with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA). The current evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between formula milk with and without LCPUFA supplementation in terms of babies&#x27; visual function, physical growth or neurodevelopment.

<text>The Battle of Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads, also known as the Battle of Tishomingo Creek or the Battle of Guntown, was fought on Friday, June 10, 1864, near Baldwyn, Mississippi, then part of the Confederate States of America. A Federal expedition from Memphis, Tennessee, of 4,800 infantry and 3,300 cavalry, under the command of Brigadier-General Samuel D. Sturgis, was defeated by a Confederate force of 3,500 cavalry under the command of Major-General Nathan B. Forrest. The battle was a victory for the Confederates. Forrest inflicted heavy casualties on the Federal force and captured more than 1,600 prisoners of war, 18 artillery pieces, and wagons loaded with supplies. Once Sturgis reached Memphis, he asked to be relieved of his command.

==Background==

In March 1864, Lieutenant-General Ulysses Grant, newly named General in Chief of the Armies of the United States, and his most trusted subordinate Major-General William Tecumseh Sherman, planned a new, coordinated strategy to cripple the Confederate States and win the war. Grant would smash General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia and head for Richmond. At the same time, Sherman would destroy the other main Confederate force, the Army of Tennessee, and seize the key city of Atlanta. Calling itself the &quot;Gate City of the South,&quot; Atlanta was the strategic back door to the Confederate States. It was the South&#x27;s most productive arsenal after Richmond and a critical transportation hub: Four railroads radiating from the city carried supplies to their forces.

==Prelude==
Sherman began his Atlanta Campaign during the first week of May, moving slowly south while battling Confederate forces under General Joseph E. Johnston, an excellent defensive fighter. Johnston called in reinforcements, including Lieutenant-General Leonidas Polk and two divisions of his Army of Mississippi, which in turn left Major-General Stephen D. Lee in command of all remaining Confederate forces within Polk&#x27;s Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. Lee took charge of the department, but wisely gave Forrest authority to act independently in the northern part of Mississippi and Tennessee.

During the four-month Atlanta Campaign, the U.S. Army advanced steadily, but in the process extended their supply lines that stretched back to Nashville, Tennessee. As the campaign progressed, Sherman grew concerned the brazen Forrest might move his Confederate cavalry force out of North Mississippi into Middle Tennessee, strike the supply lines, and perhaps jeopardize the entire Federal effort. As a result, Sherman in late May ordered Sturgis out of Memphis and into North Mississippi with a force of just over 8,000 men. Sturgis&#x27;s mission was to keep Forrest occupied and, if possible, destroy the Confederate cavalry force that Forrest commanded. Sherman&#x27;s orders to Sturgis came just in time, as Forrest&#x27;s cavalry had just left for Middle Tennessee and was forced to turn back to Mississippi to once again defend the northern part of the state. The Federal expedition marched out of Memphis on June 1. Sturgis had a great deal of discretion in his movements, but was generally expected to &quot;proceed to Corinth, Mississippi, by way of Salem and Ruckersville, capture any force that may be there, then proceed south, destroying the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to Tupelo and Okolona, and as far as possible toward Macon and Columbus.&quot;

==Battle==
At 9:45 a.m., on June 10, a brigade of Benjamin H. Grierson&#x27;s Cavalry Division reached Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads. The battle started at 10:30 a.m. when the Confederates performed a stalling operation with a brigade of their own. Forrest ordered the rest of his cavalry to converge around the cross roads. The remainder of the Federal cavalry arrived in support, but a strong Confederate assault soon pushed them back at 11:30 a.m., when the balance of Forrest&#x27;s Cavalry Corps arrived on the scene. Grierson called for infantry support and Sturgis obliged. The line held until 1:30 p.m. when the first regiments of U.S. infantry arrived.

The Federal line, initially bolstered by the infantry, briefly seized the momentum and attacked the Confederate left flank, but Forrest launched an attack from his extreme right and left wings, before the rest of the Federal infantry could take the field. In this phase of the battle, Forrest commanded his field artillery to unlimber, unprotected, only yards from the Federal line, and to shred their troops with canister. The massive damage caused Sturgis to reorder his line in a tighter semicircle around Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads, facing east.

At 3:30, Forrest&#x27;s 2nd Tennessee Cavalry assaulted the bridge across the Tishomingo. Although the attack failed, it caused severe confusion among the U.S. troops, and Sturgis ordered a general retreat. With the Tennesseans still pressing, the retreat bottlenecked at the Tishomingo bridge and a panicked rout developed instead. During the retreat, Black Union troops inflicted heavy losses on Forrest&#x27;s troops, a turn of events seen as revenge for the Fort Pillow massacre of Black Union troops by Confederates under Forrest, which allowed Sturgis to escape and plan further raids. Sturgis&#x27; forces fled wildly, pursued across six counties on their return to Memphis before the exhausted Confederate attackers retired.

==Aftermath==
In correspondence with Brigadier-General Sturgis, Colonel Alex Wilkin, commander of the 9th Minnesota, listed several reasons for the loss of the battle. He stated that General Sturgis, knowing that his men were under-supplied, having been on less than half rations, had been hesitant to advance on the enemy, but had done so against his better judgment because he had been ordered to do so. When the cavalry had engaged the enemy, many of the infantry had been ordered to advance double-time to support the cavalry. In their weakened condition, many had fallen out in the advance. Those who did arrive were exhausted at the beginning of the battle, while the Confederates were fresh and well fed, owing to a large supply in their rear.

The roads to Tupelo were wet and sloppy due to six sequential days of rain, which slowed the advance of the supply wagons and ammunition train. Several men were detailed to try to make the roads passable. Additionally, the horses pulling the trains were poorly fed because there had been little in the way of forage for them to eat along the way. This accounted for Major-General Forrest&#x27;s capture of the artillery and supplies. Intelligence had entirely favored the South, because the Confederates had been constantly fed information about the position and strength of the Federals from civilians in the area, while Brigadier-General Sturgis had received no such intelligence. Because of this information, Forrest planned to meet the Federals at a place where he could ambush Sturgis and make retreat as difficult as possible. This location was close to his supply depot, and very far from the U.S. Army&#x27;s. When the retreat had occurred, with food and supplies exhausted, many of the Federal soldiers were unable to retreat with the rest because of fatigue. This was why so many Federals were taken prisoner during the battle. Finally, Wilkin stated that the rumors that Sturgis had been intoxicated at the battle were false.

The Chippewa of G Co. 9th Minnesota were part of the rear guard at Brices Crossroads. There their marksmanship and skirmisher tactics enabled 400 men of the 59th U.S. Colored to not be overtaken by the confederate cavalry at the Tishomingo bridge. After which the Chippewa and African Americans fell back together.

==Battlefield preservation==

The Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site, established in 1929, commemorates the Battle of Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads and is considered one of the best preserved of the American Civil War. The National Park Service erected and maintains monuments and interpretive panels on a small plot at the cross roads. In 1994, concerned citizens organized the Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads National Battlefield Commission, Inc., to protect and preserve additional battlefield land. With assistance from the Civil War Trust (now the American Battlefield Trust), and the support of federal, state, and local governments, BCNBC has purchased for preservation over . Much of the land was purchased from The Agnew Family, who still own some of the property that became the site of the battlefield. The modern Bethany Presbyterian Church is at the southeast side of the cross roads. At the time of the battle this congregation&#x27;s meeting house was located further south along the Baldwyn Road. Bethany Cemetery, adjacent to the National Park Service monument, predates the American Civil War. Many of the area&#x27;s earliest settlers are buried here. The graves of more than 90 Confederate soldiers killed at the cross roads are also located in Bethany Cemetery. Federal soldiers were buried in common graves, but were later reinterred in the Memphis National Cemetery.

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners, including BCNBC, have been acquiring and preserving land at Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads since 1996, when the Trust&#x27;s predecessor organization, the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), acquired and preserved 797.7 acres – about two-thirds of the battlefield – in two purchases. In 2001, two years after the merger of the APCWS and the original Civil War Trust, the new organization, the Civil War Preservation Trust, now known as the American Battlefield Trust, acquired 512.8 additional acres. Additional purchases during the past 16 years have increased the total battlefield land acquired and preserved to 1,500 acres as of late-2021, which is nearly the entire battlefield.

<doc id="65344" wikidata="Q161801" url="?curid=65344" title="SIDS">
<text>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sometimes known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep. Typically death occurs between the hours of midnight and 9:00a.m. There is usually no noise or evidence of struggle. SIDS remains the leading cause of infant mortality in Western countries, constituting half of all post-neonatal deaths.
The exact cause of SIDS is unknown. The requirement of a combination of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility, a specific time in development, and an environmental stressor has been proposed. These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accidental suffocation from bed sharing (also known as co-sleeping) or soft objects may also play a role. Another risk factor is being born before 37 weeks of gestation. Between 1% and 5% of SIDS cases are estimated to be misidentified infanticides caused by intentional suffocation. SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs). The other 20% of cases are often caused by infections, genetic disorders, and heart problems.
The most effective method of reducing the risk of SIDS is putting a child less than one year old on their back to sleep. Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a pacifier, and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Breastfeeding and immunization may also be preventative. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is unexpected, unexplained, and can cause suspicion that the infant may have been intentionally harmed.
Rates of SIDS vary nearly tenfold in developed countries from one in a thousand to one in ten thousand. Globally, it resulted in about 19,200 deaths in 2015, down from 22,000 deaths in 1990. SIDS was the third leading cause of death in children less than one year old in the United States in 2011. It is the most common cause of death between one month and one year of age. About 90% of cases happen before six months of age, with it being most frequent between two months and four months of age. It is more common in boys than girls. Rates of SIDS have decreased by up to 80% in areas with &quot;Safe to Sleep&quot; campaigns.

==Definition==
The syndrome applies only to infants under one year of age. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be applied to only those cases in which an infant&#x27;s death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation, including:

# an autopsy (by an experienced pediatric pathologist, if possible);
# investigation of the death scene and circumstances of the death; and
# exploration of the medical history of the infant and family.

After investigation, some of these infant deaths are found to be caused by suffocation, hyperthermia or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.

Australia and New Zealand shifted to &quot;sudden unexpected death in infancy&quot; (SUDI) for professional, scientific, and coronial clarity:

 In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have proposed that such deaths be called &quot;sudden unexpected infant deaths&quot; (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.

===Age===
SIDS has a four-parameter lognormal age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth—the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death.

By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year, with the peak incidence occurring when the infant is two to four months old. This is considered a critical period because the infant&#x27;s ability to rouse from sleep is not yet mature.

==Risk factors==
The exact cause of SIDS is unknown. Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their bellies, there has been little understanding of the syndrome&#x27;s biological process or its potential causes. Deaths from SIDS are unlikely to be due to a single cause, but rather to multiple risk factors. The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by social, economic, or cultural factors, such as maternal education, race or ethnicity, or poverty. SIDS is believed to occur when an infant with an underlying biological vulnerability, who is at a critical development age, is exposed to an external trigger. The following risk factors generally contribute either to the underlying biological vulnerability or represent an external trigger:

===Tobacco smoke===
SIDS rates are higher in babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Between no smoking and smoking one cigarette a day, on average, the risk doubles. About 22% of SIDS in the United States is related to maternal smoking. SIDS correlates with levels of nicotine and its derivatives in the baby. Nicotine and derivatives cause alterations in neurodevelopment.

===Sleeping===
Placing an infant to sleep while lying on the belly or side rather than on the back increases the risk for SIDS. This increased risk is greatest at two to three months of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals in the bed. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one year of age, as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.

Sharing a bed with parents or siblings increases the risk for SIDS. This risk is greatest in the first three months of life, when the mattress is soft, when one or more persons share the infant&#x27;s bed, especially when the bed partners are using drugs or alcohol or are smoking. The risk remains, however, even in parents who do not smoke or use drugs. The American Academy of Pediatrics thus recommends &quot;room-sharing without bed-sharing&quot;, stating that such an arrangement can decrease the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. Furthermore, the academy has recommended against devices marketed to make bed-sharing &quot;safe&quot;, such as &quot;in-bed co-sleepers&quot;.

Room sharing as opposed to solitary sleeping is known to decrease the risk of SIDS.

===Breastfeeding===
Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS. It is not clear if co-sleeping among mothers who breastfeed without any other risk factors increases SIDS risk.

===Pregnancy and infant factors===
SIDS rates decrease with increasing maternal age, with teenage mothers at greatest risk. Delayed or inadequate prenatal care also increases risk. Low birth weight is a significant risk factor. In the United States from 1995 to 1998, the SIDS death rate for infants weighing 1000–1499 g was 2.89/1000, while for a birth weight of 3500–3999 g, it was only 0.51/1000. Premature birth increases the risk of SIDS death roughly fourfold. From 1995 to 1998, the U.S. SIDS rate for births at 37–39 weeks of gestation was 0.73/1000, while the SIDS rate for births at 28–31 weeks of gestation was 2.39/1000.

Anemia has also been linked to SIDS (however, per item 6 in the list of epidemiologic characteristics below, extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant&#x27;s total hemoglobin can only be measured during life). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant&#x27;s first year.

===Genetics===
Genetics plays a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males. There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female cases, for a male fraction of 0.61. This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, infant race is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often it is chosen by the mother. The X-linkage hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess might be related to a dominant X-linked allele, occurring with a frequency of that is protective against transient cerebral anoxia. An unprotected male would occur with a frequency of and an unprotected female would occur with a frequency of .

About 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are believed to be due to channelopathies, which are inherited defects in the ion channels which play an important role in the contraction of the heart.

Genetic evidence published in November 2020 concerning the case of Kathleen Folbigg, who was imprisoned for the death of her children, showed that at least two of the children had genetic mutations in the CALM2 gene that predisposed them to heart complications. Kathleen was pardoned 5 June 2023 after spending 20 years in jail.

===Alcohol===
Drinking of alcohol by parents is linked to SIDS. One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends. Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than doubling of risk.

===Other===
A 2022 study found that infants who died of SIDS exhibited significantly lower specific activity of butyrylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in the brain&#x27;s arousal pathway, shortly after birth. This can serve as a biomarker to identify infants with a potential autonomic cholinergic dysfunction and elevated risk for SIDS.

SIDS has been linked to cold weather, with this association believed to be due to over-bundling and thus, overheating. Premature babies are at four times the risk of SIDS, possibly related to an underdeveloped ability to automatically control the cardiovascular system.

A 2-part edition of &quot;The Cook Report&quot; from 1994 claimed that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in PVC and other cot mattress materials were a cause of SIDS. Subsequent investigation by an Expert Panel led by Lady Limerick found that there was no evidence to support this claim. The report also states that toxic gas cannot be generated from antimony in mattresses and that babies had SIDS on mattresses that did not contain the compound.

It has been suggested that some cases of SIDS may be related to &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; infections.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Some conditions that are often undiagnosed and could be confused with or comorbid with SIDS include:
* medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD deficiency);
* infant botulism;
* long QT syndrome (accounting for less than 2% of cases);
* &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; bacterial infections;
* shaken baby syndrome and other forms of child abuse;
*overlaying, child smothering during carer&#x27;s sleep

For example, an infant with MCAD deficiency might die by &quot;classical SIDS&quot; if found swaddled and prone, with its head covered, in an overheated room where parents were smoking. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, the presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant might have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for a pathologist to distinguish between them.

A 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in North Carolina that listed SIDS as the cause of death, and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation. The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such as unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.

Several instances of infanticide have been uncovered in which the diagnosis was originally SIDS. Since an autopsy is often unable to determine whether asphyxiation is caused intentionally, medical practitioners rely on patient and family history and evidence of prior abuse to identify cases of infanticide. Some estimates in the 1980s and 1990s placed the potential rate of SIDS deaths caused by maltreatment around 10% and as high as 40%, but data from interventions such as the Safe to Sleep campaign suggests that these figures were substantially inflated. In 2006 the American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that between 1% and 5% of SIDS cases were potentially attributable to undiagnosed infanticide.

Some have underestimated the risk of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family; the Royal Statistical Society issued a media release refuting expert testimony in one UK case, in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.

==Prevention==
A number of measures have been found to be effective in preventing SIDS, including changing the sleeping position to supine, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases the risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their bellies or sides while sleeping.

Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. In the United States, companies that sell the monitors do not have FDA approval for them as medical devices.

===Sleep positioning===

Sleeping on the back has been found to reduce the risk of SIDS. It is thus recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and promoted as a best practice by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) &quot;Safe to Sleep&quot; campaign. The incidence of SIDS has fallen in a number of countries in which this recommendation has been widely adopted. Sleeping on the back does not appear to increase the risk of choking, even in those with gastroesophageal reflux disease. While infants in this position may sleep more lightly, this is not harmful. Sharing the same room as the parents but in a different bed may decrease the SIDS risk by half.

===Pacifiers===
The use of pacifiers appears to decrease the risk of SIDS, although the reason is unclear. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers pacifier use to prevent SIDS to be reasonable. Pacifiers do not appear to affect breastfeeding in the first four months, even though this is a common misconception.

===Bedding===
Product safety experts advise against using pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, bumper pads (crib bumpers), stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib, and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib &quot;naked.&quot;

Due to the obvious dangers, experts have also warned that blankets or other clothing not be placed over a baby&#x27;s head.

The use of a &quot;baby sleep bag&quot; or &quot;sleep sack&quot;, a soft bag with holes for the baby&#x27;s arms and head, can be used as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.

===Vaccination===

Infants typically receive several vaccinations between the ages of 2 and 4 months, which is also the peak age for SIDS. Due to this coincidence, a number of studies have investigated the possible role of vaccinations as a cause of SIDS. These have found either no relation between vaccinations and SIDS, or a reduction of the risk of SIDS following vaccination. A 2007 meta-analysis found that vaccinations were associated with a halving of the risk of SIDS, and argued that immunisation should be a part of SIDS prevention campaigns.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, SIDS resulted in about 22,000 deaths , down from 30,000 deaths in 1990. Rates vary significantly by population from 0.05 per 1000 in Hong Kong to 6.7 per 1000 in Native Americans.

SIDS was responsible for 0.54 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.

SIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004, a 54% decrease. During a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%, a 31% decrease. According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS &quot;A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn&#x27;t decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting&quot;.

===Race===

In 2013, there were persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. In 2009, the rates of death ranged from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asians and Pacific Islanders to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for Native Americans and Alaska Natives. African American infants have a 24% greater risk (100.7 per 100,000 live births) of having a SIDS-related death, compared to the U.S. population as a whole, and experience a 2.5 greater incidence of SIDS than white infants. Rates are calculated per 100,000 live births to enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population size.

Research suggests that factors which contribute more directly to SIDS risk—maternal age, exposure to smoking, safe sleep practices, etc.—vary by racial and ethnic group and therefore risk exposure also varies by these groups. Risk factors associated with prone sleeping patterns of African American families include mother&#x27;s age, household poverty index, rural/urban status of residence, and infant&#x27;s age. More than 50% of African American infants were placed in non-recommended sleeping positions, according to a 2012 study completed in South Carolina, indicating that cultural factors can be protective as well as problematic.

The rate of SIDS per 1000 births varies among ethnic groups in the United States:
*Central Americans and South Americans: 0.20
*Asian/Pacific Islanders: 0.28
*Mexicans: 0.24
*Puerto Ricans: 0.53
*Whites: 0.51
*African Americans: 1.08
*Native American: 1.24

==Society and culture==
Many popular media portrayals of infants show them in non-recommended sleeping positions.

<text>A leat (; also lete or leet, or millstream) is the name, common in the south and west of England and in Wales, for an artificial watercourse or aqueduct dug into the ground, especially one supplying water to a watermill or its mill pond. Other common uses for leats include delivery of water for hydraulic mining and mineral concentration, for irrigation, to serve a dye works or other industrial plant, and provision of drinking water to a farm or household or as a catchment cut-off to improve the yield of a reservoir.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;leat&quot; is cognate with &quot;let&quot; in the sense of &quot;allow to pass through&quot;. Other names for the same thing include &quot;fleam&quot; (probably a leat supplying water to a mill that did not have a millpool). In parts of northern England, for example around Sheffield, the equivalent word is &quot;goit&quot;. In southern England, a leat used to supply water for water-meadow irrigation is often called a &quot;carrier&quot;, &quot;top carrier&quot;, or &quot;main&quot;.

==Design and functions==

===Water mills===
Leats generally start some distance (a few hundred metres/yards, or perhaps several miles/kilometres) above the mill or other destination, where an offtake or sluice gate diverts a proportion of the water from a river or stream. A weir in the source stream often serves to provide a reservoir of water adequate for diversion. The leat then runs along the edge or side of the valley, at a shallower slope than the main stream. The gradient, together with the quality of the wetted surface of the leat, determines the flow rate. The flow rate may be calculated using the Manning formula. By the time it arrives at the water mill the difference in levels between the leat and the main stream is great enough to provide a useful head of water – several metres (perhaps 5 to 15 feet) for a watermill, or a metre or less (perhaps one to four feet) for the controlled irrigation of a water-meadow.

===Water supply===
Leats are used to increase the yield of a reservoir by trapping streams in nearby catchments by means of a contour leat. This captures part or all of the stream flow and transports it along the contour to the reservoir. Such leats are common around reservoirs in the uplands of Wales.

===Mining===
Leats were built to work lead, tin and silver ores in mining areas of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, the Pennines and the Leadhills/Wanlockhead area of Southern Scotland from the 17th century onwards. They were used to supply water for hushing mineral deposits, washing ore and powering mills.

==Use in Roman times==
Leats were also used extensively by the Romans, and can still be seen at many sites, such as the Dolaucothi goldmines. They used the aqueducts to prospect for ores by sluicing away the overburden of soil to reveal the bedrock in a method known as hushing. They could then attack the ore veins by fire-setting, quench with water from a tank above the workings, and remove the debris with waves of water, a method still used in hydraulic mining. The water supply could then be used for washing the ore after crushing by simple machines also driven by water.

The Romans also used them for supplying water to the bath-houses or thermae and to drive vertical water-wheels.

==Dartmoor==
There are many leats on Dartmoor, mostly constructed to provide power for mining activities, although some were also sources of drinking water. The courses of many Dartmoor leats may still be followed. Many such leats on the moor are marked on the 1:50000 and 1:25000 Ordnance Survey maps, such as that serving the now-defunct Vitifer mine near the Warren House Inn. Notable leats include:
*Drake&#x27;s Leat, constructed in 1591 under the management of Sir Francis Drake, as an agent of the Corporation of Plymouth, to carry water from Dartmoor to Plymouth.
*Devonport Leat constructed in the late 18th century to carry water to the expanding naval dockyard at Devonport (now a part of Plymouth).

<text>&quot;FYI&quot; is a common abbreviation of &quot;for your information&quot;. The term, originally a wire service abbreviation used by journalists, is commonly used in email, instant messaging and other messages to indicate an informational message or explanatory statement not suggesting any action, or requiring a response. The abbreviation is also commonly used in spoken conversations.

Use of &quot;FYI&quot; has been attested from 1915, as &quot;just a little thing that saves space on a telegraph message&quot; (charged by the word).

Among Internet Standards, FYIs are a subset of the Request for Comments (RFC) series. The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet users with a central repository of information about any topics which relate to the Internet. FYI topics may range from historical memos on &quot;Why it was done that way&quot; to answers to commonly asked operational questions.

<doc id="65350" wikidata="Q647003" url="?curid=65350" title="Video Electronics Standards Association">
<text>VESA (), formally known as Video Electronics Standards Association, is an American technical standards organization for computer display standards. The organization was incorporated in California in July 1989 and has its office in San Jose. It claims a membership of over 300 companies.

In November 1988, NEC Home Electronics announced its creation of the association to develop and promote a Super VGA computer display standard as a successor to IBM&#x27;s proprietary Video Graphics Array (VGA) display standard. Super VGA enabled graphics display resolutions up to 800×600 pixels, compared to VGA&#x27;s maximum resolution of 640×480 pixels—a 56% increase.

The organization has since issued several additional standards related to computer video displays. Widely used VESA standards include DisplayHDR, DisplayPort, and Flat Display Mounting Interface.

== Standards ==
* Feature connector (VFC), obsolete connector that was often present on older videocards, used as an 8-bit video bus to other devices
* VESA Advanced Feature Connector (VAFC), newer version of the VFC that widens the bus to either a 16-bit or 32-bit bus
* VESA Local Bus (VLB), once used as a fast video bus (akin to the more recent Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP))
* VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE), used for enabling standard support for advanced video modes
* Display Data Channel (DDC), a data link protocol which a host device can use to control an attached display and communicate EDID, DPMS, MCCS and similar messages
* Extended Display Identification Data (EDID), a data format for display identification data
* Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS), a message protocol for controlling display parameters such as brightness, contrast, display orientation from the host device
* DisplayID, display identification data format, which is a replacement for E-EDID
* VESA Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS), which can be used to invoke power saving modes in monitors
* Digital Packet Video Link (DPVL), a display link standard that can be used to update only portions of the screen
* VESA Stereo, a standard 3-pin connector for synchronization of stereoscopic images with LC shutter glasses
* Flat Display Mounting Interface (FDMI)
* Generalized Timing Formula (GTF), video timing standard
* Coordinated Video Timings (CVT), a replacement for GTF
* VESA Video Interface Port (VIP), a digital video interface standard
* DisplayPort (DP), a digital display interface standard
* VESA Enhanced Video Connector, an obsolete standard for reducing the number of cables around computers
* DisplayHDR, a standard to simplify HDR specifications for the display industry and consumers

==Company membership==
The following major companies are members of VESA.

* AMD
* Apple Inc.
* Canon Inc.
* Casio
* Dell
* Dolby Laboratories
* Foxconn
* Fujitsu
* Gigabyte Technology
* Google

== Criticism ==
VESA has been criticized for their policy of charging non-members for some of their published standards. Some people believe the practice of charging for specifications has undermined the purpose of VESA. According to Kendall Bennett, developer of the VBE/AF standard, the VESA Software Standards Committee was closed down due to a lack of interest resulting from charging high prices for specifications. At that time no VESA standards were available for free. Although VESA now hosts some free standards documents, the free collection does not include newly developed standards. Even for obsolete standards, the free collection is incomplete. As of 2010, current standards documents from VESA cost hundreds to thousands of dollars each. Some older standards are not available for free, or for purchase. As of 2017, the free downloads require mandatory registration. While not all standards bodies provide specifications freely available for download, many do, including: ITU, JEDEC, DDWG, and HDMI (through HDMI 1.3a).

At the time DisplayPort was announced, VESA was criticized for developing the specification in secret and having a track record of developing unsuccessful digital interface standards, including Plug &amp; Display and Digital Flat Panel.

<doc id="65356" wikidata="Q1363979" url="?curid=65356" title="VESA BIOS Extensions">
<text>VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) is a VESA standard, currently at version 3, that defines the interface that can be used by software to access compliant video boards at high resolutions and bit depths. This is opposed to the &quot;traditional&quot; INT 10h BIOS calls, which are limited to resolutions of 640×480 pixels with 16 colour (4-bit) depth or less. VBE is made available through the video card&#x27;s BIOS, which installs some interrupt vectors that point to itself during boot up.

Most newer cards implement the more capable VBE 3.0 standard. Older versions of VBE provide only a real mode interface, which cannot be used without a significant performance penalty from within protected mode operating systems. Consequently, the VBE standard has almost never been used for writing a video card&#x27;s drivers; each vendor has thus had to invent a proprietary protocol for communicating with its own video card. Despite this, it is common that a driver thunk out to the real mode interrupt in order to initialize screen modes and gain direct access to a card&#x27;s linear frame buffer, because these tasks would otherwise require handling many hundreds of proprietary variations that exist from card to card.

In EFI 1.x systems, the INT 10H and the VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) are replaced by the EFI UGA protocol. In widely used UEFI 2.x systems, the INT 10H and the VBE are replaced by the UEFI GOP.

==Standards==

===Early VBE ===
VBE 1.0 (VS891001) was defined in 1989. VBE 1.1 (VS900602) was defined in 1990. VBE 1.2 (VS911022) was defined in 1991. These versions of VBE require real mode to work.

VBE defines several new functions called through INT 10H. The function numbering start with AX=4F00, or (AH=4F, AL=00), for &quot;Function 00h&quot;. 00h to 05h were defined in VBE 1.0, 06h and 07h in 1.1, and 08h in 1.2.

===VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE core) 2.0 (November 1994)===
This standard provides the primary functionality of the VESA BIOS Extensions. It allows applications to determine the capabilities of the graphics card and provides the ability to set the display modes that are found. VBE 2.0 adds some new features above the prior VBE 1.2 standard including linear framebuffer access and protected mode banking. Some of the VBE Core 2.0 features include:

; Linear framebuffer access: Enables direct framebuffer access in protected mode as one large area of memory instead of less efficient smaller chunks.
; Protected mode banking: Allows access to the framebuffer from protected mode without &quot;thunking&quot; down to real mode. This is implemented using a new &quot;Function 0Ah&quot;.
; Super VGA page flipping: Allows higher performance animation to provide for smooth animation for computer games and other high performance graphics programs.
; Super VGA virtual screens: Allows software to set up virtual display resolutions, larger than the actual displayed resolution, and smoothly scroll or pan around the larger image.
; High Color and TrueColor modes: Industry standard 16-bit and 24-bit graphics modes for resolutions from 320×200 up to ×.

===VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE core) 3.0 (September 1998)===
A superset of the VBE 2.0 standard. This standard adds refresh rate control, facilities for stereo glasses, improved multi-buffering and other functions to the VBE 2.0 standard.

; Triple buffering: Allows high speed applications to perform multi-buffering with less screen flickering and without having to wait for the graphics controller.
; Refresh rate control using GTF timings: This allows applications and operating system utilities to change the refresh rate in a standard way on all VBE 3.0 graphics controllers. Important for stereo applications, since when stereo is enabled, the user&#x27;s effective refresh rate is cut in half.
; Stereo page flipping: When viewing an application using stereo glasses, software needs to page flip twice as often as normal, because it needs to generate separate images for each eye. This new feature allows stereo compatible software to display properly.
; Hardware stereo sync: Allows stereo software to determine if there is a connector for stereo glasses on the user&#x27;s graphics card.

A new &quot;Protected Mode Entry Point&quot; was added as an alternative to &quot;Function 0Ah&quot;.

===VBE/accelerator functions (VBE/AF) (August 1996)===
VBE/AF provides a low-level, standard interface to common acceleration functions available on most hardware. Some of the functions defined in the standard are access to hardware cursors, Bit Block Transfers (Bit Blt), off screen sprites, hardware panning, drawing and other functions. It is defined to work under 32-bit protected mode. Despite the widespread adoption of VBE Core, very few devices support VBE/AF. The FreeBE/AF project implements free third-party VBE/AF drivers for certain graphics cards.

===Supplemental specifications===
Supplemental specifications provides device independent interface between application software and Super VGA hardware. Function numbers are assigned by VESA Software Standards Committee (SSC).

====Power management extensions (PM)====

DPMS is a hardware standard that allows graphics cards to communicate with DPMS-compliant monitors via a special signalling system that can be used with existing graphics controllers and monitor cables. This signalling system allows the graphics card to tell the monitor to go into a number of different power management or power saving states, which effectively allow the monitor to turn itself off when it is not in use.

====Flat panel interface extensions (FP)====
Allows access to special features in flat panel controllers.

====Audio interface extensions (AI)====
Provides standard to audio services.

Currently (version 1.00), the VBE/AI specification defines three device classes: WAVE, MIDI, and VOLUME. Device types not covered:

; CDROM control: which is covered by the Microsoft&#x27;s CD-ROM Extensions.
; Effects processors: This class of device will be expanded in future version of the VBE/AI specification.

====OEM extensions====
Provides standard entry to vendor-specific extensions.

====Display Data Channel (DDC)====

The Display Data Channel or DDC is a digital connection between a computer display and a graphics adapter that allows the display to communicate its specifications to the adapter. The standard was created by VESA.

====Serial Control Interface (SCI)====
Provides hardware independent means for operating system and application to read and write data over I²C serial control interface.

== VBE mode numbers ==
Although mode number is a 16-bit value, the optional VBE mode numbers are 14 bits wide. Bit 15 is used by VGA BIOS as a flag to clear or preserve display memory.
VBE defined mode numbers as follows:
Starting in VBE/Core 2.0, VESA no longer defines new VESA mode numbers and no longer requires a device to implement the old numbers. To properly detect information of a screen mode, use &quot;Function 01h - Return VBE Mode Information&quot;.

Mode 81FFh is a special video mode designed to preserve current memory contents and give access to the entire video memory.

===Modes defined by VESA===
Beginning with the VBE 2.0 standard, no new modes will be defined by VESA, and old modes are no longer mandatory. The use of defined modes should be considered deprecated: modern video cards may or may not use these mode numbers (even though most do for backward compatibility), and modern software should not use them. The correct way for software to discover available display modes is to obtain a list of modes (using &quot;Function 00h - Return VBE Controller Information&quot;) and then to check each mode (using &quot;Function 01h: Return VBE Mode Information&quot;) until it finds the mode/s it requires.

Modes 264–268 are text modes. 264 (0108h) is 80 columns × 60 rows (80×60), 265 (0109h) is 132×25, 266 (010Ah) is 132×43, 267 (010Bh) is 132×50 and 268 (010Ch) is 132×60. 
===Other commonly available graphics modes===

The table below combines the modes defined by VESA (the values denoted in black) along with modes commonly used, but which may not work on all graphics cards as they are not defined by any standard ().

=== Mode detection ===
A few tools have been written to detect VBE modes available on a system. They generally work by invoking &quot;Function 01h&quot;, which is more reliable than assuming a table of extended modes as it&#x27;s part of the device&#x27;s self-documentation.
* hwinfo is the hardware detection tool used in SuSE Linux and in some other Linux distributions. Running codice_1 reports graphics information, including VESA modes on a &quot;Mode&quot; line.
* mdt is a Linux or DOS tool that uses VESA BIOS functions to read monitor data.
* The Linux Real Mode Interface (LRMI) has a program that prints out VESA info.
* SciTech Software had a unrelated for DOS that dates back to 1994.
* The x86 &quot;PC&quot; version GNU GRUB 2 has a command for printing out available video modes and for trying a specific mode. They use a built-in table instead of &quot;Function 01h&quot;. For other platforms, including x86 EFI, they are replaced by the more generic and .

=== Linux video mode numbers ===

The Linux kernel allows the user to select the VESA mode at boot time by passing a code in memory to the kernel. The LILO boot loader passes this code based on a &quot;vga&quot; parameter in its configuration file. It takes the form &#x27;vga=XXX&#x27;, where XXX is the decimal value, or &#x27;vga=0xHHH&#x27;, where HHH is the hexadecimal value. However, the &#x27;vga=&#x27; boot loader parameter does not directly accept VESA video mode numbers; rather, the Linux video mode number is the VESA number plus 512 (in the case of the decimal representation) or plus 0x200 (in the case of the hexadecimal representation). For example, the defined VESA value of 257 (0x101), representing 640x480 and 256 colours, has an equivalent Linux video mode value of 769 (0x301).

As indicated earlier, the VESA standard defines a limited set of modes; in particular, none above × are covered and, instead, their implementation is completely optional for graphics adapter manufacturers. As vendors are free to utilize whatever additional values they please, this means that, in the table below, the modes (and expressed in decimal form) may not apply to every graphics adapter!


VGA= also appears to select ×800 (8-bit) for various laptops&#x27; displays. &lt;br&gt;
VGA= is ×

===Modes available in Parallels===
The VESA BIOS emulation in the Parallels virtual machine has a different set of non-standard VESA modes. As of build 3214, LRMI vbetest reveals these modes:

=== Modes available in VirtualBox ===
The VESA BIOS emulation in the VirtualBox virtual machine has a different set of non-standard VESA modes. As of 6.1.38_Ubuntu build r153438, the VESA BIOS function AX=0x4F01 reveals these modes (See also VBETables-gen.c):

<text>A gunnies, gunnis, or gunniss is the space left in a mine after the extraction by stoping of a vertical or near vertical ore-bearing lode. The term is also used when this space breaks the surface of the ground, but it can then be known as a coffin or goffen. It can also be used to describe the deep trenches that were dug by early miners in following the ore-bearing lode downwards from the surface – in this case they are often called open-works; their existence can provide the earliest evidence of mining in an area. William Pryce, writing in 1778, also used the term as a measure of width, a single gunnies being equal to three feet.

==History==
That the gunnis was an element of mining in ancient times has been shown by archaeological investigation, such as that performed in the 1990s at Bir Umm Fawakhir, an ancient gold mine in Egypt. The exploration revealed that some 20th-century drives had broken into ancient gunnises which were filled in by rocks that had fractured off the hanging wall, or fallen from above. It was discovered that a wall had been built around one of the gunnises in Roman or Byzantine times to stop material from falling in.

Some gunnies can be very large: in 1901 a warning was issued in &quot;The Cornishman&quot; about the &quot;immense gunnies&quot; in Dolcoath mine where there had been a big collapse in 1828 and &quot;ominous slow movement&quot; for the last 27 years; a 1934 article in &quot;The Western Morning News&quot; related a trip to the cliffs at St Agnes: where after entering a narrow hole, about 150 feet in there was a &quot;huge excavation ... the top or &#x27;back&#x27; [of which] could not be seen, and the depth must have been about 150 to 200 feet, as we could hear the sea roaring away down there [...] This huge &quot;gunnies&quot; could have contained a decent sized cathedral.&quot; The writer recommended that it be made accessible so that the public could admire &quot;the works of the men [...] whose enterprise, energy, daring and skill are unsurpassed in the history of our country&quot;.

The name of the village of Gunnislake in east Cornwall, England, UK, is partly derived from the term: the first record of the name in 1485 is as &quot;Gonellake&quot; from a personal name &quot;Gunna&quot; and the local word &quot;lake&quot; for a stream, but by 1796 the name had changed to its present form as a result of the mining that took place in the area.

An 18th-century gunnis at Poldark Mine is mentioned as a notable feature in the successful Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site nomination document of 2004.

==Problems and dangers==
The large extent and great depth of some gunnies often caused problems when they lay in the way of later mine development. For instance, Joseph Jennings, the former mine manager at East Pool mine wrote in 1916 that in 1908 he had had to bridge the &quot;gunniss&quot; of the Great Lode at the 160 fathom level, and that of the New North Lode at the 240 fathom level and install expensive timber stulls to enable the continued development of the mine. These large open underground spaces were the inevitable cause of accidents too: in 1836 a miner was killed at Dolcoath mine when he fell 13 fathoms (about 80 feet) from a &quot;swing stage&quot;, a platform let down on ropes or chains into a gunnies that was too wide for any available timber to reach from side to side.

===A house of water===
Another problem caused to later mining was if a gunnies became flooded, when it would sometimes be called &quot;a gunnies of water&quot;, but more often &quot;a house of water&quot;. In his &quot;Mineralogia Cornubiensis&quot; of 1778, William Pryce talks of the care taken by miners when they thought they might be digging an adit towards a house of water: they ensured that they used an iron rod to bore a small hole several feet ahead of their main pickaxe excavation; by so doing they received advance warning of breaking into a huge volume of water. Despite this care, Pryce reported that the water pressure could quickly enlarge the small hole and uncontrollably flood the mine; he also stated that men were paid extra money for working in such dangerous areas and that he was aware of miners being killed when doing this.

The Victorian author R. M. Ballantyne&#x27;s novel &quot;Deep Down; a Tale of the Cornish Mines&quot; includes a chapter entitled &quot;Describes &#x27;holing to a house of water&#x27; and its terrible consequences.&quot; In his later book of personal reminiscences entitled &quot;An Author&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, Ballantyne states that his visits to the mines of the St Just area of Cornwall in 1868 were an inspiration for his novel. His reminiscences include a mine captain named Jan telling him about a house of water that was discovered in Botallack Mine and how it was cleared.

The greatest loss of life in Cornwall caused by &quot;holing into a house of water&quot; occurred at Wheal Owles in January 1893. Twenty miners were drowned when the flooded workings of the disused Wheal Drea were breached. This occurred because of former errors in &quot;dialling&quot; (the only means of underground surveying available at that time): according to the records, the level in which the breach occurred was being driven &quot;away&quot; from the old workings. The Wheal Owles mine was said to have filled from the 120-fathom sump to the 30-fathom sea level in only 20 minutes. After the accident, the only pumping engine on the site was not powerful enough to drain the mine and attempts at fund-raising to install a better one were unsuccessful, so the bodies of those who drowned were never recovered.

===Disposal of waste===
Rather than being kept open, disused gunnies were often used as a convenient site for the disposal of waste rock (known as &quot;deads&quot; or &quot;attle&quot;). This had the useful side-effect of avoiding the need to support the sides of the gunnies with stulls, especially if the gunnies diverged significantly from the vertical, to avoid the likely collapse of the hanging wall. This was still not an ideal solution, however, because if it became necessary to pass through the filled gunnies in later development of the mine, the problem became one of digging through and supporting tons of loose rock. The 1893 mining accident at Dolcoath in which seven men were killed was caused by failure of the stull holding up a huge quantity of deads in a gunnies.

<text>Newquay ( ; ) is a town on the north coast in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is a civil parish, seaside resort, regional centre for aerospace industries with an airport and a spaceport, and a fishing port on the North Atlantic coast of Cornwall, approximately north of Truro and west of Bodmin.

The town is bounded to the south by the River Gannel and its associated salt marsh, and to the north-east by the Porth Valley. The western edge of the town meets the Atlantic at Fistral Bay. The town has been expanding inland (south) since the former fishing village of New Quay began to grow in the second half of the nineteenth century.

In 2001, the census recorded a permanent population of 19,562, increasing to 20,342 at the 2011 census and 23,600 in 2021. Recent estimates suggest that the total population for the wider Newquay area (Newquay and St Columb Community Network Area) was 27,682 in 2017, projected to rise to 33,463 by 2025.

==History==
=== Prehistoric period ===
There are some pre-historic burial mounds and an embankment on the area now known as &quot;The Barrowfields&quot;, from Trevelgue. There were once up to fifteen barrows, but now only a few remain. Excavations here have revealed charred cooking pots and a coarse pottery burial urn containing remains of a Bronze Age chieftain, who was buried here up to 3,500 years ago.

In 1987, evidence of a Bronze Age village was found at &quot;Trethellan Farm&quot;, a site that overlooks the River Gannel.

The first signs of settlement in the Newquay region consist of a late Iron Age hill fort/industrial centre which exploited the nearby abundant resources (including deposits of iron) and the superior natural defences provided by Trevelgue Head. It is claimed that occupation of the site was continuous from the 3rd century BC to the 5th or 6th century AD. A Dark Ages house was later built on the head.

=== Domesday Book ===
The settlement which is now known as Newquay was not mentioned in Domesday Book, although a parcel of land was recorded at Treninnick, which is now part of suburban Newquay. Treninnick was then part of the manor of Coswarth and consisted of one virgate (value 15d) [some 30 acres or 12 hectares] with five sheep. The village of Crantock is the only other recognisable name in the Newquay area also recorded in Domesday Book, (as &quot;Langoroch&quot;).

=== Funds to build a ‘new quay’ ===
In 1439, Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Exeter granted an Indulgence to build a new quay from which the town would later derive its modern name. However, this appeal did not succeed, and the harbour remained largely undeveloped until the early 17th century, although it is thought to have had a succession of short wooden piers since the 15th century, and possibly before that.

===Medieval to Early Modern period ===

The origins of modern Newquay can be traced back to the medieval period to a small cluster of cottages known as &quot;Towan,&quot; located where the Central Inn now stands. About 200 meters (660 feet) away was another settlement called &quot;New Quay,&quot; referring to a small harbour within the Manor of Towan Blystra. Despite occasional confusion, &quot;Towan Blystra&quot; is not a Cornish equivalent of Newquay, and there is no historical record of the name &quot;Newquay&quot; being rendered in Cornish. The two settlements were connected by a track that eventually became today&#x27;s Fore Street. The local economy at the time relied primarily on fishing, agriculture, and some mining activity

The earliest mention of a fish market in the area dates back to 1571, found in the Arundell papers. It is believed that this market may have been located in what is now Central Square, though fish trading also likely took place directly at the quay and in nearby cellars. The public house later known as &#x27;The Central&#x27; (rebuilt in 1859) became a hub of local trade, with farmers parking wagons of grain in the square and conducting business inside the inn.

Richard Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, published in 1602, includes the lines: “Neyther may I omit newe Kaye, a place in the North coast of this Hundred, so called, because in former times, the neighbours attempted, to supplie the defect of nature, by Art, in making there a Kay, for the Rode of shipping, which conceyt they still retayne, though want of means in themselves, or the place, have left the effect in Nubibus [unfulfilled].”

In 1615 Thomas Stuer, who was Lord of the Manor, applied for permission to build a single pier, and the development of the modern harbour then began.

=== The Huer&#x27;s Hut ===

The Huer&#x27;s Hut at Newquay, Cornwall served as a lookout point from which a man known as a huer could keep watch for the arrival of the pilchards. They could be discerned by the water turning a dark reddish-brown and by the flocks of seagulls which dived down to feed on the fish. The huer would announce the arrival by shouting &quot;hevva, hevva&quot; or through the use of a trumpet after which he would direct the townsfolk to the fish by waving tree branches above his head. The word huer has the same derivation as the &quot;hue&quot; in hue and cry, after this action.

The Huer&#x27;s Hut at Newquay has been described as &quot;a particularly fine late mediaeval specimen&quot;. The listed building description states that the current structure dates from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, though a plaque on the structure claims 14th-century origins. The plaque also states that the structure may have been used at an earlier time as a hermitage and lighthouse.

The structure was restored in 1836, at which point the fireplace may have been significantly altered. It received protection as a listed building (under the name &quot;Huer&#x27;s House&quot;) on 24 October 1951 and is currently categorised as grade II*

=== Central Inn ===

The origins of the original inn on the site of the present Central Inn are unclear. An inn was recorded on this site in 1755, which was probably built of freestone and topped with a thatched roof, later slate. It served as an early place of trade. In her publication &quot;Old Newquay,&quot; Sarah Teague Husband described the inn in the 1850s as being &quot;two or three hundred years old&quot; and in a state of disrepair.

The inn was rebuilt in 1859, and was known as the Commercial Inn until early in the 20th century.

=== Dr William Borlase visit in 1755 ===
Dr William Borlase, who was a Cornish antiquarian and the Rector of Ludgvan, visited Towan Blystra in 1755 during a tour of Cornwall. He wrote: &quot;Passed the Ganel and went about a mile further to a place of about twelve houses called Towan Blystra, a furlong further to the New Quay in St Columb Parish, here is a little pier, the north point of which is fixed on a rock, the end in a cliff; at the eastern end there is a gap cult [cut] about 25 feet wide into the slaty rock of the cliff: This gap lets small ships into a basin which may hold about six ships of about 80 tons burthen and at spring tides has 18 feet of water in it, upon the brow of the cliff is a dwelling house and a commodious cellar lately built.&quot;
The dwelling house mentioned by Borlase is believed to be referring to &#x27;Quay House&#x27; one of the oldest building in the town, the Newquay edition of the Homeland Handbooks book (1931) described it as having a &quot;picturesque front and low grey roof may be observed beyond a gate marked &#x27;Private&#x27;.&quot;

=== 19th century ===
The first national British census of 1801 recorded around 1,300 inhabitants in the settlement which would have include the small settlements which would become Newquay (enumerated as a village under St Columb Minor parish).

In 1832 the London-based entrepreneur Richard Lomax bought the manor of Towan Blystra. This included the small harbour at what was becoming known as New Quay.

The proposal included a description of New Quay and Towan and the unpaved track between the settlements. It also showed some buildings including an inn, (this was rebuilt in 1859 and is now known as The Central), cottages along what would become Bank Street and other structures connected with the fishing industry, such as the cellars, where the fish were dried and packed in barrels. Lomax began the construction of the north and south quay, but he died in 1837 before his harbour had been completed.

The harbour was at its most prosperous in the 25 years following its purchase in the 1870s by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. In 1872 the middle jetty was added to expand capacity.

To the north of the harbour there were fish cellars in the 19th century, where pilchards were salted and packed in casks. The two remaining areas are Fly cellars and Active cellars, although the others have disappeared.

A mansion called the Tower was built for the Molesworth family in 1835: it included a castellated tower and a private chapel as they were Roman Catholics and no church for that denomination existed in the area. The Tower later became the golf club house. After the arrival of passenger trains in June 1876, the town started to develop with many rows of private houses and hotels began to emerge.

=== Victorian Hotels ===
Several major hotels were built around the end of the 19th century, the first being the Great Western Hotel which opened in 1879 on Station Road, now Cliff Road. The original hotel was rebuilt in the 1930s. Other early first-class hotels included the Victoria (1899), the Atlantic (1892) and the Headland (1900) near Fistral, Many smaller hotels were also being opened. Some were created around the turn of the century by converting large houses, many of which had been built originally by wealthy visitors as holiday homes, particularly along Narrowcliff.

===20th century===

Three churches were built early in the twentieth century, including the present day parish church of St Michael the Archangel, which was consecrated in 1911. Growth of the town eastwards soon reached the area around the railway station: Station Road became Cliff Road around 1930, and the houses beyond, along Narrowcliff, were also converted into hotels. Narrowcliff was known for a while as Narrowcliff Promenade, and then Narrowcliff Road. On some pre-war maps, it is spelt Narrowcliffe.

At the time of the First World War the last buildings at the edge of the town were a little further along present-day Narrowcliff. Post-war development saw new houses and streets built in the Chester Road area, accompanied by ribbon development along the country lane which led to St Columb Minor, some away. This thoroughfare was modernised and named Henver Road, also some time in the 1930s. Development continued in this direction until the Second World War, by which time much of Henver Road had houses on both sides, with considerable infilling also taking place between there and the sea.

A thriving knitting industry became established in Newquay in the early part of the 20th century. In 1905, Madame Hawke began selling machine-knitted garments in a shop in the centre of the town. Debenhams was sent a sample of her work and commissioned her as a supplier. She opened a factory in Crantock Street, which has since been converted into housing. Several competing knitting companies were also set up in the town in this period.

In the early 1950s, the last houses were built along Henver Road. After that, there was a virtually continuous building line on both sides of the main road from the other side of St Columb Minor right into the town centre. The Doublestiles estate to the north of Henver Road was also built in the early 1950s, as the name of Coronation Way indicates, and further development continued beyond, becoming the Lewarne Estate and extending the built up area to the edges of Porth.

Other areas also developed in the period between the wars were Pentire (known for a time as West Newquay) and the Trenance Valley. Other streets dating from the 1920s included St Thomas Road, which provided the approach to the town&#x27;s new cottage hospital at its far end, to be followed by others in the same area near the station, such as Pargolla Road.

More recent development has been on a larger scale: until the late 1960s, a passenger arriving by train would not have seen a building by the line (with the exception of Trencreek village) until the Trenance Viaduct was reached. Today, the urban area starts a good inland from the viaduct. Other growth areas have been on the fringes of St Columb Minor and also towards the Gannel. More development beyond Treninnick, south of the Trenance Valley, has taken the urban area out as far as Lane, where more building is now under way. The Trennnick/Treloggan development, mainly in the 1970s and 1980s, included not merely housing but also an industrial estate and several large commercial outlets, including a major supermarket and a cash and carry warehouse.

===21st century===
One of the worst hotel fires in Britain for many years occurred in 2007 at the Penhallow hotel, which overlooked Towan beach. Three people were killed because the hotel management had not complied with fire safety standards. The building was later demolished and replaced by a new structure.

The first phase of a new Duchy of Cornwall development began to be built in 2012 at Tregunnel Hill, which was sometimes unofficially called Surfbury after the similar Poundbury development in Dorset. It has 174 houses of traditional designs.

There is now a similar but much more substantial development in progress inland, and construction on a large site known as Nansledan (&#x27;broad valley&#x27; in Cornish) is now well under way, mainly west of the Quintrell Road. Plans were approved for the development of 800 homes at Nansledan in December 2013, but the plan now includes more than 4,000 homes, shops, a supermarket, church and a 14-classroom primary school which opened to its first pupils in September 2019. Following the example set at Tregunnel Hill, the buildings are again of traditional designs and all street names are in Cornish.

Places like Trencreek, Porth and St Columb Minor have long since become suburbs of Newquay: it had been reported that it was possible that by the 2030s, should present development trends continue, the south eastern edge of the town could stretch beyond the present boundary set by Nansledan and encompass Quintrell Downs, from the town centre. However, the Newquay Neighbourhood Development Plan, which was approved in a referendum held on 6 April 2019, said it was important to retain a &#x27;green buffer&#x27; between Newquay and Quintrell Downs.

In April 2012 the Aerohub enterprise zone for aerospace businesses was set up at Newquay Airport. In September 2014, the UK&#x27;s Homes and Communities Agency and the European Regional Development Fund agreed to fund the construction of a £6 million Aerohub Business Park there. A plan to launch space vehicles from a new spaceport alongside the airport moved ahead in July 2018 when a contract was signed with Virgin Orbit. The first launch from the spaceport, named Spaceport Cornwall, took place on 9 January 2023. The initial launch of the LauncherOne rocket from the carrier aircraft, &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;, was successful but the rocket&#x27;s second stage suffered an anomaly and the vehicle and payload satellites failed to reach orbit.

== National and Local Government ==
=== Newquay Town Council ===
Before the establishment of Newquay Council, The Local Government Act 1858 granted powers to create Local Government Districts in England and Wales, and in 1868 a Local Board was formed in Newquay.

The Local Government Act 1894 established urban and rural districts in England and Wales, and one result was the creation of Newquay Urban District. Newquay Urban District Council would be abolished in 1974 as part of local government reorganisation. In that year, the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect, resulting in the merger of the borough of St. Austell with Fowey, Newquay urban district and St Austell Rural District.

The new council was known as the Borough of Restormel, but it was then abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England on 1 April 2009. Cornwall became a unitary authority and there is now a two-tier structure of local government in the county. Cornwall Council is responsible for such matters as council tax collections, schools, highways, the harbour, refuse and recycling and street cleaning. Locally, Newquay Town Council has been gradually acquiring more responsibilities from Cornwall Council, including the library and information service, public toilets as well as managing the Killacourt open space and one car park.

The Member of Parliament for St Austell and Newquay is Noah Law (Labour), who won the seat in the General Election of 4 July 2024. The previous MP was Steve Double (Conservative) who had been MP for the constituency since it was created in 2010. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2019.

On 1 May 2024 Newquay town councillors selected Cllr Drew Creek as Mayor for the next 12 months. Outgoing mayor Cllr Margaret North is now deputy mayor.

==Churches &amp; chapels==
=== Non-conformist ===

The first Methodist preaching at Newquay was recorded by Richard Treffry in 1802, an innkeeper, Carter, being the host. In 1810, preacher William O&#x27;Bryan came to Newquay and formed the nucleus of the first Methodist Society. 

The Society, later known as the Bible Christians or &#x27;Bryanites&#x27;, built a chapel in 1851. In 1907, following the amalgamation of the Methodist New Connexion, Bible Christians, and United Methodist Free Churches into the United Methodist Church, the chapel was renamed the Sydney Road United Methodist Church.The Methodist Union of 1932 further unified various Methodist denominations, and the chapel became known as the Sydney Road Methodist Chapel. It continued to serve the local congregation until its closure around 1977. Subsequently, the building was demolished, and the site was redeveloped for housing and a car park.

The Baptists were the first to have a building. The Newquay Baptist Church, formerly the Ebenezer Baptist Chapel founded in 1822, is one of the oldest religious buildings in Newquay. The worshippers at Ebenezer were Strict and Particular, or Calvinistic Baptists. Before the Baptist chapel was built the Strict Baptists formed themselves into a community and met for worship in the old malthouse opposite Primrose cottage on Beach Road. They had a regular Sunday supply of preachers from Plymouth, Torquay, and Truro.

The first Methodist chapel was built in 1833, at a cost of £170. In 1849, following a division within the Methodist movement, a significant portion of the congregation left to establish the Wesley Hill Chapel in 1852. The remaining members continued at Crantock Street until 1865, when they moved to the United Methodist Chapel on Marcus Hill, known as Steps Chapel. Following a visit by General Bramwell Booth in 1924, the building was taken over by the Salvation Army in 1926.

The Wesleyan Methodist Church in Newquay, built in 1904, was designed in Gothic style by the architectural firm Bell, Withers, and Meredith. It served the growing Methodist community. Renamed the Newquay Wesleyan Methodist Chapel after the Methodist Church unification in 1932, it closed in 2009 due to declining congregations and was sold to the Elim Pentecostal Church. The Grade II listed building remains a key historical landmark.

==== Roman Catholic ====
The Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity is earlier, having been built in 1903: until 1985 it was dependent on monks from Bodmin but then became part of the Diocese of Plymouth.

=== Parish Church ===

The first Anglican chapel was built in Newquay in 1858 as a chapel of ease, in a fine Cornish Perpendicular style; it was known as St Michael&#x27;s due to the dedication of a side chapel. The parish itself was created in 1882 from part of St Columb Minor parish. By 1896 St Michael&#x27;s Church had been twice enlarged, a north and a south aisle being added, and its capacity increased to 500. By the turn of the 19th century, however, it was quite inadequate to hold the summer congregation. The cramped and inconvenient site meant that no further enlargement of the chapel was possible, and it seemed inevitable that a new church would have to be built on a different site. The present church, the Newquay Parish Church of St Michael the Archangel is dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, was originally designed by Ninian Comper and built in 1910–11, but the tower not completed until the 1960s. Arthur Mee, in his &quot;Cornwall&quot; volume of the King&#x27;s England series, describes the perpetual light maintained in the church as a memorial to the men of Newquay who died in the First World War. The stained glass windows and rood screen are also described: the main themes are St Michael, the three other archangels, and Jesus Christ and Mary the Blessed Virgin. The St Michael, chapel-of-ease continued to serve the people of Newquay until 1911 when the chapel was sold to the Women&#x27;s Institute which owned it for a number of years until it was sold again to FW Woolworth for a new store. The chapel was demolished in 1937.

==Tourism==
Newquay has been a major tourist destination for more than a century, principally on account of its coastline and nine long and accessible sandy beaches. These include Fistral, which could claim to the best known surfing beach in the British Isles. Around 25,000 people live in Newquay, but the population can increase to 100,000 or more in the summer because Newquay has a large stock of holiday accommodation.

During the 20th century the town developed in sections, Trenance Leisure Gardens are in a wooded, formerly marshy valley on the quieter edge of Newquay, stretching down to the Gannel Estuary. From the Edwardian era it provided recreation for tourists with walks, tennis courts and a bowling green. The gardens are spanned by a stone railway viaduct which was rebuilt just before the Second World War. The boating lake was dug during the depression of the 1930s as a work creation scheme. In the late 1960s, further enterprises were established by the council, including mini-golf, a swimming pool, the Little Western Railway miniature railway which opened in 1968 and Newquay Zoo, which opened in 1969.

Newquay was also known for the &quot;Run to the Sun&quot; event, which began on Fistral Beach in 1987 and then took place for many years during the public holiday on the last weekend in May at Trevelgue Holiday Park. People visited the town in Volkswagen camper vans, Volkswagen Beetles and other custom cars. The last RTTS took place in 2014, but it was announced in early 2023 that the event would return on 27 May to a new site at St Mawgan, just outside Newquay.

Other events in recent times have included the large Boardmasters music festival, which attracts another 50,000 visitors over one weekend in early August and is held on sites at Watergate Bay (outside the urban area) and Fistral Beach. Cornwall Pride moved to Newquay from Truro in 2017, and this took place in 2018 on the last Saturday in August.

The South West Coast Path runs through the town.

===Town trail===
Newquay Discovery Trail is made up of 14 Cornish slate discs, each in diameter, sunk into the ground at strategic points around the town. Each of the discs features a series of &#x27;conundrum&#x27; words carved by sculptor Peter Martin. The trail starts in the centre of town at the Killacourt.

==Education==
Newquay has one higher education campus, Newquay University Centre, which is a member of the Combined Universities in Cornwall Partnership. It offers foundation degree courses in Zoological Conservation, Marine Aquaculture, Animal Science and Wildlife Education and Media. Appropriately, the campus is close to Newquay Zoo in the Trenance Valley. There are also two secondary schools: Newquay Tretherras is a state-funded academy with specialist Technology College status, and Treviglas Academy is a specialist Business and Enterprise College.

A new centre of higher education for Newquay had been planned alongside the Airport and Spaceport (see Transport) in 2020, to be known as the International Aviation Academy and attached to RAF St Mawgan. It was hoped to cater for students who wish to gain air- or space-related qualifications. The project was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and no further announcements have been made.

===Second World War===
Among many schools evacuated to Cornwall (notably Benenden Girls&#x27; School), 240 boys and 20 masters of Gresham&#x27;s School were evacuated to the town from Holt, Norfolk, during the Second World War, between June 1940 and March 1944. Gresham&#x27;s occupied the Bay Hotel and the Pentire Hotel.

Between 1940 and 1944, the Royal Air Force used hotels in Newquay as a Ground school for aircrew Initial Training Wings No 7, No 8, and No 40. Recruits were taught basic flying theory and service protocols, and were sorted into their likely future RAF trades, such as Pilots, Observers, Navigators, Wireless operators, and air gunners. The training took place in the Highbury Hotel and men were billeted in nearby hotels.

Several hotels were requisitioned as convalescent hospitals for the Army, Air Force, and Royal Navy. These were the Atlantic Hotel, the Headland Hotel, the Hotel Victoria, the Fistral Bay Hotel and St Rumons (later renamed the Esplanade).

==Hospital and emergency services==

Devon and Cornwall Constabulary maintains a substantial police station in Tolcarne Road. The modern fire station in Tregunnel Hill is run by Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service, and is the home of one of the two aerial ladder platforms based in Cornwall. The fire station has 24-hour cover during the summer and is day-staffed in the winter. A separate specialist fire service is maintained at Newquay Airport.

Ambulance cover is provided by the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust from an Ambulance Station in St Thomas Road. Cornwall Air Ambulance is also based just outside the town, alongside the airport. In addition, the airport at Newquay is one of ten UK bases for the Search and Rescue service, which is run by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#x27;s Newquay Lifeboat Station is at the harbour. There is also a coastguard rescue team based at Treloggan Industrial Park.

=== Newquay Community Hospital ===
Newquay Hospital was opened in 1931 at the end of St Thomas Road. It is a community hospital catering for both in- and outpatients, with a number of clinics and a minor injuries unit. Cornwall’s only general hospital and full accident and emergency department is in Truro.

Proposals in recent years for the Newquay Growth Area, east of the present town, have included a new and larger hospital.

==Transport==
=== Railway ===

Newquay railway station is the terminus of the Atlantic Coast Line from Par. The railway was originally built as a mineral line in the 1840s and ran mainly around the fringes of the built-up area, as it was then, to the harbour. A passenger service followed on 20 June 1876, and from then on the town developed quickly as a resort. The station is close to the beaches on the eastern side of the town centre.

Newquay has daily direct services to and from Plymouth, Exeter and London between May and September. It is the only branch line terminus in Britain still served by scheduled intercity trains. Passenger services are currently operated under government contract by Great Western Railway, whose owner is FirstGroup.

==== History ====
The goods line which would be acquired later by the Cornwall Minerals Railway was opened in 1846 from inland mines to the harbour, and was worked by horses. Parts of the old line from the present station to the harbour are still in existence: the most obvious section is a broad footpath from opposite the station in Cliff Road to East Street, known locally as the &quot;tram track&quot;, and complete with a very railway-style overbridge. From East Street, the line continued towards the harbour along the present-day Manor Road.

The last trains ran through to Newquay Harbour in about 1924, but general goods traffic continued to reach Newquay railway station until 1964. The passenger station and its approaches were enlarged more than once, with additional carriage sidings being built at Newquay in the 1930s. The originally wooden viaduct just outside the station, which crosses the Trenance Valley, was rebuilt in 1874 to allow locomotives to run over the structure and then again just before World War II to carry double track, which extended until 1964 for approximately to Tolcarn Junction. The line is now single again, but the width of the viaduct is still obvious.

Tolcarn Junction was the point where a second passenger route left the Par line between 1906 and 1963. This branch ran to Chacewater, west of Truro, via Perranporth and St Agnes, and provided through trains to Truro and Falmouth.

Two of the three former platforms were taken out of use in 1987, but Network Rail had planned to restore one of the disused platforms to improve capacity.
==== Mid Cornwall Metro ====
The Mid Cornwall Metro received provisional approval for government funding worth almost £50 million on 18 January 2023, and the project was approved by Cornwall Council in December 2023, on condition that budgets are kept under control.

A second platform will be restored at Newquay and there will be other improvements to the terminus as well as upgraded signalling and an additional crossing place (a section of double track) at Tregoss Moor, between St Columb Road and Roche stations. The MCM will provide a clockface hourly service between Newquay, Par, St Austell, Truro and Falmouth Docks.

Work is now under way. The frequency of trains to Par is due to be doubled to hourly in May 2025, and services extended to Truro and Falmouth in 2026.

===Airport===

Newquay Airport provides links to many other parts of the United Kingdom. It is an HM Customs port because it also handles increasing numbers of foreign flights, both scheduled and chartered. Newquay is the principal airport for Cornwall, although there are several minor airfields elsewhere in the county.

Until 2008, Newquay Civil Airport (as it was formerly known) used the runway and other facilities of RAF St Mawgan, but in December 2008 the Ministry of Defence handed over most of the site to the recently formed Cornwall Airport Limited. The first stage of the conversion into a fully commercial airport was completed in 2011, although further substantial development is planned. The handover, which was due to take place at the end of 2008, was delayed for almost three weeks because of problems in obtaining the essential Civil Aviation Authority licence, which was withheld until further work had been carried out.

The name has changed several times since 2008, and the airport is now marketed as Cornwall Airport Newquay. However, the IATA code is still NQY.

Usage of the airport had been rising sharply until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–22. On summer Saturdays in 2018 there were almost 50 arrivals and departures, including flights to Germany and other continental countries.

===Spaceport===
Newquay has obtained a licence to operate as a spaceport, called Spaceport Cornwall. A decision had been expected about the sites of UK spaceports in the summer of 2017, but the additional general election in June 2017 delayed necessary legislation for a time. Cornwall&#x27;s bid was supported by Cornwall Council and Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership. The proposal also included the related Cornish space tracking station at Goonhilly, which is near Helston in south Cornwall. On 16 July 2018 a new partnership was announced with Virgin Orbit to create the spaceport, with the intention of launching satellites from Newquay within three years. On the same day, the government confirmed that a grant worth £2 million would be available to developing spaceports. The planned first satellite from Newquay, Kernow Sat 1, was to measure ocean pollution and deforestation and was planned to be launched in summer 2022 (in the end, Kernow Sat 1 was not present on the first launch from Spaceport Cornwall in 2023). On 24 February 2022, the then Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, formally launched the construction of a £5.6m Centre for Space Technologies alongside the Spaceport, and the new Centre is expected to create 150 jobs. The first, unsuccessful, attempt to launch satellites took place on 9 January 2023.

===Bus===

The bus station is in Manor Road, which runs parallel to the shopping area in Bank Street. A scheme to upgrade and improve the bus station with the additions of a new enclosed waiting area and accessible toilet began in February 2018 and was completed in July. Further changes occurred in April and May 2020, because Cornwall Council had awarded an eight-year contract to run subsidised services in the county to Go Cornwall, which also operates as Plymouth CityBus and is owned by the Go-Ahead Group.

There are regular bus services from Newquay to many parts of Cornwall, including the neighbouring urban centres of St Austell and Truro as well as Camborne, Falmouth, Fowey, Padstow, Perranporth, Redruth, St Columb Major, St Ives and Wadebridge. In addition, there are several local services, including an hourly night bus service on Saturday nights/Sunday mornings to St Columb Major and Fraddon during the peak summer months. Buses are operated by First Kernow and Go Cornwall Bus while the town is also served by National Express.

Go Cornwall operates frequent services in the high summer to and from a park and ride site by the A392, opposite Hendra Holiday Park.

==Sport and leisure==
Newquay has one non-league association football club - Newquay A.F.C. play at the Mount Wise Stadium. Godolphin Atlantic F.C. used to play on Godolphin Way until the club was dissolved in January 2023.

Newquay Hornets rugby football club play at Newquay Sports Centre.

Newquay has a four-team cricket club, also based at the sports centre. Their 1st XI compete in Cornwall&#x27;s County One, winning the ECB Cornwall Premier League in 2003. Newquay&#x27;s academy has produced four full-Cornwall players — Rob Harrison, Neil Ivamy, Joe Crane and Adam Cocking, in addition to numerous County youth representatives. There are several youth teams, ranging from Under 9 to Under 19.

Newquay plays host to the Newquay Road Runners, who are again based at the sports centre.

Newquay has been a centre for Cornish wrestling in the past. Venues for tournaments have included the New Hotel Meadow, Mount Wise recreation ground, the Red Lion Field and the Tower Meadow on Tower Road. The Interceltic games were hosted by Newquay in 1936, 1948, 1951, 1965 and 1975.

===Surfing===

Newquay is widely regarded as the surf capital of the UK, and is therefore also a centre for the surf industry in Britain. There are many surf stores, board manufacturers and hire shops in the town.

At the centre of Newquay&#x27;s surfing status is Fistral Beach which has a reputation as one of the best beach breaks in Cornwall. Fistral is capable of producing powerful, hollow waves and holding a good sized swell.

Fistral Beach has been host to international surfing competitions for around 20 years now. The annual Boardmasters Festival takes place at Fistral beach, with a music festival taking place at Watergate Bay.

Newquay is also home to the reef known as the Cribbar. With waves breaking at up to , the Cribbar was until recently rarely surfed as it requires no wind and huge swell to break. It was first surfed in September 1965 by Rodney Sumpter, Bob Head and Jack Lydgate and again in 1966, by Pete Russell, Ric Friar and Johnny McElroy and American Jack Lydgate. The recent explosion in interest in surfing large waves has seen it surfed more frequently by South African born Chris Bertish, who during a succession of huge clean swells in 2004, surfed the biggest wave ever seen there.

Towan, Great Western and Tolcarne beaches nearer the town and nearby Crantock and Watergate Bay also provide high quality breaks.

In 2011, an artificial reef was proposed in Newquay to increase the swell and frequency of waves for surfers. However, it lost council support after local rowing clubs and fishermen protested against it.

==Geography==
===Climate===
As with the rest of the British Isles and South West England, Newquay experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is St. Mawgan/Newquay Airport, about 3.5 miles to the north east of the town centre. Temperature extremes in the area since 1960 vary from in June 1976 and August 1995 down to during January 1987.

===Geology===
The bedrock underlying Newquay is the Devonian age Meadfoot Group, a succession of interbedded mudstones, siltstones and sandstones, with occasional beds of limestone. Quaternary age deposits of blown sand cover the bedrock in the western part of the town. Some mineralisation associated with the Cornubian granite batholith that intrudes into much of the peninsular is found in the western part of the town near Fistral Beach, in the form of lodes of lead and silver minerals.

<text>Gloucester ( ) is a cathedral city, non-metropolitan district and the county town of Gloucestershire in the South West of England. Gloucester lies on the River Severn, between the Cotswolds to the east and the Forest of Dean to the west; it is sited from Monmouth, from Bristol, and east of the border with Wales. Gloucester has a population of around 132,000, including suburban areas. It is a port, linked via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal to the Severn Estuary.

Gloucester was founded by the Romans and became an important city and &quot;colony&quot; in AD 97, under Emperor Nerva as &quot;Colonia Glevum Nervensis&quot;.

It was granted its first charter in 1155 by Henry II. In 1216, Henry III, aged only nine years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of Gloucester Cathedral. Gloucester&#x27;s significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, founded in 679 (later Gloucester Cathedral); the nearby St Oswald&#x27;s Priory, founded in the 880s or 890s; and Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded in 1136. The town is also the site of the siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces in the First English Civil War.

A major attraction of the city is Gloucester Cathedral, which is the burial place of King Edward II and Walter de Lacy; it features in scenes from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former county jail (on the site of a Saxon and Norman castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the County Council) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a chalybeate spring having been discovered in 1814.

Economically, the city is dominated by the service industries and has strong financial, research, distribution and light industrial sectors. Historically, it was prominent in the aerospace industry.

In 1926, the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company at Brockworth changed its name to the Gloster Aircraft Company because international customers claimed that the name &quot;Gloucestershire&quot; was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester&#x27;s aviation history and its involvement in the jet engine.

==Toponymy==
From the city&#x27;s Roman name, &quot;Glevum&quot;, Anglo-Saxon migrants after 410, with their fledgling feudal structure, the Kingdom of Wessex, replaced the area&#x27;s Romano-Celtic society and changed the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Caerloyw&quot; (), Gloucester&#x27;s name in modern Welsh, while recognising the presence of the Roman fort. &quot;Caerloyw&quot; is a compound of &quot;caer&quot;, meaning &#x27;fort, stronghold, castle&#x27;, and &quot;loyw&quot;, a lenition of &quot;gloyw&quot; as it would have been pronounced by many speakers, meaning &#x27;bright, shiny, glowy&#x27;.

A variant of the term &quot;-cester/chester/caster&quot; instead of the Welsh &quot;caer&quot; was eventually adopted. The name Gloucester thus means roughly &quot;bright fort&quot;. Mediaeval orthographies include &quot;Caer Glow&quot;, &quot;Gleawecastre&quot; and &quot;Gleucestre&quot;.

This etymology was first suggested by the Austrian philologist, Alfred Holder, in 1896. An alternative etymology has been proposed, which argues that the first element of the place-name is related to a Welsh word signifying &#x27;valiant&#x27;, rendering &#x27;Gloucester&#x27; to mean &#x27;fortress of the valiant&#x27;.

==History==
===Roman Gloucester===
Glevum was established around AD 48 at an important crossing of the River Severn and near to the Fosse Way, the early front line after the Roman invasion of Britain. Initially, a Roman fort was established at present-day Kingsholm. Twenty years later, a larger legionary fortress was built on slightly higher ground nearby, centred on present-day Gloucester Cross, and a civilian settlement grew around it. Probably the Roman Legion XX Valeria Victrix was based here until 66 and then Legio II Augusta as they prepared to invade Roman Wales between 66 and 74 AD, who stayed later until around 87.

Gloucester became a &quot;Colonia&quot; in 97 as &quot;Colonia Nervia Glevensium&quot;, or &quot;Glevum&quot;, in the reign of Nerva. It is likely that Glevum became the provincial capital of Britannia Prima.

Within about 15 years new privately constructed properties replaced the earlier barracks and public buildings, temples and bath houses were under construction in stone. Piped water began to be supplied. Drains and sewers were laid. On the site of the legionary &quot;principia&quot; an imposing central &quot;forum&quot; was laid out surrounded by colonnades and flanked on three sides by part-timbered ranges of shops. Closing off the south of the forum was the 100m x 40m Basilica. Many fine homes with mosaic floors were built in the town.

At its height, Glevum may have had a population of as many as 10,000 people. The entire area around Glevum was intensely Romanised in the second and third centuries with a higher than normal distribution of villas.

At the end of the third century or the start of the fourth, major changes were made to the city&#x27;s second-century wall. It was replaced in two stages by a stronger and higher one of stone resting on massive reused stone blocks. In the second stage, the blocks rested on deep timber foundation piles. Stone external towers were added; two parallel wide ditches were also cut in front of the new walls.

Remains of the Roman city can still be seen:
*Many archaeological artifacts and some in-situ walls in the Gloucester City Museum &amp; Art Gallery
*The remains of the Roman and mediaeval East Gate in the East Gate Chamber on Eastgate Street.
*Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate Streets all follow the line of their original Roman counterparts, although Westgate Street has moved slightly north and Southgate Street now extends through the site of the Roman basilica.

===Post-Roman Gloucester===
Withdrawal of all Roman forces and many societal leaders in about the year 410 may have allowed leading families of the Dobunni tribe to regain power within the now Roman-influenced, interconnected and intermixed Celtic Brythonic local people. This intermix is reflected by the fact a large minority of basic words and available synonyms in Welsh have a Latin base. In the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; Gloucester is shown as part of Wessex from the Battle of Deorham in 577. At some point afterwards, along with the rest of its shire excluding the Forest of Dean, Gloucester was part of the minor kingdom of the Hwicce. In 628, as a result of the Battle of Cirencester, that kingdom became a client or sub-kingdom of Mercia. From about 780, the Hwicce was no longer feigning any pretence as a kingdom and became part of Mercia. Mercia, allied by matrimony and sharing a desire to counter the Danish onslaught as had conquered swathes of the wider island at large, submitted to Alfred the Great&#x27;s Kingdom of Wessex in about 877–883. A 20th-century writer intuitively adds that Roman stem Gleu- Glev- was, doubtless, pronounced without any final consonant. &quot;Claudia Castra&quot; is mentioned in the 18th century as a possible Latin name related to the city.

The first bridging point on a navigable, defensive barrier, great river and the foundation in 681 of the abbey of St Peter by Æthelred of Mercia, favoured town growth; and before the Norman conquest of England, Gloucester was a borough governed by a portreeve, with a castle which was frequently a royal residence, and a mint. In the early 10th century, the remains of Saint Oswald were brought to a small church here and shrine built there, a draw for pilgrims. The core street layout is thought to date to the reign of Æthelflæd in late Saxon times.

In 1051, Edward the Confessor held court at Gloucester and was threatened there by an army led by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, but the incident resulted in a standoff rather than a battle.

===Middle ages===
After the Norman Conquest, William Rufus made Robert Fitzhamon the first baron or overlord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon had a military base at Cardiff Castle, and for the succeeding years the history of Gloucester was closely linked to that of Cardiff.
During the Anarchy, Gloucester was a centre of support for the Empress Matilda, who was supported in her claim to the throne by her half-brother, Fitzhamon&#x27;s grandson, Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (also known as Robert of Gloucester). After this period of strife ended with the ascent of her son Henry to the throne Henry II of England, Henry granted Robert possession of Cardiff Castle, and it later passed to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester son of Robert. The story of the Anarchy is vividly told in a series of 19th-century paintings by William Burges at the Castle.

Henry granted Gloucester its first charter in 1155, which gave the burgesses the same liberties as the citizens of London and Winchester. A second charter of Henry II gave them freedom of passage on the River Severn. The first charter was confirmed in 1194 by King Richard I. The privileges of the borough were greatly extended by the charter of King John (1200), which gave freedom from toll throughout the kingdom and from pleading outside the borough.

In 1216, King Henry III, aged only ten years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of Gloucester Cathedral. During his reign, Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany his cousin was briefly imprisoned at Gloucester Castle as state prisoner from 1222 to 1223, and from 1237 to 1238, in addition to sometime during the reign of King John.

Gloucester&#x27;s significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter&#x27;s Abbey founded in 679 (later Gloucester Cathedral), the nearby St Oswald&#x27;s Priory, Gloucester founded in the 880s or 890s, Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded 1136 as a retreat for a community of Welsh monks (now near the western bypass), the Franciscan Greyfriars community founded in 1231 (near Eastgate Shopping Centre), and the Dominican Blackfriars community founded in 1239 (Ladybellegate Street). It also has some very early churches including St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester near the Cathedral and the Norman St Mary de Crypt Church, Gloucester in Southgate Street.

Additionally, there is evidence of a Jewish community in Gloucester as early as 1158–1159; they lived around present-day East Gate Street and had a synagogue on the south side, near St Michael&#x27;s church. Gloucester was probably the home of Rabbi Moses, who established an important Anglo-Jewish family. The Jews of the town were falsely accused by the Dominican monks of murdering a child, Harold of Gloucester, in an attempt to establish a cult similar to that of William of Norwich, which failed entirely. Nevertheless, the accusations were recycled around the time of the Edict of Expulsion. In January 1275, Eleanor of Provence expelled Jews from all of the towns within her dower lands, and the Jews of Gloucester were ordered to move to Bristol but finding an especially difficult situation there, relocated to Hereford.

 In the Middle Ages, the main export was wool, which came from the Cotswolds and was processed in Gloucester; other exports included leather and iron (tools and weapons). Gloucester also had a large fishing industry at that time.

In 1222, a massive fire destroyed part of Gloucester.

One of the most significant periods in Gloucester&#x27;s history began in 1378 when Richard II convened Parliament in the city. Parliaments were held there until 1406 under Henry IV of England. The Parliament Rooms at the Cathedral remain as testimony to this important time.

Gloucester was incorporated by King Richard III in 1483, the town being made a county in itself.

===Early modern era to contemporary period===
The city&#x27;s charter was confirmed in 1489 and 1510, and other charters of incorporation were received by Gloucester from Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. Princess Mary visited Gloucester in September 1525 accompanied by her ladies and gentlewomen. She was met by the Mayor, John Rawlins, at Quedgeley. Her father Henry VIII and his then Queen, Anne Boleyn, visited in July 1535. They used Gloucester as a base for hunting trips to Painswick, Coberley, and Miserden. They left Gloucester for Leonard Stanley, on their way to Berkeley Castle.

Gloucester was the site of the execution by burning of John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, in the time of Queen Mary in 1555. In 1580, Gloucester was awarded the status of a port by Queen Elizabeth I.

The 16th and 17th centuries saw the foundation of two of Gloucester&#x27;s grammar schools: the Crypt School in 1539 and Sir Thomas Rich&#x27;s School in 1666. Both still flourish as grammar schools today, along with Ribston Hall and Denmark Road High School.

During the English Civil War, the fall of nearby Bristol encouraged the reinforcement of the existing town defences. The siege of Gloucester commenced in 1643 in which the besieged parliamentarians emerged victorious. The Royalist&#x27;s plan of bombardment and tunnelling to the east gate failed due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery and the besieged sniping and conducting artillery fire on the Royalist encampment.

By the mid-17th century, only the gatehouse and keep of Gloucester Castle remained, the latter of which was being used as a gaol until it was deemed unsuitable and demolished in the late 1780s. By 1791, the new gaol was completed leaving no trace of the former castle.

In the 19th century, the city grew with new buildings including Wellington Parade and the Grade II listed Picton House (c. 1825).

The 1896 Gloucester smallpox epidemic affected some 2000 residents.

During the Second World War, two petroleum storage depots were constructed in Gloucester. A Government Civil Storage depot with six 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks was constructed on the Berkeley Canal in 1941/42 by Shell-Mex and BP and connected to the pipeline that ran from the Mersey to the Avon. It was also connected to the Air Force Reserve Depot and a Shell Mex and BP facility for road and rail loading. Due to severe tank corrosion, it was demolished in 1971/2 and disposed of in 1976. The second depot was an Air Force Reserve Depot with four 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks constructed in 1941/42 by Shell, Shell-Mex and BP at the Monk Meadow Dock on the Canal. Originally, delivery was by road, rail and barge and pipeline. It was also connected to the docks and to the Shell Mex and BP installation for rail and road loading facilities and the civil storage site. It was transferred from the Air Ministry to the Ministry of Power in 1959, closed in the 1990s and disposed of in the later 2000s.

Gloucester&#x27;s most important citizens include Robert Raikes (founder of the Sunday School movement) who is still commemorated by the name of Robert Raikes&#x27; House in Southgate Street. Its most infamous citizen was Fred West.

In July 2007, Gloucester was hit badly by a flood that struck Gloucestershire and its surrounding areas. Hundreds of homes were flooded, but the event was most memorable because of its wider impact – about 40,000 people were without power for 24 hours, and the entire city (plus surrounding areas) was without piped water for 17 days.

In 2009, Gloucester Day was revived as an annual day of celebration of Gloucester&#x27;s history and culture. The day originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces during the First English Civil War.

===Coat of arms===

Gloucester is one of the few cities in England with two coats of arms. The first consists of three chevrons surrounded by ten roundels. The chevrons come from the arms of the Clare family, who were earls of Gloucester from the 12th to the 14th centuries, while the roundels come from the arms of the Bishop of Worcester, whose bishopric historically encompassed Gloucester. This coat is the older of the two, though it is usually termed the &quot;Commonwealth coat&quot;, as it was not officially granted to the city until 1652, during the Commonwealth period. The crest and supporters (lions bearing broadswords and trowels) were also adopted at this time, along with the motto &quot;Fides Invicta Triumphat&quot; (&quot;unconquered faith triumphs&quot;, in reference to the royalist siege withstood by the city in 1643).

The second coat, termed the &quot;Tudor coat&quot;, was granted in 1538. It features the roses of York and Lancaster, the boar&#x27;s head of Richard III, a ceremonial sword and cap, and two horseshoes surrounded by nails, to represent Gloucester&#x27;s historical association with ironworking.

Although grants made by Commonwealth heralds were nullified after the Restoration, the Commonwealth coat continued to be used by the city rather than the Tudor coat. The Commonwealth coat, along with the crest and supporters, was legally granted to the city by letters patent dated 16 April 1945. This was reconfirmed in 1974 following the local government changes of that year.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Gloucester, at district (city) and county level: Gloucester City Council and Gloucestershire County Council. The Quedgeley area of the city is a civil parish with a town council, forming a third tier of local government; the remainder of the city is an unparished area.

===History===
Gloucester was an ancient borough, being treated as a borough from Saxon times and being granted its first known borough charter by Henry II in 1155. In 1483 the town of Gloucester was given the right to appoint its own magistrates, making it a county corporate, administratively independent from the surrounding county of Gloucestershire. When the Diocese of Gloucester was founded in 1541, the town was given the right to call itself a city. The city was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Gloucester was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from Gloucestershire County Council.

Gloucester Guildhall at 23 Eastgate Street was built in 1892 and served as the city&#x27;s administrative headquarters until 1986, when the council moved to North Warehouse at Gloucester Docks.

On 1 April 1974, the modern district of Gloucester was formed under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the same area as the abolished County Borough of Gloucester. The reforms also saw the city become subordinate to Gloucestershire County Council, losing the independence it had held since 1483. The parish of Quedgeley was subsequently transferred into Gloucester from Stroud District in 1991. Quedgeley retains its own parish council, unlike the rest of Gloucester, which is an unparished area. In 2017, Quedgeley Parish Council changed its name to Quedgeley Town Council, making it a town within a city.

==Geography==
Gloucester is the county town of Gloucestershire, and is the 53rd largest settlement in the United Kingdom by population. In 2010, its population was 123,400. It has the traditional lowest bridging point of the longest river in Great Britain, connecting it with Over. The 2011 census recorded that the city had a population of 121,921 and by 2016 its population was estimated to be 128,488. The city&#x27;s urban area extends beyond its boundaries, with several outlying districts. The 2021 census gave the population of the Gloucester Urban Area as 169,061, absorbing areas such as Brockworth and Churchdown.

The city is located on the eastern bank of the River Severn, sheltered by the Cotswolds to the east, while the Forest of Dean and the Malvern Hills rise to the west and north, respectively. Gloucester is an inland port, linked via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal which runs from Gloucester&#x27;s docks to the Severn Estuary, allowing larger ships to reach the docks than would be possible on the tidal reaches of the river itself, which go well north of the city to Haw Bridge. The wharfs, warehouses and the docks themselves fell into disrepair until their renovation in the 1980s. They now form a public open space. Some warehouses now house the Gloucester Waterways Museum, others were converted into residential flats, shops and bars. Additionally, the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum is located in the Custom House.

Gloucester is made up of a variety of neighbourhoods, some of which correspond to electoral divisions of the City Council.
† Quedgeley is the only town within the city&#x27;s borders. Because of this it has its own town council.

=== Green belt ===

The city itself contains no green belt; however, it is bordered to the north east by the green belt in the surrounding Tewkesbury district, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion towards Cheltenham and Innsworth, as well as protecting smaller nearby villages such as Churchdown, Badgeworth, Shurdington, and Twigworth.

==Climate==

== Potential merger of Cheltenham and Gloucester ==
In May 2024, under plans by Gloucestershire County Council, it was reported that there are secret talks to formally merge the conurbations of Cheltenham and Gloucester with each other. The plans suggest that around ten new garden towns could be built around the green belt at Boddington which if removed would result in the complete merger of both boroughs. Doing so would facilitate and effectively merge the two into a supercity. The move has been criticised by both Cheltenham Borough Council and Gloucester City Council.

==Attractions==
Gloucester Cathedral, in the north of the city near the river, originates in the foundation of an abbey dedicated to Saint Peter in 681. It is the burial place of King Edward II and Walter de Lacy. The cathedral (mainly its cloisters) was used for corridor scenes in the films &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince&quot;. The crypt was used for a scene in &quot;Sherlock Christmas special&quot;. Attached to the deanery is the Norman prior&#x27;s chapel. In St Mary&#x27;s Square outside the Abbey gate, the Bishop of Gloucester, Bishop John Hooper, was martyred under Queen Mary I in 1555.

A good number of medieval and Tudor period gabled and half timbered houses survive from earlier periods of Gloucester&#x27;s history. At the point where the four principal streets intersected stood the Tolsey (town hall), which was replaced by a modern building in 1894. None of the old public buildings are left except for the New Inn in Northgate Street. It is a timbered house, with strong, massive external galleries and courtyards. It was built around 1450 by John Twyning, a monk.
Kings Square is at the heart of the city centre and occupies what was once a cattle market and bus station. Officially opened in 1972, it was the centrepiece of a radical redesign of the city, The Jellicoe Plan, which was first proposed in 1961. It stands beside the Debenham&#x27;s (formerly Bon Marché) store built in the early 1960s. Many of the features of the redevelopment have since been dismantled; the brutalist concrete fountains in the middle of the square have gone and the overhead roadways which linked three multi storey car parks around the centre have been either closed or dismantled. The main bus station received a Civic Trust Award in 1963 but has since been demolished, with a new bus station being constructed on the same site during 2018. In 2012 a £60 million plan was unveiled to revamp the square. In 2014 the prominent Golden Egg restaurant was demolished and a new look public space was created. A prior archaeological dig revealed a Roman house underneath.

An indoor market opened in Eastgate Street in 1968, followed by the Eastgate Shopping Centre in 1973. The Kings Walk Shopping Centre was built between 1969 and 1972. The corner of Eastgate Street and Brunswick Road was redeveloped around this time; Roman remains unearthed below street level in 1974 may be seen through a glass observation panel outside the Boots building, which opened in 1980. The HSBC building on the Cross was renovated and a modern extension added to the Westgate Street aspect in 1972 which received a Civic Trust Award. Sainsbury&#x27;s opened a supermarket in Northgate Street in 1970; it retains its original interior. Opposite, Tesco opened a large two-storey supermarket in June 1976 on the site of a demolished chapel. This is now occupied by Wilkinson&#x27;s after Tesco moved to Quedgeley in 1984. Asda opened its first store in Gloucester in Bruton Way in 1983.

Gloucester Leisure Centre opened on the corner of Eastgate Street and Bruton Way in September 1974 and was redeveloped and rebranded (as &quot;GL1&quot;) in August 2002. Gloucester Central railway station was rebuilt in 1977 to serve both the original traffic to that railway station and the services from the closed Gloucester Eastgate railway station (former Midland Railway) which had stood on another site further east along the same road. Opposite the station stands one of the city&#x27;s largest office blocks, Twyver House, opened in 1968, which houses the regional Land Registry. The main shopping streets were pedestrianised in the late 1980s.

The 1966 &quot;Heights Plan for Gloucester&quot; sought to restrict construction of tall buildings and defend spiritual values by protecting views of Gloucester Cathedral. The tower of Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, started in 1970 and completed in August 1975, can be seen from miles around. In Brunswick Road, a brown concrete tower, which housed classrooms at the Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology (now moved to a site near Llanthony Bridge). The tower was added incongruously to the existing 1930s Technical College buildings in 1971 which has now been demolished. Clapham Court, a tall block of flats, stands in Columbia Close, between London Road and Kingsholm Road. It was built in 1963 and stands on what was once Columbia Street in a small district formerly known as Clapham.

Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former county jail (on the site of a Saxon and Norman castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the County Council) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a chalybeate spring having been discovered in 1814. West of this, across the canal, are the remains (a gateway and some walls) of Llanthony Secunda Priory, a cell of the mother abbey in the Vale of Ewyas, Monmouthshire, which in the reign of King Edward IV became the secondary establishment.

The city&#x27;s Northgate and Southgate streets feature a series of public art mosaic panels depicting Gloucester&#x27;s medieval trades made by artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner in 1998 and 1999. Eastgate and Westgate streets feature a series of mosaic panels made by arts group &#x27;The Pioneers&#x27;.

==Culture==
The Three Choirs Festival, originating in the 18th century and one of the oldest music festivals in the British Isles, is held in Gloucester every third year, the other venues being Hereford and Worcester. Gloucester hosted the festival in 2019, and it is next due in the city in 2023.

The city&#x27;s main theatre and cultural venue is the Guildhall. The Guildhall hosts a huge amount of entertainment, including live music, dance sessions, a cinema, bar, café, art gallery and much more. The Leisure Centre, GL1, hosts concerts and has a larger capacity than the Guildhall.

The annual Gloucester International Rhythm and Blues Festival takes place at the end of July and early August. Gloucester International Cajun and Zydeco Festival, the largest in the UK and longest-running in Europe, runs for a weekend in January each year. A Medieval Fayre is held in Westgate Street each year during the summer.

Gloucester is also noted as the home of the Frightmare Halloween Festival, the largest Halloween festival in the South West.

The main museum in the city is The Museum of Gloucester but there are several other important museums.

The Tailor of Gloucester House which is dedicated to the author Beatrix Potter can be found near the cathedral.

Since 2013 Gloucester has marked Armed Forces Day with a Drum Head Service held on College Green in the shadow of the cathedral. This is followed by a parade of serving forces, veterans and cadets through the city centre to the docks for a family day with military and military-related charity displays and entertainment in Back Badge Square in front of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum.

Nature in Art is a gallery dedicated to the display of works of art inspired by the natural world.

The city features in the popular, well-known nursery rhyme (of unknown date and origin) about a Doctor Foster, who reportedly visited the city, got wet, and swore to stay away as a result.

==Churches==
Gloucester has many churches, and historically has also had many dissenting chapels. It may have been the old proverb &quot;as sure as God&#x27;s in Gloucester&quot; that provoked Oliver Cromwell to declare that the city had &quot;more churches than godliness&quot;. Gloucester was the host of the first Sunday school in England; this was founded by Robert Raikes in 1780. Four of the churches that are of special interest are
* St Mary de Lode – with a Norman tower and chancel, and a monument of Bishop John Hooper. It was built on the site of an ancient Roman temple which became the first Christian church in Britain
* St Mary de Crypt – with a cruciform structure of the 12th century. It has later additions, such as the tower. Also the site of the Schoolroom in which the Crypt School was formed
* St Michael&#x27;s Church – said to have been connected with St Peter&#x27;s ancient abbey
* St Nicholas&#x27;s Church – founded by the Normans but with many additions since then

In the neighbourhood around St Mary de Crypt there are slight remains of Greyfriars and Blackfriars monasteries, and also of the city wall. Under the Golden Fleece (The Monks Bar) and Saracen&#x27;s Head inns early vaulted cellars still remains. In addition, in the city is St Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, a Grade II* listed building.

During the construction of the Boots store on the corner of Brunswick Road and Eastgate Street in 1974, Roman remains were found. These can be seen through a glass case on the street. At the back of the Gloucester Furniture Exhibition Centre part of the city&#x27;s South Gate can be seen.

==Education==
There are three endowed schools: the historic King&#x27;s School, refounded by Henry VIII as part of the cathedral establishment; the school of St Mary de Crypt, now known as &quot;The Crypt School, Gloucester&quot; since it moved to a mile from town centre to Podsmead, founded by Dame Joan Cooke in the same reign (1539); Sir Thomas Rich&#x27;s School, previously known as &quot;Sir Thomas Rich&#x27;s Bluecoat Hospital for Boys&quot; (1666); the High School for Girls (1883); and Ribston Hall High School for Girls. Comprehensives include Henley Bank High School, Beaufort Co-operative Academy, St Peter&#x27;s High School (Catholic school), Chosen Hill School, Severn Vale School, Gloucester Academy, Barnwood Park School and Churchdown School Academy. There is a Steiner Waldorf School founded in 1937 with a High School added just after the Second World War.

The city is home to one of three campuses of the University of Gloucestershire, based at Oxstalls, just outside the city centre. The university has also purchased the former Debenhams store in the city centre with a new campus due to open there in 2023. The university also manages student accommodation and halls of residence in the city, with the other campuses based in Cheltenham 7 miles away.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The M5 motorway, opened in 1971, runs east of the city boundary. Junction 12 serves south Gloucester and Quedgeley; junction 11a serves central Gloucester; and junction 11 serves north Gloucester. The A38 runs north–south through Gloucester, connecting the city with Tewkesbury and Bristol. The A40 runs west to east, connecting Gloucester with Cheltenham to the east (via a dual carriageway section known as &quot;The Golden Valley Bypass&quot;) and the Forest of Dean and South Wales to the West. The A46 and A4173 links Stroud, and the A417 links Cirencester in the south-east and Ledbury in the north-west. Gloucester has a network of cycle paths.

Until the construction of the Severn Bridge in 1966, Gloucester was the lowest road bridging point on the river and hence was an important settlement between South Wales and the southernmost counties of England including London. The Severn has a small anabranch here to reach Alney Island and then the main western bank. A bridge at Over, built by Thomas Telford in 1829, still stands, notable for its very flat arch, but its fragility and narrowness means it is disused; since 1974, it has been paralleled by a modern bridge. The Gloucester to Newport Line railway bridge is close to both, the lowest crossing of the UK&#x27;s longest river until the Severn Railway Bridge 1879–1960, which was coupled with the Severn Tunnel in 1886, the present holder of that status.

===Railway===
Gloucester railway station is served by several train operating companies:
* Transport for Wales operates a route between Maesteg, , Cardiff Central, and Cheltenham Spa.
* CrossCountry operates Cardiff Central – Nottingham services, via Birmingham New Street.
* Great Western Railway operates services to London Paddington, Swindon, Westbury, Bristol Temple Meads, Cheltenham, Worcester, Great Malvern and Weymouth.

Gloucester was the site of the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company railway works, which have now closed. A new station at Hunts Grove has been considered on the southern edge of the city near Quedgeley, as part of &quot;MetroWest&quot; plans to extend Bristol commuter services to the city.

===Buses and coaches===
Most local buses are run by Stagecoach West, centred at a depot on London Road, with connections to Cheltenham, Stroud, Ross-on-Wye and other smaller communities. For many years, there were both stopping and express services to Worcester and Birmingham operated by Midland Red and later Midland Red West, but this connection was lost due to service reductions. National Express Coaches operate the 444 route to London.

===Canals===
Gloucester is linked to the Severn Estuary by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which is navigable by small coasters. The city is linked to the River Avon and Stourport-on-Severn by the navigable part of the River Severn, which is navigable by river craft of a few hundred tonnes&#x27; displacement. Gloucester Docks mark the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river. Gloucester was formerly linked to Ledbury and Hereford by the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal; and subsequently by the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway, which used the southern section of the former canal, until it also closed in 1964. This canal is now being restored and the restored canal basin in the adjacent village of Over is a local attraction.

===Air===
Commercial airports with scheduled services are Bristol, Birmingham and Cardiff 40–60 miles away; global hub Heathrow is about 100 miles by road and shares with Gloucester its main rail interchange at London Paddington.

Gloucestershire Airport, sited 8 miles east of the city, is a private and special charters airfield.

==Business and industry==
Gloucester has a long history in the aerospace business. In 1926 the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company at Brockworth changed its name to the Gloster Aircraft Company because international customers claimed that the name &quot;Gloucestershire&quot; was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester&#x27;s aviation history and its involvement in the jet engine. Frank Whittle&#x27;s pioneering turbojet engine powered the Gloster E.28/39, the first British jet aircraft, which first flew at the company&#x27;s airfield at Brockworth. This is commemorated by the pub &quot;The Whittle&quot; at Gloucester Business Park, which now occupies the site. Roads in the business park are named after other Gloster aircraft and a small statue overlooks the site of the old main runway. Messier-Dowty&#x27;s landing gear plant and GE Aviation Dowty Propellers plants are on the outskirts of the city.

The large insurer Ecclesiastical Insurance is based in the city, as is its owner, the charity Benefact Trust. Lloyds Banking Group and TSB Bank each have an office in Barnwood, the former previously having been the headquarters of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.

Gloucester was the home of Priday, Metford and Company Limited, a family milling firm which survived for over one hundred years, and hydraulic engineering firm Fielding &amp; Platt.

Gloucester Business Park is a business park on the outskirts on the city and is home to a number of big brands including Fortis and BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.

&quot;The Citizen&quot;, published by Local World, is Gloucester&#x27;s main newspaper, which shares all its content with the &quot;Gloucestershire Echo&quot; and the weekly &quot;Forester&quot; covering the Forest of Dean and Chepstow. As of 2018, these newspapers have all moved to weekly publication rather than daily.

BBC Radio Gloucestershire has its studios on London Road in Gloucester. Heart West, previously Severn Sound, is based in Bristol. Gloucester FM is a community radio station specialising in black and urban music. (Sunshine Radio, which broadcasts for Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, can also be picked up in the city).

<doc id="65372" wikidata="Q723713" url="?curid=65372" title="One country, two systems">
<text>&quot;One country, two systems&quot; is a constitutional principle of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) describing the governance of the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

Deng Xiaoping developed the one country, two systems concept. This constitutional principle was formulated in the early 1980s during negotiations over Hong Kong between China and the United Kingdom. It provided that there would be only one China, but that each region would retain its own economic and administrative system. Under the principle, each of the two regions could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries, all of which are independent from those of the mainland. The PRC has also proposed to apply the principle in the unification it aims for with Taiwan.

However, since 2020, as a result of the passage of the National Security Law by Hong Kong on 30 June of the same year, the United States and the United Kingdom condemned the Chinese government of seriously breaching the principle.

==Background==
Deng Xiaoping developed the principle of one country, two systems in relation to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau had been colonized by European powers and Taiwan remained under Kuomintang Control at the end of the Chinese Civil War.

===In the context of Hong Kong===

Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom, ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom, for 156 years from 1841 (except for four years of Japanese occupation during WWII) until 1997, when it was handed over to the Chinese government. 

In discussing Hong Kong&#x27;s future, Deng described the risk of possible instability which might be caused by what he termed as destructive forces both inside and outside Hong Kong. In Deng&#x27;s view, these destructive forces might create instability both prior to, and as well as after, Hong Kong&#x27;s return to China. Deng repeatedly stressed that the central government would need to intervene in Hong Kong affairs from time-to-time. Among other occasions, Deng told Hong Kong delegates to Beijing in 1984 that certain interventions would be necessary, that when turmoil occurs in Hong Kong the central government should intervene, and that it would be necessary to see if interventions would be in the interests of Hong Kongers and Hong Kong&#x27;s stability and prosperity. In 1988, Deng stated that Hong Kong&#x27;s political system was neither the British nor American systems and Hong Kong should not import Western political systems in the future.

As part of Hong Kong&#x27;s return to China, China agreed to accept some conditions, as stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, such as the drafting and adoption of Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;mini-constitution&quot; Basic Law before its return. The Hong Kong Basic Law ensured that Hong Kong will retain its capitalist economic system and own currency (the Hong Kong dollar), legal system, legislative system, and same human rights and freedoms, as a special administrative region (SAR) of China for 50 years. Set to expire in 2047, the current arrangement has permitted Hong Kong to function as its own entity under the name &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; in many international settings (e.g. the WTO and the Olympics).

During the drafting of the Basic Law, Deng stated that universal suffrage and Western political systems were not appropriate for Hong Kong. Deng also stated that if Hong Kong became a base for anti-mainland China sentiment under the guise of democracy then China&#x27;s central government should intervene.

The Chinese renminbi is not legal tender in Hong Kong. Likewise, the Hong Kong dollar is not accepted in stores in mainland China. With this arrangement, a permit or special visa () is required when passing between the borders of Hong Kong and mainland China, and people in Hong Kong hold Hong Kong SAR passports rather than Chinese passports. The official languages are a major factor besides the history of the former colony that has made Hong Kong and mainland China distinct from each other, as Cantonese and English are the most widely used languages in Hong Kong, while Mandarin is the official language of mainland China. The central government in Beijing maintains control over Hong Kong&#x27;s foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law. The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue that the territory has yet to achieve universal suffrage as promised by the Basic Law, leading to mass demonstrations in 2014.

===In the context of Macau===

A colony of Portugal for 442 years from 1557, Macau was returned to the Chinese government in 1999. In the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau, the drafting and adoption of Macau&#x27;s mini-constitution before its return was foreseen. Like Hong Kong, a basic law would ensure that Macau retained its economic system, currency (the Macanese pataca), legal system (which is based on Portuguese civil law), legislative system, and people&#x27;s rights and freedom for 50 years, as a special administrative region (SAR) of China. Set to expire in 2049, the agreement has permitted Macau to function as its own entity in many international settings (e.g. WTO) rather than as a part of China.

As Macau has its own currency, the Chinese renminbi is not legal tender in Macau; the pataca is also not accepted in stores in China. With this agreement, a permit or visa is required when crossing between the borders of Macau and China, and people in Macau generally hold Macau SAR passports rather than mainland Chinese passports. Like Hong Kong, the official languages are a major factor that has made Macau and China distinct from each other besides the history of the former colony, as Cantonese and Portuguese are the official languages in Macau, while Mandarin is the official language of China. The central government in Beijing also maintains control over Macau&#x27;s foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law.

===In the context of Taiwan===

In addition to the Hong Kong and Macau contexts, Deng proposed the principle&#x27;s applicability to reunification with Taiwan, but the government of Taiwan has consistently rejected the proposal .

== Application to Hong Kong and Macau ==



Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping proposed the principle during negotiation with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher over the expiration of the United Kingdom&#x27;s lease on the New Territories (including New Kowloon) of Hong Kong in 1997. The same principle was proposed in talks with Portugal about Macau.

The principle is that, upon reunification, despite the practice of socialism in mainland China, both Hong Kong and Macau, which were colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal respectively, could retain their established system under a high degree of autonomy for up to 50 years after reunification. However, what would happen after 2047 and 2049 for Hong Kong and Macau respectively has never been publicly stated.

Chapter 1, Article 5 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, the constitutional document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, reads:

The establishment of these regions, called &quot;special administrative regions&quot; (SARs), is authorised by Article 31 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which states that the state may establish SARs when necessary, and that the systems to be instituted in them shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People&#x27;s Congress in light of the specific conditions.

The SARs of Hong Kong and Macau were formally established on the 1 July 1997 and the 20 December 1999 respectively, immediately after the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) assumed sovereignty over these respective regions.

===Framework===
The two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau are responsible for their domestic affairs including, but not limited to, the judiciary and courts of final appeal (last resort), immigration and customs, public finance, currencies and extradition. The SARs are also exempt from mainland laws mandating the use of simplified characters in publishing and Mandarin in public education and most broadcasting. The diplomatic relations and military defence of the two SARs however, is the responsibility of the Central People&#x27;s Government in Beijing.

Hong Kong continues using English common law while Macau continues using the Portuguese civil law system.

===Names===
When the two regions have their own membership in international organisations (such as the WTO and the Paralympics), both regions are mandated to use the name &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; or &quot;Macao, China&quot; instead of &quot;Hong Kong&quot; or &quot;Macau&quot;/&quot;Macao&quot;, as stipulated several times under Chapter VII (&quot;External Affairs&quot;) of both regions&#x27; Basic Laws.

For example, in Trade Policy Review documents between Hong Kong and the WTO, the documents use &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; throughout even in prose. When a short name is used, it uses the acronym &quot;HKC&quot; and never &quot;Hong Kong&quot; or &quot;HK&quot; standalone. Similarly, in Trade Policy Review documents between Macau and the WTO, &quot;Macao, China&quot; is used in prose throughout and the only short name used is the acronym &quot;MSAR&quot;.

=== Potential extension ===
Several high level members of the government have expressed a potential extension of the system beyond 2047 for Hong Kong. In January 2020, Carrie Lam stated that &quot;My view is this: as long as we persist with the &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; principle, push forward the implementation of &#x27;One Country, Two Systems&#x27; and have a full understanding and implementation of the principle... then we have adequate reason to believe that &#x27;One Country, Two Systems&#x27; will be implemented smoothly and in the long term, and it will not change after 2047.&quot;

Additionally, in a June 2020 online webinar to campaign for the National Security Law, Zhang Xiaoming said that the National Security Law would ensure that the freedoms granted to the city can be extended beyond 2047. However, neither Carrie Lam or Zhang Xiaoming have promised such an extension or laid out concrete steps or goals in order for it to happen.

In October 2021, Carrie Lam reiterated that she believed the system would be extended beyond 2047, stating &quot;Anybody would seriously ask: why do we have to change it? But of course, something more concrete will have to come out later on to give the needed assurance about the continuation of the common law system, the monetary system, the professional recognition system, maybe some land leases.&quot;

In March 2022, Xia Baolong, head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said that after 2047, the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; could be extended by another 50 years, until 2097.

In July 2022, Leung Chun-ying, former chief executive, said that he expected the system to be extended past 2047.

On 1 July 2022, during a visit to Hong Kong, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping made a promise that the system is a long-term policy.

In February 2024, Xia Baolong said that the system would be kept permanently.

==Implementation in Hong Kong==
=== Degree of autonomy ===
As a British colony, Hong Kong was neither democratic nor autonomous. After Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing promised that Hong Kong citizens would be free to elect their local government. However, the Basic Law does not have a clear timetable for when universal suffrage is to be achieved, ultimately stating that a full vote by the populace and universal suffrage must be reached before the end of the 50-year transition according to Article 45.

In the year after the handover, surveys showed high levels of satisfaction with Beijing&#x27;s hands-off relationship with the former colony.

The year before, the Provisional Legislative Council passed laws restricting the right of abode, leading to a case brought against the government, which ended in a loss for the government in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in 1999. The government then took its case to the National People&#x27;s Congress. The legal establishment expressed its disapproval of the act Martin Lee described as &quot;giving away&quot; Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy with a silent march. Polls showed the events had depressed the public&#x27;s confidence in the government, despite the fact that most were in favour of the government&#x27;s stance over that of the court&#x27;s.

On 10 June 2014, China&#x27;s central government released a white paper describing its view of comprehensive jurisdiction over Hong Kong. The white paper stated that Hong Kong&#x27;s high degree of autonomy is not an inherent power, but rather one which exists solely through the authorization of the central government. The white paper&#x27;s release ignited criticism from many people in Hong Kong, who said that the Communist leadership was reneging on its pledges to abide by the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy that allows for a democratic, autonomous Hong Kong under Beijing&#x27;s rule.

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, students demanded more political freedom in direct response to the &quot;831 decision&quot; of the NPCSC. The participants demanded freedom of choice, electoral freedom, democracy and, in particular, they wanted to participate in the elections of the head of the administration of Hong Kong. The name &quot;umbrella movement&quot; originated because the students protected themselves with umbrellas from the pepper spray of the police. Thus, umbrellas became the symbol of this movement. In 2016, Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law, student leaders of the protests, were charged for their roles in the protests and found guilty.

=== Moral and National Education controversy ===

It was officially announced in September 2012 that the Hong Kong government would introduce compulsory &quot;national, moral and civic education&quot; in all non-international primary and secondary schools to strengthen &quot;national identity awareness and nurture patriotism towards China&quot;. According to an academic research paper, the current school curriculum in Hong Kong projects a &quot;dual sense of identity&quot;: &quot;Chineseness&quot; and &quot;Hongkongesness&quot; and notably, this has created strong public activism by Hong Kong pre- and post-1997. However, the new curriculum includes &quot;general civic education&quot; and lessons meant to increase students&#x27; appreciation of China. This announcement led to 10 days of protests, with up to 120,000 protesters each day, due to concerns of Hong Kong losing autonomy. In response, the chief executive at the time, CY Leung, chose to remove the idea of compulsory teaching, meaning that schools could freely decide if they would teach the subject. Despite CY Leung&#x27;s decision, new chief executive Carrie Lam, who took over on 1 July 2017, has prioritised the topic of national education, by placing importance on &quot;instilling patriotism in pupils&quot;. Furthermore, in August 2017, Christine Choi Yuk-Lin was appointed by the government as the under-secretary of the Education Bureau. She &quot;has former connections with the pro-Beijing Federation of Education Workers&quot; (SCMP article A). This led to more than 17,000 people signing a petition opposing Yuk-lin having the position. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping also announced during his visit to Hong Kong in July 2017 the need for an enhancement and boost of &quot;national history and culture&quot; in Hong Kong education.

=== Causeway Bay booksellers case ===

The disappearances of five staff at Causeway Bay Books – an independent publisher and bookstore – in October to December 2015 precipitated an international outcry as cross-border abductions were widely suspected. Although at least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand, one member was last seen in Hong Kong, but apparently had found his way across the Chinese land border in Shenzhen without the necessary travel documents. The unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the suspected abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, in violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. It was later confirmed that they are under detention in mainland China although most had reappeared in Hong Kong and cancelled their missing persons&#x27; reports with the police.

On 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, Lam Wing-kee gave a long press conference in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam implicated the involvement of the Central Investigation Team, which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a flurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.

=== Hong Kong National Party ban ===

On 17 July 2018, the Hong Kong Police Force served the party convener a notice under the Societies Ordinance, seeking to ban the Hong Kong National Party (HKNP) for sedition, on grounds of national security with respect to Chinese territorial integrity. The party and its convener Andy Chan submitted their case against being outlawed. Ten days later, in an unprecedented move, Secretary for Security John Lee on 24 September 2018 officially banned the party on national security grounds.

The ban prohibited anyone who claims to be a HKNP member, or is found to provide aid to the party in any way, under the threat of being fined and jailed for up to two years. The definition of &quot;providing aid&quot; to the party and the two leaders were not made clear. Chan&#x27;s lawyers wrote to the Department of Justice seeking an assurance that providing legal assistance to him would not be regarded as providing assistance to the HKNP, but that assurance was not forthcoming.

=== Victor Mallet controversy ===

In August, a controversy erupted in 2018 when the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of Hong Kong (FCC) hosted a lunchtime talk with Andy Chan, convener of the Hong Kong Independence Party (HKIP) to take place on 14 August. Victor Mallet, vice-chairman of the press organisation, chaired the session. The governments of China and Hong Kong had called for the cancellation of the talk, because the issue of independence supposedly crossed one of the &quot;bottom lines&quot; on national sovereignty. After a visit to Bangkok, Mallet was denied a working visa by the Hong Kong government. Mallet was subjected to a four-hour interrogation by immigration officers on his return from Thailand on Sunday 7 October before he was finally allowed to enter Hong Kong on a seven-day tourist visa.

In the absence of an official explanation, Mallet&#x27;s visa rejection was widely seen to be retribution for his role in chairing the Andy Chan talk which the FCC refused to call off. Secretary for Security John Lee insisted the ban on Mallet was unrelated to press freedom, but declined to explain the decision. The incident caused a furious debate over restrictions to freedoms that were supposedly protected by the Sino-British Joint Declaration under &quot;one country, two systems&quot;.

=== Extradition bill and Hong Kong 2019–2020 protests ===

In April 2019, an extradition bill was proposed in Hong Kong inciting mass protests. The new law identifies that those who are suspects of serious crimes could be sent to China. This was initiated due to a murder suspect fleeing from Taiwan to Hong Kong in 2018. He was accused of murdering his pregnant 20 year old girlfriend, thus Hong Kong authorities were asked by Taiwan to extradite the man. Hong Kong, however, did not concur with this demand and could not prosecute him as Hong Kong does not have any form of an extradition agreement with Taiwan. In terms of the Extradition Law, it was claimed that decisions would be made on a &quot;case-by-case basis by the Chief Executive&quot;, in addition to Hong Kong courts making final decisions on extradition requests. For this reason, those accused of crimes based on politics or religion would not be extradited, and the new law would purely be &quot;dealing with cross border crimes and transnational crimes&quot; that carries a minimum seven-years sentence, as Carrie Lam stated in her speech on Monday 10 June. However, many Hong Kong people claim that this is another example of Hong Kong losing its autonomy. There has been criticism that this law would mean that suspects would be susceptible to many practices under the Chinese judicial system that is not present in the Hong Kong judicial system: arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture. Michael DeGolyer, a researcher at Baptist University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that Hong Kong people fear lack of judicial independence as the current judiciary system &quot;is seen as guaranteeing a measure of protection from the government on the mainland&quot;.

There has been a widespread response opposing the law: nationally and internationally. Criticism, petitions and protests have incorporated many parts of society, including doctors, lawyers, teachers and housewives. On 9 June there were an estimated one million people protesting across Hong Kong, making it the biggest protest since the handover. Additionally, concern was displayed internationally: in Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States. The US congressional commission argued in May 2019 that the extradition bill makes &quot;Hong Kong more susceptible to China&#x27;s political coercion and further erodes Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy&quot;. China&#x27;s foreign ministry has rebutted these concerns by claiming them &quot;attempts to politicise the Hong Kong government proposal and interference in China&#x27;s internal affairs&quot;.

Due to this negative response nationally and internationally, on 4 September 2019, Carrie Lam formally announced that the extradition bill would be withdrawn. Despite this, fear of the loss of Hong Kong autonomy remains. Protests continued until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, and are predicted to continue once the pandemic is under control in Hong Kong.

=== 2020 national security legislation ===

A draft national security bill was submitted on 22 May 2020 to China&#x27;s national parliament, the National People&#x27;s Congress. In accordance with the one country, two systems formula, Hong Kong&#x27;s basic law requires the Hong Kong legislature to ratify national security to prevent sedition, secession and foreign interference. The Chinese central government is now bypassing the HKSAR to directly legislate. A National People&#x27;s Congress official reported as saying it was exercising &quot;constitutional power&quot; to create a new legal framework and enforcement mechanism to guarantee national security in Hong Kong. On 30 June 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) passed the national security law for Hong Kong unanimously and listed it under Annex III of the Basic Law, bypassing Hong Kong approval. The Hong Kong Bar Association (HKBA) disputed the constitutionality of enacting the law through inclusion in Annex III of the Basic Law in May 2020.

On 30 May 2020, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in a White House press conference, officially declared that the United States would be ending special treatments afforded to Hong Kong as outlined in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, due to China replacing the promised formula of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; with &quot;one country, one system&quot;, and threatened that the United States would take further actions on Hong Kong in response to the national security law. On 14 July 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13936, pursuant to the Hong Kong Autonomy Act passed by the US Congress, ending Hong Kong&#x27;s special trade privileges.

According to Victoria Tin-bor Hui, writing in &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, the national security legislation is being used to erode civil and legal protections on the way to &quot;establishing a police state&quot; in Hong Kong.

==Implementation in Macau==
=== Macau and Mainland China relations ===
Macau has not seen outbreaks of protests and civil unrest that have occurred in Hong Kong. According to Jason Chao, a former president of the New Macau Association (a pro-democracy party), Macau differed from Hong Kong as Macau does not wish for freedom and autonomy. Instead, the majority of Macau&#x27;s population are pro-China. A reason for this is because approximately half of the 600,000 people living in Macau are Chinese immigrants. In December 2019, Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPCSC, claimed that there is a &quot;strong sense of international identity&quot; in Macau. In Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s first official speech in Macau in December 2019 marking the 20th anniversary, he proclaimed Macau as &quot;a gorgeous chapter in the short history of the one country, two systems experiment&quot;. Chief executive of Macau, Ho Iat Seng, said: &quot;Macau will be an example of China&#x27;s reunification,&quot; and Xi has agreed, by placing emphasis on the &quot;Macau Model&quot; as Macau has correctly followed the &quot;one country, two system&quot; agreement. As a reward for Macau&#x27;s peaceful behaviour and lack of anti-government protests, Xi Jinping has given Macau more Chinese land from Hengqin Island. This is to enable Macau to further develop their education and healthcare system, in addition to physically integrating Macau more with China.

==Proposed application onto Taiwan==
The PRC government was also proposed the application of the one country, two systems principle for Taiwan, but the Taiwanese government has refused this suggestion. It has been claimed that the system was originally designed for Taiwan in order for it to be unified with the PRC.

While China had guaranteed that Hong Kong&#x27;s economic and political systems would not be changed for 50 years following the British handover, the Mainland Affairs Council of the Republic of China has cited 218 cases between 1997 and 2007 that they claim to be breaches of the Hong Kong peoples&#x27; rights to self-rule or freedom of speech, as well as severe interventions in the judicial system.

A new policy based on the 1992 Consensus was emphasised during the Pan-Blue visits to mainland China in April 2005 as well as subsequent major cross-strait exchanges under President Ma Ying-jeou, whose pro-unification Kuomintang (KMT) party won the 2008 Taiwanese presidential election. During his visit to Beijing in March 2012, former KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung proposed a &quot;one country, two areas&quot; () framework to govern cross-strait relations, though this term did not become widely adopted.

In January 2019, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced an open letter to Taiwan proposing a one country, two systems formula for eventual unification. President Tsai Ing-wen responded to Xi in a January 2019 speech by stating that Taiwan rejected one country, two systems, and that because Beijing equated the 1992 Consensus with one country, two systems, Taiwan rejected it as well. Tsai expressed her solidarity with Hong Kong protesters, remarking that Taiwan&#x27;s democracy was hard-earned and had to be guarded and renewed. Pledging that as long as she was Taiwan&#x27;s president, she would never accept one country, two systems, Tsai cited what she considered to be the constant and rapid deterioration of democracy in Hong Kong over the previous 20 years. Following the landslide defeat of the KMT in the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, KMT chairman Johnny Chiang rejected the one country, two systems as a feasible model for Taiwan. In 2021, the KMT platform under newly elected chairman Eric Chu also continued to include the 1992 Consensus while rejecting one country, two systems.

In 1987, the president of the Republic of China at the time, Chiang Ching-kuo, counter-proposed with the alternative of &quot;one country, better system&quot; () in a pun on &quot;one country, two systems&quot; (), proposing that the PRC and ROC could be unified after the PRC adopts the democratic system of the ROC.

==Comparison to status of Tibet==
Jiang (2008) notes that the concept of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; is based on the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet signed in 1951, and that its mechanism is similar to how the Qing emperor integrated new territories it had conquered by permitting local elites in these regions to continue to enjoy power for a time and to exercise autonomy without apparently threatening distinct local customs. As the concept was merely a &quot;tactical and transitional arrangement&quot;, a point of view argues that the territory of Hong Kong will gradually experience the same fate as Tibet since 1959 – forced assimilation and tight direct control by the central government. Over time, full assimilation, and abolition of local autonomy, would take place in a manner &quot;illustrative of a similar Chinese imperial expansionist mentalité&quot;.

The 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s 2005 proposal for &quot;high-level autonomy&quot; for Tibet, evolved from a position of advocating Tibetan independence, has been compared to &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. He has said that his proposals should be acceptable to China because &quot;one country, two systems&quot; is accommodated for in the Chinese Constitution. State media rejected this claim, pointing out that &quot;one country, two systems&quot; was designed for the capitalist social systems of Hong Kong and Macau, which had never existed in Tibet. In 2012, Dalai Lama mentioned again that the Seventeen Point Agreement was signed in the spirit of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;.

== One country, two systems proposals for other countries ==
Muhammad Cohen, writing for &quot;Asia Times&quot;, suggests the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula is a possible solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

North Korea suggests the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula to bring about Korean reunification, through a confederation of two systems within one country. China has also promoted the idea; the difference between North Korea&#x27;s motivation and China&#x27;s is that North Korea seeks to maintain two separate governments, while China seeks gradual unification as it wishes to bring stability to the Korean peninsula with one centralised government.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the arrangement linking Hong Kong with China could be a possible solution for addressing the fate of Northern Ireland after Brexit. The border between the EU member state Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland is becoming an increasing concern in talks with the United Kingdom, with Dublin demanding that the frontier remain completely open, to avoid endangering the peace process.

<text>A lingua franca (; ; for plurals see ), also known as a bridge language, common language, trade language, auxiliary language, link language or language of wider communication (LWC), is a language systematically used to make communication possible between groups of people who do not share a native language or dialect, particularly when it is a third language that is distinct from both of the speakers&#x27; native languages.

Linguae francae have developed around the world throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called &quot;trade languages&quot; facilitated trade), but also for cultural, religious, diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term is taken from the medieval Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a Romance-based pidgin language used especially by traders in the Mediterranean Basin from the 11th to the 19th centuries. A world language—a language spoken internationally and by many people—is a language that may function as a global lingua franca.

==Characteristics==
Any language regularly used for communication between people who do not share a native language is a lingua franca. Lingua franca is a functional term, independent of any linguistic history or language structure.

Pidgins are therefore lingua francas; creoles and arguably mixed languages may similarly be used for communication between language groups. But lingua franca is equally applicable to a non-creole language native to one nation (often a colonial power) learned as a second language and used for communication between diverse language communities in a colony or former colony.

Lingua francas are often pre-existing languages with native speakers, but they can also be pidgins or creoles developed for that specific region or context. Pidgins are rapidly developed and simplified combinations of two or more established languages, while creoles are generally viewed as pidgins that have evolved into fully complex languages in the course of adaptation by subsequent generations. Pre-existing lingua francas such as French are used to facilitate intercommunication in large-scale trade or political matters, while pidgins and creoles often arise out of colonial situations and a specific need for communication between colonists and indigenous peoples. Pre-existing lingua francas are generally widespread, highly developed languages with many native speakers. Conversely, pidgins are very simplified means of communication, containing loose structuring, few grammatical rules, and possessing few or no native speakers. Creole languages are more developed than their ancestral pidgins, utilizing more complex structure, grammar, and vocabulary, as well as having substantial communities of native speakers.

Whereas a vernacular language is the native language of a specific geographical community, a lingua franca is used beyond the boundaries of its original community, for trade, religious, political, or academic reasons. For example, English is a in the United Kingdom but it is used as a in the Philippines, alongside Filipino. Likewise, Arabic, French, Standard Chinese, Russian and Spanish serve similar purposes as industrial and educational lingua francas across regional and national boundaries.

Even though they are used as bridge languages, international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto have not had a great degree of adoption, so they are not described as lingua francas.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;lingua franca&quot; derives from Mediterranean Lingua Franca (also known as &quot;Sabir&quot;), the pidgin language that people around the Levant and the eastern Mediterranean Sea used as the main language of commerce and diplomacy from the late Middle Ages to the 18th century, most notably during the Renaissance era. During that period, a simplified version of mainly Italian in the eastern Mediterranean and Spanish in the western Mediterranean that incorporated many loanwords from Greek, Slavic languages, Arabic, and Turkish came to be widely used as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the region, although some scholars claim that the Mediterranean Lingua Franca was just poorly used Italian.

In Lingua Franca (the specific language), is from the Italian for &#x27;a language&#x27;. is related to Greek () and Arabic () as well as the equivalent Italian—in all three cases, the literal sense is &#x27;Frankish&#x27;, leading to the direct translation: &#x27;language of the Franks&#x27;. During the late Byzantine Empire, &quot;Franks&quot; was a term that applied to all Western Europeans.

Through changes of the term in literature, &quot;lingua franca&quot; has come to be interpreted as a general term for pidgins, creoles, and some or all forms of vehicular languages. This transition in meaning has been attributed to the idea that pidgin languages only became widely known from the 16th century on due to European colonization of continents such as The Americas, Africa, and Asia. During this time, the need for a term to address these pidgin languages arose, hence the shift in the meaning of Lingua Franca from a single proper noun to a common noun encompassing a large class of pidgin languages.

As recently as the late 20th century, some restricted the use of the generic term to mean only mixed languages that are used as vehicular languages, its original meaning.

Douglas Harper&#x27;s &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; states that the term &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; (as the name of the particular language) was first recorded in English during the 1670s, although an even earlier example of the use of it in English is attested from 1632, where it is also referred to as &quot;Bastard Spanish&quot;.

==Usage notes==
The term is well established in its naturalization to English and so major dictionaries do not italicize it as a &quot;foreign&quot; term.

Its plurals in English are &quot;lingua francas&quot; and &quot;linguae francae&quot;, with the former being first-listed or only-listed in major dictionaries.

==Examples==
===Historical lingua francas===

The use of lingua francas has existed since antiquity.

Akkadian remained the common language of a large part of Western Asia from several earlier empires, until it was supplanted in this role by Aramaic.

Sanskrit historically served as a lingua franca throughout the majority of South Asia. The Sanskrit language&#x27;s historic presence is attested across a wide geography beyond South Asia. Inscriptions and literary evidence suggest that Sanskrit was already being adopted in Southeast Asia and Central Asia in the 1st millennium CE, through monks, religious pilgrims and merchants.

Until the early 20th century, Literary Chinese served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, Ryūkyū, and Vietnam. In the early 20th century, vernacular written Chinese replaced Classical Chinese within China as both the written and spoken lingua franca for speakers of different Chinese dialects, and because of the declining power and cultural influence of China in East Asia, English has since replaced Classical Chinese as the lingua franca in East Asia.

Koine Greek was the lingua franca of the Hellenistic culture. Koine Greek (Modern ; ), also known as Alexandrian dialect, common Attic, Hellenistic, or Biblical Greek, was the common supra-regional form of Greek spoken and written during the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. It evolved from the spread of Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, and served as the lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries.

Old Tamil was once the lingua franca for most of ancient Tamilakam and Sri Lanka. John Guy states that Tamil was also the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India. The language and its dialects were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in the southern Andhra Pradesh districts of Chittoor and Nellore until the 12th century AD. Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as Kolar, Mysore, Mandya and Bangalore.

Latin, through the power of the Roman Republic, became the dominant language in Italy and subsequently throughout the realms of the Roman Empire. Even after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, Latin was the common language of communication, science, and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when other regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage, and it eventually became a dead language in the modern linguistic definition.

Classical Māori is the retrospective name for the language (formed out of many dialects, albeit all mutually intelligible) of both the North Island and the South Island for the 800 years before the European settlement of New Zealand. Māori shared a common language that was used for trade, inter-iwi dialogue on marae, and education through wānanga. After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, Māori language was the lingua franca of the Colony of New Zealand until English superseded it in the 1870s. The description of Māori language as New Zealand&#x27;s 19th-century lingua franca has been widely accepted. The language was initially vital for all European and Chinese migrants in New Zealand to learn, as Māori formed a majority of the population, owned nearly all the country&#x27;s land and dominated the economy until the 1860s. Discriminatory laws such as the Native Schools Act 1867 contributed to the demise of Māori language as a lingua franca.

Sogdian was used to facilitate trade between those who spoke different languages along the Silk Road, which is why native speakers of Sogdian were employed as translators in Tang China. The Sogdians also ended up circulating spiritual beliefs and texts, including those of Buddhism and Christianity, thanks to their ability to communicate to many people in the region through their native language.

Old Church Slavonic, an Eastern South Slavic language, is the first Slavic literary language. Between 9th and 11th century, it was the lingua franca of a great part of the predominantly Slavic states and populations in Southeast and Eastern Europe, in liturgy and church organization, culture, literature, education and diplomacy, as an Official language and National language in the case of Bulgaria. It was the first national and also international Slavic literary language (autonym , ). The Glagolitic alphabet was originally used at both schools, though the Cyrillic script was developed early on at the Preslav Literary School, where it superseded Glagolitic as the official script in Bulgaria in 893. Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably Croatia, Serbia, Bohemia, Lesser Poland, and principalities of the Kievan Rus&#x27; while retaining characteristically South Slavic linguistic features. It spread also to not completely Slavic territories between the Carpathian Mountains, the Danube and the Black Sea, corresponding to Wallachia and Moldavia. Nowadays, the Cyrillic writing system is used for various languages across Eurasia, and as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, Uralic, Caucasian and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central, North, and East Asia.

The Mediterranean Lingua Franca was largely based on Italian and Provençal. This language was spoken from the 11th to 19th centuries around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the European commercial empires of Italian cities (Genoa, Venice, Florence, Milan, Pisa, Siena) and in trading ports located throughout the eastern Mediterranean rim.

During the Renaissance, standard Italian was spoken as a language of culture in the main royal courts of Europe, and among intellectuals. This lasted from the 14th century to the end of the 16th, when French replaced Italian as the usual lingua franca in northern Europe. Italian musical terms, in particular dynamic and tempo notations, have continued in use to the present day.

Classical Quechua is either of two historical forms of Quechua, the exact relationship and degree of closeness between which is controversial, and which have sometimes been identified with each other. These are:

# the variety of Quechua that was used as a lingua franca and administrative language in the Inca Empire (1438–1533) (or Inca lingua franca). Since the Incas did not have writing, the evidence about the characteristics of this variety is scant and they have been a subject of significant disagreements.
# the variety of Quechua that was used in writing for religious and administrative purposes in the Andean territories of the Spanish Empire, mostly in the late 16th century and the first half of the 17th century and has sometimes been referred to, both historically and in academia, as &quot;lengua general&quot; (&#x27;common language&#x27;) (or Standard Colonial Quechua).

Ajem-Turkic functioned as lingua franca in the Caucasus region and in southeastern Dagestan, and was widely spoken at the court and in the army of Safavid Iran.

===Modern===
====English====

English is sometimes described as the foremost global lingua franca, being used as a working language by individuals of diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds in a variety of fields and international organizations to communicate with one another. English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the historical global influence of the British Empire as well as the United States. It is a co-official language of the United Nations and many other international and regional organizations and has also become the &quot;de facto&quot; language of diplomacy, science, international trade, tourism, aviation, entertainment and the Internet.

When the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the lingua franca of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, most of the newly independent nations which had many indigenous languages opted to continue using English as one of their official languages such as Ghana and South Africa. In other former colonies with several official languages such as Singapore and Fiji, English is the primary medium of education and serves as the lingua franca among citizens.

Even in countries not associated with the English-speaking world, English has emerged as a lingua franca in certain situations where its use is perceived to be more efficient to communicate, especially among groups consisting of native speakers of many languages. In Qatar, the medical community is primarily made up of workers from countries without English as a native language. In medical practices and hospitals, nurses typically communicate with other professionals in English as a lingua franca. This occurrence has led to interest in researching the consequences of the medical community communicating in a lingua franca. English is also sometimes used in Switzerland between people who do not share one of Switzerland&#x27;s four official languages, or with foreigners who are not fluent in the local language. In the European Union, the use of English as a lingua franca has led researchers to investigate whether a Euro English dialect has emerged. In the fields of technology and science, English emerged as a lingua franca in the 20th century. English has also significantly influenced many other languages.

====Spanish====

The Spanish language spread mainly throughout the New World, becoming a lingua franca in the territories and colonies of the Spanish Empire, which also included parts of Africa, Asia, and Oceania. After the breakup of much of the empire in the Americas, its function as a lingua franca was solidified by the governments of the newly independent nations of what is now Hispanic America. While its usage in Spain&#x27;s Asia-Pacific colonies has largely died out except in the Philippines, where it is still spoken by a small minority, Spanish became the lingua franca of what is now Equatorial Guinea, being the main language of government and education and is spoken by the vast majority of the population.

Due to large numbers of immigrants from Latin America in the second half of the 20th century and resulting influence, Spanish has also emerged somewhat as a lingua franca in parts of the Southwestern United States and southern Florida, especially in communities where native Spanish speakers form the majority of the population.

At present it is the second most used language in international trade, and the third most used in politics, diplomacy and culture after English and French.

It is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world and is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.

====French====
French is sometimes regarded as the first global lingua franca, having supplanted Latin as the prestige language of politics, trade, education, diplomacy, and military in early modern Europe and later spreading around the world with the establishment of the French colonial empire. With France emerging as the leading political, economic, and cultural power of Europe in the 16th century, the language was adopted by royal courts throughout the continent, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Russia, and as the language of communication between European academics, merchants, and diplomats. With the expansion of Western colonial empires, French became the main language of diplomacy and international relations up until World War II when it was replaced by English due the rise of the United States as the leading superpower. Stanley Meisler of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the &quot;first diplomatic blow&quot; against the language. Nevertheless, it remains the second most used language in international affairs and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.

As a legacy of French and Belgian colonial rule, most former colonies of these countries maintain French as an official language or lingua franca due to the many indigenous languages spoken in their territory. Notably, in most Francophone West and Central African countries, French has transitioned from being only a lingua franca to the native language among some communities, mostly in urban areas or among the elite class. In other regions such as the French-speaking countries of the Maghreb (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania) and parts of the French Caribbean, French is the lingua franca in professional sectors and education, even though it is not the native language of the majority.

French continues to be used as a lingua franca in certain cultural fields such as cuisine, fashion, and sport.

As a consequence of Brexit, French has been increasingly used as a lingua franca in the European Union and its institutions either alongside or, at times, in place of English.

====German====
German is used as a lingua franca in Switzerland to some extent; however, English is generally preferred to avoid favoring it over the three other official languages. Middle Low German used to be the Lingua franca during the late Hohenstaufen till the mid-15th century periods, in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea when extensive trading was done by the Hanseatic League along the Baltic and North Seas. German remains a widely studied language in Central Europe and the Balkans, especially in former Yugoslavia. It is recognized as an official language in countries outside of Europe, specifically Namibia. German is also one of the working languages of the EU along English and French, but it is used less in that role than the other two.

====Chinese====
Today, Standard Mandarin Chinese is the lingua franca of China and Taiwan, which are home to many mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese and, in the case of Taiwan, indigenous Formosan languages. Among many Chinese diaspora communities, Cantonese is often used as the lingua franca instead, particularly in Southeast Asia, due to a longer history of immigration and trade networks with southern China, although Mandarin has also been adopted in some circles since the 2000s.

====Arabic====
Arabic was used as a lingua franca across the Islamic empires, whose sizes necessitated a common language, and spread across the Arab and Muslim worlds. In Djibouti and parts of Eritrea, both of which are countries where multiple official languages are spoken, Arabic has emerged as a lingua franca in part thanks to the population of the region being predominantly Muslim and Arabic playing a crucial role in Islam. In addition, after having fled from Eritrea due to ongoing warfare and gone to some of the nearby Arab countries, Eritrean emigrants are contributing to Arabic becoming a lingua franca in the region by coming back to their homelands having picked up the Arabic language.

====Russian====
Russian is in use and widely understood in Central Asia and the Caucasus, areas formerly part of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Its use remains prevalent in many post-Soviet states. Russian has some presence as a minority language in the Baltic states and some other states in Eastern Europe, as well as in pre-opening China. It remains the official language of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russian is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its use has declined in post-Soviet states. Parts of the Russian speaking minorities outside Russia have either emigrated to Russia or assimilated into their countries of residence by learning the local language, which they now prefer to use in daily communication.

For contrast, in Central European countries that after the Second World War were included in the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence, the Russian language was used only as Eastern Bloc&#x27;s language of internal political communication. There are no Russian minorities in these countries, in schools the primary foreign language is English and nowadays the Russian language practically does not exist.

====Portuguese====
Portuguese served as lingua franca in the Portuguese Empire, Africa, South America and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. When the Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of lingua franca with the local languages. When Dutch, English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this &quot;broken Portuguese&quot;. Through a process of change the lingua franca and Portuguese lexicon was replaced with the languages of the people in contact. Portuguese remains an important lingua franca in the Portuguese-speaking African countries, East Timor, and to a certain extent in Macau where it is recognized as an official language alongside Chinese though in practice not commonly spoken. Portuguese and Spanish have a certain degree of mutual intelligibility and mixed languages such as Portuñol are used to facilitate communication in areas like the border area between Brazil and Uruguay.

====Hindustani====

The Hindustani language, with Hindi and Urdu as dual standard varieties, serves as the lingua franca of Pakistan and Northern India. Many Hindi-speaking North Indian states have adopted the three-language formula in which students are taught: &quot;(a) Hindi (with Sanskrit as part of the composite course); (b) Any other modern Indian language including Urdu and (c) English or any other modern European language.&quot; The order in non-Hindi speaking states is: &quot;(a) the major language of the state or region; (b) Hindi; (c) Any other modern Indian language including Urdu but excluding (a) and (b) above; and (d) English or any other modern European language.&quot; Hindi has also emerged as a lingua franca in Arunachal Pradesh, a linguistically diverse state in Northeast India. It is estimated that nine-tenths of the state&#x27;s population knows Hindi.

Urdu is the lingua franca of Pakistan and had gained significant influence amongst its people, administration and education. While it shares official status with English, Urdu is the preferred and dominant language used for inter-communication between different ethnic groups of Pakistan.

====Malay====
Malay is understood across a cultural region in Southeast Asia called the &quot;Malay world&quot; including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, southern Thailand, and certain parts of the Philippines. It is pluricentric, with several nations codifying a local vernacular variety into several national literary standards: Indonesia notably adopts a variant spoken in Riau specifically as the basis for &quot;Indonesian&quot; for national use despite Javanese having more native speakers; this standard is the sole official language spoken throughout the vast country despite being the first language of some Indonesians.

====Swahili====
Swahili developed as a lingua franca between several Bantu-speaking tribal groups on the east coast of Africa with heavy influence from Arabic. The earliest examples of writing in Swahili are from 1711. In the early 19th century the use of Swahili as a lingua franca moved inland with the Arabic ivory and slave traders. It was eventually adopted by Europeans as well during periods of colonization in the area. German colonizers used it as the language of administration in German East Africa, later becoming Tanganyika, which influenced the choice to use it as a national language in what is now independent Tanzania. Swahili is currently one of the national languages and it is taught in schools and universities in several East African countries, thus prompting it to be regarded as a modern-day lingua franca by many people in the region. Several Pan-African writers and politicians have unsuccessfully called for Swahili to become the lingua franca of Africa as a means of unifying the African continent and overcoming the legacy of colonialism.

====Persian====
Persian, an Iranian language, is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan (Dari) and Tajikistan (Tajik). It acts as a lingua franca in both Iran and Afghanistan between the various ethnic groups in those countries. The Persian language in South Asia, before the British colonized the Indian subcontinent, was the region&#x27;s lingua franca and a widely used official language in north India and Pakistan.

====Hausa====
Hausa can also be seen as a lingua franca because it is the language of communication between speakers of different languages in Northern Nigeria and other West African countries, including the northern region of Ghana.

====Amharic====
Amharic is the lingua franca and most widely spoken language in Ethiopia, and is known by most people who speak another Ethiopian language.

====Creole languages====
Creoles, such as Nigerian Pidgin in Nigeria, are used as lingua francas across the world. This is especially true in Africa, the Caribbean, Melanesia, Southeast Asia and in parts of Australia by Indigenous Australians.

====Sign languages====
The majority of pre-colonial North American nations communicated internationally using Hand Talk. Also called Prairie Sign Language, Plains Indian Sign Language, or First Nations Sign Language, this language functioned predominantly—and still continues to function—as a second language within most of the (now historical) countries of the Great Plains, from Newe Segobia in the West to Anishinaabewaki in the East, down into what are now the northern states of Mexico and up into Cree Country stopping before Denendeh. The relationship remains unknown between Hand Talk and other manual Indigenous languages like Keresan Sign Language and Plateau Sign Language, the latter of which is now extinct (though Ktunaxa Sign Language is still used). Although unrelated, perhaps Inuit Sign Language played and continues to play a similar role across Inuit Nunangat and the various Inuit dialects. The original Hand Talk is found across Indian Country in pockets, but it has also been employed to create new or revive old languages, such as with Oneida Sign Language.

International Sign, though a pidgin language, is present at most significant international gatherings, from which interpretations of national sign languages are given, such as in LSF, ASL, BSL, Libras, or Auslan. International Sign, or IS and formerly Gestuno, interpreters can be found at many European Union parliamentary or committee sittings, during certain United Nations affairs, conducting international sporting events like the Deaflympics, in all World Federation of the Deaf functions, and across similar settings. The language has few set internal grammatical rules, instead co-opting national vocabularies of the speaker and audience, and modifying the words to bridge linguistic gaps, with heavy use of gestures and classifiers.

<doc id="65378" wikidata="Q236017" url="?curid=65378" title="Jiang Qing">
<text>Jiang Qing (March 191414 May 1991), also known as Madame Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary, actress, and political figure. She was the fourth wife of Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party and Paramount leader of China. Jiang was best known for playing a major role in the Cultural Revolution as the leader of the radical Gang of Four.

Born into a declining family with an abusive father and a mother who worked as a domestic servant and sometimes a prostitute, Jiang Qing became a renowned actress in Shanghai, and later the wife of Mao Zedong in Yan&#x27;an, in the 1930s. In the 1940s, she worked as Mao Zedong&#x27;s personal secretary, and during the 1950s, she headed the Film Section of the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 

Appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group in 1966, Jiang played a pivotal role as Mao’s emissary during the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Collaborating with Lin Biao, she advanced Mao’s ideology and promoted his cult of personality. Jiang wielded considerable influence over state affairs, particularly in culture and the arts. Propaganda posters idolised her as the &quot;Great Flagbearer of the Proletarian Revolution.&quot; In 1969, she secured a seat on the Politburo, cementing her power. 

Following Mao&#x27;s death, she was soon arrested by Hua Guofeng and his allies in 1976. State media portrayed her as the &quot;White-Boned Demon,&quot; and she was widely blamed for instigating the Cultural Revolution, a period of upheaval that caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. Initially sentenced to death with a two year reprieve in a televised trial, Jiang&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983. Released for medical treatment in the early 1990s, she committed suicide in May 1991.

== Names ==

=== Chinese names ===
Jiang Qing was known by various names throughout her life. Before her birth, her father named the baby Li Jinnan, where Jinnan means the &quot;coming boy.&quot; When she was born, her father changed the name to Li Jinhai, meaning the &quot;coming child.&quot; Therefore, Jiang Qing also called herself Li Jin. Several other sources indicate her birth name Li Shumeng, which means &quot;pure and simple.&quot;

She adopted the name Li Yunhe during primary school. She told her biographer Roxane Witke that she liked the name because &quot;Yunhe,&quot; meaning &quot;crane in the cloud,&quot; sounded beautiful. In July 1933, during her first visit to Shanghai, she assumed the name Li He and worked as a teacher for local workers. On her second visit to Shanghai in June 1934, she used the alias Zhang Shuzhen. Later, when detained by the Nationalist government in October 1934, she identified herself as Li Yungu.

In 1935, when she entered the entertainment industry, she took on the stage name Lan Ping, which means &quot;blue apple&quot;. Although the name had no particular meaning, its bluntness made it unique. However, Jiang Qing did not favour this name due to its association with her scandals in Shanghai. She became known as Jiang Qing upon arriving in Yan&#x27;an, where &quot;Jiang&quot; means &quot;river&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; means &quot;azure&quot; or &quot;better than blue&quot;. 

In 1991, when she was hospitalised in Beijing, she used the name Li Runqing. When she died in Beijing, her body was labelled with the pseudonym Li Zi. In March 2002, she was buried in Beijing by her school name Li Yunhe.

=== English names ===
In English, many contemporary articles used the Wade–Giles romanisation system to spell Chinese names. For this reason, some sources – especially older ones – spell her name &quot;Chiang Ch&#x27;ing&quot;, while newer sources use Pinyin and spell her name &quot;Jiang Qing&quot;. She was also known as Madame Mao, as the wife and widow of Mao Zedong. Yet, the Chinese usually keep their maiden name after getting married, so her surname remains unchanged in Chinese.

==Early life==
Jiang Qing was born in Zhucheng, Shandong, in March 1914. She deliberately kept her exact birth date private to avoid receiving any gifts. Her father was Li Dewen, a carpenter, and her mother, whose name is unknown, was Li&#x27;s subsidiary wife, or concubine. Her father had his own carpentry and cabinet making workshop. Her parents were married after her father initially found his first wife unable to conceive.

As a child, Jiang was deeply traumatised by the domestic violence inflicted by her father, who verbally and physically abused her mother almost every day. One Lantern Festival, after her father broke her mother’s finger during an attack, her mother fled with Jiang under the cover of darkness. Her mother found work as a domestic servant that often blurred the lines with prostitution, and her husband separated from her. 

Jiang eventually moved with her mother to her grandparents&#x27; home in Jinan. However, they soon returned to Zhucheng, as her mother continued to seek inheritance rights, or financial support, from her husband’s family, which proved extremely difficult. During this period, Jiang attended two primary schools with disruptions, where she was often mocked for wearing outdated, boyish clothing from her brothers. She became silent and not easy to open up.

Her mother, having fallen ill, eventually abandoned hope of obtaining further financial support from her husband. After selling some of her belongings, she purchased a train ticket, and together with Jiang, boarded a train from Jiaoxian to Jinan. There, Jiang was welcomed by her grandparents and resumed her primary education. In 1926–1927, her mother took her further north to Tianjin to stay with her half-sister. During this time, Jiang worked as a housekeeper in the household. She proposed taking a job rolling cigarettes, but the family disapproved. Later they returned to Jinan, where her mother passed away in 1928.
== Entertainment career ==

=== Jinan ===
At 14, Jiang, now an orphan, joined a local underground theatre troupe, seeking independence. Her striking looks drew attention, but she remained sensitive about her poor upbringing. Alarmed by her undisclosed departure, her grandparents paid the troupe&#x27;s boss to bring her back. She enrolled in the Experimental Arts Academy, which became less picky about the social class of new entrants due to the May Fourth Movement. Despite her strong Shandong accent initially hindering her performances, she excelled during her year of training, in some traditional opera roles. When the academy closed in 1930, Jiang, though only half-trained, was chosen to join theatrical companies in Beijing. She returned to Jinan in May 1931 and married Pei Minglun, the wealthy son of a businessman, and soon divorced.

=== Qingdao ===
Following her divorce, Jiang reached out to Zhao Taimou, the former director of the Arts Academy and dean of Qingdao University. With the assistance of Zhao&#x27;s wife, Yu Shan, Jiang secured a position as a clerk in the university library. Yu Shan later introduced Jiang to her brother, Yu Qiwei, an upper-class youth who had embraced the Communist cause and was connected to underground Communist organisations as well as literary and performing arts circles. 

The Mukden Incident in September ignited her patriotism, leading her to develop a dislike for the Kuomintang and its supporters. By the end of 1932, Jiang and Yu Qiwei fell in love and began living together, enabling Jiang to gain entry into the Communist Cultural Front. She became a member of the Seaside Drama Society, performing in plays such as &quot;Lay Down Your Whip&quot;, harnessing the influence of theatre to resist Japanese aggression. In February 1933, she officially joined the CCP. 

The Communist activities at Qingdao University attracted significant attention from the Kuomintang&#x27;s secret police, who arrested Yu Qiwei in July, forcing Jiang to leave Qingdao.

=== Shanghai ===
After the arrest of Yu Qiwei, Yu Shan arranged for Jiang to move to Shanghai. With a recommendation from Tian Han&#x27;s younger brother, Tian Luan, she enrolled as a visiting student at the Great China University in Shanghai. In July, with endorsements from Tian Han and his associates, Jiang became a teacher at the Chengeng Workers&#x27; School, an institution organised by Tao Xingzhi. During this time, Yu Qiwei was released and visited her in Shanghai. In October, Jiang re-joined the Chinese Communist Youth League, became a member of the League of Left-Wing Educators, and resumed her career as a drama actress. 

She performed in the Shanghai Work Study Troupe. Jiang was among the cast of a production of &quot;Roar, China!&quot; which British authorities banned from being performed in Shanghai&#x27;s International Settlement.

In September 1934, Jiang was arrested and jailed for her political activities in Shanghai. During her arrest in Shanghai, Jiang Qing was interrogated by a Zhongtong agent, Zhao Yaoshan. Jiang had once revealed to Zhao that Tan Xiaoqing was a CCP member, leading to Tan’s arrest. She was released three months later, in December. She then traveled to Beijing where she reunited with Yu Qiwei who had just been released following his prison sentence, and the two began living together again. 
She returned to Shanghai in March 1935, and entered Diantong Film Company. She became famous when featuring in Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; as Nora. She later became an actress in &quot;Goddess of Freedom&quot; and &quot;Scenes of City Life&quot;, during which she fell in love with Tang Na, her colleague at Diantong. The two began living together in September 1935. However, Jiang lied to Tang, claiming her mother was ill, and returned to Tianjin to see Yu Qiwei. When Tang discovered the truth, he attempted suicide in Jinan but later reconciled with Jiang and returned with her to Shanghai in July 1935. Later they were married in a collective wedding ceremony at Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou in April 1936.In Shanghai, Jiang joined Lianhua Film Company, where she acted in &quot;Blood on Wolf Mountain&quot; and &quot;Lianhua Symphony&quot;. During this period, she began an affair with film director Zhang Min, appeared in his production &quot;The Storm&quot;. She also became an actress in &quot;Wang Laowu&quot;. However, during the second performance of &quot;The Storm&quot; in May 1937, Tang attempted suicide again. Following this incident, Jiang divorced Tang and started living with Zhang Min, but the relationship cost her career as she was dismissed by Lianhua Film Company.

Jiang&#x27;s widely publicised affair with Tang Na tarnished her reputation, making it difficult for her to continue her acting career in Shanghai. Like many youths of her time, she was drawn to the progressive ideals associated with Yan&#x27;an. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, which marked the start of Japan&#x27;s full-scale invasion of China, further galvanised young activists to advocate for a united front. Yan&#x27;an, promoted through Communist propaganda, emerged as a symbol of democracy, freedom, and hope. She left Shanghai in July, after which the Japanese invasion in Shanghai started on 13 August.
== Early political activities ==
=== Yan&#x27;an ===

==== Drama teacher ====
She went first to Xi&#x27;an, then to Yan&#x27;an. In November, she enrolled in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University for study. The Lu Xun Academy of Arts was newly founded in Yan&#x27;an on 10 April 1938, and Jiang became a drama department instructor, teaching and performing in college plays and operas. The conditions in Yan&#x27;an were harsh, but Jiang was able to make it there and persist. Jiang was striking in appearance and had several talents; she could sing opera, write well, and her calligraphy was particularly impressive, especially in regular script. On one hand, she was relatively quiet and reserved—she didn&#x27;t enjoy shooting, but liked playing poker, knitting, and was skilled at creating various patterns. She was also adept at tailoring and made her own clothes beautifully. On the other hand, she had a lively and bold side—Jiang enjoyed horseback riding, especially taming wild horses; the more ferocious the horse, the more she liked to ride it. This combination of traits allowed her to excel as both a homemaker and adapt to the tough, military lifestyle, earning the admiration of revolutionary leaders.

==== Secret marriage ====
In the autumn of 1937, He Zizhen, the wife of Mao Zedong, left Yan&#x27;an. When news of Jiang Qing&#x27;s romance with Mao Zedong broke, it sparked significant opposition. The most vocal critic was Zhang Wentian, who believed that He, as an outstanding CCP member, having endured the Long March and sustained multiple injuries, deserved respect. However, some felt that Mao Zedong&#x27;s personal matters, including his choice of a wife, were his own business, and others should not interfere. Among those who supported Mao, the most vocal was Kang Sheng.Figures like Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi, however, were more cautious in their support of Jiang Qing. They sent telegrams to the Communist leadership in Shanghai, requesting them to clarify Jiang&#x27;s conduct in Shanghai, where she was suspected of being a &quot;secret agent&quot; of the Kuomintang. , a party leader in Shanghai, secretly written to Yan&#x27;an arguing that Jiang was unsuitable for marriage to Mao. 

Nevertheless, on 28 November 1938, Jiang Qing married Mao Zedong with the eventual approval of the Politburo, but with three restrictions as follows:
# Since Mao and He Zizhen had not formally dissolved their marriage, Jiang Qing was prohibited from publicly assuming the title of Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife.
# Jiang Qing was tasked solely with caring for Mao Zedong&#x27;s daily life and health, and no one else could make similar requests to the Party Central Committee.
# Jiang Qing was restricted to managing Mao&#x27;s private affairs. She was barred from holding any Party positions for 20 years and was prohibited from interfering in Party personnel matters or participating in political activities.

In the early years of their marriage, Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing shared a harmonious life. Jiang primarily took on the role of a homemaker, attending to Mao&#x27;s daily needs. In 1940, she gave birth to their daughter, Li Na. After Li Na’s birth, Jiang Qing largely withdrew from the public eye. 

=== Beijing and Moscow ===
==== First Lady ====
After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Jiang Qing became the nation&#x27;s first lady. However, her role was concealed from the general public in China or beyond throughout the 1950s. During the 1950s, Jiang Qing left a generally favourable impression on those who interacted with her. In 1949, after Soong Ching-ling attended the founding ceremony in Beijing and returned to Shanghai, Mao Zedong sent Jiang Qing to see her off at the train station. It is said that Soong later remarked that Jiang was &quot;polite and likeable.&quot; In 1956, Soong hosted Indonesian President Sukarno at a banquet in Shanghai, where Jiang and Liu Shaoqi’s wife, Wang Guangmei, were also present. Soong reportedly praised Jiang for her refined manners and tasteful attire. During their conversation, Jiang even asked Soong to encourage Mao to wear a tie and suits, noting that Sun Yat-sen often did so and suggesting that foreigners found the simplicity of Chinese officials&#x27; clothing too monotonous. 

==== Film bureaucracy ====

She served as the deputy director of the Film Guidance Committee, overseeing the evaluation of film projects from 1949 to 1951. In 1951, Jiang Qing was given a minor position of Film Bureau Chief. After her appointment, Jiang engaged in three attempts in establishing the standard for socialist art. Jiang&#x27;s first attempt was her advice to ban the 1950 Hong Kong movie &quot;Sorrows of the Forbidden City&quot;, of which Jiang believed to be unpatriotic. Her opinion was not taken seriously by the communist leadership due to the minor political influence of her office and the movie was distributed in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Mao intervened to support her. 

Later that year, Jiang critiqued and objected to the distribution of the movie &quot;The Life of Wu Xun&quot; for glorifying the wealthy landed class while dismissing the peasantry. Again, Jiang&#x27;s opinion was dismissed. Mao had to intervene to support her again. 

Jiang&#x27;s third attempt involved the role of literary criticism in the development of socialist art. She asked the editor of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; to republish the new literary interpretation of the classic novel &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; by two young scholars at Shandong University. The editor refused Jiang&#x27;s request on the grounds that the party newspaper was not a forum for free debate. Again, Mao spoke up on Jiang&#x27;s behalf.

Jiang was a member of the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s steering committee for film production.

==== Medical treatment ====
Jiang was in poor health for much of the 1950s, leading her to step back from her official duties. As a result, she had to move back and forth between Beijing and Moscow. In 1949, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent four rounds of treatment in the Soviet Union. In March 1949, she travelled to Moscow and Yalta, returning in the autumn. She visited Moscow again in 1952, staying until the autumn of 1953. Due to severe pain in her liver, while the Chinese doctors were unable to fulfil their duties due to the Three-Antis Movement, the Soviet doctors explored her liver through surgery. Her life in the Soviet Union was rather reclusive, with only Russian doctors, nurses, bodyguards, and all reading materials only from the Chinese diplomatic mission. In 1956, she made another trip to the Soviet Union for treatment and returned in 1957.

During this period, as a foreign dignitary, she gained access to a wide range of films banned in the Soviet Union, including many Hollywood productions. This exposure allowed her to stay informed about Western art trends, which later influenced her transformation of the Peking Opera. In 1957, Jiang recovered from cervical cancer, though she believed she was still unwell, contrary to her doctors’ assessment of her good health. Therefore, they recommended that she engage in therapeutic activities such as watching films, listening to music, and attending theatre and concerts.

==== Cover-up ====
During the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, Zhao Yaoshan, the Zhongtong agent who interrogated Jiang during her arrest in the 1930s, was executed. In January 1953, , who had secretly written to Yan&#x27;an about Jiang&#x27;s experiences in Shanghai, was imprisoned. Pan Hannian, the Communist intelligence chief who defended Yang, was also jailed. 

In December, Mao Zedong travelled to Hangzhou with Jiang Qing. After his departure on 14 March, Jiang received an anonymous letter from Shanghai later that month. Initially disturbed and then angered, she sought out Zhejiang party chief Tan Qilong, asserting her revolutionary commitment and requesting an investigation. Despite extensive police efforts, the sender&#x27;s identity remained unknown. 

In 1958, while Mao attended a meeting in Nanning, he met Yu Qiwei, who had a romantic relationship with Jiang. After being criticised by Mao, Yu suffered severe mental and physical distress. Upon arriving at Guangzhou Airport, he kowtowed before Li Fuchun, pleading to be &quot;spared.&quot; Li then escorted him to a military hospital. There, Yu attempted suicide by jumping out of a window, resulting in a broken leg. Yu passed away a few months later, and Mao sent a wreath in his name alone as a gesture of condolence. 

In 1961, Zhu Ming, the widow of Lin Boqu, wrote to the Party Central Committee regarding her late husband. Her handwriting matched that of the anonymous letter. When confronted, Zhu admitted to writing the letter and subsequently committed suicide.

== Cultural Revolution ==
=== Prelude ===
Before 1962, the Chinese media never mentioned who Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife was in its international propaganda. People close to Mao Zedong claimed that after the 1950s, Jiang Qing was rarely seen by his side, and their emotional relationship had essentially ended, leaving her feeling frustrated for a time. However, as the 1960s progressed, Mao became increasingly distrustful of the surrounding leaders and his judgment of the domestic political situation grew more severe. Jiang Qing capitalised on this shift, becoming more outspoken, which led Mao to view her as &quot;politically sensitive&quot; and start to trust her. As a result, her power grew steadily.

After Jiang&#x27;s return to China in 1962, she frequently attended local opera performances. In 1963, Jiang Qing enlisted A Jia to help modernise Beijing Opera with revolutionary socialist themes. She later instructed the Beijing Municipal Opera Company to create &quot;Shajiabang&quot;, depicting the struggle between the Kuomintang and Communists during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and tasked the Shanghai Beijing Opera Company with producing &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy&quot;. In her first public speech in June 1964 at a Peking Opera convention, Jiang criticised regional opera troupes for glorifying emperors, generals, scholars, and other ox-demons and snake-spirits.

Jiang&#x27;s efforts to reform Peking Opera gained approval from the Communist leadership, especially during the 1964 Modern Beijing Opera Trial Performance Convention. She also formed a productive collaboration with Yu Huiyong, to push the yangbanxi (model drama) projects. Their shared vision focused on creating operas that reflected modern Chinese society and the lives of the working class, starting with &quot;On the Docks&quot;, which portrayed Communist-ruled Shanghai. Jiang’s political influence helped ensure the success of these projects, which aimed to create revolutionary art that represented the reality of contemporary life.

=== Cultural reforms ===

From 1962 onwards, Jiang Qing began appearing publicly as Mao&#x27;s wife and later gave frequent speeches in the cultural and propaganda sectors, criticizing and condemning various figures. By late 1965, as Jiang Qing’s influence grew, she rallied close allies such as Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. She organised a campaign to criticise the play &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot;, which marked the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.

In February 1966, Jiang hosted a forum with PLA officers. The group studied writings by Mao, watched films and plays, and met with the cast and crew of an in-progress film production. The forum concluded that a &quot;black line&quot; of bourgeois thought dominated the arts since the PRC&#x27;s founding. A summary of Jiang&#x27;s analysis at the forum was later distributed widely during the Cultural Revolution and became a significant document.

Over April through June 1966, Jiang presided over the All-Army Artistic Creation Conference in Beijing. Conference attendees evaluated a total of 80 domestic and foreign films. Jiang approved of 7 as consistent with Mao Zedong Thought and criticised the other films. Backed by her husband, she was appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group (CCRG) in 1966 and emerged as a serious political figure in the summer of that year.

==== Revolutionary operas ====

In 1967, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang declared eight works of performance art to be the new models for proletarian literature and art. These &quot;model operas&quot;, or &quot;revolutionary operas&quot;, were designed to glorify Mao Zedong, The People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and the revolutionary struggles. The ballets &quot;White-Haired Girl&quot;, &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot;, and &quot;Shajiabang&quot; (&quot;Revolutionary Symphonic Music&quot;) were included in the list of eight, and were closely associated with Jiang, because of their inclusion of elements from Chinese and Western opera, dance, and music. The Red Guards condemned Yu Huiyong to be a &quot;bad element&quot; for propagating feudalism through his utilisation of traditional Chinese music in operas. Yu was also tagged as &quot;a democrat hiding under the banner of the Communist Party&quot; due to his frequent absences in party meetings. In 1966, Yu was subsequently sent to a Cow Shed, a small room where the &quot;bad elements&quot; were confined. In October 1966, Yu was released after Jiang requested a meeting with Yu to stage the production of two operas in Beijing. Jiang seated Yu next to her, as a display of Yu&#x27;s importance in the making of yangbanxi, during the showing of &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy&quot;. During Richard Nixon&#x27;s famous visit to China in February 1972, he watched &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot;, and was impressed by the opera. He famously asked Jiang who the writer, director, and composer were, to which she replied it was &quot;created by the masses.&quot;

==== Fashion designs ====

In 1974, Jiang Qing directed the Ministry of Culture to design a new dress for Chinese women, inspired by elements of women&#x27;s clothing from the Song dynasty. The dress was called the Jiang Qing Dress. The dress featured a symmetrical V-neckline, differing slightly from the traditional Y-shaped neckline of Hanfu. Mockingly dubbed the &quot;Nun&#x27;s Robe,&quot; Jiang intended for female cadres to lead the way in wearing it, with the eventual goal of making it a nationwide standard.

=== Political activism ===
During this period, Mao galvanised students and young workers as his paramilitary organisation the Red Guards to attack what he termed as revisionists in the party. Mao told them the revolution was in danger and that they must do all they could to stop the emergence of a privileged class in China. He argued this is what had happened in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev. With time, Jiang began playing an increasingly active political role in the movement. She took part in most important Party and government activities. Jiang took advantage of the Cultural Revolution to wreak vengeance on her personal enemies, including people who had slighted her during her acting career in the 1930s. She was supported by a radical coterie, dubbed, by Mao himself, the Gang of Four. She became a prominent member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and a major player in Chinese politics from 1966 to 1976. 

==== 1966–1969 ====

From 1962, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang Guangmei frequently appeared at diplomatic events, earning Wang the title of &quot;First Lady,&quot; which reportedly made Jiang Qing jealous. Before Wang&#x27;s overseas trips, Jiang advised her not to wear jewellery, claiming it looked better. However, upon seeing Wang on television wearing a necklace, Jiang criticised her for displaying &quot;bourgeois style&quot; in a talk with Red Guards. 
On 13 December 1966, Liu Shaoqi voluntarily offered to resign from his positions as President. He proposed moving with his wife and children to Yan’an or his hometown in Hunan to take up farming, hoping to bring the Cultural Revolution to an early conclusion and minimise the damage to the country. On 18 December, Zhang Chunqiao, deputy head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, summoned Kuai Dafu, a leader of the Red Guards at Tsinghua University, and instructed him to launch a campaign to overthrow Liu Shaoqi. On 25 December, Kuai Dafu led thousands of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, where they publicly chanted the slogan “Down with Liu Shaoqi.”

The Central Cultural Revolution Group was initially a small body under the Standing Committee of the Politburo. With the backing of Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan initiated a coup in Shanghai in January 1967, consolidating power and gaining support from revolutionary factions like Wang Hongwen. On 6 January 1967, Red Guards at Tsinghua University, with Jiang Qing&#x27;s backing, lured Wang to the campus under the pretext of her daughter being in a car accident. Once there, Wang was detained and prosecuted.

Following the Red Guards&#x27; disruption of party structures in January 1967, this group replaced the Secretariat and became the central command for the party. Jiang Qing&#x27;s role as the &quot;First Deputy Head&quot; of the group grew significantly, elevating her political power. Chen Boda, the nominal leader of the group, was repeatedly humiliated by Jiang Qing during this period. Fearing her power, he endured her mistreatment in silence. In one notable incident, after a middle school student scaled his wall, Chen’s wife reported the event, sparking a &quot;footprint incident&quot; that enraged Jiang Qing. She demanded Chen move out of Zhongnanhai, and this further strained his relationship with her. Seizing the opportunity, Lin Biao and his wife, Ye Qun, aligned with Chen, who quietly defected to their faction.

On 18 July 1967, a public struggle session against Liu Shaoqi was held in Zhongnanhai. On 5 August, the Central Cultural Revolution Group approved three separate struggle sessions targeting Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Deng Xiaoping and his wife, and Tao Zhu and his wife. From that point, Liu Shaoqi was completely stripped of his personal freedom. On 16 September 1968, under Jiang Qing’s leadership, a special investigation team compiled three volumes of so-called evidence against Liu, largely extracted through torture and coercion. After being imprisoned in Zhongnanhai for over two years, Liu Shaoqi was transferred to Kaifeng, Henan Province, on 17 October 1969, where he subsequently passed away. 

Meanwhile, Jiang’s stature continued to rise, though she was still not a member of the Central Committee during the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee. At the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in April 1969, Jiang was admitted to the Politburo after Mao Zedong shifted his stance, likely to balance the power of the Lin Biao faction. Mao also approved the entry of Lin Biao&#x27;s wife, Ye Qun, into the Politburo, further consolidating their influence.

==== 1969–1971 ====
Jiang&#x27;s rivalry with, and personal dislike of, Zhou Enlai led Jiang to hurt Zhou where he was most vulnerable. In 1968, Jiang had Zhou&#x27;s adopted son (Sun Yang) and daughter (Sun Weishi) tortured and murdered by Red Guards. Sun Yang was murdered in the basement of Renmin University. After Sun Weishi died following seven months of torture in a secret prison (at Jiang&#x27;s direction), Jiang made sure that Sun&#x27;s body was cremated and disposed of so that no autopsy could be performed and Sun&#x27;s family could not have her ashes. In 1968, Jiang forced Zhou to sign an arrest warrant for his own brother. In 1973 and 1974, Jiang directed the &quot;Criticise Lin, Criticise Confucius&quot; campaign against premier Zhou because Zhou was viewed as one of Jiang&#x27;s primary political opponents. In 1975, Jiang initiated a campaign named &quot;Criticizing Song Jiang, Evaluating the Water Margin&quot;, which encouraged the use of Zhou as an example of a political loser. After Zhou Enlai died in 1976, Jiang initiated the &quot;Five Nos&quot; campaign in order to discourage and prohibit any public mourning for Zhou. When traditional landscape and bird-and-flower paintings re-emerged in the early 1970s, Jiang criticised these traditional forms as &quot;black paintings&quot;, which in fact targeted Zhou Enlai.

==== 1971–1973 ====
Jiang first collaborated with then second-in-charge Lin Biao, but after Lin Biao&#x27;s death in 1971, she turned against him publicly in the Criticise Lin, Criticise Confucius Campaign. After the September 13 Incident in 1971, Jiang Qing saw the collapse of the Lin Biao faction and, with Mao Zedong&#x27;s declining health, she became eager to seize the highest power in the country. In 1972, Jiang Qing enlisted American journalist Roxane Witke to write her autobiography. After 1972, Mao&#x27;s health deteriorated. Though Mao was largely cut off from the outside world due to his illness, Zhu De sent Mao a letter informing him about Jiang Qing’s biography. This revelation deeply angered Mao, who, in a fit of rage, even expressed his desire to expel Jiang Qing from the Politburo and sever their political ties. By 1973, although unreported due to it being a personal matter, Mao and his wife Jiang had separated.

==== 1973–1976 ====

On 10 March 1973, Deng Xiaoping was reinstated as Vice Premier, serving as Zhou Enlai&#x27;s deputy. During the 10th National Congress of the CCP, Deng remained a member of the Central Committee but he did not gain a seat on the Politburo. On 10 April 1974, Deng led the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Although Jiang Qing strongly opposed Deng&#x27;s appointment, Mao Zedong cautioned her in a letter to cease opposing his decision.

After Zhou Enlai was hospitalised, Wang Hongwen managed the Politburo, Deng Xiaoping oversaw the State Council, and Ye Jianying led the Central Military Commission. On 4 October 1974, Mao Zedong proposed appointing Deng as First Vice Premier. Sensing that Deng might replace Zhou Enlai at the upcoming Fourth National People&#x27;s Congress, Jiang Qing attempted to block Deng from taking charge of the State Council and the Party’s central operations. 

On 12 December, Mao reaffirmed his support for Deng by proposing his appointment as a member of both the Military Commission and the Politburo—a suggestion that gained majority approval from Politburo members. On 23 December, despite his ill health, Zhou Enlai flew to Changsha to meet Mao and seek his endorsement of Deng Xiaoping, with Wang Hongwen also in attendance. Mao agreed and, while pointing at Wang, remarked that Deng&#x27;s &quot;politics&quot; is better than his.&quot;&quot; Mao spoke English for the word &quot;politics.&quot; Wang was embarrassed as he did not understand.

==Downfall==

=== Protests ===

By the mid-1970s, Jiang spearheaded the campaign against Deng Xiaoping. Yet, the Chinese public became intensely discontented at politics and chose to blame Jiang, a more accessible and easier target than Mao. 

In January 1976, official news announced the death of Zhou Enlai. Zhou was highly respected in Chinese society, second only to Mao Zedong in influence. However, no official commemorative activities were organised following his death. On 5 March and 25 March, &quot;Wenhui Daily&quot; published two reports criticising Deng Xiaoping, indirectly accusing Zhou Enlai of being the &quot;biggest capitalist roader&quot; who had supported and protected Deng. Starting on 21 March, students at Nanjing University began questioning and condemning &quot;Wenhui Daily&quot; and the criticisms of Zhou in Shanghai. On 29 March, the students escalated their protests by writing large slogans on trains departing from Nanjing, spreading their message nationwide. On 30 March, members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, including Cao Zhijie, posted signed wall posters in Beijing. These posters transformed the veiled political dissent into open protest, marking the beginning of the Tiananmen protests in Beijing. 

Many Chinese instinctively believe that it was Jiang Qing who ordered the removal of the wreaths dedicated to Zhou Enlai from Tiananmen Square. In response, slogans appeared, such as &quot;Down with the Empress Dowager, down with Indira Gandhi.&quot; Another individual placed a wreath in honour of Mao&#x27;s revered second wife, Yang Kaihui, who had been executed by Chiang Kai-shek in 1930. Jiang Qing was often referred to obliquely as &quot;that woman&quot; or &quot;three drops of water,&quot; a reference to part of the Chinese character for her name. The protests eventually evolved into a riot, with cars ignited by angry protesters and militia intervention.

=== Coup d&#x27;état ===
On 5 September 1976, Jiang Qing was informed of the critical illness of Mao Zedong and soon returned to Beijing. On the evening of 8 September, she drove to Xinhua News Agency trying to find supporters, and returned to Zhongnanhai late in night, where high-rank Chinese officials and Mao&#x27;s family members were present. Jiang could not fall asleep. She needed to confront two other factions within the party, Hua Guofeng who had received a note from Mao saying, &quot;With you in charge, I am at ease,&quot; and Deng Xiaoping who was being attacked by Jiang. She approached Hua secretly, proposing to expel Deng in the Politburo meeting before Mao&#x27;s death, but she did not succeed. 

Mao died on 9 September. The funeral services were hosted by Wang Hongwen, with a million people assembled at Tiananmen Square to mourned his death. Jiang sent a large wreath of chrysanthemums and greenery, as his student and comrade, rather than his widow. Hua was the designated successor of Mao and soon became the party chief and became embroiled in a power struggle with the Gang of Four. Jiang went to Baoding to rally the 38th Army, preparing to replace Hua as a party chief. In response, both Ye Jianying, one of Deng&#x27;s allies, and Hua mobilised their military forces in Beijing and Guangzhou. Xu Shiyou warned a north expedition from Guangzhou, if Jiang had not been arrested in Beijing. In 4–5 October, Hua continued to negotiate with Jiang&#x27;s allies on the personnel arrangement and agreed to continue the talk the following day. 

On 6 October, Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen were arrested when they arrived at Zhongnanhai. Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan were arrested at their homes. Hua – supported by the military and state security – had Jiang and the rest of the Gang arrested and removed from their party positions. According to Zhang Yaoci, who carried out the arrest, Jiang did not say much when she was arrested. It was reported that one of her servants spat at her as she was being taken away under a flurry of blows by onlookers and police. In May 1975, Mao Zedong once criticised the Gang of Four for leaning too heavily on empiricism. However, he downplayed the severity of their issue, stating that it was not a significant problem but needed to be addressed. Mao remarked,

The remark served as a justification for Hua Guofeng to arrest the Gang of Four.

===Televised trial===

Hua was later replaced by Deng Xiaoping, who proceeded with prosecuting Jiang. At the time of her arrest, the country lacked the proper institutions for a legal trial. As a result she and the other members of the Gang of Four were held in a state of limbo for the first six months of their capture. Following prompt legal modernisation, an indictment was brought forward, formally titled &quot;Indictment of the Special Procuratorate under the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate of the People’s Republic of China.&quot; The indictment contained 48 separate counts. 

In November 1980, the government announced that Jiang and nine others would stand trial. She was tried with the other three members of the Gang of Four and six associates. She was accused of persecuting artists during the Cultural Revolution, and authorising the burgling of the homes of writers and performers in Shanghai to destroy material related to Jiang&#x27;s early career that could harm her reputation. Xinhua News Agency reported that Jiang initially sought to recruit her own lawyers but rejected those recommended by the special team after interviews. Meanwhile, five of the ten defendants agreed to be represented by government-appointed lawyers who would act as their defence counsel.

Jiang was defiant in the court. She argued to the special prosecution teams that Mao should also be held accountable for her actions. Whenever a witness took the stand, there was a chance the court proceedings would devolve into a shouting match. She did not deny the accusations, and insisted that she had been protecting Mao and following his instructions. Jiang remarked: 

Her defence strategy was marked by attempts to transcend the court room and appeal to history and the logic of revolution. Jiang sought to challenge Hua Guofeng&#x27;s authority within the Party, with an appalling yet unverifiable claim,

The court announced its verdict after six weeks of testimony and debate and four weeks of deliberations. In early 1981, she was convicted and sentenced to death with a two year reprieve. She was assigned the highest level of criminal liability among the defendants as a &quot;ringleader&quot; of a counterrevolutionary group. Wu Xiuquan recounted in his memoir that the court room erupted into applause as the verdict was read and Jiang Qing was dragged out of the court room by two female guards while shouting revolutionary slogans.

== Death and burial ==

=== Internment and illness ===
Following her arrest, Jiang Qing was held at Qincheng Prison, where she occupied herself with activities such as reading newspapers, listening to radio broadcasts, watching television, knitting, studying books, and writing. Her daughter, Li Na, visited her fortnightly. She was treated well, unlike how she treated her enemies during the Cultural Revolution. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983. The Supreme People&#x27;s Court determined that both Jiang and her chief associate, Zhang, had demonstrated &quot;sufficient repentance&quot; during their two-year reprieve, leading to their death sentences being commuted. However, senior Chinese officials stated that Jiang has not shown genuine remorse and remains as defiant as the day she was removed from a crowded courtroom, shouting, &quot;Long Live the Revolution.&quot;

In 1984, Jiang was granted medical parole and relocated to a discreet residence arranged by the authorities. In December 1988, on the occasion of Mao Zedong&#x27;s 95th birth anniversary, Jiang requested approval to hold a family gathering, but her petition was denied. Distressed, she attempted suicide by ingesting 50 sleeping pills she had secretly saved. The attempt failed. She was later sent back to Qincheng Prison in 1989 when her medical parole concluded. Jiang Qing believed that Deng Xiaoping should be held responsible for the student movement (better known as the Tiananmen Square protests), as he tolerated Western ideologies. She also condemned the subsequent massacre that followed the protests, emphasising that Mao Zedong had never ordered the army to massacre crowds. While in custody, Jiang was diagnosed with throat cancer, and doctors advised surgery. She refused, asserting that losing her voice was unacceptable. 

=== Suicide ===
On 15 March 1991, Jiang Qing was transferred to the Beijing Police Hospital from her residence at Jiuxianqiao due to a high fever. By 18 March, her fever had subsided. She was then moved to a ward within the hospital compound, which included a bedroom, bathroom, and living room. On 10 May 1991, she tore apart her memoir manuscript in front of others and expressed a wish to return to her home. Two days later, on 12 May, her daughter and son-in-law came to visit her in the hospital after learning about her condition, but Jiang declined to meet them. On 14 May 1991, Jiang Qing committed suicide. At 3:30 a.m., a nurse entered her room and found her hanging above the bathtub, having passed away. The suicide note read,
That afternoon, Li Na, went to the hospital to sign the death certificate and agreed that no funeral or memorial service would be held. On 18 May, Jiang Qing&#x27;s remains were cremated. Neither Li Na nor any of Jiang Qing&#x27;s other relatives attended the cremation. Jiang Qing&#x27;s ashes were entrusted to Li Na, who kept them at her home. The Chinese government confirmed that she had hanged herself on 4 June, withholding the announcement for two weeks to avoid its impact before the second anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen protests. 

However, He Diankui, a former staff of Qincheng Prison, later claimed that &quot;Jiang Qing never left Qincheng Prison until her death.&quot; He suggested that she died in the prison from taking sleeping pills, which refuted the official report regarding her death.

=== Burial ===
While imprisoned, Jiang Qing expressed in her will a desire to be buried in her hometown of Zhucheng, Shandong. In 1996, Yan Changgui, Jiang Qing&#x27;s former secretary, visited Zhucheng, where the city’s Party Secretary asked him to convey to Li Na that Jiang Qing could be buried there, pending her consent. However, after the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Jiang Zemin suggested to Li Na that Zhucheng might not be a secure burial site. Instead, Li Na inquired about the possibility of burial in Beijing, which Jiang Zemin approved. Li Na arranged the burial at her own expense. In March 2002, Jiang Qing’s ashes were interred at the Futian Cemetery in Beijing&#x27;s Western Hills scenic area. The tombstone reads: &quot;The Grave of Mother Li Yunhe, 1914–1991, respectfully erected by her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson.&quot;

== Legacy ==

=== Public image ===
Jiang Qing was never a widely admired figure throughout her life. Her marriage to Mao in the 1930s scandalised many of the more puritanical comrades in Yan&#x27;an. During the Cultural Revolution, she did little to win the favour of other Chinese leaders. 

Jiang Qing is often viewed as a figure of naked ambition, with many perceiving her as a typical power-hungry wife of an emperor, seeking to secure power for herself through questionable means. Her public image is largely shaped by her self-serving narrative, which portrays her as a central figure in the turbulent and cutthroat environment of Chinese leadership. She is seen as embodying the ruthless, unpredictable, and dangerous nature of life at the top. Her long-standing vendetta against former cultural-political rivals from her acting days in Shanghai has fueled her reputation for vindictiveness. Though she framed her conflicts with these men as ideological battles, it is widely believed that personal grudges and animosities were the true driving forces behind her actions. 

According to Roxane Witke, Jiang&#x27;s early life was marked by poverty, hunger, and violence, and later, as a woman in a male-dominated world, she faced numerous challenges. These experiences shaped her defensive and aggressive personality, fostering an opportunism that persisted even when she no longer needed to assert herself. Jiang&#x27;s televised trials and her defiance in court have softened hatred towards her among the younger generations, who became sceptical of China&#x27;s Communist system.

==== Official historiography ====

After Jiang Qing’s arrest in 1976, the Chinese government launched a massive propaganda campaign to vilify her and the other members of the so-called Gang of Four. Orchestrated under the authoritarian political culture of Mao’s successor Hua Guofeng, this campaign aimed to discredit Jiang and her associates entirely. In the years leading to her trial in 1980, millions of posters and cartoons depicted the Gang of Four as class enemies and spies. Jiang herself became the primary target of ridicule, portrayed as an empress scheming to succeed Mao and as a prostitute, with references to her past as a Shanghai actress used to question her moral integrity. The propaganda also criticised her interest in Western pastimes, such as photography and poker, portraying them as evidence of her lack of communist values. Ultimately, she was branded the &quot;white-boned demon,&quot; a gendered caricature symbolising destruction and chaos.

The 1980 Gang of Four trial solidified Jiang’s image as a manipulative and villainous figure. The indictment held the Gang responsible for the violence of the Cultural Revolution, accusing Jiang of using political purges for personal vendettas and fostering large-scale chaos. Widely broadcast both within and outside China, the trial reinforced a clear dichotomy: Jiang as a symbol of the past’s chaos, and Deng Xiaoping’s administration as the harbinger of order and progress. This narrative was consistent with the CCP’s Resolution on History, which sought to redefine Mao Zedong’s legacy. While Mao was criticised for &quot;errors,&quot; he was not held directly accountable for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, full blame was shifted to Jiang and the Gang of Four, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to remain ideologically valid under Deng’s reforms.

==== Alternative views ====
Biographical literature on Jiang Qing has emerged as a tool to critique and reinterpret official Chinese historiography. These works challenge the one-dimensional vilification of Jiang, contributing to broader historical debates about the Cultural Revolution and its impact on shaping modern China. While factual biographies aim to deliver an accurate portrayal of their subject, fictional works take creative liberties, reimagining the life of a historical figure without strict adherence to facts. By rejecting the traditional authoritative biographical model—which presents a subject’s life as a coherent narrative—works such as &quot;Jiang Qing and Her Husbands&quot; and &quot;Becoming Madame Mao&quot; instead question the validity of totalising narratives about Jiang. Ultimately, the private sphere in these narratives is used not to provide more intimate insights into the subject but as a means to deconstruct and challenge official Chinese historiography.

The 2013 trial of Bo Xilai was regarded as the most dramatic courtroom event in China since Jiang Qing&#x27;s trial in 1980. Bo&#x27;s wife, Gu Kailai, was frequently likened to Jiang Qing due to the nature of her crimes. In 2024, &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; reported on Peng Liyuan&#x27;s influence over key personnel decisions within the CCP. The report highlighted her backing of Dong Jun&#x27;s appointment as Minister of Defence and Li Ganjie&#x27;s selection as head of the CCP Organisation Department. Dong and Li were both from Shandong, where Peng was born. The report drew parallels between Xi Jinping&#x27;s leadership in his later years and Mao Zedong&#x27;s, likening Peng to Jiang Qing.

=== Memorials ===
Jiang Qing’s grave remained undisclosed to the public until early 2009. Each year during the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, flower baskets are placed at Jiang&#x27;s tomb. In 2015, leftist activists attempting to pay their respects faced resistance from dozens of security guards, with several taken to Pingguoyuan Police Station for questioning. Frustrated Maoist supporters questioned why publicly honouring Chiang Kai-shek was permitted while commemorating Jiang Qing was not, rhetorically asking if the Republic of China had somehow reclaimed the mainland. Since 2018, such commemorations have proceeded without police interference. On 14 May 2021, leftist activists held a panel discussion on &quot;the Role of Li Jin in the History of the Party&quot;, which Li Na reportedly attended. Since 2021, as large numbers of visitors continued to honour Jiang Qing, international media noted that authorities allowed leftist groups to commemorate her while prohibiting public mourning for Zhao Ziyang. Following this, the authorities banned public mourning for her at her gravesite, with surveillance cameras and security guards constantly monitoring the situation.

=== Peking Opera ===

During the production of yangbanxi, Jiang had shown keen intuition, due to her experience as an actress, in showing the shape yangbanxi should take. However, Jiang&#x27;s directions on opera reforms were often vague. Yu, acting as the pawn of Jiang, was able to manifest Jiang&#x27;s orders into technical details that can be followed by the performers. Despite Yu&#x27;s growing influence, he was never able to defy Jiang&#x27;s orders, as he could only influence her thinking.

Jiang identified the weakness of Beijing opera as the lack of well organised music, which according to Jiang, &quot;builds the image of the characters.&quot; This conception was influenced by Yu&#x27;s writing on the functional conception of music. Yu focused on reforming the language of music. This was due to Yu&#x27;s belief that for yangbanxi to become successful in educating the masses on the structure and benefits of the new socialist state, the language of the music must be understandable to the common person. He first recommended that the lyrics be written in Mandarin, which was in line with the Chinese government policy that mandated the use of Mandarin as the language of instruction in schools nationwide. Yu also advocated that &quot;the melody should be composed in such a way that it also shadowed the syllabic tonal patterns&quot;, which &quot;should sound natural to the ear as well as being easily understandable to the listener.&quot;

According to Jiang&#x27;s theory of the &quot;three prominences,&quot; the model revolutionary works were to foreground the principal hero over other heroic characters and positive characters over other characters. Jiang criticised spy thrillers (which were known as counterespionage films) for making the antagonists seem too intriguing. Jiang was known to be blunt in directing the yangbanxi, but Yu was able to serve as the mediator between Jiang and the performers. Since Jiang could not communicate her vision clearly, performers often take her criticisms as personal insults. Du Mingxin, one of Jiang&#x27;s composers, recalled Jiang dismissed his music in the ballet &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot; (Hong Se Niang Zi Jun) as &quot;erotic ballad that used to be performed in the 1930s Shanghai nightclubs&quot;. Du was then criticised for trying to destroy the yangbanxi project by hiding bourgeois music in a revolutionary ballet. Du felt humiliated by this remark. It was until Yu asked the group to submit another composition that Du regained his motivation and composed the now famous Wanquan Heshui (On Wanquan River). According to Du, this incident revealed Yu&#x27;s artistic integrity, personal courage, and the ability to gain Jiang&#x27;s acknowledgement on his decisions.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===

In Mao Zedong’s later years, he frequently refused to meet Jiang Qing. The two lived apart—Mao resided in Zhongnanhai, while Jiang stayed at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse—and rarely saw each other. Mao often criticised Jiang Qing and noted in his written comments that &quot;Jiang Qing does not represent me; she represents herself.&quot; He once confided to Wang Hairong and Tang Wensheng that Jiang aspired to become the Party Chair. During his interactions with Jiang Qing, Mao advised her to improve her relationships with colleagues who held differing opinions, rather than her small group. He also expressed frustration that she did not study the works of Marx, Lenin, or his own writings. Mao voiced concerns about Jiang Qing’s future after his death, fearing that she might face troubles.

She had a daughter with Mao Zedong, which was Li Na. Li Na visited her frequently at Qincheng Prison, but they often quarrelled with each other for the husband of Li Na, Wang Jingqing, who once served the Central Security Regiment.

=== Hobbies ===
Jiang&#x27;s hobbies included photography, playing cards, and holding screenings of classic Hollywood films, especially those featuring Greta Garbo, one of her favorite actresses, even as they were banned for the average Chinese citizen as a symbol of bourgeois decadence. Jiang Qing was able to imitate Mao Zedong&#x27;s handwriting. Her calligraphy was so similar to Mao&#x27;s that some of her works were even displayed as Mao Zedong&#x27;s manuscripts

Since 1961, Jiang Qing, under the pen names Li Yunhe and Li Jin, had multiple landscape photographs selected for four consecutive National Photography Exhibitions. She became one of the photographers with the most works featured in each exhibition. In terms of lighting techniques, Jiang favoured backlighting and side-backlighting. Her visual style, which emphasised grandeur and completeness, had a significant influence on the photography community in mainland China.

<doc id="65379" wikidata="Q1216940" url="?curid=65379" title="The Day of the Triffids">
<text>The Day of the Triffids is a 1951 post-apocalyptic novel by the English science fiction author John Wyndham. After most people in the world are blinded by an apparent meteor shower, an aggressive species of plant starts killing people. Although Wyndham had already published other novels using other pen name combinations drawn from his real name, this was the first novel published as &quot;John Wyndham&quot;.

The story has been made into the 1962 feature film of the same name, three radio drama series (in 1957, 1968 and 2001) and two TV series (in 1981 and 2009). It was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952, and in 2003 the novel was listed on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.
It was the inspiration for the zombie movie &quot;28 Days Later&quot;. In 2021, the novel was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to feature on a series of UK postage stamps.

==Summary==
The protagonist is Bill Masen, a biologist who has made his living working with triffids—tall, venomous, carnivorous plants capable of locomotion. Due to his background, Bill suspects they were bioengineered in the Soviet Union and accidentally released into the wild. Because of the excellent industrial quality of an oil produced by and obtained from the triffids, there is heavy triffid cultivation around the world.

The narrative begins with Bill in hospital, his eyes bandaged after having been splashed with triffid poison from a stinger. During his recovery he is told of an unexpected green meteor shower. The next morning, he learns that the light from the unusual display has rendered any who watched it blind (later in the book, Bill speculates that the &quot;meteor shower&quot; may have been orbiting satellite weapons, triggered accidentally). After unbandaging his eyes he finds the hospital in chaos, with staff and patients without sight. He wanders through a chaotic London full of blind inhabitants and meets wealthy novelist Josella Playton, whom he rescues after discovering her being forcibly used as a guide by a blind man. Intrigued by a single light on top of the Senate House in an otherwise darkened city, Bill and Josella discover a group of sighted survivors led by a man named Beadley, who plans to establish a colony in the countryside. They decide to join the group.

The polygamy implicit in Beadley&#x27;s scheme for rebuilding society appalls some group members, especially the religious Miss Durrant. However, before these plans can be put in place, a man named Wilfred Coker stages a fire at the university and kidnaps a number of sighted individuals, including Bill and Josella. They are each chained to a blind person and assigned to lead a squadron of the blind, collecting food and other supplies, all the while beset by escaped triffids and rival scavengers.

Soon Bill&#x27;s followers begin to fall sick and die of an unknown disease. When he wakes one morning to find the survivors have left him, he returns to the Senate House to seek Josella but his only lead is an address left behind by Beadley&#x27;s group. Joined by a repentant Coker, Bill drives to the address, a country estate called Tynsham in Wiltshire. He finds part of the Beadley group, now led by Durrant, who eventually tells him that Beadley went to Dorset a few days before he arrived; there has been no sign of Josella. Bill and Coker decide to follow Beadley, finding small groups of blind and sighted people along the way. Eventually they decide to separate, Coker returning to help at Tynsham, while Bill heads for the Sussex Downs after remembering a remark Josella made about friends she had there.

En route, Bill rescues a young sighted girl named Susan, whom he finds trapped alone at home, while her young brother lies dead in the garden, killed by a triffid. He buries the boy and takes Susan with him. A few days later, during a night of heavy rain, they see a faint light in the distance. Upon reaching it, they discover Josella and her friends.

The survivors attempt to establish a self-sufficient colony in Sussex with some success but are constantly under threat from the triffids, which mass around the fenced exterior. Several years pass, until one day a representative of Beadley&#x27;s faction lands a helicopter in their yard and reports that his group has established a colony on the Isle of Wight. Durrant&#x27;s talk of Dorset was a deliberate attempt to throw Bill off on his journey to find Beadley. While Bill and the others are reluctant to leave their own settlement, the group decide to see the summer out in Sussex before moving to the Isle of Wight.

Their plans are hurried by the arrival in an armoured car of the militaristic representatives of a self-appointed, despotic government. Bill recognises the leader as a ruthless young man he had encountered on a scavenging expedition in London, whom he had watched cold-bloodedly execute one of his own group who had fallen ill. The latter plans to give Bill a large number of blind people to care for and use on the farm as slave labour; he will also take Susan as hostage. Feigning agreement, Bill&#x27;s group throw a party, during which they encourage the visitors to get drunk. Creeping out of the house whilst the visitors are fast asleep, they disable the armoured car by pouring honey into the fuel tank and drive through the gates, leaving them open for the triffids to pour in. The novel ends with Bill&#x27;s group on the Isle of Wight, determined one day to destroy the triffids and reclaim their world.

==Publication history==
In the United States, Doubleday &amp; Company holds the 1951 copyright. A condensed version of the book also was serialized in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine in January and February 1951. An unabridged paperback edition was published in the late 1960s, in arrangement with Doubleday, under the Crest Book imprint of Fawcett Publications World Library.

==Influences==
Wyndham frequently acknowledged the influence of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897) on &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;— Wells&#x27;s working title had been &quot;The Day of the Tripods&quot;.

The triffids are related, in some editions of the novel, to brief mention of the theories of the Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko, a proponent of Lamarckism who eventually was thoroughly debunked. &quot;In the days when information was still exchanged Russia had reported some successes. Later, however, a cleavage of methods and views had caused biology there, under a man called Lysenko, to take a different course&quot; (Chapter 2). Lysenkoism at the time of the novel&#x27;s creation was still being defended by some prominent international Stalinists.&quot;

During the Blitz, Wyndham was a fire watcher and later member of the Home Guard. He witnessed the destruction of London from the rooftops of Bloomsbury. He described many scenes and incidents, including the uncanny silence of London on a Sunday morning after a heavy bombardment, in letters to his long-term partner Grace Wilson. These found their way into &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The book has been praised by other science fiction writers. Karl Edward Wagner cited &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; as one of the thirteen best science fiction horror novels. Arthur C. Clarke called it an &quot;immortal story&quot;. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised it, saying: &quot;rarely have the details of [the] collapse been treated with such detailed plausibility and human immediacy, and never has the collapse been attributed to such an unusual and terrifying source&quot;. Forrest J. Ackerman wrote in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; that &quot;Triffids&quot; &quot;is extraordinarily well carried out, with the exception of a somewhat anticlimactic if perhaps inevitable conclusion&quot;.

Brian Aldiss coined the disparaging phrase cosy catastrophe to describe the subgenre of post-war apocalyptic fiction in which society is destroyed save for a handful of survivors, who are able to enjoy a relatively comfortable existence. He singled out &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; as an example and described &quot;Triffids&quot; as &quot;totally devoid of ideas&quot;. However, some more recent critics have argued against this view. Margaret Atwood wrote: &quot;one might as well call World War II—of which Wyndham was a veteran—a &#x27;cozy&#x27; war because not everyone died in it&quot;.

John Clute commented that the book was regularly chosen for school syllabuses, as it was &quot;safe&quot;. Robert M. Philmus called it derivative of better books by H. G. Wells. Groff Conklin, reviewing the novel&#x27;s first publication, characterised it as &quot;a good run-of-the-mill affair&quot; and &quot;pleasant reading... provided you aren&#x27;t out hunting science fiction masterpieces&quot;.

==Cultural impact==

According to director Danny Boyle, the opening hospital sequence of &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; inspired Alex Garland to write the screenplay for &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002).

The 2012 short story &quot;How to Make a Triffid&quot; by Kelly Lagor includes discussions of the possible genetic pathways that could be manipulated to engineer the triffids.

== Themes ==

=== Science and technology ===
&quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; touches on mankind&#x27;s advances in science and technology as a possible contributor to the collapse of society that&#x27;s depicted in the novel.

In a master&#x27;s thesis entitled &quot;Social Critique in the Major Novels of John Wyndham: Civilization&#x27;s Secrets and Nature&#x27;s Truths&quot;, Michael Douglas Green writes about other scientific contributions to the novel&#x27;s apocalypse:

=== Post-WWII British politics ===
Critics have highlighted the parallels between the triffids and the decolonization that took place in Europe after 1945. In an essay entitled &quot;The Politics of Post-Apocalypse: Ideologies on Trial in John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;&quot;, literary critic Jerry Määttä writes:

Robert Yeates, in his essay &quot;Gender and Ethnicity in Post-Apocalyptic Suburbia&quot;, proposes another connection to colonialism:

At the time of the novel&#x27;s writing there was an emerging welfare state in Great Britain after the formation of the Attlee ministry. Coker&#x27;s forced shackling of sighted people to the blind echoes the sentiments that some middle-class British citizens felt in the wake of the changes introduced by the Labour party after their 1945 election victory.

=== Loss of identity ===
The novel frequently brings into question the utility of individualism during the apocalypse. Colin Manlove highlights this phenomenon in his essay &quot;Everything Slipping Away: John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;&quot;:

==Adaptations==
===Film adaptations===
* London-based film producers Albert R. Broccoli and Irving Allen purchased the film rights and in 1956 hired Jimmy Sangster to write the script. Sangster believed that Wyndham was one of the best science fiction novelists writing at the time and felt both honoured and &quot;a little bit intimidated&quot; that he was about to &quot;start messing&quot; with Wyndham&#x27;s novel. Sangster claims he was paid for his work but never heard from the producers and the film was not made. He later said that he did not think that his script was good.
* A British cinematic version, directed by Steve Sekely, with a screenplay by Bernard Gordon, was filmed on location in Spain and released in July 1962. Not in agreement with the novel, it suggested that the triffids arrived on Earth via spores from the meteor shower.
* In September 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that a 3D film version was being planned by producers Don Murphy and Michael Preger.
* The anime film &quot;Crayon Shin-chan: My Moving Story! Cactus Large Attack!&quot; (2015) had a similar setting with Triffids replaced by killer cacti.

===Game adaptations===
* Prázdninová škola Lipnice, a non-profit organisation that pioneered experiential education summer camps in Czechoslovakia in the 1980s, developed an outdoor game based on the story.
* The Italian version of the 1983 Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons &quot;Shambling Mound&quot; Fantasy Adventure Figure by TSR, Inc. named the creature &quot;Il Trifido dinoccolato&quot; &quot;The slouching Triffid.&quot;

===Print adaptations===
* Marvel Comics adapted the story in the magazine &quot;Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction&quot; (1975).

===Radio adaptations===
* There were readings of the novel in 1953 (BBC Home Service – 15 × 15 minutes, read by Frank Duncan)
* Giles Cooper adapted the novel in six 30-minute episodes for the BBC Light Programme, first broadcast between 2 October and 6 November 1957. It was produced by Peter Watts.
* A second version of Cooper&#x27;s adaptation, for BBC Radio 4, was first broadcast between 20 June and 25 July 1968. It was produced by John Powell, with music by David Cain of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.
* It was adapted in Germany in 1968 by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) Köln (Cologne), translated by Hein Bruehl. Most recently, it was re-broadcast as a four-episode series on WDR5 in January 2008.
* It was adapted in Norway in 1969 by Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK), translated by Knut Johansen, and most recently re-broadcast as a six-episode series on NRK in September and October 2012. The Norwegian version is also available on CD and iTunes.
* There were readings of the novel in 1971 (BBC Radio 4 – 10 × 15 minutes, read by Gabriel Woolf)
* A 20-minute extract for schools was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 September 1973, adapted and produced by Peter Fozzard.
* There were readings of the novel in 1980 (BBC Radio 4/Woman&#x27;s Hour – 14 × 15 minutes, read by David Ashford)
* An adaptation by Lance Dann in two 45-minute episodes for the BBC World Service was first broadcast on 8 and 22 September 2001. It was directed by Rosalind Ward, with music by Simon Russell. Episode 2 was originally scheduled for 15 September 2001, but was rescheduled due to the September 11 attacks. Each episode was followed by a 15-minute documentary on the book.
* There were readings of the novel in 2004 (BBC Radio 7 – 17 × 30 minutes, read by Roger May)

===Television adaptations===
* &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;&quot;.
* A six-episode (each episode 30 minutes in length) television serial version was produced by the BBC in 1981 and repeated first on UKGold in the early 1990s (as 3x50 minute episodes, as it was edited for international sales) then on BBC Four in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2014. It starred John Duttine as Bill Masen and was fairly faithful to the novel, albeit moving the timeline to a then-contemporary setting, with Triffid oil being farmed as an energy-saving fuel additive.
* In December 2009, the BBC broadcast a new version of the story, written by &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; writer Patrick Harbinson. It stars Dougray Scott as Bill Masen, Joely Richardson as Jo Playton, Brian Cox as Dennis Masen, Vanessa Redgrave as Durrant, Eddie Izzard as Torrence and Jason Priestley as Coker. An estimated 6.1 million people viewed the first episode. In this version the Triffids originally evolved in Zaire, and their oil is used as an alternative fuel, averting global warming. The elements of repopulating the Earth and the plague were overlooked in this adaptation; another difference in the plot was that the Earth was blinded by a solar flare rather than a meteor shower.
* Amazon Studios announced a planned television series adaptation of the novel with Johan Renck set to direct and executive produce for Angry Films.

==Sequels==
Simon Clark wrote a sequel &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; (2001). This is set 25 years after Wyndham&#x27;s book, and focuses on the adventures of Bill Masen&#x27;s son David, who travels to New York, USA. Big Finish Productions adapted it as an audio play in 2014. The dramatisation featuring Sam Troughton was later broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in June 2016.

Simon Gould published &quot;The Land of the Triffids&quot; in 2016, continuing the story of Christina Schofield, picking up where Simon Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; left off. However, , the book is unavailable for purchase and has not been dramatised in any form.

In 2020, English science fiction and fantasy author John Whitbourn published a sequel, entitled &quot;The Age of the Triffids&quot;. Set in the Isle of Wight &quot;Colony&quot; in the lead-up to the Millennium, it details the rallying of survivors from across Britain for one last attempt to defeat the triffid threat. For copyright reasons, the book is not for sale outside Canada and New Zealand.

<text>The Kalinago, also called Island Caribs or simply Caribs, are an Indigenous people of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. They may have been related to the Mainland Caribs (Kalina) of South America, but they spoke an unrelated language known as Kalinago or Island Carib. They also spoke a pidgin language associated with the Mainland Caribs.

At the time of Spanish contact, the Kalinago were one of the dominant groups in the Caribbean (the name of which is derived from &quot;Carib&quot;, as the Kalinago were once called). They lived throughout north-eastern South America, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, Dominica, and possibly the southern Leeward Islands. Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland peoples who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the Igneri. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Kalinago language appears not to have been Cariban, but like that of their neighbors, the Taíno. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland peoples migrated to the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.

In the early colonial period, the Kalinago had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands. According to the tales of Spanish conquistadors, the Kalinago were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh, although this is considered by the community to be an offensive myth. There is no hard evidence of Caribs eating human flesh, though one historian points out it might have been seldomly done as means of taunting or even frightening their Arawak enemies. The Kalinago and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of Dominica. The Garifuna, who share common ancestry with the Kalinago, also live principally in Central America.

==Name==

The exonym &quot;Caribe&quot; was first recorded by Christopher Columbus. One hypothesis for the origin of &quot;Carib&quot; is that it means &quot;brave warrior&quot;. Its variants, including the English word &quot;Carib&quot;, were then adopted by other European languages. Early Spanish explorers and administrators used the terms &quot;Arawak&quot; and &quot;Caribs&quot; to distinguish the peoples of the Caribbean, with &quot;Carib&quot; reserved for Indigenous groups that they considered hostile and &quot;Arawak&quot; for groups that they considered friendly.

The Kalinago language endonyms are &quot;Karifuna&quot; (singular) and &quot;Kalinago&quot; (plural). The name was officially changed from &#x27;Carib&#x27; to &#x27;Kalinago&#x27; in Dominica in 2015.

==History==
William F. Keegan and Corinne L. Hofman have outlined two major models for the origin of the Kalinago. The traditional account, which is almost as old as Columbus, says that the Caribs were a warlike people who were moving up the Lesser Antilles and displacing the original inhabitants. Early missionary texts suggested the original inhabitants of the islands were the Igneri, while the Kalinago were invaders originating in South America (home to the mainland Caribs or Kalina) who conquered and displaced the Igneri. As this tradition was widespread in oral testimonies, and internally consistent, it was accepted as historical by Europeans.

The second model proposes that the Kalinago developed out of the indigenous peoples of the Antilles. While the Caribs were commonly believed to have migrated from the Orinoco River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 CE, an analysis of ancient DNA suggests that the Caribs had a common origin with contemporary groups in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. The transition from Igneri to Island Carib culture may have occurred around 1450.

Archaeological evidence in support of either model is sparse, with &quot;no confirmed Carib sites [known] prior to the 1990s.&quot; However, Cayo-style pottery found in the Lesser Antilles, and dated between 1000 and 1500, is similar to the Koriabo complex from which the mainland Carib or Kari&#x27;na pottery tradition is descended. Cayo pottery was once thought to have preceded Suazoid pottery (associated with the Igneri) in the Lesser Antilles, but more recent scholarship suggests that Cayo pottery gradually replaced Suazoid pottery in the islands. Cayo-style pottery has been found in the Lesser Antilles from Grenada to Basse-Terre, and, possibly, Saint Kitts. Cayo pottery also shows similarities to the Meillacoid and Chicoid styles of the Greater Antilles, as well as to the South American Koriabo style.

===Arrival of Columbus===

Upon his arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Maipurean-speaking Taínos reportedly told Christopher Columbus that Caribs were fierce warriors and cannibals, who made frequent raids on the Taínos, often capturing women. According to Columbus, the Taínos said the Caribs had spent the last two centuries displacing the Taínos by warfare, extermination, and assimilation.

The French missionary Raymond Breton arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, and lived in Guadeloupe and Dominica until 1653. He took ethnographic and linguistic notes on the native peoples of these islands, including St. Vincent, which he visited briefly. Breton was responsible for many of the early stereotypes about Kalinago.

Later, the Kalinago occasionally allied with the Taínos to repel European invaders. When the Spanish attempted to colonize Puerto Rico, Kalinago from St. Croix arrived to aid the local Taíno. Daguao village, initially slated to be the Europeans&#x27; new capital, was destroyed by Taínos from the eastern area of Puerto Rico, with the support of Kalinago from neighboring Vieques. By the middle of the 16th century, the resistance of Taínos and Kalinago alike was largely quashed across the Greater Antilles. The survivors were enslaved to work in agriculture or mining.

The Kalinagos were more successful in repelling the Spanish—and later the French and English—in the Lesser Antilles, retaining their independence. The lack of gold in the area and the large numbers of casualties inflicted upon the Spanish contributed to their survival.

===Resistance to the English and the French===

In the seventeenth century, the Kalinago regularly attacked the plantations of the English and the French in the Leeward Islands. In the 1630s, planters from the Leewards conducted campaigns against the Kalinago, but with limited success. The Kalinago took advantage of divisions between the Europeans, to provide support to the French and the Dutch during wars in the 1650s, consolidating their independence as a result. Such wars led to a geopolitical boundary separating the Lesser Antilles, inhabited by the Kalinago, from the Greater Antilles, inhabited by the Taíno. This boundary became known as the &quot;poison arrow curtain&quot;.

In 1660, France and England signed the &quot;Treaty of Saint Charles&quot; with Island Caribs. It stipulated that the Kalinago would evacuate all the Lesser Antilles except for Dominica and Saint Vincent, which were recognised as reserves. However, the English later ignored the treaty, and pursue a campaign against the Kalinago in succeeding decades. Between the 1660s and 1700, the English waged an intermittent campaign against the Kalinago.

By 1763, the British had annexed St Lucia, Tobago, Dominica and St Vincent. On Saint Vincent the Kalinago intermarried with runaway slaves, forming the ‘Black Caribs’ or Garifuna who were expelled to Honduras in 1797. The British colonial use of the term &quot;Black Carib&quot;, particularly in William Young&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Black Charaibs&quot; (1795), has been described in modern historiography as framing the majority of the indigenous St. Vincent population as &quot;mere interlopers from Africa&quot; who lacked claims to land possession in St. Vincent. On Dominica the runaways formed distinct Maroon communities while the Caribs remained distinct. A remnant of these Caribs lives on in the Kalinago Territory.

==Kalinago people today==

, a small population of around 3,400 Kalinago survived in the Kalinago Territory in northeast Dominica, of whom some 70 &quot;defined themselves as &#x27;pure&#x27;&quot;. The Kalinago of Dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island&#x27;s rugged terrain. The island&#x27;s east coast includes a territory formerly known as the Carib Territory that was granted to the people by the British government in 1903. The Dominican Kalinago elect their own chief. In July 2003, the Kalinago observed 100 Years of Territory, and in July 2014, Charles Williams was elected Kalinago Chief, succeeding Chief Garnette Joseph.

Several hundred Carib descendants live in the U. S. Virgin Islands, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Trinidad and St. Vincent. &quot;Black Caribs,&quot; the descendants of the mixture of Africans live in St. Vincent whose total population is unknown. Some ethnic Carib communities remain on the American mainland, in countries such as Guyana and Suriname in South America, and Belize in Central America. The size of these communities varies widely.

During the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Island Carib population in St. Vincent was greater than that in Dominica. Both the Island Caribs (Yellow Caribs) and the Black Caribs (Garifuna) fought against the British during the Second Carib War. After the end of the war, the British deported the Garifuna (a population of 4,338) to Roatan Island, while the Island Caribs (whose population consisted of 80 people) were allowed to stay on St. Vincent. The 1812 eruption of La Soufrière destroyed the Carib territory, killing a majority of the Yellow Caribs. After the eruption, 130 Yellow Caribs and 59 Black Caribs survived on St. Vincent. Unable to recover from the damage caused by the eruption, 120 of the Yellow Caribs, under Captain Baptiste, emigrated to Trinidad. In 1830, the Carib population numbered less than 100. The population made a remarkable recovery after that, although almost the entire tribe died out during the 1902 eruption of La Soufrière.

==Culture and society==
===Canoes===
Canoes are a significant aspect of the Kalinago&#x27;s material culture and economy. They are used for transport from the southern continent and islands of the Caribbean, as well as providing them with the ability to fish more efficiently and to grow their fishing industry. Canoes, constructed from the Burseraceae, &quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, and &quot;Hymenaea courbaril&quot; trees, serve different purposes depending on their height and thickness of the bark. The &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; tree is not only functional but spiritual and believed to house spirits that would become angered if disturbed. Canoes have been used throughout the history of the Kalinago and have become a renewed interest within the manufacturing of traditional dugout canoes used for inter-island transportation and fishing.

In 1997 Dominica Carib artist Jacob Frederick and Tortola artist Aragorn Dick Read set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in Dominica, Guadeloupe and Martinique. They launched a voyage by canoe to the Orinoco delta to meet up with the local Kalinago tribes, re-establishing cultural connections with the remaining Kalinago communities along the island chain, documented by the BBC in &quot;The Quest of the Carib Canoe&quot;.

===Language===

Historically, scholars assumed that Island Carib men and women spoke different languages. To explain this phenomenon, scholars proposed that the Island Caribs may have killed the men and kept the women, allowing the Igneri language to survive among women. This assumption arose from the fact that by at least the early 17th century, Carib men spoke a Cariban-based pidgin language in addition to the usual Arawakan language used by both sexes. This was similar to pidgins used by mainland Caribs when communicating with their Arawak neighbors. Berend J. Hoff and Douglas Taylor hypothesized that it dated to the time of the Carib expansion through the islands, and that males maintained it to emphasize their origins on the mainland.

Linguistic analysis in the 20th century determined that the main Island Carib language was spoken by both sexes, and was Arawakan, not Cariban. Scholars adopted more nuanced theories to explain the transition from the earlier Igneri to the later Island Carib societies in the Antilles. Irving Rouse proposed that a relatively small scale Carib force conquered but did not displace the Igneri, and the invaders eventually took on the Igneri language while still maintaining their identity as Caribs. Other scholars such as Sued Badillo doubt there was an invasion at all, proposing that the Igneri adopted the &quot;Carib&quot; identity over time due to their close economic and political relations with the rising mainland Carib polity. Both theories accept that the historical Island Carib language developed from the existing tongue of the islands, and thus it is also known as Igneri.

===Medicine===
By the early twenty-first century, a combination of bush medicine and modern medicine was used by the Kalinago of Dominica. For example, various fruits and leaves are used to heal common ailments. For a sprain, oils from coconuts, snakes, and bay leaves are used to heal the injury. Formerly the Caribs used an extensive range of medicinal plant and animal products.

===Religion===
The Caribs are believed to have practiced polytheism. As the Spanish began to colonise the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism. The Caribs destroyed a church of Franciscans in Aguada, Puerto Rico and killed five of its members, in 1579.

Currently, the remaining Kalinago in Dominica practice parts of Catholicism through baptism of children. However, not all practice Christianity. Some Caribs worship their ancestors and believe them to have magical power over their crops.

==Representation==
In 1492, when Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the Maipurean-speaking Taínos reportedly relayed stories of the Caribs&#x27; war-like nature and cannibalism to him. When he arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, the French missionary Raymond Breton made ethnographic and linguistic notes on the &quot;Caribs&quot;, which also informed many of the early stereotypes about the Kalinago. Other missionaries, such as Cesar de Rochefort, would refute the common conception of the Caribs as cannibals.

===Cannibalism===
Early European accounts describe the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Arawak and other Amerindian groups such as the Carib and Tupinambá, though the exact accuracy of cannibalistic reports still remains debated without skeletal evidence to support it. Scholars such as Hilary McD. Beckles have instead suggested that the stories of &quot;vicious cannibals&quot; may have comprised an &quot;ideological campaign&quot; against the Kalinago to justify &quot;genocidal military expeditions&quot; by European colonizers.

The Island Carib word &quot;karibna&quot; meant &quot;person&quot;, although it became the origin of the English word &quot;cannibal&quot; after Columbus shared stories of flesh-eating Kalinago, apparently heard from their historic Taíno enemies. Among the Caribs, &quot;karibna&quot; was apparently associated with ritual eating of war enemies.

The Caribs reportedly had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses. Missionaries, such as Père Jean Baptiste Labat and Cesar de Rochefort, described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants. The Caribs have been described by their various enemies as vicious and violent raiders. Rochefort stated they did not practice cannibalism.

During his third voyage to North America in 1528, after exploring Florida, the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was killed and allegedly eaten by Carib natives on what is now Guadeloupe, near a place called &quot;Karukera&quot; (“island of beautiful waters”). Historian William Riviere has described most of the cannibalism as related to war rituals.

===Carib resistance===
Chief Kairouane and his men from Grenada jumped off the &quot;Leapers Hill&quot; rather than face slavery under the French invaders, serving as an iconic representation of the Kalinago spirit of resistance.

<text>The dime novel is a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of inexpensive paperbound editions. The term &quot;dime novel&quot; has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, &quot;thick book&quot; reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines. The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine &quot;Western Dime Novels&quot;. In the modern age, the term &quot;dime novel&quot; has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.

== History ==

In 1860, the publishers Erastus and Irwin Beadle released a new series of cheap paperbacks, &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Dime Novels&quot;. &quot;Dime novel&quot; became a general term for similar paperbacks produced by various publishers in the early twentieth century. The first book in the Beadle series was &quot;Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter&quot;, by Ann S. Stephens, dated June 9, 1860. The novel was essentially a reprint of Stephens&#x27;s earlier serial, which had appeared in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Companion&quot; magazine in February, March and April 1839. It sold more than 65,000 copies in the first few months after its publication as a dime novel. Dime novels varied in size, even in the first Beadle series, but were mostly about , with 100 pages. The first 28 were published without a cover illustration, in a salmon-colored paper wrapper. A woodblock print was added in issue 29, and the first 28 were reprinted with illustrated covers. The books were priced, of course, at ten cents.

This series ran for 321 issues and established almost all the conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. Most of the stories were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources, but many were original stories.

As the popularity of dime novels increased, original stories came to be the norm. The books were reprinted many times, sometimes with different covers, and the stories were often further reprinted in different series and by different publishers.

The literacy rate increased around the time of the American Civil War, and &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Dime Novels&quot; were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle &amp; Adams had their own alternate &quot;brands&quot;, such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term &quot;dime novel&quot; came to refer to any form of cheap, sensational fiction, rather than the specific format.

Nonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, and other adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s thesis in &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835) says that in democratic and socially permeable societies, like that of the U.S., the lower classes were not &quot;naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies.&quot; He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a &quot;sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people.&quot; According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for reading matter. Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which &quot;may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages ... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste.&quot; Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.

=== Prices ===
Adding to the general confusion as to what is or is not a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten (a dime) to fifteen cents. Beadle &amp; Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, there were a number of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include &quot;Bunce&#x27;s Ten Cent Novels&quot;, &quot;Brady&#x27;s Mercury Stories&quot;, &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Dime Novels&quot;, Irwin P. Beadle&#x27;s &quot;Ten Cent Stories&quot;, &quot;Munro&#x27;s Ten Cent Novels&quot;, &quot;Dawley&#x27;s Ten Penny Novels&quot;, &quot;Fireside Series&quot;, &quot;Chaney&#x27;s Union Novels&quot;,&quot; DeWitt&#x27;s Ten Cent Romances&quot;, &quot;Champion Novels&quot;, &quot;Frank Starr&#x27;s American Novels&quot;, &quot;Ten Cent Novelettes&quot;, &quot;Richmond&#x27;s Sensation Novels&quot;, and &quot;Ten Cent Irish Novels&quot;.

In 1874, Beadle &amp; Adams added the novelty of color to the covers when their &quot;New Dime Novels&quot; series replaced the flagship title. The &quot;New Dime Novels&quot; were issued with a dual numbering system on the cover, one continuing the numbering from the first series and the second and more prominent one indicating the number in the current series; for example, the first issue was numbered 1 (322). The stories were mostly reprints from the first series. Like its predecessor, Beadle&#x27;s &quot;New Dime Novels&quot; ran for 321 issues, until 1885.

=== Development ===
Much of the content of dime novels came from story papers, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to full-size newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included &quot;The Saturday Journal&quot;, &quot;Young Men of America&quot;, &quot;Golden Weekly&quot;, &quot;Golden Hours&quot;, &quot;Good News&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Most of the stories in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series characters began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original Frank Reade stories first appeared in &quot;Boys of New York&quot;. The Old Sleuth, appearing in &quot;The Fireside Companion&quot; story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character to use the word &quot;sleuth&quot; to denote a detective, the word&#x27;s original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of the use of the word &quot;old&quot; in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. Nick Carter first appeared in 1886 in the &quot;New York Weekly&quot;. Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.

=== Changing formats ===
In 1873, the house of Beadle &amp; Adams introduced a new ten-cent format, , with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title &quot;New and Old Friends&quot;. It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with &quot;The Fireside Library&quot; and &quot;Frank Starr&#x27;s New York Library&quot;. The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly &quot;libraries&quot;. These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10 inches (&quot;The Boy&#x27;s Star Library&quot; is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (&quot;New York Detective Library&quot;). The &quot;Old Cap Collier Library&quot; was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, and many of them were devoted to a single character. Frontier stories, evolving into westerns, were still popular, but the new vogue tended to urban crime stories. One of the most successful titles, Frank Tousey&#x27;s &quot;New York Detective Library&quot; eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.

The competition was fierce, and publishers were always looking for an edge. Once again, color came into play when Frank Tousey introduced a weekly with brightly colored covers in 1896. Street &amp; Smith countered by issuing a weekly in a smaller format with muted colors. Such titles as &quot;New Nick Carter Weekly&quot; (continuing the original black-and-white &quot;Nick Carter Library&quot;), &quot;Tip-Top Weekly&quot; (introducing Frank Merriwell) and others were 7 x 10 inches with thirty-two pages of text, but the 8.5 x 11 Tousey format carried the day, and Street &amp; Smith soon followed suit. The price was also dropped to five cents, making the magazines more accessible to children. This would be the last major permutation of the product before it evolved into pulp magazines. Ironically, for many years it has been the nickel weeklies that most people refer to when using the term &quot;dime novel&quot;.

The nickel weeklies were popular, and their numbers grew quickly. Frank Tousey and Street &amp; Smith dominated the field. Tousey had his &quot;big six&quot;: &quot;Work and Win&quot; (featuring Fred Fearnot, a serious rival to the soon-to-be-popular Frank Merriwell), &quot;Secret Service&quot;, &quot;Pluck and Luck&quot;, &quot;Wild West Weekly&quot;, &quot;Fame and Fortune Weekly&quot;, and &quot;The Liberty Boys of &#x27;76&quot;, each of which issued over a thousand copies weekly. Street &amp; Smith had &quot;New Nick Carter Weekly&quot;, &quot;Tip Top Weekly&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill Stories&quot;, &quot;Jesse James Stories&quot;, &quot;Brave &amp; Bold Weekly&quot; and many others. The Tousey stories were generally the more lurid and sensational of the two.

Perhaps the most confusing of the various formats lumped together under the term &quot;dime novel&quot; are the so-called &quot;thick-book&quot; series, most of which were published by Street &amp; Smith, J. S. Ogilvie and Arthur Westbrook. These books were published in series, contained roughly 150 to 200 pages, and were , often with color covers on a higher-grade stock. They reprinted multiple stories from the five- and ten-cent weeklies, often slightly rewritten to tie them together.

All dime-novel publishers were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street &amp; Smith excelled at it. They developed the practice of publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the &quot;New Magnet Library&quot;. The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the &quot;Medal, New Medal&quot; and &quot;Merriwell&quot; libraries, Buffalo Bill in the &quot;Buffalo Bill Library&quot; and &quot;Far West Library&quot;, and so on. The thick books were still in print as late as the 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously assume they have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.

=== Demise ===
In 1896, Frank Munsey had converted his juvenile magazine &quot;Argosy&quot; into a fiction magazine for adults, the first of the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off. In 1910, Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, &quot;New Tip Top Weekly&quot; and &quot;Top Notch Magazine&quot;, into pulps; in 1915, &quot;Nick Carter Stories&quot;, itself a replacement for the &quot;New Nick Carter Weekly&quot;, became &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;, and in 1919, &quot;New Buffalo Bill Weekly&quot; became &quot;Western Story Magazine&quot;. Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably &quot;Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune&quot; and &quot;Wild West Weekly&quot;. These two series were purchased by Street &amp; Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.

<text>Mauricio Raúl Kagel (; 24 December 1931 – 18 September 2008) was an Argentine-German composer and academic teacher.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Mauricio Raúl Kagel was born on 24 December 1931 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled Russia in the 1920s. He studied music, history of literature, and philosophy in Buenos Aires. In 1957 he moved to Cologne, West Germany, where he lived until his death.

===As teacher===
From 1960–66 and 1972–76 Kagel taught at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. He also taught from 1964–65 at the University at Buffalo as the visiting Slee Professor of music theory. At the Berlin Film and Television Academy he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in Gothenburg and Cologne. He was professor for new music theatre at the Köln Hochschule from 1974–97.

Among his students were Moya Henderson, Kevin Volans, Maria de Alvear, Carola Bauckholt, Branimir Krstić, David Sawer, , Juan Maria Solare, Norma Tyer, Gerald Barry, Martyn Harry, and Chao-Ming Tung. &quot;&quot;

===As composer===

Some of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, or to physically interact with other performers. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the theatre of the absurd. He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society. He was also active in the fields of film and photography. In 1991 Kagel was invited by Walter Fink to be the second composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 2000 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.

==Music==

&quot;Staatstheater&quot; (1970) remains, probably, Kagel&#x27;s best-known work. He described it as a &quot;ballet for non-dancers&quot;, although it is in many ways more like an opera; the devices it uses as musical instruments include chamber pots and enema equipment.

Similar is the radio play &quot;Ein Aufnahmezustand&quot; (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In &quot;Con voce&quot; (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. &quot;Match&quot; (1964) is a &quot;tennis game&quot; for cellists with a percussionist as umpire, also the subject of one of Kagel&#x27;s films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre.

Kagel also wrote a large number of more conventional orchestral and chamber pieces. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt.

==Films==
Kagel also made films, with one of the best known being &quot;Ludwig van&quot; (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of Beethoven&#x27;s music made during the bicentenary of that composer&#x27;s birth. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven&#x27;s studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the Beethoven House in Bonn. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven&#x27;s pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a piano playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the &quot;Beethoven Year 1770&quot;. Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film—the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing pianist.

<text>The Sumerian King List (abbreviated SKL) or Chronicle of the One Monarchy is an ancient literary composition written in Sumerian that was likely created and redacted to legitimize the claims to power of various city-states and kingdoms in southern Mesopotamia during the late third and early second millennium BC. It does so by repetitively listing Sumerian cities, the kings that ruled there, and the lengths of their reigns. Especially in the early part of the list, these reigns often span thousands of years. In the oldest known version, dated to the Ur III period () but probably based on Akkadian source material, the &quot;SKL&quot; reflected a more linear transition of power from Kish, the first city to receive kingship, to Akkad. In later versions from the Old Babylonian period, the list consisted of a large number of cities between which kingship was transferred, reflecting a more cyclical view of how kingship came to a city, only to be inevitably replaced by the next. In its best-known and best-preserved version, as recorded on the Weld-Blundell Prism, the &quot;SKL&quot; begins with a number of fictional antediluvian kings, who ruled before a flood swept over the land, after which kingship went to Kish. It ends with a dynasty from Isin (early second millennium BC), which is well-known from other contemporary sources.

The &quot;SKL&quot; is preserved in several versions, the first fragement of which was published in 1906 by Hermann Volrath Hilprecht, and the second in 1911 by Jean-Vincent Scheil. Most of these date to the Old Babylonian period, but the oldest version of the SKL dates back to the Ur III period. The clay tablets on which the &quot;SKL&quot; was recorded were generally found on sites in southern Mesopotamia. These versions differ in their exact content; some sections are missing, others are arranged in a different order, names of kings may be absent or the lengths of their reigns may vary. These differences are both the result of copying errors, and of deliberate editorial decisions to change the text to fit current needs.

In the past, the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; was considered as an invaluable source for the reconstruction of the political history of Early Dynastic Mesopotamia. More recent research has indicated that the use of the &quot;SKL&quot; is fraught with difficulties, and that it should only be used with caution, if at all, in the study of ancient Mesopotamia during the third and early second millennium BC.

== Naming conventions ==
The text is best known under its modern name &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, which is often abbreviated to &quot;SKL&quot; in scholarly literature. A less-used name is the &quot;Chronicle of the One Monarchy&quot;, reflecting the notion that, according to this text, there could ever be only one city exercising kingship over Mesopotamia. In contemporary sources, the &quot;SKL&quot; was called after its first word: &quot;nam-lugal&quot;, or &quot;kingship&quot;. It should also be noted that what is commonly referred to as the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, is in reality not a single text. Rather, it is a literary composition of which different versions existed through time in which sections were missing, arranged in a different order, and names, reigns and details on kings were different or absent.

Modern scholarship has used numbered dynasties to refer to the uninterrupted rule of a single city; hence the Ur III dynasty denotes the third time that the city of Ur assumed hegemony over Mesopotamia according to the &quot;SKL&quot;. This numbering (e.g. Kish I, Uruk IV, Ur III) is not present in the original text. It should also be noted that the modern usage of the term dynasty, i.e. a sequence of rulers from a single family, does not necessarily apply to ancient Mesopotamia. Even though the &quot;SKL&quot; points out that some rulers were family, it was the city, rather than individual rulers, to which kingship was given.

==Sources==

The &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; is known from a number of different sources, all in the form of clay tablets or cylinders and written in Sumerian. At least 16 different tablets or fragments containing parts of the composition are known. Some tablets are unprovenanced, but most have been recovered, or are known to have come from various sites across Mesopotamia, the majority coming from Nippur. So far a version of the &quot;SKL&quot; has been found outside of Babylonia only twice. One copy was found at Susa in Elam. The other, found at Tell Leilan in Upper Mesopotamia, contains the only clean copy of the Mari list which is badly broken in other rescensions.

There is only one manuscript that contains a relatively undamaged version of the composition. This is the Weld-Blundell Prism which includes the antediluvian part of the composition and ends with the Isin dynasty. Other manuscripts are incomplete because they are damaged or fragmentary. The Scheil dynastic tablet, from Susa, for example, only contains parts of the composition running from Uruk II to Ur III. Given the state of the SKL sources literary compositions like the Tummal Chronicle and the Ballad of the Early Rulers are used as input as well.

The majority of the sources are dated to the Old Babylonian period (early second millennium BC), and more specifically the early part of that era. In many cases, a more precise dating is not possible, but in one case, the Weld-Blundell prism, it could be dated to year 11 of the reign of king Sin-Magir of Isin, the last ruler to be mentioned in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. The so-called &quot;Ur III Sumerian King List&quot; (&quot;USKL&quot;), on a clay tablet possibly found in Adab, is the only known version of the &quot;SKL&quot; that predates the Old Babylonian period. The colophon of this text mentions that it was copied during the reign of Shulgi (2084–2037 BC), the second king of the Ur III dynasty. The &quot;USKL&quot; is especially interesting because its pre-Sargonic part is completely different from that of the &quot;SKL&quot;. Whereas the &quot;SKL&quot; records many different dynasties from several cities, the &quot;USKL&quot; starts with a single long list of rulers from Kish (including rulers who, in the &quot;SKL&quot; were part of different Kish dynasties), followed by a few other dynasties, followed again by the kings of Akkad.

== Contents ==

The sources differ in their exact contents. This is not only the result of many sources being fragmentary, it is also the result of scribal errors made during copying of the composition, and of the fact that changes were made to the composition through time. For example, the section on rulers before the flood is not present in every copy of the text, including every text from Nippur, where the majority of versions of the &quot;SKL&quot; were found. Also, the order of some of the dynasties or kings may be changed between copies, some dynasties that were separately mentioned in one version are taken together in another, details on the lengths of individual reigns vary, and individual kings may be left out entirely.

The following summary and line numbers are taken from the compilation by the &quot;Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature&quot;, which in turn takes the text of the Weld-Blundell prism as its main source, listing other versions when there are differences in the text.

=== Lines 1–39: before the flood ===
This section, which is not present in every copy of the text, opens with the line &quot;After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridu.&quot; Two kings of Eridu are mentioned, before the city &quot;fell&quot; and the &quot;kingship was taken to Bad-tibira&quot;. This pattern of cities receiving kingship and then falling or being defeated, only to be succeeded by the next, is present throughout the entire text, often in the exact same words. This first section lists eight kings who ruled over five cities (apart from Eridu and Bad-tibira, these also included Larag, Zimbir and Shuruppak). The duration of each reign is also given. In this first section, the reigns vary between 43,200 and 28,800 years for a total of 241,200 years. The section ends with the line &quot;Then the flood swept over&quot;. Among the kings mentioned in this section is the ancient Mesopotamian god Dumuzid (the later Tammuz).

=== Lines 40–265: first dynasty of Kish to Lugal-zage-si ===
&quot;After the flood had swept over, and the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish.&quot; After this well-known line, the section goes on to list 23 kings of Kish, who ruled between 1500 and 300 years for a total of 24,510 years. The exact number of years varies between copies. Apart from the lengths of their reigns and whether they were the son of their predecessor (for example, &quot;Mashda, the son of Atab, ruled for 840 years&quot;), no other details are usually given on the exploits of these kings. Exceptions are Etana, &quot;who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries&quot; and Enmebaragesi, &quot;who made the land of Elam submit&quot;. Enmebaragesi is also the first king in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; whose name is attested from contemporaneous (Early Dynastic I) inscriptions. His successor Aga of Kish, the final king mentioned before Kish fell and kingship was taken to E-ana, also appears in the poem Gilgamesh and Aga.

The next lines, up until Sargon of Akkad, show a steady succession of cities and kings, usually without much detail beyond the lengths of the individual reigns. Every entry is structured exactly the same: the city where kingship is located is named, followed by one or more kings and how long they reigned, followed by a summary and a final line indicating where kingship went next. Lines 134–147 may serve as an example:In Ur, Mesannepada became king; he ruled for 80 years. Meskiagnun, the son of Mesannepada, became king; he ruled for 36 years. Elulu ruled for 25 years. Balulu ruled for 36 years. 4 kings; they ruled for 171 years. Then Ur was defeated and the kingship was taken to Awan.Individual reigns vary in length, from 1200 years for Lugalbanda of Uruk, to six years for another king of Uruk and several kings of Akshak. On average, the number of regnal years decreases down the list. Some city names, such as Uruk, Ur and Kish, appear more than once in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. The earlier part of this section mentions several kings who are also known from other literary sources. These kings include Dumuzid the Fisherman and Gilgamesh, although virtually no king from the earlier part of this section appears in inscriptions dating from the actual period in which they were supposed to live. Lines 211–223 describe a dynasty from Mari, which is a city outside Sumer proper but which played an important role in Mesopotamian history during the late third and early second millennia BC. The following third dynasty of Kish consists of a single ruler Kug-Bau (&quot;the woman tavern keeper&quot;), thought to be the only queen listed in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. The final two dynasties of this section, the fourth of Kish and the third of Uruk, provide a link to the next section. Sargon of Akkad is mentioned in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; as cup-bearer to Ur-zababa of Kish, and he defeated Lugal-zage-si of Uruk before founding his own dynasty.

=== Lines 266–377: Akkad to Isin ===
This section is devoted to the well-known Akkadian ruler Sargon and his successors. After the entry on Shar-kali-sharri, the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; reads &quot;Then who was king? Who was not king?&quot;, suggesting a period of chaos that may reflect the uncertain times during which the Akkadian Empire came to an end. Four kings are mentioned to have ruled for a total of only three years. Of the Akkadian kings mentioned after Shar-kali-sharri, only the names of Dudu and Shu-turul have been attested in inscriptions dating from the Akkadian period. The Akkadian dynasty is succeeded by the fourth dynasty of Uruk, two kings of which, Ur-nigin and his son Ur-gigir, appear in other contemporary inscriptions. Kingship was then taken to the &quot;land&quot; or &quot;army&quot; of Gutium, of which it was said that at first they had no kings and that they ruled themselves for a few years. After this short episode, 21 Gutian kings are listed before the fall of Gutium and kingship was taken to Uruk. Only one ruler is listed during this period of kingship (Utu-hegal), before it moved on to Ur. The so-called Third Dynasty of Ur consisted of 5 kings who ruled between 9 and 46 years. No other details of their exploits are given. The &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; remarks that, after the rule of Ur was abolished, &quot;The very foundation of Sumer was torn out&quot;, after which kingship was taken to Isin. The kings of Isin are the final dynasty that is included in the list. The dynasty consisted of 14 kings who ruled between 3 and 33 years. As with the Ur III dynasty, no details are given on the reigns of individual kings.

=== Lines 378–431: summary ===
Some versions of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; conclude with a summary of the dynasties after the flood. In this summary, the number of kings and their accumulated regnal years are mentioned for each city, as well as the number of times that city had received kingship: &quot;A total of 12 kings ruled for 396 years, 3 times in Urim.&quot; The final line again tallies the numbers for all these dynasties: &quot;There are 11 cities, cities in which the kingship was exercised. A total of 134 kings, who altogether ruled for 28876 + X years.&quot;

== Discussion ==
 has observed that, with the exception of the Epic of Gilgamesh, there might not be a single cuneiform text with as much &quot;name recognition&quot; as the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. The &quot;SKL&quot; might also be among the compositions that have fuelled the most intense debate and controversy among academia. These debates generally focused on when, where and why it was created, and if and how the text can be used in the reconstruction of the political history of Mesopotamia during the third and second millennia BC.

=== Dating, redaction and purpose ===

All but one of the surviving versions of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; date to the Old Babylonian period, i.e. the early part of the second millennium BC. One version, the &quot;Ur III Sumerian King List&quot; (&quot;USKL&quot;) dates to the reign of Shulgi (2084–2037 BC). By carefully comparing the different versions, especially the &quot;USKL&quot; with the much later Old Babylonian versions of the &quot;SKL&quot;, it has been shown that the composition that is now known as the &quot;SKL&quot; was probably first created in the Sargonic period in a form very similar to the &quot;USKL&quot;. It has even been suggested that this precursor of the &quot;SKL&quot; was not written in Sumerian, but in Akkadian. The original contents of the &quot;USKL&quot;, especially the pre-Sargonic part, were probably significantly altered only after the Ur III period, as a reaction to the societal upheaval that resulted from the disintegration of the Ur III state at the end of the third millennium BC. This altering of the composition meant that the original long, uninterrupted list of kings of Kish was cut up in smaller dynasties (e.g. Kish I, Kish II, and so forth), and that other dynasties were inserted. The result was the &quot;SKL&quot; as it is known from Old Babylonian manuscripts such as the Weld-Blundell prism. The cyclical change of kingship from one city to the next became a so-called &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, or recurring theme, in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;.

It has been generally accepted that the main aim was not to provide a historiographical record of the political landscape of ancient Mesopotamia. Instead, it has been suggested that the &quot;SKL&quot;, in its various redactions, was used by contemporary rulers to legitimize their claims to power over Babylonia. Steinkeller has argued that the &quot;SKL&quot; was first created during the Akkad dynasty to position Akkad as a direct heir to the hegemony of Kish. Thus, it would make sense to present the predecessors to the Akkadian kings as a long, unbroken line of rulers from Kish. In this way the Akkadian dynasty could legitimize its claims to power over Babylonia by arguing that, from the earliest times onwards, there had always been a single city where kingship was exercised. Later rulers then used the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; for their own political purposes, amending and adding to the text as they saw fit. This is why, for example, the version recorded on the Weld-Blundell prism ends with the Isin dynasty, suggesting that it was now their turn to rule over Mesopotamia as the rightful inheritors of the Ur III legacy. The use of the &quot;SKL&quot; as political propaganda may also explain why some versions, including the older &quot;USKL&quot;, did not contain the antediluvian part of the list. In its original form, the list started with the hegemony of Kish. Some city-states may have been uncomfortable with the preeminent position of Kish. By inserting a section of primordial kings who ruled before a flood, which is only known from some Old Babylonian versions, the importance of Kish could be downplayed.

=== Reliability as a historical source ===
During much of the 20th century, many scholars accepted the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; as a historical source of great importance for the reconstruction of the political history of Mesopotamia, despite the problems associated with the text. For example, many scholars have observed that the kings in the early part of the list reigned for unnaturally long time spans. Various approaches have been offered to reconcile these long reigns with a historical time line in which reigns would fall within reasonable human bounds, and with what is known from the archaeological record as well as other textual sources. Thorkild Jacobsen argued in his major 1939 study of the &quot;SKL&quot; that, in principle, all rulers mentioned in the list should be considered historical because their names were taken from older lists that were kept for administrative purposes and could therefore be considered reliable. His solution to the reigns considered too long, then, was to argue that &quot;[t]heir occurrence in our material must be ascribed to a tendency known also among other peoples of antiquity to form very exaggerated ideas of the length of human life in the earliest times of which they were conscious.&quot; In order to create a fixed chronology where individual kings could be absolutely dated, Jacobsen replaced time spans considered too long with average reigns of 20–30 years. For example, Etana ruled for 1500 years according to the &quot;SKL&quot;, but instead Jacobsen assumed a reign of circa 30 years. In this manner, and by working backwards from reigns whose dates could be independently established by other means, Jacobsen was able to fit all pre-Sargonic kings in a chronology consistent with the dates that were at that time (1939) accepted for the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia. Jacobsen has been criticised for putting too much faith in the reliability of the king list, for making wishful reconstructions and readings of incomplete parts of the list, for ignoring inconsistencies between the &quot;SKL&quot; and other textual evidence, and for ignoring the fact that only very few of the pre-Sargonic rulers have been attested in contemporaneous (i.e. Early Dynastic) inscriptions.

Others have attempted to reconcile the reigns in the &quot;Sumerian&quot; &quot;King List&quot; by arguing that many time spans were actually consciously invented, mathematically derived numbers. Rowton, for example, observed that a majority of the reigns in the Gutian dynasty were 5, 6, or 7 years in length. In the sexagesimal system used at that time, &quot;about 6 years&quot; would be the same as &quot;about 10 years&quot; in a decimal system (i.e. a general round number). This was sufficient evidence for him to conclude that at least these figures were completely artificial. The longer time spans from the first part of the list could also be argued to be artificial: various reigns were multiples of 60 (e.g. Jushur reigned for 600 years, Puannum ruled for 840 years) while others were squares (e.g. Ilku reigned for 900 years (square of 30) while Meshkiangasher ruled for 324 years (square of 18)).

During the last few decades, scholars have taken a more careful approach. For example, many recent handbooks on the archaeology and history of ancient Mesopotamia all acknowledge the problematic nature of the &quot;SKL&quot; and warn that the list&#x27;s use as a historical document for that period is severely limited up to the point that it should not be used at all. It has been argued, for example, that the omission of certain cities in the list which were known to have been important at the time, such as Lagash and Larsa, was deliberate. Furthermore, the fact that the &quot;SKL&quot; adheres to a strict sequential ordering of kingships which were considered equal means that it does no justice at all to the actual complexities of Mesopotamian political history where different reigns overlapped, or where different rulers or cities were not equally powerful. Recent studies on the &quot;SKL&quot; even go so far as to discredit the composition as a valuable historical source on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia altogether. Important arguments to dismiss the &quot;SKL&quot; as a reliable and valuable source are its nature as a political, ideological text, its long redactional history, and the fact that out of the many pre-Sargonic kings listed, only seven have been attested in contemporary Early Dynastic inscriptions. The final volume on the history and philology of third millennium BC Mesopotamia of the ESF-funded ARCANE-project (Associated Regional Chronologies for the Ancient Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean), for example, did not list any of the pre-Sargonic rulers from the &quot;SKL&quot; in its chronological tables unless their existence was corroborated by Early Dynastic inscriptions.

Thus, in the absence of independent sources from the Early Dynastic period itself, the pre-Sargonic part of the &quot;SKL&quot; must be considered fictional. Many of the rulers in the pre-Sargonic part (i.e. prior to Sargon of Akkad) of the list must therefore be considered as purely fictional or mythological characters to which reigns of hundreds of years were assigned. However, there is a small group of pre-Sargonic rulers in the &quot;SKL&quot; whose names have been attested in Early Dynastic inscriptions. This group consists of seven rulers: Enmebaragesi, Gilgamesh, Mesannepada, Meskiagnun, Elulu, Enshakushanna and Lugal-zage-si. It has also been shown that several kings did not rule sequentially as described by the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, but rather contemporaneously. Starting with the Akkadian rulers, but especially for the Ur III and Isin dynasties, the &quot;SKL&quot; becomes much more reliable. Not only are most of the kings attested in other contemporaneous documents, but the reigns attributed to them in the &quot;SKL&quot; are more or less in line with what can be established from those other sources. This is probably due to the fact that the compilers of the &quot;SKL&quot; could rely on lists of year names, which came in regular use during the Akkadian period. Other sources may have included votive and victory inscriptions.

However, while the &quot;SKL&quot; has little value for the study on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, it continues to be an important document for the study on the Sargonic to Old Babylonian periods. The &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; offers scholars a window into how Old Babylonian kings and scribes viewed their own history, how they perceived the concept of kingship, and how they could have used it to further their own goals. For example, it has been noted that the king list is unique among Sumerian compositions in there being no divine intervention in the process of dynastic change. Also, the style and contents of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; certainly influenced later compositions such as the &quot;Curse of Akkad&quot;, the &quot;Lamentation over Sumer and Akkad&quot;, later king lists such as the &quot;Assyrian King List&quot;, and the &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; by Berossus.

== Rulers in the Sumerian King List ==
Early dates are approximate, and are based on available archaeological data. For most of the pre-Akkadian rulers listed, the king list is itself the source of information. Beginning with Lugal-zage-si and the Third Dynasty of Uruk (which was defeated by Sargon of Akkad), a better understanding of how subsequent rulers fit into the chronology of the ancient Near East can be deduced. The short chronology is used here.

Antediluvian rulers

None of the following predynastic antediluvian rulers have been verified as historical by archaeological excavations, epigraphical inscriptions or otherwise. While there is no evidence they ever reigned as such, the Sumerians purported them to have lived in the mythical era before the great deluge.

The &quot;antediluvian&quot; reigns were measured in Sumerian numerical units known as &quot;sars&quot; (units of 3,600), &quot;ners&quot; (units of 600), and &quot;sosses&quot; (units of 60). Attempts have been made to map these numbers into more reasonable regnal lengths.

First dynasty of Kish

First rulers of Uruk

First dynasty of Ur


Dynasty of Awan
This was a dynasty from Elam.

Many rulers are known from Mari, but different names are mentioned in the Sumerian king list.
Third dynasty of Kish

Dynasty of Akshak

Fourth dynasty of Kish

Third dynasty of Uruk

Dynasty of Akkad

Fourth dynasty of Uruk
::(Possibly rulers of lower Mesopotamia contemporary with the Dynasty of Akkad)

The Second dynasty of Lagash (before c. 2093–2046 BC (short)) is not mentioned in the King List, though it is well known from inscriptions.

Gutian rule


Fifth dynasty of Uruk

Third dynasty of Ur

Dynasty of Isin

Independent Amorite states in lower Mesopotamia.
The Dynasty of Larsa (c. 1961–1674 BC (short)) from this period is not mentioned in the King List.

<doc id="65411" wikidata="Q520154" url="?curid=65411" title="Wired (magazine)">
<text>Wired is a bi-monthly American magazine, published in print and online editions, that focuses on how emerging technologies affect culture, the economy, and politics. Owned by Condé Nast, its editorial offices are in San Francisco, California, and its business office at Condé Nast headquarters in Liberty Tower in New York City. Wired has been in publication since its launch in January 1993. Several spin-offs have followed, including &quot;Wired UK&quot;, &quot;Wired Italia&quot;, &quot;Wired Japan&quot;, &quot;Wired Czech Republic and Slovakia&quot; and &quot;Wired Germany&quot;. The magazine was published monthly until 2024, when publishing switched to 6 issues a year.

From its beginning, the strongest influence on the magazine&#x27;s editorial outlook came from founding editor and publisher Louis Rossetto. In 1991, Rossetto and founding creative director John Plunkett created a 12-page &quot;Manifesto for a New Magazine&quot;, nearly all of whose ideas were realized in the magazine&#x27;s first several issues. During the five years of Rossetto&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s colophon credited Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan as its &quot;patron saint&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; went on to chronicle the evolution of digital technology and its impact on society.

&quot;Wired&quot; quickly became recognized as the voice of the emerging digital economy and culture and a pace setter in print design and web design. During its explosive growth in the mid-1990s, it articulated the values of a far-reaching &quot;digital revolution&quot; driven by the people creating and using digital technology and networks. It won the National Magazine Awards for General Excellence in its first year of publication, and others subsequently for both editorial and design. &quot;Adweek&quot; acknowledged &quot;Wired&quot; as its Magazine of the Decade in 2009. &quot;SF Gate&quot; called &quot;Wired&quot; &quot;the magazine that led the digital revolution&quot;.

From 1998 to 2006, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and &quot;Wired News&quot;, which publishes at &quot;Wired.com&quot;, had separate owners. However, &quot;Wired News&quot; remained responsible for republishing &quot;Wired&quot; magazine&#x27;s content online due to an agreement when Condé Nast purchased the magazine. In 2006, Condé Nast bought &quot;Wired News&quot; for $25 million, reuniting the magazine with its website.

&quot;Wired&quot;’s second editor Katrina Heron published Bill Joy&#x27;s &quot;Why the Future Doesn&#x27;t Need Us&quot;, breaking with Wired&#x27;s optimism to present a dystopian view of the technological future.

&quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s third editor, Chris Anderson is known for popularizing the term &quot;the long tail&quot;, as a phrase relating to a &quot;power law&quot;-type graph that helps to visualize the 2000s emergent new media business model. Anderson&#x27;s article for &quot;Wired&quot; on this paradigm related to research on power law distribution models carried out by Clay Shirky, specifically in relation to bloggers. Anderson widened the definition of the term in capitals to describe a specific point of view relating to what he sees as an overlooked aspect of the traditional market space that has been opened up by new media.

The magazine coined the term &quot;crowdsourcing&quot;, as well as its annual tradition of handing out Vaporware Awards, which recognize &quot;products, videogames, and other nerdy tidbits pitched, promised and hyped, but never delivered&quot;. In these same years, the magazine also published the story, written by Joshuah Bearman, that became the movie &quot;Argo&quot;. In more recent times, the publication became known for its deep investigative reporting, including a long story about Facebook—&quot;Inside the Two Years that Shook Facebook and the World&quot;—that became the publication&#x27;s most read article of the modern era. It was written by Fred Vogelstein and Nicholas Thompson, the latter of whom was the publication&#x27;s editor-in-chief and had also been the editor on the piece that became Argo.

==History==

The magazine was launched in 1993 by American expatriates Louis Rossetto and his life and business partner Jane Metcalfe. &quot;Wired&quot; was originally conceived in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, when they were working on &quot;Electric Word&quot;, a small, groundbreaking technology magazine that developed a global following because of its focus not just on hardware and software, but the people, companies, and ideas that were part of what they called the language industries. &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot; called it &quot;The Least Boring Computer Magazine in the World&quot;. This broader focus on the social, economic, and political issues surrounding technology became the core of the &quot;Wired&quot; editorial approach.

Initial funding for &quot;Wired&quot; was provided by Eckart Wintzen, a Dutch entrepreneur. His Origin software company extended a contract for advertising and bought the first 1000 subscribers. Rossetto and Metcalfe moved back to the United States to start &quot;Wired&quot;, finding the European Union not a cohesive enough media market to support a continent-wide publication.

Origin&#x27;s upfront payment was the seed capital which saw Rossetto and Metcalfe through 12 fruitless months of fundraising. They approached established computer and lifestyle publishers, as well as venture capitalists, and met constant rejection. The &quot;Wired&quot; business concept was a radical departure. Computer magazines carried no lifestyle advertising, and lifestyle magazines carried no computer advertising. And Wired&#x27;s target audience of “Digital Visionaries” was unknown.

&quot;Wired&quot;’s fundraising breakthrough came when they showed a prototype to Nicholas Negroponte, founder and head of the MIT Media Lab at the February 1992 TED Conference, which Richard Saul Wurman comped them to attend. Negroponte agreed to become the first investor in &quot;Wired,&quot; but even before he could write his check, software entrepreneur Charlie Jackson deposited the first investor money in the &quot;Wired&quot; account a few weeks later. Negroponte was to become a regular columnist for six years (through 1998), wrote the book &quot;Being Digital&quot;, and later founded One Laptop per Child.

By September 1992, &quot;Wired&quot; had rented loft space in the SoMa district of San Francisco off South Park and hired its first employees. As Editor and CEO, Rossetto oversaw content and business strategy, and Metcalfe, as President and COO, oversaw advertising, circulation, finance, and company operations. Kevin Kelly was executive editor, John Plunkett creative director, and John Battelle managing editor. John Plunkett&#x27;s wife and partner, Barbara Kuhr (Plunkett+Kuhr) later became the launch creative director of &quot;Wired&#x27;s&quot; website Hotwired. They were to remain with &quot;Wired&quot; through the first six years of publication, 1993–98.

Rossetto and Metcalfe were aided in starting &quot;Wired&quot; by Ian Charles Stewart, who helped write the original business plan, John Plunkett, who designed the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, Eugene Mosier, who provided production support to create the first prototype (and later became Art Director for Production), and Randy Stickrod, who provided Rossetto and Metcalfe refuge in his office on South Park when they first arrived in San Francisco. IDG&#x27;s George Clark arranged nationwide newsstand distribution. Associate publisher Kathleen Lyman joined Wired from News Corporation and Ziff Davis to execute on its ambition to attract both technology and lifestyle advertising, and delivered from the first issue. She and her protégé Simon Ferguson (&quot;Wired&quot;″s first advertising manager) landed pioneering campaigns by a diverse group of industry leaders such as Apple Computer, Intel, Sony, Calvin Klein, and Absolut. Lyman and Ferguson left in year two. Condé Nast veteran Dana Lyon then took over ad sales. Two years after they left Amsterdam, and nearly five years after they first started work on the business plan, Metcalfe and Rossetto and their initial band of twelve Wired Ones launched &quot;Wired&quot; as a quarterly on 6 January 1993 and first distributed it by hand at Macworld Expo in San Francisco and, later that week, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Copies arrived on newsstand two weeks later as Bill Clinton took office as President, with his Vice President Al Gore touting the Information Superhighway. Due to the work of John Battelle&#x27;s fiancée, ex-CBS producer Michelle Scileppi, feature pieces on &quot;Wired&quot;’s launch appeared on CNN and in &quot;The San Jose Mercury News&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines.

Circulation and advertising response was so strong that &quot;Wired&quot; went bi-monthly with its next issue, and monthly by September with the William Gibson cover story about Singapore called &quot;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&quot;, which was banned there. In January 1994, Advance Publications&#x27;s Condé Nast made a minority investment in Wired Ventures. And in April that year, &quot;Wired&quot; won its first National Magazine Award for General Excellence for its first year of publication. During Rossetto&#x27;s five years as editor, it would be nominated for General Excellence every year, win the design award in 1996, and a second General Excellence in 1997.

&quot;Wired&quot;’s founding executive editor, Kevin Kelly, had been an editor of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog, Co-Evolution Quarterly&quot;,  and the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;. He brought with him contributing writers from those publications. Six authors of the first &quot;Wired&quot; issue (1.1) had written for &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;, most notably Bruce Sterling (who was on the first cover) and Stewart Brand. Other contributors to &quot;Whole Earth&quot; who appeared in &quot;Wired&quot;, included William Gibson, who was also featured on &quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s cover in its first year.

&quot;Wired&quot; co-founder Rossetto claimed in his launch editorial that &quot;the Digital Revolution is whipping through our lives like a Bengali typhoon&quot;, a bold statement at the time, when there were no smart phones, web browsers, and less than 10 million users connected to the Internet around the world, barely half that in the United States. Bold also describes John Plunkett&#x27;s graphic design, and its use of fluorescents and metallics. Uniquely for magazines, &quot;Wired&quot; was printed on a new, state of the art, high-end, six color press normally used for annual reports.

The first issue covered interactive games, cell-phone hacking, digital special effects, digital libraries, an interview with Camille Paglia by Stewart Brand, digital surveillance, Bruce Sterling&#x27;s cover story about military simulations, and Karl Taro Greenfeld’s story on Japanese otaku. And while Wired was one of the first magazines to list the email addresses of its authors and contributors, the column by Nicholas Negroponte, while written in the style of an email message, surprisingly contained an obviously fake, non-standard email address.

That was remedied in the second issue. &quot;Wired&quot; first mentioned the World Wide Web in its third issue, after CERN put it in the public domain in April. Subsequently, &quot;Wired&quot; focused extensively on the networking explosion, carrying cover stories on Yahoo&#x27;s origin story, Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 50,000 word, epic essay on the laying of the fiber optic datalink from London to Japan, and Bill Gate&#x27;s media strategy for Microsoft.

On October 27, 1994, 20 months after its first issue, and following the introduction of the first graphic web browser Mosaic, Wired Ventures launched its &quot;Hotwired&quot; website, the first with original content and Fortune 500 advertising. Inventing the banner ad, Wired brought ATT, Volvo, MCI, Club Med and seven other companies to the web for the first time on websites built by Jonathan Nelson&#x27;s Organic Online. Among the launch crew of 12 was Jonathan Steuer, who led the group, Justin Hall, a pioneer blogger who ran his own successful site on the side, Howard Rheingold as executive editor, and Apache server co-creator Brian Behlendorf, who was webmaster.

Convinced the Web was the future of media, and using Condé Nast&#x27;s investment, &quot;Wired&quot; bet its future by quickly expanding Hotwired into a suite of websites to include Ask Dr. Weil, Rough Guides, extreme sports, even cocktails. In 1996, it introduced its search engine HotBot in partnership with Berkeley startup Inktomi. Hotwired pioneered many of the features and techniques that would go on to define online journalism and online content creation in general. The web was so new at the time, &quot;Wired&quot; hired forty engineers to write the code for its edit and ad serving software. By the end of 1995, Hotwired ranked sixth among all websites for revenue, ahead of ESPN, CNET, and CNN.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Wired&quot; is more than a successful magazine. Like Rolling Stone in the 60&#x27;s, it has become the totem of a major cultural movement.&quot;

With &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and Hotwired&#x27;s explosive growth, Wired expansion accelerated. By 1996, it had launched a book publishing division (HardWired), licensed a Japanese edition with Dohosha Publishing, created a British edition (&quot;Wired UK&quot;) in a joint venture with the Guardian newspaper, and had signed with Gruner and Jahr to do a German edition to be headquartered in Berlin. And it began work on Wired TV in partnership with MSNBC, as well as three new magazine titles: a shelter book called &quot;Neo&quot; to be edited by &quot;Wired&quot; Editor-At-Large Katrina Heron and designed by Rhonda Rubenstein; a business magazine called &quot;The New Economy&quot;; and a concept magazine with New York design star Tibor Kalman focusing on the countdown to the new millennium.

In 1996, reacting to the IPOs of web competitors Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, and Infoseek, Wired Ventures announced its own IPO. It selected the leading East Coast investment bank Goldman Sachs and the leading West Coast bank Robertson Stephens as co-leads, with Goldman managing. Scheduled to go out in June, the IPO was postponed when the market declined days before. When it finally went out in October, Goldman was unable to close the round following another market downturn, and Wired withdrew its IPO.

Fingerpointing followed. Some observers claimed the market rejected Wired&#x27;s $293 million &quot;internet valuation&quot;, as too rich for what was a traditional publishing company. Wired replied that its valuation was confirmed by savvy private investors who put $12.5 million into the company in May at just under the original offering stock price. They also argued that the offering price was set by the bankers, and was merited since it pioneered web media, and its revenue at Hotwired was greater than Yahoo when it went public at a higher valuation than Wired&#x27;s. For their part, Wired executives blamed Goldman for mismanaging their IPO, and then failing the company by not closing the round which already had investors booked. The Goldman executive who managed the IPO is quoted as saying &quot;Had the market not been so volatile, I believe the offering would have been quite successful.&quot;

Goldman&#x27;s failure left Wired Ventures cash-strapped. It turned to its current investor Tudor Investment Corporation. Tudor brought on Providence Equity Capital, concluding a private funding at the end of December 1996. Wired then proceeded to cut costs by focusing on its US magazine and web businesses, shutting its UK magazine, its book company, and its TV operation, and terminating work on new magazines. By June, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine was profitable. The web company, now rebranded Wired Digital, was growing. Wired execs wanted to try to go public again in 1998, catching what was to be the second runup in internet stocks which resulted in the 1999 dot-com bubble. In 1996, Wired Digital made up 7 percent of the company&#x27;s revenues, and in 1997 it pulled in 30 percent. The unit was expected to contribute about 40 percent of revenues in 1998.

Providence and Tudor had other plans, and hired Lazard Freres to shop the company. Rossetto and Metcalfe lost control of Wired Ventures in March 1998. The Street.com commented that a &quot;company that started out as one of the more promising bastions of the digital revolution lost control to old-fashioned vulture capitalism&quot;.

Providence/Tudor quickly cut a deal to sell the magazine to Miller Publishing for $77 million. When Wired Ventures investor Condé Nast heard about the deal through a leak to a Silicon Valley gossip columnist, they peremptorily outbid Miller and bought &quot;Wired&quot; magazine for $90 million. The month of the sale, &quot;Wired&quot;’s magazine and web businesses became cashflow positive. Condé Nast declined to buy Wired Digital. Four months later, Providence/Tudor sold &quot;Wired Digital&quot; to Lycos.

The deal almost did not close. Wired Ventures&#x27;s founders and early investors threatened lawsuits against Tudor and Providence for breach of fiduciary responsibility, claiming they were engaging in unfair distribution of proceeds from the sale amounting to $50-100 million. Ultimately, the controlling investors relented, and the deal closed in June 1999 for $285 million. At that point, Wired Digital was also cashflow positive. Combined proceeds of the two sales exceeded the Wired Ventures valuation at the time of its failed IPO.

Rossetto&#x27;s penultimate issue was five years after his first, in January 1998. Appropriately, the issue was entitled &quot;Change is Good&quot;, Wired&#x27;s unofficial slogan. In his last issue in February, he ushered in a complete redesign of the magazine, the first since its start. Katrina Heron became &quot;Wired&quot;’s second editor-in-chief with the March 1998 issue.
&quot;Wired&quot; magazine&#x27;s new owner Condé Nast kept the editorial offices in San Francisco, but moved the business offices to New York&quot;. Wired&quot; survived the dot-com bubble under the business leadership of publisher Drew Schutte who expanded the brands reach by launching The Wired Store and Wired NextFest. In 2001 Wired found new editorial direction under editor-in-chief Chris Anderson, making the magazine&#x27;s coverage &quot;more mainstream&quot;. The print magazine&#x27;s average page length, however, declined significantly from 1996 to 2001 and then again from 2001 to 2003.

In 2009, Condé Nast Italia launched the Italian edition of &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Wired.it&quot;. On April 2, 2009, Condé Nast relaunched the UK edition of &quot;Wired&quot;, edited by David Rowan, and launched &quot;Wired.co.uk&quot;.

In 2006, Condé Nast repurchased Wired Digital from Lycos, returning the website to the same company that published the magazine, reuniting the brand.

In August 2023, Katie Drummond was announced as the new editor of &quot;Wired&quot;.

In 2025, during the second presidency of Donald Trump, &quot;Wired&quot; became noted for breaking numerous stories about the Trump administration and Elon Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk criticized the magazine, saying &quot;Wired&quot; &quot;went from being about technology to being an unreadable, far-left wing propaganda mouthpiece.&quot;

==Website today==
&quot;Wired&quot;s web presence started with its launch of Hotwired.com in October 1994. Hotwired was the first website with original content and Fortune 500 advertising. Hotwired grew into a variety of vertical content sites, including Webmonkey, Ask Dr. Weil, Talk.com, WiredNews, and the search engine Hotbot. In 1997, all were rebranded under Wired Digital. The Wired.com website, formerly known as Wired News and &quot;Hotwired&quot;, launched in October 1994. The website and magazine were split in 1998, when the former was sold to Condé Nast and the latter to Lycos in September 1998. The two remained independent until Condé Nast purchased &quot;Wired News&quot; on July 11, 2006. This move finally reunited the &quot;Wired&quot; brand.

As of August 2023, &quot;Wired.com&quot; is paywalled. Users may only access a limited number of articles per month without payment.

Today, &quot;Wired.com&quot; hosts several technology blogs on topics in security, business, new products, culture, and science.

; NextFest

From 2004 to 2008, &quot;Wired&quot; organized an annual &quot;festival of innovative products and technologies&quot;. A NextFest for 2009 was canceled. In 2018, &quot;Wired&quot; hosted &quot;Wired 25&quot;, a celebration of its 25 years, an event which included Jeff Bezos, Jack Dorsey, and many of the other founders of the tech industry.

<text>The river Warta ( , ; ; ) rises in central Poland and meanders greatly through the Polish Plain in a north-westerly direction to flow into the Oder at Kostrzyn nad Odrą on Poland&#x27;s border with Germany. About long, it the second-longest river within the borders of Poland (after the Vistula), and the third-longest Polish river after the Oder (which also flows through the Czech Republic and Germany). Its drainage basin covers . The Warta is navigable from Kostrzyn nad Odrą to Konin - approximately half of its length.

The Warta connects to the Vistula via its own tributary, the Noteć, and the Bydgoszcz Canal () near the city of Bydgoszcz.

== Course ==
The Warta rises in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland at Kromołów in Zawiercie, Silesian Voivodeship, flows through Łódź Land, Greater Poland and Lubusz Land, where it empties into the Oder near Kostrzyn at the border with Germany.

The Greater Warta Basin defines the site of early Poland; it is said that the tribe of Western Polans () settled the Warta Basin between the 6th and 8th century. The river is also mentioned in the second stanza of the Polish national anthem, &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;.

<text>Jacques Offenbach (; 20 June 18195 October 1880) was a German-born French composer, cellist and impresario. He is remembered for his nearly 100 operettas of the 1850s to the 1870s, and his uncompleted opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. He was a powerful influence on later composers of the operetta genre, particularly Franz von Suppé, Johann Strauss II and Arthur Sullivan. His best-known works were continually revived during the 20th century, and many of his operettas continue to be staged in the 21st. &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; remains part of the standard opera repertory.

Born in Cologne, Kingdom of Prussia, the son of a synagogue cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was accepted as a student at the Paris Conservatoire; he found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year, but remained in Paris. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris&#x27;s company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the . There, during the next three years, he presented a series of more than two dozen of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.

In 1858 Offenbach produced his first full-length operetta, (&quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;), with its celebrated can-can; the work was exceptionally well received and has remained his most played. During the 1860s, he produced at least eighteen full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period include (1864), (1866), (1867) and (1868). The risqué humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach&#x27;s facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London, elsewhere in Europe and in the US.

Offenbach became associated with the Second French Empire of Napoleon III: the emperor and his court were genially satirised in many of Offenbach&#x27;s operettas, and Napoleon personally granted him French citizenship and the . With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the fall of the empire, Offenbach found himself out of favour in Paris because of his imperial connections and his German birth. He remained successful in Vienna, London and New York. He re-established himself in Paris during the 1870s, with revivals of some of his earlier favourites and a series of new works, and undertook a popular US tour. In his last years he strove to finish &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, but died before the premiere of the opera, which has entered the standard repertory in versions completed or edited by other musicians.
==Life and career==

===Early years===

Offenbach was born on 20 June 1819, as Jacob (or Jakob) Offenbach to a Jewish family in the German city of Cologne, which was then a part of Prussia. His birthplace in the was a short distance from the square that is now named after him, the . He was the second son and the seventh of ten children of Isaac Juda Offenbach Eberst (1779–1850) and his wife Marianne Rindskopf (–1840). Isaac, who came from a musical family, had abandoned his original trade as a bookbinder and earned an itinerant living as a cantor in synagogues and playing the violin in cafés. He was generally known as &quot;&quot;, after his native town, Offenbach am Main, and in 1808 he officially adopted Offenbach as a surname. In 1816 he settled in Cologne, where he became established as a teacher, giving lessons in singing, violin, flute, and guitar, and composing both religious and secular music.

When Jacob was six years old his father taught him to play the violin; within two years the boy was composing songs and dances, and at the age of nine he took up the cello. As Isaac was by then the permanent cantor of the local synagogue, he could afford to pay for his son to take lessons from the well-known cellist Bernhard Breuer. Three years later, the biographer Gabriel Grovlez records, the boy was giving performances of his own compositions, &quot;the technical difficulties of which terrified his master&quot;, Breuer. Together with his brother Julius (violin) and sister Isabella (piano), Jacob played in a trio at local dance halls, inns and cafés, performing popular dance music and operatic arrangements. In 1833 Isaac decided that his musically talented sons Julius and Jacob (then aged 18 and 14) needed to leave the provincial musical scene of Cologne to study in Paris. With generous support from local music lovers and the municipal orchestra, with whom they gave a farewell concert on 9 October, the two young musicians, accompanied by their father, made the four-day journey to Paris in November 1833.

Isaac had been given letters of introduction to the director of the Paris Conservatoire, Luigi Cherubini, but had to persuade Cherubini even to give Jacob an audition. The boy&#x27;s age and nationality were both obstacles to admission. Cherubini had several years earlier refused the twelve-year-old Franz Liszt admission on similar grounds, but he eventually agreed to hear the young Offenbach play. He listened to his playing and stopped him, saying, &quot;Enough, young man, you are now a pupil of this Conservatoire.&quot; Julius was also admitted. Both brothers adopted French forms of their names, Julius becoming Jules and Jacob becoming Jacques.
Isaac hoped to secure permanent employment in Paris but failed to do so and returned to Cologne. Before leaving, he found several pupils for Jules; the modest earnings from those lessons, supplemented by fees earned by both brothers as members of synagogue choirs, supported them during their studies. At the conservatoire, Jules was a diligent student; he graduated and became a successful violin teacher and conductor, and was of his younger brother&#x27;s orchestra for several years. By contrast, Jacques was bored by academic study and left after a year. The conservatoire&#x27;s roll of students notes against his name &quot;Struck off on 2 December 1834 (left of his own free will)&quot;.

===Cello virtuoso===
Having left the conservatoire, Offenbach was free from the stern academicism of Cherubini&#x27;s curriculum, but as the biographer James Harding writes, &quot;he was free, also, to starve&quot;. He secured a few temporary jobs in theatre orchestras before gaining a permanent appointment in 1835 as a cellist at the . He was no more serious there than he had been at the conservatoire, and regularly had his pay docked for playing pranks during performances; on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues&#x27; music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance. Nevertheless, the earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Halévy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that the young man was going to be a great composer. Some of Offenbach&#x27;s early compositions were played by the fashionable conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien. Offenbach and another young composer, Friedrich von Flotow, collaborated in 1839 on a series of works for cello and piano. Although Offenbach&#x27;s ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entrée to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow&#x27;s help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris. Through contacts he made there he gained pupils. In 1838 the commissioned him to compose songs for the play , staged in March 1839. In January 1839, together with his elder brother, he gave his first public concert.
Among the salons at which Offenbach most frequently appeared, from 1839, was that of Madeleine-Sophie, . There he met Hérminie d&#x27;Alcain, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a Carlist general. They fell in love, and in 1843 they became engaged, but he was not yet in a financial position to marry. To extend his fame and earning power beyond Paris, he undertook tours of France and Germany. Among those with whom he performed were Anton Rubinstein and in September 1843 in a concert in Offenbach&#x27;s native Cologne, Liszt. In 1844, probably through English family connections of Hérminie, he embarked on a tour of England. There, he was immediately engaged to appear with some of the most famous musicians of the day, including Felix Mendelssohn, Joseph Joachim, Michael Costa and Julius Benedict. &quot;The Era&quot; wrote of his debut performance in London, &quot;His execution and taste excited both wonder and pleasure, the genius he exhibited amounting to absolute inspiration.&quot; The British press reported a triumphant royal command performance; &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; observed, &quot;Herr Jacques Offenbach, the astonishing Violoncellist, performed on Thursday evening at Windsor before the Emperor of Russia, the King of Saxony, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert with great success.&quot; The use of the German &quot;&quot;, reflecting the fact that Offenbach remained a Prussian citizen, was common to all the British press coverage of Offenbach&#x27;s 1844 tour. The ambiguity of his nationality sometimes caused him difficulty in later life when France and Prussia became enemies.

Offenbach returned to Paris with his reputation and his bank balance both much enhanced. The last remaining obstacle to his marriage to Hérminie was the difference in their professed religions; he converted to Roman Catholicism, with the acting as his sponsor. Isaac Offenbach&#x27;s views on his son&#x27;s conversion from Judaism are unknown. The wedding took place on 14 August 1844; the bride was seventeen years old, and the bridegroom was twenty-five. The marriage was lifelong, and happy, despite some extramarital affairs on Offenbach&#x27;s part. After Offenbach&#x27;s death, a friend said that Hérminie &quot;gave him courage, shared his ordeals and comforted him always with tenderness and devotion&quot;.
Returning to the familiar Paris salons, Offenbach gradually shifted the emphasis of his work from being a cellist who also composed to being a composer who also played the cello. He had already published many compositions, and some of them had sold well, but now he began to write, perform and produce musical burlesques as part of his salon presentations. He amused the comtesse de Vaux&#x27;s 200 guests with a parody of Félicien David&#x27;s currently fashionable , and in April 1846 gave a concert at which seven operatic items of his own composition were premiered before an audience that included leading music critics. The following year he staged his first operetta, the one-act . It had been written at the invitation of the , which had then failed to present it, and Offenbach mounted the production himself as part of an evening of his works at the . He seemed on the verge of breaking into theatrical composition when the 1848 revolution broke out, sweeping Louis Philippe from the throne and leading to serious bloodshed in the streets of the capital. Three hundred and fifty people were killed within three days. Offenbach hastily took Hérminie and their two-year-old daughter to join his family in Cologne. The city was experiencing its own nationalistic revolutionary upheaval and Offenbach found it expedient to change his forename back to the German while there.

Returning to Paris in February 1849 Offenbach found the grand salons closed down. He went back to working as a cellist, and occasional conductor, at the , but was not encouraged in his aspirations to compose. His talents had been noted by the director of the Comédie-Française, Arsène Houssaye, who appointed him musical director of the theatre in 1850, with a brief to enlarge and improve the orchestra. Offenbach composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the in the early 1850s. Some of his songs became very popular, and he gained valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Houssaye later wrote that Offenbach had done wonders for his theatre, but the management of the was uninterested in commissioning him to compose for its stage. The composer and critic Claude Debussy later wrote that the musical establishment could not cope with Offenbach&#x27;s irony, which exposed the &quot;false, overblown quality&quot; of the operas they favoured – &quot;the great art at which one was not allowed to smile&quot;.
Between 1853 and May 1855 Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas and managed to have them staged in Paris. They were all well received, but the authorities of the remained unmoved. Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as . At his theatre, the , opened in 1854, pioneered French light comic opera, or &quot;&quot;. In &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;, Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, &quot;Without the example set by , Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned , , and so many other triumphant works.&quot; Offenbach approached , who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called . It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received. Offenbach&#x27;s biographer Peter Gammond describes it as &quot;a charming piece of nonsense&quot;. The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by , shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat. Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the .
Offenbach had chosen his theatre, the Salle Lacaze in the Champs-Élysées. The location and the timing were ideal for him. Paris was about to be filled between May and November with visitors from France and abroad for the 1855 Great Exhibition. The Salle Lacaze was next to the exhibition site. He later wrote:

The description of the theatre as &quot;little&quot; was accurate: it could hold an audience of at most 300. It was therefore well suited to the tiny casts permitted under the prevailing licensing laws: Offenbach was limited to three speaking (or singing) characters in any piece. With such small forces, full-length works were out of the question, and Offenbach, like Hervé, presented evenings of several one-act pieces. The opening of the theatre was a frantic rush, with less than a month between the issue of the licence and the opening night on 5 July 1855. During this period Offenbach had to &quot;equip the theatre, recruit actors, orchestra and staff, find authors to write material for the opening programme – and compose the music&quot;. Among those he recruited at short notice was , the nephew of Offenbach&#x27;s early mentor . Ludovic was a rising civil servant with a passion for the theatre and a gift for dialogue and verse. While maintaining his civil service career he went on to collaborate (sometimes under discreet pseudonyms) with Offenbach in 21 works over the next 24 years.

 wrote the libretto for one of the pieces in the opening programme, but the most popular work of the evening had words by . , &quot;The Two Blind Men&quot;, is a comedy about two beggars feigning blindness. During rehearsals there had been some concern that the public might judge it to be in poor taste, but it was not only the hit of the season in Paris: it was soon playing successfully in Vienna, London and elsewhere. Another success in 1855 was (The Village Fiddler), which made a star of Hortense Schneider in her first role for Offenbach. When she auditioned for him, aged 22, he engaged her on the spot. From 1855 she was a key member of his companies through much of his career.

The Champs-Élysées in 1855 were not yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an unpaved . The public who were flocking to Offenbach&#x27;s theatre in the summer and autumn of 1855 could not be expected to venture there in the depths of a Parisian winter. He cast about for a suitable venue and found the , known also as the or , in central Paris. He entered into partnership with its proprietor and moved the there for the winter season. The company returned to the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857 and 1859 summer seasons, performing at the in the winter. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the were discontinued.
Offenbach&#x27;s first piece for the company&#x27;s new home was (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a libretto by . He followed it with fifteen more one-act operettas over the next three years. They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the he was granted an increase from three to four singers.
Under Offenbach&#x27;s management, the staged works by many composers. These included new pieces by Leon Gastinel and Léo Delibes. When Offenbach asked Rossini&#x27;s permission to revive his comedy , Rossini replied that he was pleased to be able to do anything for &quot;the Mozart of the Champs-Élysées&quot;. Offenbach revered Mozart above all other composers. He had an ambition to present Mozart&#x27;s neglected one-act comic opera (&quot;The Impresario&quot;) at the , and he acquired the score from Vienna. With a text translated and adapted by and , he presented it during the Mozart centenary celebrations in May 1856 as ; it was popular with the public and also greatly enhanced the critical and social standing of the . By command of the emperor, Napoleon III, the company performed at the Tuileries Palace shortly after the first performance.

In a long article in in July 1856, Offenbach traced the history of comic opera. He declared that the first work worthy to be called was Philidor&#x27;s 1759 (Blaise the Cobbler), and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and mischief, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including , , , and considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, , written by and . The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. became, and remained, a friend of Offenbach. and Offenbach took a dislike to each other, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.

Although the played to full houses, the theatre was constantly on the verge of running out of money, principally because of what his biographer Alexander Faris calls &quot;Offenbach&#x27;s incorrigible extravagance as a manager&quot;. An earlier biographer, , wrote, &quot;Jacques spent money without counting. Whole lengths of velvet were swallowed up in the auditorium; costumes devoured width after width of satin.&quot; Moreover, Offenbach was personally generous and liberally hospitable. To boost the company&#x27;s finances, a London season was organised in 1857, half the company remaining in Paris to play at the and the other half performing at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in the West End of London. The visit was a success, but did not cause the sensation that Offenbach&#x27;s later works did in London.

In 1858, the government lifted the licensing restrictions on the number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works. His first full-length operetta, (&quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by , lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.

As the company was particularly short of money following an abortive season in Berlin, a big success was urgently needed. At first the production seemed merely to be a modest success. It soon benefited from an outraged review by , the critic of the . He condemned the piece for profanity and irreverence to Roman mythology: the theme was the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, although Napoleon III and his government were generally seen as the real targets of its satire. Offenbach and his librettist seized on this free publicity, and joined in a lively public debate in the columns of the Parisian daily newspaper . Janin&#x27;s indignation made the public agog to see the work, and the box office takings were prodigious. The piece ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. , in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 – although it was still performing strongly at the box-office – &quot;because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted&quot;. Among those who wanted to see the satire of the emperor was the emperor himself, who commanded a performance in April 1860. Despite many great successes during the rest of Offenbach&#x27;s career, remained his most popular work. Gammond lists among the reasons for its success, &quot;the sweeping waltzes&quot; reminiscent of Vienna but with a new French flavour, the patter songs, and &quot;above all else, of course, the can-can which had led a naughty life in low places since the 1830s or thereabouts and now became a polite fashion, as uninhibited as ever&quot;.

In the 1859 season the presented new works by composers including Flotow, Jules Erlanger, , , and Offenbach himself. Of Offenbach&#x27;s new pieces, , though initially only a mild success, was later revised and gained much popularity; the comedy duet of the two cowardly gendarmes became a favourite number in Britain as well as France and the basis for the Marines&#x27; Hymn in the US.

===Early 1860s===

The 1860s were Offenbach&#x27;s most successful decade. At the beginning of 1860, he was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon III, and the following year he was appointed a chevalier of the ; this appointment scandalised those members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera. Offenbach began the decade with his only substantial ballet score, (&quot;The Butterfly&quot;), produced at the Opéra in 1860. It achieved what was then a successful run of 42 performances, without, as the biographer Andrew Lamb says, &quot;giving him any greater acceptance in more respectable circles&quot;. Among other operettas in the same year, he finally had a piece presented by the , the three-act . It was not a success; its plot revolved around a dog, and Offenbach attempted canine imitations in his music. Neither the public nor the critics were impressed, and the piece survived for only seven performances.

Apart from that setback, Offenbach flourished in the 1860s, the successes greatly outnumbering the failures. In 1861 he led the company in a summer season in Vienna. Encountering packed houses and enthusiastic reviews, Offenbach found Vienna much to his liking. He even reverted, for a single evening, to his old role as a cello virtuoso at a command performance before Emperor Franz Joseph. That success was followed by a failure in Berlin. Offenbach, though born a Prussian citizen, observed, &quot;Prussia never does anything to make those of our nationality happy.&quot; He and the company hastened back to Paris. Meanwhile, among his operettas that season were the full-length and the one-act .

In 1862, Offenbach&#x27;s only son, Auguste (died 1883), was born, the last of five children. In the same year, Offenbach resigned as director of the Bouffes-Parisiens, handing the post over to Alphonse Varney. He continued to write most of his works for the company, with occasional pieces first given at the summer season at Bad Ems. Despite problems with the libretto, Offenbach completed a serious opera in 1864, , a hotchpotch of romantic and mythological themes. The opera was presented with substantial cuts at the Vienna Court Opera and in Cologne in 1865. It was not given again until 2002, when it was finally performed in its entirety. Since then it has been given several productions. It contained one number, the , described by the critic Eduard Hanslick as &quot;lovely, luring and sensuous&quot;, which Ernest Guiraud later adapted as the Barcarolle in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. After December 1864, Offenbach wrote less frequently for the Bouffes-Parisiens, and many of his new works premiered at larger theatres.

===Later 1860s===

Between 1864 and 1868 Offenbach wrote four of the operettas for which he is chiefly remembered: (1864), (1866), (1867) and (1868). Halévy was joined as librettist for all of them by Henri Meilhac. Offenbach, who called them &quot;Meil&quot; and &quot;Hal&quot;, said of this trinity: a play on words loosely translated as &quot;I am certainly the Father, but each of them is my Son and Wholly Spirited&quot;.

For Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to play the title role. Since her early success in his short operas, she had become a leading star of the French musical stage. She now commanded large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano Léa Silly feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach&#x27;s extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.

 was a success in early 1866 and was quickly reproduced elsewhere. later in the same year was a new departure for Offenbach and his librettists; for the first time in a large-scale piece they chose a modern setting, instead of disguising their satire under a classical cloak. It needed no inadvertent boost from Janin but was an instant and prolonged success with Parisian audiences, although its very Parisian themes made it less popular abroad. Gammond describes the libretto as &quot;almost worthy of [W. S.] Gilbert&quot;, and Offenbach&#x27;s score as &quot;certainly his best so far&quot;. The piece starred Zulma Bouffar, who began an affair with the composer that lasted until at least 1875.

In 1867 Offenbach had one of his greatest successes. The premiere of , a satire on militarism, took place two days after the opening of the Paris Exhibition, an even greater international draw than the 1855 exhibition which had helped him launch his composing career. The Parisian public and foreign visitors flocked to the new operetta. Sovereigns who saw the piece included King William of Prussia accompanied by his chief minister, Otto von Bismarck. Halévy, with his experience as a senior civil servant, saw the looming threat from Prussia; he wrote in his diary, &quot;Bismarck is helping to double our takings. This time it&#x27;s war we&#x27;re laughing at, and war is at our gates.&quot; &quot;La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein&quot; was followed by a quick succession of modest successes. In 1867 he produced &quot;Robinson Crusoé&quot; and a revised version of &quot;Geneviève de Brabant&quot;; in 1868, , and a revised version of .

In October 1868 &quot;La Périchole&quot; marked a transition in Offenbach&#x27;s style, with less exuberant satire and more human romantic interest. Lamb calls it Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;most charming&quot; score. There was some critical grumbling at the change, but the piece, with Schneider in the lead, made a good profit. It was quickly produced elsewhere in Europe and both North and South America. Of the pieces that followed it at the end of the decade, &quot;Les brigands&quot; (1869) was another work that leaned more to romantic comic opera than to the more ebullient opéra bouffe. It was well received, but has been less often revived than Offenbach&#x27;s best-known operettas.

===War and aftermath===
Offenbach returned hurriedly from a trip to Ems and Wiesbaden just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He then went to his home in Étretat in Normandy and arranged for his family to move to the safety of San Sebastián in northern Spain, joining them shortly afterwards. Having risen to fame under Napoleon III, satirised him, and been rewarded by him, Offenbach was universally associated with the old régime: he was known as &quot;the mocking-bird of the Second Empire&quot;. When the empire fell in the wake of Prussia&#x27;s crushing victory at Sedan in September 1870, Offenbach&#x27;s music was suddenly out of favour. France was swept by violently anti-German sentiments, and despite his French citizenship and , his birth and upbringing in Cologne made him suspect. His operettas were now frequently vilified as the embodiment of everything superficial and worthless in Napoleon III&#x27;s régime. was banned in France because of its antimilitarist satire.
Although his Parisian audience deserted him, Offenbach had by now become highly popular in London&#x27;s West End. John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre presented Offenbach&#x27;s operettas to large and enthusiastic audiences. Between 1870 and 1872, the Gaiety produced fifteen of his works. At the Royalty Theatre, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte presented in 1875. In Vienna, too, Offenbach works were regularly produced. While the war and its aftermath ravaged Paris, the composer supervised Viennese productions and travelled to England as the guest of the Prince of Wales.

By the end of 1871 life in Paris had returned to normal, and Offenbach ended his voluntary exile. His new works (1872) and (1873) were modestly profitable, but lavish revivals of his earlier successes did better at the box office. He decided to go back into theatre management and took over the Théâtre de la Gaîté in July 1873. His spectacular revival of there was highly profitable; an attempt to repeat that success with a new, lavish version of proved less popular. Along with the costs of extravagant productions, collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou culminated in financial disaster. An expensive production of Sardou&#x27;s in 1874, with incidental music by Offenbach, failed to attract the public to the Gaîté, and Offenbach was forced to sell his interests in the Gaîté and to mortgage future royalties.

In 1876 a successful tour of the US in connection with its Centennial Exhibition enabled Offenbach to recover some of his losses and pay his debts. Beginning with a concert at Gilmore&#x27;s Garden before a crowd of 8,000 people, he gave a series of more than 40 concerts in New York and Philadelphia. To circumvent a Philadelphia law forbidding entertainments on Sundays, he disguised his operetta numbers as liturgical pieces and advertised a &quot;Grand Sacred Concert by M. Offenbach&quot;. &quot; from became a &quot;, and other equally secular numbers were billed as &quot; or &quot;. The local authorities were not deceived, and withdrew authorisation for the concert at the last minute. At Booth&#x27;s Theatre, New York, Offenbach conducted and his recent (1873) . He returned to France in July 1876, with profits that were handsome but not spectacular.

Offenbach&#x27;s later operettas enjoyed renewed popularity in France, especially (1878), which featured a fantasy plot about the real-life French actress Marie Justine Favart, and (1879), which was the most successful of his operettas of the 1870s.

===Last years===

Profitable though was, composing it left Offenbach less time to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, , by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera, (&quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, &quot;I would give everything I have to be at the première&quot;. Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach&#x27;s 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making major changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the &#x27;s director, Carvalho. The opera was first seen at the on 10 February 1881. Offenbach also left his last comedy, , unfinished; Léo Delibes orchestrated it and it was given at the Théâtre de la Renaissance on 30 October 1880.

Offenbach died in Paris on 5 October 1880 at the age of 61. His cause of death was certified as heart failure brought on by acute gout. He was given a state funeral; &quot;The Times&quot; reported, &quot;The crowd of distinguished men that accompanied him on his last journey amid the general sympathy of the public shows that the late composer was reckoned among the masters of his art.&quot; He is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

==Works==

In &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, Mark Lubbock wrote in 1957:
Among other well-known Offenbach numbers are (the Doll Song from &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;); and (); and in , which Lamb notes was Offenbach&#x27;s last major song for Hortense Schneider.

===Operettas===

By his own reckoning, Offenbach composed more than 100 operas. Both the number and the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but a few of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term (English: operetta) or for some of his one-act works, more often using the term for his full-length ones (though there are several one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.

Offenbach&#x27;s earliest operettas were one-act pieces for small casts. More than 30 of these were presented before his first full-scale &quot;&quot;, , in 1858, and he composed over twenty more of them during the rest of his career. Lamb, following the precedent of Henseler&#x27;s 1930 study of the composer, divides the one-act pieces into five categories: (i) country idylls; (ii) urban operettas; (iii) military operettas; (iv) farces; and (v) burlesques or parodies. Offenbach enjoyed his greatest success in the 1860s. His most popular operettas from that decade have remained among his best known.

====Texts and word setting====

The first ideas for plots usually came from Offenbach, his librettists working along lines agreed with him. Lamb writes, &quot;In this respect Offenbach was both well served and skilful at discovering talent. Like Sullivan, and unlike Johann Strauss II, he was consistently blessed with workable subjects and genuinely witty librettos.&quot; In his setting of his librettists&#x27; words he took advantage of the rhythmic flexibility of the French language, and sometimes took this to extremes, forcing words into unnatural stresses. Harding comments that he &quot;wrought much violence on the French language&quot;. A frequent characteristic of Offenbach&#x27;s word setting was the nonsensical repetition of isolated syllables of words for comic effect; an example is the quintet for the kings in : 

====Musical structure====
In general, Offenbach followed simple, established forms. His melodies are usually short and unvaried in their basic rhythm, rarely, in Hughes&#x27;s words, escaping &quot;the despotism of the four-bar phrase&quot;. In modulation Offenbach was similarly cautious; he rarely switched a melody to a remote or unexpected key, and kept mostly to a tonic–dominant–subdominant pattern. Within these conventional limits, he employed greater resource in his varied use of rhythm; in a single number he would contrast rapid patter for one singer with a broad, smooth phrase for another, illustrating their different characters. He often switched quickly between major and minor keys, effectively contrasting characters or situations. When he wished to, Offenbach could use unconventional techniques, such as the leitmotif, used throughout to accompany the eponymous Docteur Ox (1877) and to parody Wagner in (1860).

====Orchestration====
In his early pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the size of the orchestra pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of sixteen players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, percussion (including timpani) and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and – exceptionally, Keck records – an ophicleide (&quot;Le Papillon&quot;), tubular bells (&quot;Le carnaval des revues&quot;), and a wind machine (&quot;Le voyage dans la lune&quot;).

Hughes describes Offenbach&#x27;s orchestration as &quot;always skilful, often delicate, and occasionally subtle&quot;. He instances Pluton&#x27;s song in &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot;, introduced by a three-bar phrase for solo clarinet and solo bassoon in octaves immediately repeated on solo flute and solo bassoon an octave higher. In Keck&#x27;s view, &quot;Offenbach&#x27;s orchestral scoring is full of details, elaborate counter-voices, minute interactions coloured by interjections of the woodwinds or brass, all of which establish a dialogue with the voices. His refinement of design equals that of Mozart or Rossini.&quot;

====Compositional method====
According to Keck, Offenbach would first make a note of melodies a libretto suggested to him in a notebook or straight onto the librettist&#x27;s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a sort of shorthand.

====Parody and influences====

Offenbach was well known for parodying other composers&#x27; music. Some of them saw the joke and others did not. Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach&#x27;s parodies of their scores. Meyerbeer made a point of attending all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach&#x27;s private box. Among the composers who were not amused by Offenbach&#x27;s parodies were Berlioz and Wagner. Offenbach mocked Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;strivings after the antique&quot;, and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner&#x27;s pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike. Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as &quot;the product of the mad German mind&quot;, and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach.

In general, Offenbach&#x27;s parodistic technique was simply to play the original music in unexpected and incongruous circumstances. He slipped the banned revolutionary anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; into the chorus of rebellious gods in &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot;, and quoted the aria from Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot; in the same work; in he quoted the patriotic trio from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; and parodied himself in the ensemble for the kings of Greece, in which the accompaniment quotes the &quot;rondeau&quot; from . In his one act pieces, Offenbach parodied Rossini&#x27;s and familiar arias by Bellini. In &quot;Croquefer&quot; (1857), one duet consists of quotations from Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot; and Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot; and &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. Even in his later, less satirical period, he included a parodic quotation from Donizetti&#x27;s in .

Other examples of Offenbach&#x27;s use of incongruity are noted by the critic Paul Taylor: &quot;In , the kings of Greece denounce Paris as &#x27;un vil séducteur&#x27; [vile seducer] to a waltz tempo that is itself unsuitably seductive ... the potty-sounding phrase becomes the absurd nucleus of a big cod-ensemble.&quot; Another lyric set to absurdly ceremonious music is (your coat has split down the back) in &quot;La vie parisienne&quot;. The Grand Duchess of Gérolstein&#x27;s rondo is rhythmically and melodically similar to the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony, but it is not clear whether the similarity is parodic or coincidental.

In Offenbach&#x27;s last decade, he took note of a change in public taste: a simpler, more romantic style was now preferred. Harding writes that Lecocq had successfully moved away from satire and parody, returning to &quot;the genuine spirit of opéra-comique and its peculiarly French gaiety&quot;. Offenbach followed suit in a series of twenty operettas; the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida names the finest of these as (1879).

===Other works===

Of Offenbach&#x27;s two serious operas, &quot;Die Rheinnixen&quot;, a failure, was not revived until the 21st century. His second attempt, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, was originally intended as a grand opera. When the work was accepted by for production at the , Offenbach agreed to make it an with spoken dialogue. It was incomplete when he died; Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet&#x27;s premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would have been asked to complete the piece and would have done so more satisfactorily. The critic Tim Ashley writes, &quot;Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences ... Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann&#x27;s narrative. Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert.&quot;

Although he wrote ballet music for dance sequences in many of his operettas, Offenbach wrote only one full-length ballet, . The score was much praised for its orchestration, and it contained one number, the &quot;Valse des rayons&quot;, that became an international success. Between 1836 and 1875 he composed several individual waltzes and polkas, and suites of dances. They include a waltz, (&quot;Evening Papers&quot;) composed for Vienna with Johann Strauss&#x27;s (&quot;Morning Papers&quot;) as a companion piece. Other orchestral compositions include a piece in 17th-century style with cello solo, which became a standard work of the cello repertoire. Little of Offenbach&#x27;s non-operatic orchestral music has been regularly performed since his death.

Offenbach composed more than 50 non-operatic songs between 1838 and 1854, most of them to French texts, by authors including Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier and Jean de La Fontaine, and also ten to German texts. Among the most popular of these songs are &quot;&quot; (1843), dedicated to the young Hérminie d&#x27;Alcain as an early token of the composer&#x27;s love. An Ave Maria for soprano solo was rediscovered at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in 2000.

===Arrangements and editions===
Although the overtures to and are well known and frequently recorded, the scores usually performed and recorded are not by Offenbach, but were arranged from music in the operas by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres of the two works. Offenbach&#x27;s own preludes are much shorter.

In 1938, Manuel Rosenthal assembled the popular ballet from his own orchestral arrangements of melodies from Offenbach&#x27;s stage works, and in 1953 the same composer assembled a symphonic suite, &quot;Offenbachiana&quot;, also from music by Offenbach. Jean-Christophe Keck regards the 1938 work as &quot;no more than a vulgarly orchestrated pastiche&quot;. In Gammond&#x27;s view it does &quot;full justice&quot; to Offenbach.

Efforts to present critical editions of Offenbach&#x27;s works have been hampered by the dispersion of his autograph scores to several collections after his death, some of which do not grant access to scholars. Although Auguste catalogued the sketches and manuscripts after his father&#x27;s death, when the composer&#x27;s widow died the surviving daughters battled over the papers. Many of his papers may have been lost in the collapse of the city archives in Cologne in 2009.

==Legacy and reputation==
===Influence===
Offenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach&#x27;s works. Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: &quot;Hence () is directly derived from in &quot;. Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own music. The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach&#x27;s in Poulenc&#x27;s .

The musician and author Fritz Spiegl wrote in 1980, &quot;Without Offenbach there would have been no Savoy Opera ... no or &quot;Merry Widow&quot;&quot;. The two creators of the Savoy operas – the librettist, Gilbert, and the composer, Sullivan – were both indebted to Offenbach and his partners for their satiric and musical styles, even borrowing plot components. For example, Faris argues that the mock-oriental &quot;Ba-ta-clan&quot; influenced &quot;The Mikado&quot;, including its character names, Offenbach&#x27;s Ko-ko-ri-ko and Gilbert&#x27;s Ko-Ko. The best-known instance in which a Savoy opera draws on Offenbach&#x27;s work is &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1879), where both Gilbert and Sullivan follow the lead of (1869) in their treatment of the police, who plod along ineffectually in heavy march-time. was presented in London in 1871, 1873 and 1875; before the first of these, Gilbert made an English translation of Meilhac and Halévy&#x27;s libretto.

However much the young Sullivan was influenced by Offenbach, the influence was evidently not in only one direction. Hughes observes that two numbers in Offenbach&#x27;s (1878) bear &quot;an astonishing resemblance&quot; to &quot;My name is John Wellington Wells&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (1877).

Offenbach&#x27;s popularity with Viennese audiences led composers there to follow his lead. He encouraged Johann Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in Vienna in 1864, but it was not until seven years later that Strauss did so. In his first successful operetta, (1874), and its successors, Strauss worked on the lines developed by his Parisian colleague. The libretto for was adapted from a play by Meilhac and Halévy, and the operetta specialist Richard Traubner comments that Strauss was influenced by &quot;the two brilliant party scenes&quot; in Offenbach&#x27;s . A leading Viennese critic demanded that composers &quot;remain within the realm of pure operetta, a rule strictly observed by Offenbach&quot;, and among Strauss&#x27;s later stage works was &quot;Prinz Methusalem&quot; (1877), described by Lamb as &quot;a satirical Offenbachian piece&quot;.

In Gammond&#x27;s view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach&#x27;s works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model. Traubner writes that Suppé&#x27;s early works frankly imitated Offenbach&#x27;s, and his operas – and Strauss&#x27;s – were &quot;unmistakably Parisian (as much derived from Meilhac and Halévy as from Offenbach)&quot;. Suppé&#x27;s (The Boarding School, 1860) not only emulates Offenbach, but refers to him in the first act, when the heroine, the schoolgirl Sophie, and her friends learn about the can-can and proceed to dance it. Suppé&#x27;s most enduring one-act success, (The Beautiful Galatea, 1865), was modelled, in both title and style, on Offenbach&#x27;s which had been a great success in Vienna earlier that year.
In the &quot;Cambridge Opera Journal&quot; in 2014 the musicologist Micaela Baranello writes that Franz Lehár&#x27;s operettas have a strong Offenbachian element, alongside what she calls a &quot;folksy, imaginary&quot; one. She cites eight numbers in &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; as in the Parisian tradition, including &quot;the percussive nonsense syllables familiar from Offenbach&quot;. Elsewhere in Europe, Offenbach was an important influence on the development of zarzuela in Spain, and the 20th-century German composer Kurt Weill described his own (Cattle Trading) as &quot;an operetta influenced by Offenbach&quot;.

In his 1957 article, Lubbock wrote, &quot;Offenbach is undoubtedly the most significant figure in the history of the &#x27;musical&#x27;&quot;, and traced the development of musical theatre from Offenbach via Sullivan, Lehár, Messager and Lionel Monckton to Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein. Lamb writes, &quot;During the nineteenth century the works of Offenbach, Johann Strauss, and Gilbert and Sullivan had scarcely less success in the New World than in the Old&quot;, and according to the historian Adrian Wright the 1858 New York premiere of made Offenbach &quot;a Broadway constant&quot;, putting his works in vogue in America until the end of the century. He influenced some American composers such as John Philip Sousa in his operetta &quot;El Capitan&quot; (1896). Sousa&#x27;s contemporary, David Braham, was dubbed &quot;the American Offenbach&quot;, and included phrases from Offenbach&#x27;s scores in his own music. Later, Lamb finds echoes of &quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot; (1929), although the influence in that case is more that of Meilhac and Halévy than of Offenbach. In a 2005 study of Lerner and Loewe, Gene Lees writes, &quot;The wellspring of the American musical is to be found in the opéra-bouffe of Jacques Offenbach&quot;, and Alan Jay Lerner said that Offenbach &quot;was indeed the father of us all&quot;.

===Reputation===
During Offenbach&#x27;s lifetime, and in the obituary notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed &quot;Musical Snobs Ltd&quot; by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation. In a 1980 article in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten. Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach&#x27;s unusual quality; in &quot;The Times&quot;, Francis Hueffer wrote, &quot;none of his numerous Parisian imitators has ever been able to rival Offenbach at his best&quot;. Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: &quot;It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; shared this view: &quot;That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote , and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation&quot;. After the posthumous production of &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, &quot; [will] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer in every sense of the word&quot;. It then lapsed into what Gammond calls &quot;Victorian sanctimoniousness&quot; by taking it for granted that the opera &quot;will uphold Offenbach&#x27;s fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory&quot;.

The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called Offenbach both an &quot;artistic genius&quot; and a &quot;clown&quot;, but wrote that &quot;nearly every one&quot; of Offenbach&#x27;s works achieves half a dozen &quot;moments of wanton perfection&quot;. The novelist Émile Zola commented on Offenbach in an essay, &quot;La féerie et l&#x27;opérette IV/V&quot;. While granting that Offenbach&#x27;s best operettas are full of grace, charm and wit, Zola blames him for what others have made of the genre. Zola calls operetta a &quot;public enemy&quot; and a &quot;monstrous beast&quot;. Some critics saw the satire in Offenbach&#x27;s works as a social protest, an attack against the establishment, but Zola saw the works as a homage to the social system in the Second Empire.

The mid-20th-century critic Sacheverell Sitwell compared Offenbach&#x27;s lyrical and comic gifts to those of Mozart and Rossini. Otto Klemperer, although best known as a conductor of the German symphonic classics, was an admirer of Offenbach; late in life he reflected: &quot;At the Kroll [in 1931] we did . That&#x27;s a really delightful score. So is &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and . Those who called him &#x27;The Mozart of the Boulevards&#x27; were not much mistaken&quot;. Debussy, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov loved Offenbach&#x27;s operettas. Debussy rated them higher than &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;: &quot;The one work in which [Offenbach] tried to be serious met with no success.&quot; He wrote this in 1903, when &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, after initial success, with 101 performances in its first year, had become neglected. A production by Thomas Beecham at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 1910 restored the work to the mainstream operatic repertoire, where it has remained. A London critic wrote, on Offenbach&#x27;s death, &quot;I somewhere read that some of Offenbach&#x27;s latest work shows him to be capable of more ambitious work. I, for one, am glad he did what he did, and only wish he had done more of the same kind.&quot; In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Lamb writes:

<text>Georges-Léon-Jules-Marie Feydeau (; 8 December 1862 – 5 June 1921) was a French playwright of the Belle Époque era, remembered for his farces, written between 1886 and 1914.

Feydeau was born in Paris to middle-class parents and raised in an artistic and literary environment. From an early age he was fascinated by the theatre, and as a child he wrote plays and organised his schoolfellows into a drama group. In his teens he wrote comic monologues and moved on to writing longer plays. His first full-length comedy, &quot;&quot; (), was well received, but was followed by a string of comparative failures. He gave up writing for a time in the early 1890s and studied the methods of earlier masters of French comedy, particularly Eugène Labiche, Alfred Hennequin and Henri Meilhac. With his technique honed, and sometimes in collaboration with a co-author, he wrote seventeen full-length plays between 1892 and 1914, many of which have become staples of the theatrical repertoire in France and abroad. They include (, 1894), &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot; (, 1899), &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot; (, 1907) and &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; (, 1908).

The plays of Feydeau are marked by closely observed characters, with whom his audiences could identify, plunged into fast-moving comic plots of mistaken identity, attempted adultery, split-second timing and a precariously happy ending. After the great success they enjoyed in his lifetime they were neglected after his death, until the 1940s and 1950s, when productions by Jean-Louis Barrault and the Comédie-Française led a revival of interest in his works, at first in Paris and subsequently worldwide.

Feydeau&#x27;s personal life was marred by depression, unsuccessful gambling and divorce. In 1919 his mental condition deteriorated sharply and he spent his final two years in a sanatorium at Rueil (now Rueil-Malmaison), near Paris. He died there in 1921 at the age of fifty-eight.
==Life and career==
===Early years===
Feydeau was born at his parents&#x27; house in the Rue de Clichy, Paris, on 8 December 1862. His father, Ernest-Aimé Feydeau (1821–1873), was a financier and a moderately well-known writer, whose first novel &quot;Fanny&quot; (1858) was a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; and earned him some notoriety. It was condemned from the pulpit by the Archbishop of Paris, and consequently sold in large numbers and had to be reprinted; Ernest dedicated the new edition to the archbishop.

Feydeau&#x27;s mother was Lodzia Bogaslawa, &quot;née&quot; Zelewska (1838–1924) known as &quot;Léocadie&quot;. When she married Ernest Feydeau in 1861, he was a forty-year-old childless widower and she was twenty-two. She was a famous beauty, and rumours spread that she was the mistress of the Duc de Morny or even the Emperor Napoleon III and that one of them was the father of Georges, her first child. In later life Léocadie commented, &quot;How can anyone be stupid enough to believe that a boy as intelligent as Georges is the son of that idiotic emperor!&quot; She was more equivocal about her relationship with the duke, and Georges later said that people could think Morny his father if they wanted to.

Ernest was a friend of Gustave Flaubert, Théophile Gautier and Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, and Feydeau grew up in a literary and artistic environment. After being taken to the theatre at the age of six or seven he was so enthusiastic that he started to write a play of his own. His father, impressed, told the family&#x27;s governess to let the boy off tuition that day. Feydeau later said that laziness made him a playwright, once he found he could escape lessons by writing plays. He sought out Henri Meilhac, one of the leading dramatists in Paris, and showed him his latest effort. He recalled Meilhac as saying, &quot;My boy, your play is stupid, but it is theatrical. You will be a man of the theatre&quot;.

After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 the family left Paris for Boulogne-sur-Mer. They returned briefly to Paris in March 1871 and then moved to the spa town of Bad Homburg so that Ernest, whose health was failing, could take the cure. Soon after their return to Paris in October 1871 the nine-year-old Feydeau, who had so far received only private tuition, was sent to a boarding school. As a pupil he was generally indolent, but devoted time and energy to organising an amateur dramatic group and performing. In October 1873 Ernest died and in 1876 Léocadie remarried. Her second husband, nearer her own age than Ernest, was a prominent liberal journalist, Henry Fouquier (1838–1901), with whom Feydeau got on well. In 1879 Feydeau completed his formal education at the Lycée Saint-Louis, and was engaged as a clerk in a law firm. Still stage-struck, he began writing again. Comic monologues were fashionable in society, and he wrote &quot;La Petite révoltée&quot; (The rebellious young lady), a humorous monologue in verse, of about seven minutes&#x27; duration, which attracted favourable attention and was taken up by the publisher Ollendorff.

===1880s===

The first of Feydeau&#x27;s plays to be staged was a one-act two-hander called &quot;Par la fenêtre&quot; (Through the window) presented by the &quot;Cercle des arts intimes&quot;, an amateur society, in June 1882. In his biography of Feydeau Henry Gidel comments that it was not a representative audience, being composed of friends of society members, but it was nonetheless a test of a sort, and the play was enthusiastically received. The typical Feydeau characters and plot were already in evidence: a shy husband, a domineering wife, mistaken identities, confusion and a happy ending. The first professional presentation of a Feydeau play was in January 1883, when &quot;Amour et piano&quot; was staged at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée. It depicts the confusion arising when a young lady receives a young gentleman who she thinks is her new piano teacher; he has come to the wrong house and believes he is calling on a glamorous cocotte. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; called it &quot;a very witty fantasy, very agreeably interpreted&quot;.

After completing his compulsory military service (1883–84) Feydeau was appointed &quot;secrétaire général&quot; to the Théâtre de la Renaissance, under the management of his friend Fernand Samuel. In that capacity he successfully pressed for the premiere of Henry Becque&#x27;s &quot;La Parisienne&quot; (1885), later recognised as one of the masterpieces of French naturalist theatre. In December 1886 the Renaissance presented a three-act comédie by Feydeau, &quot;Tailleur pour dames&quot; (Ladies&#x27; tailor). &quot;Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot; thought the play insubstantial, but, it enthused, &quot;what gaiety in the dialogue, what good humour, what pleasing words, what fun in this childishness, what unforeseen things in this madness, what comic invention in this imbroglio, which obtained the most outright success one could wish to a beginner!&quot; The critic of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; said that the piece was not a comedy at all in the conventional sense of the word:


The critic Jules Prével correctly predicted that the young author would struggle to repeat this early triumph: it was not until 1892 that Feydeau had another success to match &quot;Tailleur pour dames&quot;. He had a series of poor or mediocre runs in the late 1880s with &quot;La Lycéenne&quot; (a &quot;vaudeville-opérette&quot; with music by Gaston Serpette, 1887), (1888), &quot;Les Fiancés de Loches&quot; (1888 co-written with Maurice Desvallières), and &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Edouard&quot; (1889).

In 1889 Feydeau married Marie-Anne, the daughter of Carolus-Duran, a prosperous portrait painter. The couple had four children, born between 1890 and 1903. The marriage was ideal to Feydeau in several ways. It was a genuine love-match (though it later went awry); he was an ardent amateur painter, and his father-in-law gave him lessons; and marriage into a well-to-do family relieved Feydeau of some of the financial problems arising from his succession of theatrical failures and heavy losses on the stock exchange.

===1890s===
In 1890 Feydeau took a break from writing and made a study of the works of the leading comic playwrights, particularly Eugène Labiche, Alfred Hennequin and Meilhac. He benefited from his study, and in 1891 wrote two plays that restored his reputation and fortune. He submitted them both to the management of the Théâtre du Palais-Royal. They agreed to stage one of them, &quot;Monsieur chasse!&quot;, but turned down the second, &quot;Champignol malgré lui&quot; (another collaboration with Desvallières) as too unbelievable for an audience to accept. After receiving this news from the Palais-Royal, Feydeau met an old friend, Henri Micheau, the owner of the Théâtre des Nouveautés, who insisted on seeing the rejected script and immediately recognised it as a potential winner. Meyer writes, &quot;He was right. &quot;Monsieur chasse!&quot; was a success, but &quot;Champignol&quot; was a triumph&quot;. When the play opened in November 1892 one critic wrote of:
Another critic said that it had been years since he heard such laughter in a Paris theatre – &quot;I could return to it again and again with pleasure&quot;. He predicted that the piece &quot;will have an interminable run&quot;, and it ran far into the following year for a total of 434 performances. An English version of the play, called &quot;The Other Fellow&quot; opened in London in September 1893 and ran for three months. Feydeau&#x27;s next play, &quot;Le Système Ribadier&quot; (The Ribadier System, 1892), had a fair run in Paris and was successfully produced in Berlin, and subsequently (under the title &quot;His Little Dodge&quot;) in London and New York.

In 1894 Feydeau collaborated with Desvallières on &quot;Le Ruban&quot; (The ribbon), a comedy about a man desperately manoeuvring for appointment to the Légion d&#x27;honneur. At the same time, after a certain amount of similar manoeuvring on his own account, Feydeau was appointed to the legion, at the early age of thirty-two, joining a small élite of French playwrights to receive the honour, including Dumas, Meilhac, Ludovic Halévy, Victorien Sardou and Becque.
 &quot;Le Ruban&quot; ran at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon for 45 performances. Feydeau and Desvallières returned to winning form in the same year with (The Free Exchange Hotel). The &quot;Annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot;, noting that the laughter reverberated inside and out of the auditorium, said that a reviewer could only laugh and applaud rather than criticise. Another critic, predicting a long run, wrote that he and his colleagues would not be needed at the Nouveautés in their professional capacities for a year or so, but would know where to come if they wanted to laugh. The play ran for 371 performances. An English adaptation, &quot;The Gay Parisians&quot;, was staged in New York in September 1895, and ran for nearly 150 performances; a London version, &quot;A Night in Paris&quot;, opened in April 1896 and outran the Parisian original, with a total of 531 performances.

During the rest of the 1890s there were two more Feydeau plays, both highly successful. &quot;Le Dindon&quot; (literally &quot;Turkey&quot; but in French usage signifying &quot;Dupe&quot; or &quot;Fall guy&quot;) ran for 275 performances at the Palais-Royale in 1896–97, and at the end of the decade Feydeau had the best run of his career with &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot;, which played at the Nouveautés from January 1899 to November 1900, a total of 579 performances. The author was used to working with and writing for established farceurs such as Alexandre Germain, who starred in many of his plays from &quot;Champignol malgré lui&quot; (1892) to &quot;On purge bébé!&quot; (1910); for &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot; Feydeau discovered Armande Cassive, whom he moulded into his ideal leading lady for his later works.

===1900–1909===
The Feydeaus&#x27; marriage, happy for its first decade or so, had begun to go wrong by the early years of the 20th century. Feydeau gambled and lost large sums and in 1901 had to sell some of his valuable art collection; his wife was said to have become bitter and spendthrift. Finance became a continual problem. Feydeau never regained the success he had enjoyed with &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot;. A collaboration in 1902 with the composer Alfred Kaiser on a serious romantic opera, &quot;Le Billet de Joséphine&quot;, was not a success, closing after 16 performances. Of his first four plays of the 1900s, only &quot;La Main passe!&quot; (1904) had a substantial run. &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot; (A flea in her ear) (1907) won glowing reviews, and seemed set to become one of the author&#x27;s biggest box-office successes, but after 86 performances a leading member of the cast, the much loved comic actor Joseph Torin, died suddenly and the play was withdrawn; it was not seen again in Paris until 1952.
In 1908 &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; (Look after Amélie) opened at the Nouveautés. The reviewers were enthusiastic; in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Emmanuel Arène said:
In &quot;Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot; Edmond Stoullig wrote:

The piece ran for 288 performances at the Nouveautés during 1908–09, and at the Théâtre Antoine for 96 performances later in 1909.

===Last years===

In 1909, after a particularly acrimonious quarrel, Feydeau left home and moved into the Hotel Terminus in the Rue Saint-Lazare. He lived there, surrounded by his paintings and books, until 1919. He and Marie-Anne were divorced in 1916 and in 1918, now aged fifty-five, he embarked on an affair with a young dancer, Odette Darthys, whom he cast in the lead in revivals of his plays.

&quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; was the last full-length play Feydeau wrote on his own. &quot;Le Circuit&quot; (The road race, 1909) with Francis de Croisset made little impact. &quot;Je ne trompe pas mon mari&quot; (I don&#x27;t cheat on my husband, 1914) with René Peter did well at the box office, with 200 performances, but in the view of Feydeau&#x27;s biographer Leonard Pronko it has signs that &quot;the dramatist had almost reached the end of his brilliant inventiveness&quot;. From 1908 Feydeau focused chiefly on a series of one-act plays, which he envisaged as a set to be called &quot;Du mariage au divorce&quot; (From marriage to divorce). Pronko describes the last of these, &quot;Hortense a dit: &quot;je m&#x27;en fous!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Hortense says &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a damn&#x27;&quot;, 1916) &quot;astringently funny … Feydeau&#x27;s last dazzling gasp&quot;.

Feydeau had long been subject to depression, but in mid-1919 his family, alarmed at signs of a severe deterioration in his mental condition, called in medical experts; the diagnosis was dementia caused by tertiary syphilis. The condition was incurable, and Feydeau&#x27;s sons arranged for him to be admitted to a leading sanatorium at Rueil (now Rueil-Malmaison). He spent his last two years there, imagining himself to be Napoleon III appointing ministers and issuing invitations to his coronation.
Feydeau sank into a coma and died in the sanatorium at Rueil on 5 June 1921, aged fifty-eight. After a funeral at Sainte-Trinité, Paris, he was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

==Works==
Feydeau wrote more than twenty comic monologues, and provided librettos for the composers Gaston Serpette, Alfred Kaiser and Louis Varney, but his reputation rests on those of his plays known in English as farces. He did not use that term for any of his works: he called them vaudevilles or comédies. The vaudeville, a genre that originated in the middle ages as a satirical song, evolved into a play in verse with music, and by Feydeau&#x27;s time had split into two branches: opérettes, such as those by Offenbach, and, in the words of the writer Peter Meyer, &quot;the vaudeville itself ... akin to what we would call slapstick farce, where movement was more important than character&quot;. Reviewers in the French press in Feydeau&#x27;s time used both terms –&quot;vaudeville&quot; and &quot;farce&quot; – to label his plays.
Between 1878 and 1916 Feydeau completed twenty full-length and nineteen one-act plays. Eleven of them were written with a co-author, and not all were farcical; &quot;Le Ruban&quot; (The ribbon, 1894, in collaboration with Maurice Desvallières), is a comedy about a man&#x27;s strenuous efforts to gain a state honour, and &quot;Le Bourgeon&quot; (The bud) is a comedy of manners with serious moments. The latter had a respectable run of 92 performances, but Feydeau&#x27;s greatest successes were in farce. He said that he made so much money from &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot; that he could afford to take two years&#x27; break from writing and devote himself instead to his hobby, painting. That play remains a favourite with French audiences; in English-speaking countries &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; became the most popular.

===Farcical style===
The critic S. Beynon John contrasts Feydeau&#x27;s farce with that of the English theatre of the same period – the latter &quot;cosy and genial&quot;, and Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;sharply subversive&quot;. John also contrasts Feydeau with the earlier French farceur, Eugène Labiche: &quot;Labiche&#x27;s world, though fantasticated, is rooted in ordinary life; Feydeau&#x27;s is cruel, claustrophobic, and smacks of mania&quot;. Discussing his technique, Feydeau said, &quot;When I sit down to write a play I identify those characters who have every reason to avoid each other; and I make it my business to bring them together as soon, and as often, as I can.&quot; He also said that to make people laugh &quot;you have to place ordinary people in a dramatic situation and then observe them from a comic angle, but they must never be allowed to say or do anything which is not strictly demanded, first by their character and secondly by the plot&quot;. Although in private life he was known for his wit, he carefully avoided it in his plays, holding that witty theatrical dialogue interrupted the action.

The critic W. D. Howarth sums up Feydeau&#x27;s typical dramatic template as &quot;a nightmare sequence of events in otherwise unremarkable lives&quot;. In general the vaudeville or farcical events are confined to the second of three acts:
Howarth observes that &quot;The nightmare quality of Feydeau&#x27;s middle acts&quot; depends not only on &quot;frenzied comings and goings&quot;, but also on mechanical stage accessories such as the revolving bed in &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot;, which conveys its occupants into the adjoining room, seemingly at random.

When Feydeau took a break from writing to study the works of his most successful predecessors, he focused in particular on three playwrights: Labiche, Hennequin and Meilhac. From Labiche he learned the importance of close observation of real-life characters, lending verisimilitude to the most chaotic situations. From Hennequin – who had started as an engineer – Feydeau drew the intricate plotting, described by Pronko as &quot;endless mazes of crisscrossing couples, scurrying from door to door, room to room in every possible and impossible combination&quot;. From Meilhac he learned the art of writing polished dialogue, sounding elegant but natural. From these three influences, Feydeau fashioned what Pronko calls &quot;the last great masterpieces of the vaudeville form&quot;.

Contemporary opinions of Feydeau covered a wide range. Catulle Mendès wrote, &quot;I continue to deplore the fact that M. Georges Feydeau uses his truly remarkable talent on plays that will be performed four or five hundred times but that will never be read&quot;. For some, his late one-act plays are misogynistic; for others, they were his finest achievements, comparable with Strindberg in their naturalism; Feydeau was seen here as a moralist as well as an entertainer. For the authors of &quot;Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot;, and critics in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; his farces were what made Feydeau incomparable. Later critics including Gidel, Pronko, Marcel Achard and Kenneth Tynan have judged that in his farces Feydeau was second only to Molière as France&#x27;s great comic dramatist.

==Legacy==

After his death Feydeau&#x27;s plays were neglected for many years. It was not until the 1940s that major revivals were staged in Paris, after which Feydeau gradually became a staple of the repertory in France and abroad. The Comédie-Française admitted a Feydeau work to its repertoire for the first time in 1941, with a production of the one-act &quot;Feu la mère de Madame&quot;, directed by Fernand Ledoux, starring Madeleine Renaud and Pierre Bertin. At the Théâtre Marigny in 1948 Renaud starred in the first production of &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; since Feydeau&#x27;s 1908 original, with the company she co-founded with Jean-Louis Barrault. They took the production to Broadway in 1952, and the West End in 1956, playing in the original French and gaining enthusiastic reviews from the New York and London critics. In the meanwhile the Comédie-Française staged its first full-length Feydeau production, &quot;Le Dindon&quot; (1951). English adaptations had been familiar in Feydeau&#x27;s day, and in the 1950s new versions began to appear, including Peter Glenville&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; (1956, from ) and Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Look After Lulu!&quot; (1959, from &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot;); both were seen in the West End and on Broadway.

The 1960s saw two celebrated productions by Jacques Charon. The first was &quot;Un Fil à la patte&quot; (1961) for the Comédie-Française, which the company took to London in 1964. This led to an invitation from Laurence Olivier to Charon to direct John Mortimer&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot; as &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; for the National Theatre (1966). Charon followed this with Mortimer&#x27;s version of &quot;Un Fil à la patte&quot; (&quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot;) in the West End (1969). In the 1970s the Comédie-Française added two more Feydeau plays to its repertoire: &quot;Mais n&#x27;te promène donc pas toute nue!&quot; (1971) and &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot; (1978), both directed by Jean-Laurent Cochet. In New York there were productions of &quot;Le Dindon&quot; (1972 as &quot;There&#x27;s One in Every Marriage&quot;), &quot;La Main passe&quot; (1973 as &quot;Chemin de fer&quot;), and &quot;Monsieur chasse!&quot; (1978, as &quot;13 rue de l&#x27;amour&quot;). In London the National Theatre presented a second Mortimer adaptation, &quot;The Lady from Maxim&#x27;s&quot; (1977).

During the last two decades of the twentieth century interest in Feydeau continued. The Comédie-Française presented four more of his plays: &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot; (1981) directed by Jean-Paul Roussillon, &quot;Léonie est en avance&quot; (1985) directed by Stuart Seide, &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; (1995) directed by Roger Planchon, and &quot;Chat en poche&quot; (1998) directed by Muriel Mayette. There were numerous Feydeau revivals in theatres in Paris, cities across France, and Brussels, including seven productions of &quot;Le Système Ribadier&quot; three of &quot;Monsieur chasse!&quot;, five of &quot;La Dame de chez Maxim&quot;, and four of &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot;. In London the National Theatre presented Mortimer&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;L&#x27;Hôtel du libre-échange&quot; (1984, as &quot;A Little Hotel on the Side&quot;), which was later played on Broadway. Other English adaptations included Peter Hall and Nicki Frei&#x27;s versions of &quot;Le Dindon&quot; (1994, as &quot;An Absolute Turkey&quot;) and &quot;Occupe-toi d&#x27;Amélie!&quot; (1996, as &quot;Mind Millie for Me&quot;).

During the first two decades of the 21st century, the Comédie-Française presented seven Feydeau productions: &quot;Le Dindon&quot; (2002, directed by Lukas Hemleb), &quot;Un Fil à la patte&quot; (2010 Jérôme Deschamps), &quot;Quatre pièces&quot; – a quadruple bill of one-act plays and a monologue (&quot;Amour et Piano&quot;, &quot;Un monsieur qui n&#x27;aime pas les monologues&quot;, &quot;Fiancés en herbe&quot; and &quot;Feu la mère de madame&quot;, 2009, Gian Manuel Rau), &quot;Le Cercle des castagnettes&quot; (monologues, 2012, Alain Françon), &quot;Le Système Ribadier&quot; (2013, Zabou Breitman), &quot;L&#x27;Hôtel du libre-échange&quot; (2017, Isabelle Nanty) and &quot;La Puce à l&#x27;oreille&quot; (2019, Lilo Baur). The Internet Broadway Database records no Feydeau productions in the 21st century. Among British productions were Frei&#x27;s 2003 version of &quot;Le Système Rebadier&quot; (as &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot;) directed by Hall and Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot;, revived at the Old Vic in 2010, directed by Richard Eyre.

==Adaptations==
Several of Feydeau&#x27;s plays have been adapted for the cinema and television. Although he was active well into the early years of film he never wrote for the medium, but within two years of his death in 1921 other writers and directors began to take his plays as the basis for films, of which more than twenty have been made, in several countries and languages. At least fourteen of his plays have been adapted for television.
