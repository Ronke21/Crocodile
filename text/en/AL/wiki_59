<text>The Oprah Winfrey Show was an American first-run syndicated talk show hosted by Oprah Winfrey. The show ran for twenty-five seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, in which it broadcast 4,561 episodes. The show was taped in Chicago and produced by Winfrey. It remains the highest-rated daytime talk show in American television history.

The show was highly influential to many young stars, and many of its themes have penetrated into the American pop-cultural consciousness. Winfrey used the show as an educational platform, featuring book clubs, interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show did not attempt to profit off the products it endorsed; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.

&quot;Oprah&quot; was one of the longest-running daytime television talk shows in history. The show received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey chose to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000. In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it at No. 49 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, they ranked it as the 19th greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; #17 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

== Early history ==
&quot;Oprah&quot; had its roots in &quot;A.M. Chicago&quot;, a half-hour morning talk show airing on WLS-TV, an ABC owned-and-operated station in Chicago. In 1983, Dennis Swanson, the new general manager of WLS-TV, hired Winfrey to replace Robb Weller, that program&#x27;s former host. Winfrey took over as host on January 2, 1984, and, within a month, took it from last place to first place in local Chicago ratings. By 1985, the local &quot;A.M. Chicago&quot; program was renamed to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Following Winfrey&#x27;s success in performing in the role of Sofia in the film &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (for which she earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations), on September 8, 1986, the talk show was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally. For the premiere, the show&#x27;s producers tried rigorously to book &quot;Miami Vice&quot;″s Don Johnson as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with Dom Pérignon and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to &quot;do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people&quot;. The theme for the premiere show was &quot;How to Marry the Man or Woman of Your Choice&quot;.

== Interviews ==

Winfrey interviewed a plethora of public figures and everyday people during the show&#x27;s 25-year history. When celebrities and newsmakers were ready to share their most intimate secrets their first stop was Winfrey&#x27;s couch and when a serious story hit, the &quot;Oprah&quot; show focused on putting a human face on the headlines.

=== Celebrities ===
Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with Elizabeth Taylor in the show&#x27;s second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey not to ask any questions about her relationships. Winfrey found this to be a challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times.

On February 10, 1993, Winfrey sat down in a prime-time special broadcast with Michael Jackson, who had performed ten days earlier in the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show, for what would become the most-watched interview in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson&#x27;s Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide and, as a result, his then 14-month-old studio album &quot;Dangerous&quot; returned to the top-ten on the album charts. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as vitiligo when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.

Winfrey&#x27;s interview with Tom Cruise, which was broadcast on May 23, 2005, also gained notoriety. Cruise &quot;jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his then-girlfriend, Katie Holmes.&quot; This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media.

Celine Dion appeared on the show 28 times, the most of any celebrity, besides Gayle King, Winfrey&#x27;s best friend, who appeared 141 times.

Winfrey also interviewed Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Guardian Angels&quot; and Raymond Lear in 1988.

=== Notable guests ===
Winfrey interviewed Kathy Bray three weeks after her 10-year-old son, Scott, was accidentally killed by a friend who had found his father&#x27;s gun. Viewers later commented that the interview changed their feelings about having guns in their homes.

In the 1989–90 season, Truddi Chase—a woman who was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, having 92 distinct personalities—appeared on the show. Chase had been violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two and said her old self ceased to exist after that. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;, Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming.

Erin Kramp, a mother dying of breast cancer, appeared on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp began recording videotapes filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp died on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred videos and audiotapes for her daughter.

Jo Ann Compton&#x27;s daughter Laurie Ann was stabbed to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. &quot;I hope they&#x27;re in the same hell I&#x27;m in.&quot; she said of her daughter&#x27;s murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil McGraw to help Jo Ann. He asked her if she thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. &quot;Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life.&quot; Phil continued. &quot;She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died.&quot; After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: &quot;I never thought of it that way.&quot; Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: &quot;She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive.&quot; Compton&#x27;s surviving daughter, Cindy, said &quot;She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation.&quot;

In 2001, Winfrey met 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek, who was born with dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy and wrote inspirational poetry he titled &quot;Heartsongs&quot;. On the show, Stepanek stated, &quot;A heartsong doesn&#x27;t have to be a song in your heart. It doesn&#x27;t have to be talking about love and peace. … It&#x27;s your message, what you feel like you need to do.&quot; In October 2008, Winfrey spoke at the posthumous dedication of Mattie J.T Stepanek Park in Maryland.

== Regular segments and campaigns ==
===Oprah&#x27;s Book Club===

Originally featured a monthly book highlight, including author interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, featuring more classic works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The original format was reintroduced in September 2005, but Winfrey&#x27;s selection of James Frey&#x27;s &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw Elie Wiesel&#x27;s &quot;Night&quot; selected; Winfrey even traveled to Auschwitz with Wiesel. In 2008, Eckhart Tolle&#x27;s &quot;A New Earth&quot; was selected. Modernizing the book club&#x27;s platform, Winfrey and Tolle began a series of live webcast classes that were streamed on Oprah.com to discuss elements of the book with a worldwide audience.

===Oprah&#x27;s Favorite Things===

Items personally favored by Winfrey were featured on the show and given away to audience members. Since its launch in 1996, the &quot;Favorite Things&quot; episode quickly became the hottest ticket in television. When a product was featured, its sales skyrocketed. Select groups were sometimes chosen to receive the items. In 2004, the audience was made up of educators from across the country. Hurricane Katrina volunteer workers were invited to the 2099 show. Winfrey has said that the iPad, given away to her 2010 audience, was her all-time favorite &quot;Favorite Thing&quot;. During a &quot;Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes&quot; episode documenting the production of the giveaway, Winfrey talked about why the event resonates with viewers:
===Oprah &amp; Gayle&#x27;s Big Adventures===
Winfrey and Gayle King are friends. In 1976, Winfrey was working as a news anchor in Baltimore when she met King, a production assistant. The two bonded during a snowstorm when Winfrey told King she could stay at her home to wait it out. Their friendship was often showcased on the show when the best friends decided to take a trip together.

In 2004, they traveled back in time, participating in the PBS series &quot;Colonial House&quot;. The series intended to recreate daily life in Plymouth Colony in 1628. Their 24-hour Puritan adventure included wood-chopping, cooking over an open fire, battling with mice, and using leaves as toilet paper.

Winfrey and King joined 60 other women for a spa getaway in 2006. They spent five days at Miraval Life in Balance Resort and Spa taking part in self-improvement exercises. For an exercise called A Swing and a Prayer, the women were hoisted 40 feet in the air and told to let go. Once in the air, King—who is afraid of heights—would not let herself fall. Winfrey could not help but laugh as King remained in the air, but eventually persuaded her to let go.

In the summer of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day, 3,600-mile road trip across America – from California to New York. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial excitement quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite the challenges of the road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey&#x27;s many driving anxieties and King&#x27;s tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.

The friends visited the State Fair of Texas in 2009. They played traditional state fair games such as Flip-the-Chick and the water gun race. They tried many of the fried foods offered at the fair and judged a best &quot;Best of Show&quot; food contest.

For the farewell season, the best friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park to see some of its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, from which El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature &quot;Oprah&quot; cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.

===Remembering Your Spirit===
A segment at the end of the show that featured spiritual counselors, ordinary people who had been involved in extraordinary situations. They would come on the show and share their stories of overcoming adversity with the audience, inspiring viewers to do the same in their own lives.

===Change Your Life TV===
====Iyanla Vanzant====
Iyanla Vanzant is a former attorney, spiritual teacher and self-help expert who was a regular on the show in the late 1990s. She started the show in its 12th season and became known for her no-nonsense, hard-hitting, and often humorous advice. Vanzant&#x27;s take on everything from cheating spouses to financial struggles connected with viewers and, at times, Winfrey sat in the audience while Vanzant led the show. Her books &quot;In the Meantime&quot; and &quot;One Day My Soul Just Opened Up&quot; became &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers.

====Dr. Phil====
Winfrey met Phil McGraw when he worked as a consultant for her legal team during her 1998 beef trial in Amarillo, Texas. Starting in April of that year, he became a fixture on the show and a viewer favorite. McGraw gave guests tough, tell-it-like-it-is advice and did not allow excuses or rationalizations for their bad habits, bad marriages, or bad attitudes. His popular Tuesday appearances on the show led to his own talk show, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, in 2002.

====Suze Orman====
Financial expert Suze Orman became a viewer favorite, offering money tips, spending interventions, and her famous &quot;Suze smackdowns&quot;. She encouraged people to be honest with themselves about what they could afford and gave advice on getting rid of credit card debt. Her motivational approach to fixing finances has led to her own financial advice empire.

===What&#x27;s the Buzz?===
Winfrey introduced up-and-coming public figures who generated industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled &quot;The Oprah Effect&quot;, people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx and singer James Blunt benefited from the extra publicity the show garnered. Blunt, in particular, saw album sales increase dramatically and landed a Top Two spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Wildest Dreams===
A show feature called &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; fulfilled the dreams of people reported to Winfrey by the producers – mostly viewers who wrote into the show – be the dreams of a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show. It was named after the Tina Turner song &quot;In Your Wildest Dreams&quot;, and Turner was one of the celebrities featured on the segment.

===Tuesdays with Dr. Oz===
Mehmet Oz, the head of cardiac surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in NYC and better known to millions of Winfrey&#x27;s viewers as &quot;Dr. Oz&quot;, regularly appeared on Tuesdays during the 2008–2009 season. In 2009, Dr. Oz debuted &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; in first-run syndication. The series is co-produced by Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television.

===Fridays Live===
A weekly live episode premiered in the show&#x27;s 23rd season with a panel consisting of Winfrey, Gayle King, Mark Consuelos, and Ali Wentworth. The panel discussed the week&#x27;s news and highlighted events in the media and on the show.

In the 2009–10 season, Winfrey hosted this segment on her own. Fridays Live did not return for the show&#x27;s 25th season.

===No Phone Zone===

In March 2010, Winfrey began a campaign to stop drivers from talking or texting on their cell phone in their vehicles while driving. This campaign was regularly noted near the beginning or at the end of episodes.

== Notable moments ==
On November 10, 1986, during a show about sexual abuse, Winfrey revealed that she was raped by a relative when she was nine years old. Since this episode, Winfrey has used the show as a platform to help catch child predators, raise awareness, and give victims a voice.

Liberace appeared in the first season of the show on December 25, 1986. He performed a Christmas medley; Winfrey said it was &quot;the most beautiful I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. Six weeks later, he died of cardiac arrest due to congestive heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy. The episode was Liberace&#x27;s final televised appearance.

The show had only been on the air for just six months when, in 1987, Winfrey traveled to Forsyth County, Georgia, a community in which, for 75 years, no black person had lived. Winfrey brought attention to racial tensions in the area, which had just experienced several protests. The show was set up as a town hall meeting where residents expressed their divisive opinions on the matter. The meeting was becoming heated when one woman stood up and said:
The &quot;Diet Dreams Come True&quot; episode from November 15, 1988, has become one of the most talked-about moments in the history of the show. After years of struggling to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her slim figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost. Winfrey now refers to that moment as her &quot;ego in a pom pom salute.&quot;

While doing a show centered on women drug users in 1995, Winfrey opened up about her personal history with drug abuse:
In 1996, Winfrey spoke with seven of the Little Rock Nine and three white former classmates who tormented the group on their first day of high school in 1957 as well as a student who had befriended them. Winfrey was grateful to have the remaining members of the Little Rock Nine on her show because she credits her success to those who have contributed to the Civil Rights Movement which paved the way for people like herself.

Comedian Ellen DeGeneres came out publicly as a lesbian during her appearance on the show in 1997 after appearing on a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover next to the headline &quot;Yep, I&#x27;m gay.&quot; At the time, DeGeneres was the star of her own sitcom, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ellen&quot;. The episode brought Winfrey the most hate mail she had ever received.

Clemantine Wamariya and her sister Claire appeared on the show in 2006 when Wamariya was selected as one of the winners of an essay contest held by Winfrey. It was revealed that the siblings had not seen their parents in 12 years after fleeing Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. Winfrey surprised the sisters by flying their family to Chicago for one of the most emotional reunions on the show.

In 2007, the Marines of the Second Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion Alpha Company and their naval corpsman, made the show their first stop after a seven-month tour on the front lines in Iraq. Winfrey welcomed the Marines with a big homecoming celebration where they were reunited with their loved ones on the show.
On November 11, 2009, Charla Nash, who was mauled by her friend and employer Sandra Herold&#x27;s pet chimpanzee Travis, came to the show to speak out for the first time about the terrifying attack that took place just nine months prior. Nash wears a veil daily because the attack left devastating injuries to her face and she &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to scare people.&quot; During the show, she agreed to lift her veil for the first time in public.

While taping the show&#x27;s 24th-season premiere on September 8, 2009, the entire audience of 21,000 people, gathered on Chicago&#x27;s Magnificent Mile, surprised Winfrey by breaking out into a synchronized dance set to The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; performance of &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; (with new lyrics congratulating Winfrey on her show&#x27;s longevity). The dance had been choreographed and rehearsed for weeks by a core group of dancers, who taught it to the entire crowd earlier in the day.

During the farewell season, two hundred men who were molested came forward as part of a two-day event in 2010 to take a stand against sexual abuse. The men were joined by director and producer Tyler Perry, who had also experienced sexual abuse. Winfrey hoped that the episode would help survivors suffering in silence release the shame.

On January 24, 2011, Winfrey revealed that just before Thanksgiving 2010 she had discovered she has a half-sister. Winfrey decided to share the news on her show because she knew the story would eventually get out and wanted to be the first to address the matter.

===Giveaways===
On the season premiere of 2004, every person in Winfrey&#x27;s show audience was given a new Pontiac G6 that was donated by General Motors, worth about $8 million in total. The giveaway was the genesis of the oft-satirized Oprah quote, &quot;You get a car! You get a car! Everybody gets a car!&quot; For the premiere of the show&#x27;s farewell season, the studio audience of 300 &quot;ultimate fans&quot; were rewarded by being given a trip to Australia with Winfrey (donated by Australian tourism bodies). Other giveaway shows included the annual Oprah&#x27;s Favorite Things show, in which the studio audience received products Winfrey considered good Christmas gifts.

=== Controversies ===
In 1996, on a discussion of Mad Cow Disease, Winfrey stated that the disease fears had &quot;stopped [her] cold from eating another burger!&quot; Texas cattle ranchers considered that quote tantamount to defamation, and promptly sued her for libel. The show was still producing new episodes at the time of the trial and could not go into reruns, so the production was forced to move to Amarillo, Texas for a period of approximately one month during the proceedings. A gag order meant Winfrey was not allowed to even mention the trial on her show. Winfrey was found not liable. The trial and move to Amarillo led to Winfrey meeting Phil McGraw; Winfrey made McGraw a regular guest on her show shortly thereafter, which eventually led to McGraw getting his own show, produced by Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Productions.

A controversial episode, which aired in 2005 (though originally aired to little apparent notice in October 2003), saw guests discussing the sexual act of &quot;rimming&quot;, igniting criticism. The FCC received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets. However, most FCC correspondents were prodded to write by Howard Stern, a noteworthy target of the agency, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, in an attempt to expose an FCC double standard.

During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Winfrey was criticized for apparently declining to invite Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to her show until after the election.

A 2009 episode attracted criticism from the crowd after Winfrey suggested mothers should buy vibrators for their teenage daughters.

Winfrey&#x27;s program was criticized for featuring alternative medicine and junk science advocates such as Suzanne Somers and vaccine denialist Jenny McCarthy.

In the lead-up to Winfrey&#x27;s tour of Australia, the show was heavily criticized for airing a segment sponsored by the McDonald&#x27;s Corporation in which it was claimed by Australian TV personality Carrie Bickmore that Australians liked to hang out at &quot;hip McCafés&quot;. This depiction of Australian culture was greeted with surprise by many Australians, and anger throughout the Australian coffee industry, which claimed the statements did not accurately reflect the industry, painted the Australian coffee drinker in a bad light, and expected that the industry would be negatively affected by the statements. In the same episode, McDonald&#x27;s products were handed out to the studio audience.

==Final season==
Early in its twelfth season, Winfrey confessed she was &quot;exhausted&quot; and considered quitting. However, while making the 1998 movie &quot;Beloved&quot;, Winfrey then admitted that it brought her back to her responsibility as an admired black woman with a great deal of power and influence. She realized that being in such a position within the media industry, she could make a positive difference in people&#x27;s lives. Winfrey was once again inspired to continue to help people take better control of their destinies, hence her slogan, &quot;Live Your Best Life&quot;.

On January 15, 2008, Discovery Communications, Harpo Productions, and Winfrey announced a joint venture to establish a new cable channel in 2009, known as the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). In November 2008, it was reported that, during a conference call, Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav stated that Winfrey did not intend to renew her contracts for &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; beyond the 2010–11 season. Zaslav stated that &quot;Oprah&quot; could potentially move to the new channel in some form following the end of the syndicated series. However, Harpo Productions denied the report, stating that Winfrey had &quot;not made a final decision as to whether she will continue her show in syndication beyond [2011]&quot;.

On November 20, 2009, Winfrey officially announced that &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; would conclude in 2011, after its 25th and final season. Winfrey explained that 25 was &quot;the perfect number—the exact right time&quot;, and that &quot;I love this show. This show has been my life. And I love it enough to know when it&#x27;s time to say goodbye.&quot; The 25th season premiered on September 13, 2010, featuring guest John Travolta, and an audience of 300 of her &quot;most loyal&quot; fans.

During the episode, it was also announced that the entire audience had been invited to join Winfrey on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Sydney, Australia for a series of special episodes, via a plane piloted by Travolta. On December 11, 2010, Winfrey arrived in Sydney to record shows at the Sydney Opera House. Winfrey and her 300 American audience members were officially welcomed at a cocktail party in Sydney&#x27;s Botanical Gardens overlooking Sydney Harbour. The beach-themed party, hosted by New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally, featured live music and a fireworks display over the water which culminated in the lighting of a red &#x27;O&#x27; on the Harbour Bridge. The episodes in Australia were coordinated between Harpo Studios, Tourism Australia, Tourism New South Wales, the Sydney Opera House, Tourism Victoria, Tourism Queensland, R. M. Williams and Network Ten. The federal government of Australia spent $1.5 million on the event while the government of the state of New South Wales spent an additional $1–2 million to promote the region. Tourism minister Martin Ferguson said &quot;I think it&#x27;s money well spent&quot;. In addition, Tourism Victoria spent a further A$650,000.

The farewell season featured several notable cast reunions, including &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and &quot;The Way We Were&quot;.

In May 2011, Winfrey interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, her first-ever interview with a sitting president and First Lady. They talked about the challenges of parenting at the White House, the strength of their relationship, and their concern for the country&#x27;s future. President Obama also thanked Winfrey for her contributions to the country. &quot;You&#x27;ve got a big heart, and you share it with people. Nobody knows how to connect better than you do,&quot; he said. &quot;We are just blessed and grateful to have you in our lives.&quot;

=== Final episodes ===
The final episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; aired on May 25, 2011. It was preceded by a two-part farewell special recorded at the United Center in Chicago in front of an audience of 13,000. The two-part show featured appearances by Aretha Franklin, Tom Cruise, Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, Beyoncé, Tom Hanks, Maria Shriver, Will Smith, and Madonna. Several hundred graduates of Morehouse College who were the recipients of Oprah&#x27;s Oprah Winfrey Scholarship also attended to thank Oprah and pledge their future support of the scholarship program. The final episode was a smaller affair, recorded in the usual recording studio. Winfrey spent most of the finale thanking the show&#x27;s staff and her fans.

She finished the show in tears. The finale was marked by viewing parties across the US, and the episode was also shown in movie theaters. The episode received the show&#x27;s highest rating in 17 years.

After the show&#x27;s final episode, reruns of &quot;Oprah&quot; remained available to air until September 2011, by which point individual stations had selected other syndicated or local programs to fill the show&#x27;s timeslot. Several stations that had carried the show in the 4:00 p.m. timeslot began carrying local news programs at that time, with a handful of stations debuting these newscasts the day after the final episode aired; as a result, the show&#x27;s final months of reruns did not air in the normal timeslot in some areas.

==Broadcast history and release==
The show aired on most ABC-owned stations in the United States (except KTRK-TV, but CBS-affiliate KHOU carried the show for the entire run) (as well as various other stations through CBS Television Distribution, successor to King World), CTV in most Canadian markets, Diva Universal in Malaysia, TV3 in Ireland, GNT in Brazil, national TV3 in Sweden, Network Ten in Australia, La7d in Italy, MBC 4 in the Arab world, MetroTV in Indonesia, FARSI1 in Iran, Star World in India, and in the Netherlands on RTL4.

In the United Kingdom, the show has been broadcast on a number of different channels.

Five pick up the terrestrial rights from early 1998. Rights subsequently went to Living TV by 2002, followed by ITV2 in 2006, and then to Diva TV, until rights went to TLC for the last couple of series.

==Reception==
===Television viewership and ratings===

It has been reported that the show averages an estimated 7, 14, and 15–20 million viewers a day in the United States. It has also been reported at 26 million and 42 million a week (5.2 and 8.4 million a day).

<text>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed ingredients, frequently vegetables. They are typically served chilled or at room temperature, though some can be served warm. Condiments and salad dressings, which exist in a variety of flavors, are used to make a salad. 

Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula or rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word &quot;salad&quot; alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include bean salad, tuna salad, bread salad (such as fattoush, panzanella), vegetable salads without leafy greens (such as Greek salad, potato salad, coleslaw), rice-, pasta- and noodle-based salads, fruit salads and desserts.

Salads may be served at any point during a meal:
*Appetizer salads – light, smaller-portion salads served as the first course of the meal
*Side salads – to accompany the main course as a side dish; examples include potato salad and coleslaw
*Main course salads – usually containing a portion of one or more high-protein foods, such as eggs, legumes, or cheese
*Dessert salads – sweet salads containing fruit, gelatin, sweeteners or whipped cream
When a sauce is used to flavor a salad, it is generally called a dressing; most salad dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a creamy dairy base.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;salad&quot; comes to English from the French &quot;salade&quot; of the same meaning, itself an abbreviated form of the earlier Vulgar Latin &quot;herba salata&quot; (salted herb), from the Latin &quot;salata&quot; (salted), from &quot;sal&quot; (salt). In English, the word first appears as &quot;salad&quot; or &quot;sallet&quot; in the 14th century. Salt is associated with salad because vegetables were seasoned with brine (a solution of salt in water) or salty oil-and-vinegar dressings during Roman times.
The phrase &quot;salad days&quot;, meaning a &quot;time of youthful inexperience&quot; (based on the notion of &quot;green&quot;), is first recorded by Shakespeare in 1606, while the use of salad bar, referring to a buffet-style serving of salad ingredients, first appeared in American English in 1937.

== History== 
The Romans and ancient Greeks ate mixed greens with dressing, a type of mixed salad. Salads, including layered and dressed salads, have been popular in Europe since the Greek and Roman imperial expansions. In his 1699 book, &quot;Acetaria: A Discourse on Sallets&quot;, John Evelyn attempted with little success to encourage his fellow Britons to eat fresh salad greens. Mary, Queen of Scots, ate boiled celery root over greens covered with creamy mustard dressing, truffles, chervil, and slices of hard-boiled eggs.

Oil used on salads can be found in the 17th-century colony of New Netherland (later called New York, New Jersey and Delaware). A list of common items arriving on ships and their designated prices when appraising cargo included &quot;a can of salad oil at 1.10 florins&quot; and &quot;an anker of wine vinegar at 16 florins&quot;. In a 1665 letter to the Director of New Netherland from the Island of Curaçao there is a request to send greens: &quot;I request most amicably that your honors be pleased to send me seed of every sort, such as cabbage, carrots, lettuce, parsley, etc. for none can be acquired here and I know that your honor has plenty...&quot;.

Salads may be sold in supermarkets, at restaurants and at fast food chains. In the United States, restaurants may have a salad bar with salad-making ingredients, which the customers will use to put together their salad. Salad restaurants were earning more than $300 million in 2014. At-home salad consumption in the 2010s was rising but moving away from fresh-chopped lettuce and toward bagged greens and salad kits, with bag sales expected to reach $7 billion per year.

== Types ==


A salad can be a composed salad (with the ingredients specifically arranged on the serving dish) or a tossed salad (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed, often with salad dressing). An antipasto plate, the first dish of a formal Italian meal, is similar to a composed salad, and has vegetables, cheese, and meat.

=== Green salad ===
A green salad, or green leaf salad, another name for garden salad, is most often composed of leafy vegetables such as lettuce varieties, spinach, or rocket (arugula). If non-greens make up a large portion of the salad it may instead be called a vegetable salad. Common raw vegetables (in the culinary sense) used in a salad include cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, radishes, mushrooms, avocado, olives, artichoke hearts, heart of palm, watercress, parsley, garden beets, and green beans. Nuts, berries, seeds, lentils, and flowers are less common components. Hard-boiled eggs, bacon, shrimp, and cheeses may be used as garnishes, but large amounts of animal-based foods would be more likely in a dinner salad.

====Wedge salad====
A wedge salad is a green salad made from a head of lettuce (often iceberg), halved or quartered, with other ingredients on top.

=== Bound salads ===
Bound salads are assembled with thick sauces such as mayonnaise. One portion of a bound salad will hold its shape when placed on a plate with a scoop. Examples of bound salad include tuna salad, chicken salad, egg salad, coleslaw, and potato salad. Some bound salads are used as sandwich fillings. Some pasta salads, e.g. macaroni salad, are bound salads. They are popular at picnics, potlucks and barbecues.

=== Dinner salads ===
Main course salads (known as dinner salads or as entrée salads in the United States) may contain small pieces of poultry, seafood, or steak. Caesar salad, chef salad, Cobb salad, Chinese chicken salad, Michigan salad, and Pittsburgh salad are dinner salads.

A wide variety of cheeses are used in dinner salads, including Roquefort blue cheese (traditional for a Cobb salad), and Swiss, Cheddar, Jack, and Provolone (for chef and Cobb salads).

=== Fruit salads ===

Fruit salads are made of fruit (in the culinary sense), which may be fresh or canned. Examples include fruit cocktail.

=== Dessert salads ===
Dessert salads rarely include leafy greens and are often sweet. Common variants are made with gelatin or whipped cream; e.g. jello salad, pistachio salad, and ambrosia. Other forms of dessert salads include regional dishes such as Midwestern America&#x27;s ambrosia-like glorified rice and cookie salad, which contains crumbled cookies as an ingredient.

<doc id="61955" wikidata="Q1362723" url="?curid=61955" title="International Dublin Literary Award">
<text>The International Dublin Literary Award (), established as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 1996, is presented each year for a novel written or translated into English. It promotes excellence in world literature and is solely sponsored by Dublin City Council, Ireland. At €100,000, the award is one of the richest literary prizes in the world. If the winning book is a translation (as it has been twelve times), the prize is divided between the writer and the translator, with the writer receiving €75,000 and the translator €25,000. The first award was made in 1996 to David Malouf for his English-language novel &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot;.

Nominations are submitted by public libraries worldwide – over 400 library systems in 177 countries worldwide are invited to nominate books each year – from which the shortlist and the eventual winner are selected by an international panel of judges (which changes each year).

==Eligibility and procedure==
The prize is open to novels written in any language and by authors of any nationality, provided the work has been published in English or English translation. The presentation of the award is post-dated by two years from the date of publication. Thus, to win an award in 2017, the work must have been published in 2015. If it is an English translation, the work must have been published in its original language between two and six years before its translation. The scope for inclusion has been subject to criticism; according to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; journalist Eileen Battersby, &quot;many of the titles are already well known even at the time of the publication of the long list.&quot;

Dublin City Public Libraries seek nominations from 400 public libraries from major cities across the world. Libraries can apply to be considered for inclusion in the nomination process. The longlist is announced in October or November of each year, and the shortlist (up to 10 titles) is announced in March or April of the following year. The longlist and shortlist are chosen by an international panel of judges which rotates each year. Allen Weinstein was the non-voting chair of the panel from 1996 to 2003. As of 2017, the former Chief Judge of the US Court of Appeals, Eugene R. Sullivan, is the non-voting chair. The winner of the award is announced each June.

==History==
The award was established in 1994 as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, a joint initiative of Dublin City Council and the American productivity company IMPAC, which had its European headquarters in Dublin. James Irwin, president of IMPAC, established the prize money at €100,000. A trust fund was established to pay for the award and its maintenance. The award has been administered by Dublin City Public Libraries since its inception. IMPAC went defunct in the late-2000s when its founder and president James Irwin died in 2009. In late 2013, the trust fund became exhausted and there was no money left to run the award. The council agreed to step in and continue funding the award under the same brand name of the now-defunct company while seeking a new sponsor. It was reported that the council paid €100,000 for the prize plus €80,250 in administration costs in 2015. The award was subsequently renamed the International DUBLIN Literary Award in November 2015.

Describing the award as &quot;the most eclectic and unpredictable of the literary world&#x27;s annual gongs&quot;, the journalist Michelle Pauli posed the question in relation to the longlist for the 2004 edition: &quot;Where would you find Michael Dobbs and Tony Parsons up against Umberto Eco and Milan Kundera for a €100,000 prize?&quot;

<text>The Red Badge of Courage is an 1895 war novel by American author Stephen Crane. The novel was published on 3 October 1895. Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a &quot;red badge of courage&quot;, to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as flag-bearer, carrying the regimental colors.

Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism and naturalism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by &quot;Century Magazine&quot;) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane&#x27;s original manuscript, was published in 1982.

The novel is known for its distinctive style, which includes realistic battle sequences as well as the repeated use of color imagery, and ironic tone. Separating itself from a traditional war narrative, Crane&#x27;s story reflects the inner experience of its protagonist (a soldier fleeing from combat) rather than the external world around him. Also notable for its use of what Crane called a &quot;psychological portrayal of fear&quot;, the novel&#x27;s allegorical and symbolic qualities are often debated by critics. Several of the themes that the story explores are maturation, heroism, cowardice, and the indifference of nature. &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; garnered widespread acclaim, what H. G. Wells called &quot;an orgy of praise&quot;, shortly after its publication, making Crane an instant celebrity at the age of twenty-four. The novel and its author did have their initial detractors, however, including author and veteran Ambrose Bierce. Adapted several times for the screen, the novel became a bestseller. Never out of print, it is Crane&#x27;s most important work and a major American text.

==Background== 
Stephen Crane published his first novel, &quot;&quot;, in March 1893 at the age of 21. &quot;Maggie&quot; was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend&#x27;s studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of &quot;Century Magazine&quot; that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, &quot;I wonder that some of those fellows don&#x27;t tell how they &quot;felt&quot; in those scraps. They spout enough of what they &quot;did&quot;, but they&#x27;re as emotionless as rocks.&quot; Returning to these magazines during subsequent visits to the studio, he decided to write a war novel. He later stated that he &quot;had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood&quot; and had imagined &quot;war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers.&quot;

At the time, Crane was intermittently employed as a freelance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war&#x27;s reality. He took the private&#x27;s surname, &quot;Fleming,&quot; from his sister-in-law&#x27;s maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with &quot;every word in place, every comma, every period fixed.&quot; Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894

==Publication history==
The title of Crane&#x27;s original, 55,000-word manuscript was &quot;Private Fleming/His various battles&quot;, but in order to create the sense of a less traditional Civil War narrative, he ultimately changed the title to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War&quot;. In early 1894, Crane submitted the manuscript to S. S. McClure, who held on to it for six months without publication. Frustrated, the author asked for the manuscript to be returned, after which he gave it to Irving Bacheller in October. An abbreviated version of Crane&#x27;s story was first serialized in &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot; in December 1894. This version of the story, which was culled to 18,000 words by an editor specifically for the serialization, was reprinted in newspapers across America, establishing Crane&#x27;s fame. Crane biographer John Berryman wrote that the story was published in at least 200 small city dailies and approximately 550 weekly papers. In October 1895, a version, which was 5,000 words shorter than the original manuscript, was printed in book form by D. Appleton &amp; Company. This version of the novel differed greatly from Crane&#x27;s original manuscript; the deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an Appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of the novel&#x27;s content. Parts of the original manuscript removed from the 1895 version include all of the twelfth chapter, as well as the endings to chapters seven, ten and fifteen.

Crane&#x27;s contract with Appleton allowed him to receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated that he was not to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton &amp; Company published a version of the novel based on Crane&#x27;s original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition of his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never gone out of print.

==Plot summary==
On a cold day, the fictional 304th New York Infantry Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Private Henry Fleming, a young teenaged recruit, remembers his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother&#x27;s resulting protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear or turn and run back. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment&#x27;s first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union&#x27;s victory.
Ashamed, Henry escapes into a nearby forest, where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a &quot;tattered soldier&quot;, asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group is Conklin, who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next comes upon a retreating column that is in disarray. In the panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.

The next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time. His regiment encounters an isolated Confederate unit, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he &quot;had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man&quot;. Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from his commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than &quot;mule drivers&quot; and &quot;mud diggers&quot;. With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.

In the final battle, Henry acts as the flag-bearer after the color sergeant falls. A line of Confederates, hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing, shoots with impunity at Henry&#x27;s regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are taken prisoner. The novel closes with the following passage:

==Historical accuracy and inspiration==

Although Crane once wrote in a letter, &quot;You can tell nothing ... unless you are in that condition yourself,&quot; he wrote &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six years after the end of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: &quot;Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days&quot;.

Crane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle. &quot;Century&quot; &quot;Battles and Leaders&quot; series served as direct inspiration for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss&#x27;s &quot;Recollections of a Private&quot;) contains many parallels to Crane&#x27;s work. Thomas Beer wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; after having announced that he could do better than Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;La Débâcle&quot;. This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. The metaphor of the &quot;red badge of courage&quot; itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.

It is believed that Crane listened to war stories in the town square of Port Jervis, New York (where his family at times resided) told by members of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. The Orange Blossoms first saw battle at Chancellorsville, which is believed by local historians to have been the inspiration for the battle depicted in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. Furthermore, there was a Private James Conklin who served in the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and Crane&#x27;s short story &quot;The Veteran&quot;, which was published in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; the year after &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, depicts an elderly Henry Fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at Chancellorsville.

==Style and genre==

&quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has a distinctive style, which is often described as naturalistic, realistic, impressionistic or a mixture of the three. Told in a third-person limited point of view, the novel reflects the inner-experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat, rather than upon the external world around him. &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which help create suspense within the story. Critics in particular have pointed to the repeated use of color imagery throughout the novel, both literal and figurative, as proof of the novel&#x27;s use of Impressionism. Blue and gray uniforms are mentioned, as are yellow and orange sunlight, and green forests, while men&#x27;s faces grow red with rage or courage, and gray with death. Crane also uses animalistic imagery to comment upon people, nature, and war itself. For example, the novel begins by portraying the army as a living entity that is &quot;stretched out on the hills, resting.&quot;

While the novel takes place during a series of battles, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; is not a traditional Civil War narrative. Focusing on the complex internal struggle of its main character, rather than on the war itself, Crane&#x27;s novel often divides readers as to whether the story is intended to be either for or against war. By avoiding political, military, and geographic details, the story becomes divorced from its historical context. Notably lacking are the dates in which the action takes place, and the name of the battle; these omissions effectively shift attention away from historical patterns in order to concentrate on the emotional violence of battle in general. The writer alluded to as much in a letter, in which he stated he wished to depict war through &quot;a psychological portrayal of fear.&quot;

Writing more than thirty years after the novel&#x27;s debut, author Joseph Conrad agreed that the novel&#x27;s main struggle was internal rather than external, and that Fleming &quot;stands before the unknown. He would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not &#x27;run from the battle&#x27;. And in his unblooded regiment he can find no help. He is alone with the problem of courage.&quot; Crane&#x27;s realistic portrayal of the psychological struck a chord with reviewers; as one contemporary critic wrote for &quot;The New York Press&quot;: &quot;At times the description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating. The reader is right down in the midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen men can be seen, firing blindly and grotesquely into the smoke. This is war from a new point of view.&quot;

With its heavy use of irony, symbolism and metaphor, the novel also lends itself to less straightforward readings. As with many of Crane&#x27;s fictional works, the novel&#x27;s dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects, contributing to its apparent historicity; for example, Jim Conklin muses at the beginning of the novel: &quot;I s&#x27;pose we must go reconnoiterin&#x27; &#x27;round th&#x27; kentry jest t&#x27; keep &#x27;em from gittin&#x27; too clost, or t&#x27;develope&#x27;m, or something&quot;. The ironic tone increases in severity as the novel progresses, especially in terms of the ironic distance between the narrator and protagonist. The title of the work itself is ironic; Henry wishes &quot;that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage&quot;, echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier), however, is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.

By substituting epithets for characters&#x27; names (&quot;the youth&quot;, &quot;the tattered soldier&quot;), Crane injects an allegorical quality into his work, making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man. There have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. Beginning with Robert W. Stallman&#x27;s 1968 Crane biography, several critics have explored the novel in terms of Christian allegory. In particular, the death of Henry Fleming&#x27;s Christ-like friend, Jim Conklin, is noted for evidence of this reading, as well as the concluding sentence of chapter nine, which refers to the sun as &quot;fierce wafer&quot; in the sky. John Berryman was one of the first critics to interpret the novel as a modern wasteland through which the protagonist plays the role of an Everyman. Still others read the novel as having a Naturalist structure, comparing the work to those by Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris and Jack London.

==Themes==
As the title of the work suggests, the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming&#x27;s attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his &quot;red badge of courage&quot;. The first twelve chapters, until he receives his accidental wound, expose his cowardice. The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism. Before the onset of battle, the novel&#x27;s protagonist romanticized war; what little he knew about battle he learned from books: &quot;He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all&quot;. Therefore, when confronted by the harsh realities of war, Henry is shocked, and his idealism falters. Finding solace in existential thoughts, he internally fights to make sense of the senseless world in which he finds himself. When he seems to come to terms with his situation, he is yet again forced into the fears of battle, which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity. Joseph Hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that, at its heart, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was a &quot;story of the birth, in a boy, of a knowledge of himself and of self-command.&quot;

However, the text is ambiguous, making it questionable that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero&quot;, &quot;the novel undercuts itself. It says there is no answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one else does either.&quot; Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry&#x27;s &quot;spiritual change&quot; by the end of the story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel&#x27;s enigmatic ending. Although Henry &quot;progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph&quot;, as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous &quot;romantic notions,&quot; &quot;the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception.&quot; Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel&#x27;s heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry&#x27;s lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that &quot;in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically.&quot;

The indifference of the natural world is a reoccurring theme in Crane&#x27;s work. At the beginning of the novel, as the regiments advance toward battle, the sky is described as being an innocuous &quot;fairy blue.&quot; In chapter seven, Henry notes the inexplicable tranquility of nature, &quot;a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy&quot;, even as the battle rages on. Similarly, Heaven itself is indifferent to the slaughter he encounters on the battlefield. The dichotomy between nature&#x27;s sweetness and war&#x27;s destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen: &quot;A cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the blue, enameled sky.&quot; After his desertion, however, Henry finds some comfort in the laws of nature, which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice:

This landscape gave him assurance. A fair field holding life. It was the religion of peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.

==Reception==
&quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication; in particular, it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work. Appleton&#x27;s 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone, making Crane an overnight success at the age of twenty-four. H. G. Wells, a friend of the author, later wrote that the novel was greeted by an &quot;orgy of praise&quot; in England and the United States. An anonymous reviewer for &quot;The New York Press&quot; wrote shortly after the novel&#x27;s initial publication that &quot;One should be forever slow in charging an author with genius, but it must be confessed that &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; is open to the suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be girdled by the name of talent.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; was impressed by Crane&#x27;s realistic portrayal of war, writing that the book &quot;strikes the reader as a statement of facts by a veteran&quot;, a sentiment that was echoed by the reviewer for &quot;The Critic&quot;, who called the novel &quot;a true book; true to life, whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier&#x27;s experiences in his first battle, or... a great parable of the inner battle which every man must fight.&quot;

The novel, however, did have its initial detractors. Some critics found Crane&#x27;s young age and inexperience troubling, rather than impressive. For example, one reviewer wrote, &quot;As Mr. Crane is too young a man to write from experience, the frightful details of his book must be the outcome of a very feverish imagination.&quot; Crane and his work also received criticism from veterans of the war; one in particular, Alexander C. McClurg, a brigadier general who served through the Chickamauga and Chattanooga campaigns, wrote a lengthy letter to &quot;The Dial&quot; (which his publishing company owned) in April 1896, lambasting the novel as &quot;a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies.&quot; Author and veteran Ambrose Bierce, popular for his Civil War-fiction, also expressed contempt for the novel and its writer. When a reviewer for &quot;The New York Journal&quot; referred to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; as a poor imitation of Bierce&#x27;s work, Bierce responded by congratulating them for exposing &quot;the Crane freak&quot;. Some reviewers also found fault with Crane&#x27;s narrative style, grammar mistakes, and apparent lack of traditional plot.

While it eventually became a bestseller in the United States, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when it was published in late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel&#x27;s success overseas, writing to a friend: &quot;I have only one pride and that is that the English edition of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has been received with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win.&quot; Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, applauding Crane&#x27;s ability to &quot;stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre.&quot; Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that &quot;If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all&quot;. Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel&#x27;s treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be &quot;positively... cold and ineffectual&quot; when compared to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;.

==Legacy==
Crane himself later wrote about the novel: &quot;I don&#x27;t think &quot;The Red Badge&quot; to be any great shakes but then the very theme of it gives it an intensity that the writer can&#x27;t reach every day.&quot; For the remainder of Crane&#x27;s short career (he died from tuberculosis at the age of 28), &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; served as the standard against which the rest of his works were compared. Appleton republished the novel again in 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, reissuing it three additional times that same year.

Since the resurgence of Crane&#x27;s popularity in the 1920s, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has been deemed a major American text and Crane&#x27;s most important work. While modern critics have noted Crane&#x27;s &quot;anticipation of the modern spectacle of war&quot;, others, such as Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim, believe the work to be &quot;unquestionably the most realistic novel about the American Civil War&quot;. Donald Gibson called the novel &quot;ahead of its time&quot; because it did &quot;not conform to very many contemporary notions about what literature should be and do.&quot; The novel has been anthologized numerous times, including in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1942 collection &quot;Men at War: The Best War Stories of All Time&quot;. In the introduction, Hemingway wrote that the novel &quot;is one of the finest books of our literature, and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is.&quot; Robert W. Stallman&#x27;s introduction to the Modern Library&#x27;s 1951 edition of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; contained one of the first modern assessments of the novel. This novel is followed by other works by Crane, such as the novella, &quot;&quot;.

The novel has been adapted several times for the screen. A 1951 film by the same name was directed by John Huston, starring Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy as Henry Fleming. Written by Huston and Albert Band, the film suffered from a troubled production history, went over budget, and was cut down to only seventy minutes despite objections from the director. A made-for-television movie was released in 1974, starring Richard Thomas as Fleming, while the 2008 Czech film &quot;Tobruk&quot; was partly based on &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;.

The novel is also the inspiration for the title of the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The Red Badge of Gayness&quot;, which revolves around a Civil War re-enactment.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 (; NATO reporting name: Farmer) is a Soviet second generation, single-seat, twinjet fighter aircraft. It was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic speeds in level flight. A comparable U.S. &quot;Century Series&quot; fighter was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, although the MiG-19 primarily fought against the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam. This aircraft was originally used by the Soviet Union but it was later used by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force of China.

==Design and development==
In 1950 the Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) design bureau (also known as OKB-155) began work on a new fighter aircraft, intended to have a greater range than the existing MiG-15 and MiG-17 aircraft, and capable of reaching supersonic speeds in level flight. MiG chose to use two of the new Mikulin AM-5 axial jet engines (a scaled-down version of the Mikulin AM-3 that powered the Tupolev Tu-16 bomber) for its new fighter. As a test bed for the new engine, OKB-155 was authorised on 20 April 1951 to convert one of the prototype MiG-17s, replacing the single Klimov VK-1 engine with two AM-5s (later replaced by AM-5As), with the testbed, designated SM-1 (or I-340), flying late in 1951. While the SM-1 was a useful testbed, its performance was less than expected, and first resulted in an afterburner being designed for the AM-5, resulting in the AM-5F (reaching with afterburner).

While the SM-1 was a test bed, the SM-2 (or I-360) was intended as the required supersonic escort fighter, with work authorised on 10 August 1951. The SM-2 was a twin-engined, mid-winged aircraft. Its thin wings, which had been designed at TsAGI, the Soviet Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, for supersonic flight were swept back at an angle of 55 degrees and had a single wing fence on each side. Unusually, a T-tail was fitted. Armament was two Nudelman N-37 37-mm cannon located in the leading edge of the aircraft&#x27;s wings, near the wing roots - the guns had been moved compared to those in the MiG-15 and -17 to avoid ingestion of gun blast gases causing surging of the aircraft&#x27;s engines. The first SM-2, the SM-2/1 was sent to the &quot;Letno-Issledovatel&#x27;skiy Institut&quot; (en:flight research institute) (LII) in April 1952 for testing, and was flown for the first time on 24 May 1952, with test pilot G. A. Sedov at the aircraft&#x27;s controls. With the AM-5A engines without an afterburner the SM-2 could not exceed the speed of sound in level flight. To solve this, AM-5F engines with afterburners were substituted. While the new engines improved performance, the aircraft was found to have handling problems, particularly at high angles of attack, where the aircraft was prone to spinning. To solve these problems the aircraft&#x27;s horizontal tail was lowered, with other changes including moving the aircraft&#x27;s airbrakes and deepening the wing fences, with the modifications causing the aircraft to be redesignated SM-2A and then SM-2B.

The AM-5F still generated inadequate thrust and so the Mikulin engine design bureau developed a new engine to replace it, the AM-9B (later re-designed the Tumansky RD-9), rated at dry and with afterburner. When fitted with the new engines, the SM-2B became the SM-9, first flying in this form on 5 January 1954. The SM-9&#x27;s performance impressed the Soviet authorities, and it was ordered into production as the MiG-19 on 17 February 1954, despite the fact that factory testing had only just started.

The rush to get the MiG-19 into service resulted in initial production aircraft having a number of serious problems. The type suffered a number of in-flight explosions, eventually traced to poor insulation between the aircraft&#x27;s engines and fuel tanks in the rear fuselage - overheating of these tanks could cause fuel explosions. This was eventually partly solved by fitting a metal heat shield between the engines and the tanks. The aircraft&#x27;s elevators proved ineffective at supersonic speeds, and an all-moving slab tail was tested by the second and third SM-9 prototypes, and later included in the major production type, the MiG-19S, which also featured an improved armament.

At the same time that the daylight escort fighter was developed from the SM-2 and SM-9 into the MiG-19 and MiG-19S, work went on in parallel to design and build a radar-equipped all-weather fighter, with the first prototype SM-7/1 flying for the first time on 28 August 1954. This prototype had a similar airframe to the first SM-9, including the conventional fixed horizontal tail, with the second and third SM-7s introducing similar changes to those tested on the SM-9 prototypes, including the slab tail. The all weather fighter entered production as the MiG-19P in 1955. Major differences from the MiG-19S included RP-1 &quot;Izumrud&quot; radar in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, with small radomes in the centre and on the top lip of the air intake and an armament of two cannon in the aircraft&#x27;s wing roots. From 1957, production of all weather fighters switched to the missile equipped MiG-19PM, with an armament of four K-5M air-to-air missiles, with the cannon removed.

In 1955, following American introduction of high-altitude reconnaissance balloons and overflights by British Canberra aircraft, which could not be intercepted by existing aircraft, together with intelligence reports of the development of the Lockheed U-2 with an even greater ceiling, development began on a specialist high-altitude version of the MiG-19, the MiG-19SV, which entered limited production. This had more powerful engines and was lightened, with seatback armour and one of the guns removed, while flap settings were adjusted to give greater lift at higher altitudes and a new pressure suit was introduced. These changes increased the aircraft&#x27;s ceiling from to . The prototype MiG-19SV was further modified (as the MiG-19SVK) with increased wingspan, giving a ceiling of , but this was still inadequate to deal with the U-2, and effort was switched to adding rocket boosters.

==Operational history==
===Soviet Union===
Deliveries of the new fighter to the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) began in June 1955, with the type being publicly unveiled on 3 July that year, when 48 MiG-19s took part in a flypast during an airshow at Tushino Airfield, Moscow.

During their service with Soviet Anti-Air Defense and in East Germany, MiG-19s were involved in multiple interceptions of Western reconnaissance aircraft. The first documented encounter with a Lockheed U-2 took place in the autumn of 1957. The MiG-19 pilot reported seeing the aircraft, but could not make up the difference in altitude. When Francis Gary Powers&#x27;s U-2 was shot down in the 1960 incident, one pursuing MiG-19P was also hit by the salvo of S-75 Dvina (NATO: SA-2 &quot;Guideline&quot;) missiles, killing the pilot Sergei Safronov. In a highly controversial incident, on 1 July 1960, a MiG-19 shot down an RB-47H (S/N 53-4281) reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Arctic Circle with four of the crew killed and two captured by the Soviets (they were released in 1961). In another incident, on 28 January 1964, a MiG-19 shot down a T-39 Sabreliner which had strayed into East German airspace while on a training mission; all three crewmembers were killed.

===East Asia===

====China====
The first use and loss of a U.S. fighter to a MiG-19 (J-6) was in 1965 when a USAF Lockheed F-104 Starfighter piloted by Captain Philip E. Smith was attacked by a PLAAF aircraft over Hainan Island. His Starfighter took cannon fire which damaged a portion of his wing and missile mount. Smith gave chase and did receive missile tone on the MiG but, shortly after pressing his missile firing button, his Starfighter lost all power. He ejected and was captured. Smith was held prisoner until released on 15 March 1973, due to improving US-China relations following U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China in 1972.

==== Vietnam ====
The Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) began receiving the MiG-19 at the end of Operation Rolling Thunder, which ended in 1968. Despite their limited numbers, MiG-19s were involved in extensive combat during Operations Linebacker and Linebacker 2. The VPAF claimed seven victories over U.S. aircraft using the MiG-19, all of which were F-4 Phantom IIs. The MiG-19 was tested by U.S. pilots in the United States in 1969 after receiving an F-6 (J-6 export model) from Pakistan. In addition to finding the aircraft to have a good canopy allowing good visibility for the pilot, along with three hard-hitting 30mm cannons, U.S. pilots found the MiG-19 (J-6/F-6) to be an excellent fighter, &quot;like the MiG-17, it could easily out-turn the Phantom...and could out-accelerate the F-4 out to Mach 1.2, but was slower than the MiG-21.&quot;. However, the MiG-19&#x27;s greatest fault was its extremely short range, as one U.S. test pilot remarked, &quot;after going in full after-burner at low altitude for five minutes, the MiG driver will be looking for a place to land!&quot; This, combined with the aircraft&#x27;s twin engines, which were difficult to maintain, made the MiG-19 unpopular with North Vietnamese pilots.

The North Vietnamese government decided in early 1969 to strengthen its air defenses by creating a third jet fighter unit; the 925th Fighter Regiment. This unit would consist of late model MiG-17s and the newly acquired MiG-19s (nearly all of which were Shenyang J-6s from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC)). The regiment was established at Yen Bai, and by April 1969, nine combat-rated MiG-19 pilots were posted for combat duty. While some of North Vietnam&#x27;s MiG-17s and all of their MiG-21s were supplied by the Soviet Union, the MiG-19s (J-6 models) were supplied by the PRC, which seldom exceeded 54 MiG-19s in number.

The MiG-19 lacked mounts for air-to-air missiles but it had the one advantage over the early model F-4 Phantom II: it was armed with cannons. VPAF MiG-19s had three 30 mm cannons which &quot;were notable for their large muzzle flash&quot; when fired. The aircraft were loaded with 90 rounds per cannon, giving approximately six seconds of firing time. A single two second burst of 90 shells could impact a US aircraft with of metal. This contrasted to a U.S. 20 mm cannon such as the M61 Vulcan which would deliver of metal.

US sources claim that 10 VPAF MiG-19s were lost in aerial combat. On 2 June 1972 a MiG-19 was the first recorded jet fighter to be shot down in aerial combat by cannon fire at supersonic speeds, by a USAF F-4 Phantom flown by Phil Handley. According to the VPAF, from 1965 to 1972, North Vietnamese MiG-19s shot down 13 enemy aircraft and helicopters, while five MiG-19s were lost (four shot down by enemy aircraft and one by friendly fire) and one pilot was killed.

====Air-to-air victories====
The following are Chinese and Vietnamese air-to-air kills, confirmed by US sources; all were achieved with 30 mm cannon shells.
=== Middle East ===
====Egypt====
One of the first Egyptian MiG-19 units was the 15th Air Brigade, consisting of Nos 20 and 21 Squadrons, which became operational at Fayid with a forward location at Milayz in the early 1960s.

In 1962, Egyptian MiG-19s saw some action in the ground-attack role during the North Yemen Civil War. The first reported air combat in the Middle East with the MiG-19 happened on 29 November 1966 when an Israeli Air Force (IAF) Dassault Mirage III shot down two Egyptian MiG-19s which were trying to intercept an Israeli reconnaissance Piper J-3 Cub in Israeli airspace. The first MiG was destroyed with a R.530 radar-guided missile at a range of less than 1.6 km (one mile), marking the first aerial kill for the French-made missile. The second MiG-19 was dispatched with cannon fire.

Around 80 MiG-19s were in service with Egypt during the Six-Day War in June 1967, but more than half of them were destroyed on the ground during the opening Israeli airstrikes of Operation Focus. Israeli pilots, however, did find the MiG-19 a potentially dangerous adversary because of its performance, maneuverability, and heavy armament.

Following the war, the Egyptians reorganized their surviving MiG-19 fleet, and assigned them to the air defense of Egypt&#x27;s interior. The Soviet Union did not supply Egypt with any additional MiG-19s as replacements for those destroyed in the Six-Day War, but Egypt might have received some from Syria and Iraq, so that by the end of 1968 there were more than 80 MiG-19s in service with the Egyptian Air Force. The aircraft also saw combat during the War of Attrition; in one engagement on 19 May 1969, a MiG-19 engaged two Israeli Mirages, shooting down one with cannon fire while the other escaped.

====Iraq====
Iraq obtained some MiG-19S fighters in the early 1960s, but later sold most of them (a couple remaining in local museums), though a few remaining airframes did see some action against the Kurds in the 1960s.

====Syria====

The Syrian Air Force used MiG-19s in the Yemen War.

=== North Korea ===
North Korea received an unknown number of MiG-19S from the Soviet Union following the signing of a mutual assistance treaty in 1961. Thirty of these aircraft may have been sold to Iraq in 1983. At least 100 F-6s were acquired from China in 1988–89. As of April 2002, the Korean People&#x27;s Army Air and Anti-Air Force was reportedly operating about 100 Shenyang J-6 and/or MiG 19s.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (; NATO reporting name: Fishbed) is a supersonic jet fighter and interceptor aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. Its nicknames include: &quot;&quot;Balalaika&quot;, because its planform resembles the stringed musical instrument of the same name; &quot;Ołówek&quot;&quot;, Polish for &quot;pencil&quot;, due to the shape of its fuselage, and &quot;Én Bạc&quot;, meaning &quot;silver swallow&quot;, in Vietnamese.

Approximately 60 countries across four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations seven decades after its maiden flight. It set aviation records, becoming the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history, the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War and, previously, the longest production run of any combat aircraft.

==Development==

===Origins===
The MiG-21 jet fighter was a continuation of Soviet jet fighters, starting with the subsonic MiG-15 and MiG-17, and the supersonic MiG-19. A number of experimental Mach 2 Soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings, such as the Sukhoi Su-7, or tailed deltas, of which the MiG-21 would be the most successful.

Development of what would become the MiG-21 began in the early 1950s when Mikoyan OKB finished a preliminary design study for a prototype designated Ye-1 in 1954. This project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered; the redesign led to the second prototype, the Ye-2. Both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings. The first prototype with the delta wings found on production variants was the Ye-4. It made its maiden flight on 16 June 1955 and its first public appearance during the Soviet Aviation Day display at Moscow&#x27;s Tushino airfield in July 1956.

In the West, due to the lack of available information, early details of the MiG-21 often were confused with those of similar Soviet fighters of the era. In one instance, &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft 1960–1961&quot; listed the &quot;Fishbed&quot; as a Sukhoi design and used an illustration of the Su-9 &#x27;Fishpot&#x27;.

===Design===

The MiG-21 was the first successful Soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered afterburning turbojet, and is thus comparable to the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and the French Dassault Mirage III. Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included the Su-9 interceptor and fast E-150 prototype from the MiG bureau, while the successful mass-produced frontline fighter Su-7 and Mikoyan&#x27;s I-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and ultimately proved to have limited development potential, mainly due to the small available space for the radar.

Like many aircraft designed as interceptors, the MiG-21 had a short range. This was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity. As the internal fuel was consumed, the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters. This had the effect of making the plane statically unstable to the point of being difficult to control, resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition. This can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity. The Chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout (as did the second generation of Soviet variants), and also carried significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue. Additionally, when more than half the fuel was used up, violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine, thereby causing it to shut down in flight. This increased the risk of tank implosions (MiG-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engine&#x27;s compressor), a problem inherited from the MiG-15, MiG-17 and MiG-19. The short endurance and low fuel capacity of the MiG-21F, PF, PFM, S/SM and M/MF variants—though each had a somewhat greater fuel capacity than its predecessor—led to the development of the MT and SMT variants. These had an increased range of compared to the MiG-21SM, but at the cost of worsening all other performance figures, such as a lower service ceiling and slower time to altitude.

The delta wing, while excellent for a fast-climbing interceptor, meant any form of turning combat led to a rapid loss of speed. However, the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a climb rate of 235 m/s (46,250 ft/min) was possible with a combat-loaded MiG-21bis, not far short of the performance of the later F-16A. MiG-21&#x27;s Tumansky R-25 jet engine&#x27;s specialty was the addition of a second fuel pump in the afterburning stage. Activating the ЧР (rus. &quot;чрезвычайный режим&quot; - emergency mode)(Emergency Power Rating, EPR in India) booster feature allows the engine to develop 97.4 kilonewtons (21,896 lbf) of thrust under 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) of altitude. The rpm of the engine would increase by 2.5% and the compression ratio would thus increase, with a rise in exhaust temperature. The limit of operation is 2 minutes for both practice and actual wartime use, as further use causes the engine to overheat. The fuel consumption increased by 50% over the rate in full afterburner. Use of this temporary power gave the MiG-21bis slightly better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and a climbing rate of 254 meters/second, equalling the F-16&#x27;s nominal capabilities in a close-quarters dogfight.
The use of WEP thrust was limited to 2 minutes to reduce stress on the engines&#x27; 750 (250+250+250) flight hours lifetime since every second of super-afterburner counted as several minutes of regular power run due to extreme thermal stress. With WEP on, the MiG-21bis&#x27;s R-25 engine produced a huge 10–12 meter long blowtorch exhaust, with six or seven brightly glowing rhomboid &quot;shock diamonds&quot; visible inside the exhaust. The Russians gave the emergency power setting its &quot;diamond regime&quot; name, never used in India. Given a skilled pilot and capable missiles, it could give a good account of itself against contemporary fighters. Its G-limits were increased from +7Gs in initial variants to +8.5Gs in the latest variants. It was replaced by the newer variable-geometry MiG-23 and MiG-27 for ground support duties. However, not until the MiG-29 would the Soviet Union ultimately replace the MiG-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new American air superiority types.

The MiG-21 was exported widely and remains in use. The aircraft&#x27;s simple controls, engine, weapons, and avionics were typical of Soviet-era military designs. The use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the flight envelope, enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots; this, in turn, enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools. While technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced, low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying Eastern Bloc military hardware. Several Russian, Israeli and Romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to MiG-21 operators, designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard, with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments.

===Production===

A total of 10,645 aircraft were built in the USSR. They were produced in three factories: AZ 30 (3,203 aircraft) in Moscow (also known as &quot;MMZ Znamya Truda&quot;), GAZ 21 (5,765 aircraft) in Gorky, and TAZ 31 (1,678 aircraft) in Tbilisi. Generally, Gorky built single-seaters for the Soviet forces. Moscow constructed single-seaters for export, and Tbilisi manufactured two-seaters both for export and the USSR, though there were exceptions. The MiG-21R and MiG-21bis for export and for the USSR were built in Gorky, 17 single-seaters were built in Tbilisi (MiG-21 and MiG-21F), the MiG-21MF was first constructed in Moscow and then Gorky, and the MiG-21U was built in Moscow as well as in Tbilisi.

A total of 194 MiG-21F-13s were built under licence in Czechoslovakia, and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. of India built 657 MiG-21FL, MiG-21M and MiG-21bis (of which 225 were bis)

===Cost===
Due to the mass production, the aircraft was very cheap: the MiG-21MF, for example, was cheaper than the BMP-1. The F-4 Phantom&#x27;s cost was several times higher than MiG-21.

==Design==


The MiG-21 has a delta wing. The sweep angle on the leading edge is 57° with a TsAGI S-12 airfoil. The angle of incidence is 0° while the dihedral angle is −2°. On the trailing edge there are ailerons with an area of 1.18 m2, and flaps with an area of 1.87 m2. In front of the ailerons there are small wing fences.

The fuselage is semi-monocoque with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of . The air flow to the engine is regulated by an inlet cone in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5, the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9, the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9, the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine. On both sides of the nose, there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the pitot tube is attached to the bottom of the nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake. Later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right, as seen from the cockpit, and had an emergency pitot head on the right side, just ahead of the canopy and below the pilot&#x27;s eyeline.
The cabin is pressurized and air-conditioned. On variants prior to the MiG-21PFM, the cabin canopy is hinged at the front. When ejecting, the SK-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to provide a windbreak from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections. After ejection, the canopy opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground. However, ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate, sometimes resulting in pilot death. The minimum height for ejection in level flight was 110 m. Starting with the MiG-21PFM, a new ejection seat proved to be very reliable and did not need the canopy to protect the pilot which had never been fully satisfactory. The canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit.

On the underside of the aircraft, there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76 m2, and a deflection angle of 35°. The rear air brake has an area of 0.47 m2 and a deflection angle of 40°. The rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the underside of the airplane, just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two JATO rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at former #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.

The empennage of the MiG-21 consists of a vertical stabilizer, a stabilator and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control. The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60° and an area of 5.32 m2 (on earlier version 3.8 m2) and a rudder. The stabilator has a sweep angle of 57°, an area of 3.94 m2 and a span of 2.6 m.

The MiG-21 uses a tricycle-type undercarriage. On most variants, the main landing gear uses tires that are 800 mm in diameter and 200 mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660×200 mm. The wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87° and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar. The nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit. Thus, landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue, with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel and ventral fuel tank or the airbrake.

==Operational history==

===India===
====Overview====
India is the largest operator of MiG-21s. In 1961, the Indian Air Force (IAF) opted to purchase the MiG-21 over several other Western competitors. As part of the deal, the Soviet Union offered India full transfer of technology and rights for local assembly. In 1964, the MiG-21 became the first supersonic fighter jet to enter service with the IAF. Due to limited induction numbers and lack of pilot training, the IAF MiG-21 played a limited role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. However, the IAF gained valuable experience while operating the MiG-21 for defensive sorties during the war. The positive feedback from IAF pilots during the 1965 war prompted India to place more orders for the fighter jet and also invest heavily in building the MiG-21&#x27;s maintenance infrastructure and pilot training programs.

Since 1963, India inducted more than 1,200 MiG-21s into its air force. As of 2024, around 40 MiG-21s are known to be in operation with the IAF. At its peak, IAF operated 400 MiG-21s in 19 squadrons.

In 2023, the IAF announced that it would replace its MiG-21 Bisons with indigenously built Tejas fighter jet.
====Safety record====
The plane has been plagued by safety problems. Since 1970 more than 170 Indian pilots and 40 civilians have been killed in MiG-21 accidents, thus the unofficial nickname &quot;flying coffin&quot;. Over half of the 840 aircraft built between 1966 and 1984 were lost to crashes. At least 14 MiG-21s crashed between 2010 and 2013. Poor maintenance and quality of replacement parts has been considered to be a factor in this phenomenon. When in afterburner, the engine operates very close to its surge line and the ingestion of even a small bird can lead to an engine surge/seizure and flame out.

====Future====
In view of the several incidents that have occurred after the 1999 Kargil War, the modernized MiG-21 Bison seems to have at present the role of an interceptor and possibly a limited role of a fighter aircraft.

On 11 December 2013, India&#x27;s second-generation supersonic jet fighter, MiG-21FL was decommissioned after being in service for 50 years.

The Indian Air Force plans to decommission all MiG-21s by 2025.

====1971 Indo-Pakistan War====
The expansion of the IAF MiG-21 fleet marked a developing India-Soviet Union military partnership, which enabled India to field a formidable air force to counter Chinese and Pakistani threats. The capabilities of the MiG-21 were put to the test during the Bangladesh Liberation War. During the war, the MiG-21s played a crucial role in giving the IAF air superiority over vital points and areas in the western theater of the conflict.

The 1971 war witnessed the first supersonic air combat in the subcontinent when an Indian MiG-21FL claimed a PAF F-104A Starfighter with its GSh-23 twin-barrelled 23 mm cannon. By the time the hostilities came to an end, the IAF MiG-21FLs had claimed four PAF F-104As, two PAF Shenyang F-6s, one PAF North American F-86 Sabre and one PAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Only two kills were confirmed (both F-104As). Two more F-104s were critically damaged by MiG-21 fighters. Pakistan decommissioned all F-104s shortly after the end of the war. According to one Western military analyst, the MiG-21FLs had clearly &quot;won&quot; the much anticipated air combat between the MiG-21FL and the F-104A Starfighter.

Because of the performance of India&#x27;s MiG-21s, several nations, including Iraq, approached India for MiG-21 pilot training. By the early 1970s, more than 120 Iraqi pilots were being trained by the Indian Air Force.

====Kargil War====
One MiG-21 was shot down by a Pakistani soldier using a shoulder-fired MANPADS missile during the Kargil war.

====Other clashes====
On 10 August 1999, two MiG-21FLs of the Indian Air Force intercepted and shot down a Pakistani Bréguet 1150 Atlantic maritime patrol aircraft with an R-60 missile after it allegedly entered Indian airspace for surveillance, killing all on board.

During the 2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes, the Pakistan Air Force shot down an Indian MiG-21 and captured its pilot. The MiG-21&#x27;s debris had fallen in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. The pilot was later returned to India.

===Indonesia===

The Indonesian Air Force purchased 22 MiG-21s. In 1962, 20 MiG-21F-13s and MiG-21Us were received during Operation Trikora in the Western New Guinea conflict. Indonesian MiG-21s never fought in any dogfights. Right after the U.S.-backed anti-communist forces took over the government, 13 Indonesian MiG-21s were delivered to the U.S. in exchange for T-33, UH-34D, and later, F-5 and OV-10 aircraft. All remaining MiG-21s were grounded and retired due to a lack of spare parts and the withdrawal of Soviet maintenance support.

The MiGs were added to the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (&quot;Red Eagles&quot;), a USAF aggressor squadron at Tonopah Test Range.

===Vietnam===


The MiG-21 was designed for very short ground-controlled interception (GCI) missions. It became renowned for this type of mission in the skies over North Vietnam. The first MiG-21s arrived directly from the Soviet Union by ship in April 1966. After being unloaded and assembled they were given to the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force&#x27;s (VPAF) oldest fighter unit, the 921st Fighter Regiment (921st FR), which had been created on 3 February 1964 as a MiG-17 unit. Because the VPAF&#x27;s 923rd FR was newer and less experienced, they continued to operate MiG-17s, while the arrival of the MiG-19s (J-6 versions) from China in 1969 led to North Vietnam&#x27;s only MiG-19 unit, the 925th FR. On 3 February 1972, North Vietnam commissioned its fourth and last fighter regiment created during the war with South Vietnam, the MiG-21PFM (Type 94)-equipped 927th FR.

Former MiG-17 pilot Nguyen Nhat Chieu and his wingman Tran Ngoc Siu intercepted USAF F-105Ds while on CAP duty over Phuc Yen Airbase (a.k.a. Noi Bai Airbase) on 7 July 1966, shooting down one piloted by Capt. Tomes with a salvo from Tran&#x27;s UB-16-57/S-5M unguided rocket-equipped MiG-21, while flight leader Nguyen was unable to establish a lock on another, wildly-evading F-105 with his R-3S AAM; this was the first instance of a VPAF MiG-21 shooting down a piloted enemy aircraft in the Vietnam War.

Although 13 of North Vietnam&#x27;s flying aces attained their status while flying the MiG-21 (cf. three in the MiG-17), many VPAF pilots preferred the MiG-17 because the high wing loading of the MiG-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the MiG-17 gave better visibility. However, this is not the impression British author Roger Boniface got when he interviewed Pham Ngoc Lan and ace Nguyễn Nhật Chiêu (who scored victories flying both the MiG-17 and MiG-21). Pham Ngoc Lan told Boniface that &quot;The MiG-21 was much faster, and it had two Atoll missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1,000 and 1,200 yards.&quot; And Chiêu asserted that &quot;... for me personally, I preferred the MiG-21 because it was superior in all specifications in climb, speed and armament. The Atoll missile was very accurate and I scored four kills with the Atoll. ... In general combat conditions, I was always confident of a kill over an F-4 Phantom when flying a MiG-21.&quot;

Although the MiG-21 lacked the long-range radar, missiles, and heavy bomb load of its contemporary multi-mission U.S. fighters, its RP-21 Sapfir radar helped make it a challenging adversary in the hands of experienced pilots, especially when used in high-speed hit-and-run attacks under GCI control. MiG-21 intercepts of Republic F-105 Thunderchief strike groups were effective in downing US aircraft or forcing them to jettison their bomb loads.

====Aerial combat victories 1966–1972====

The VPAF flew their interceptors with guidance from ground controllers, who positioned the MiGs in ambush battle stations to make &quot;one pass, then haul ass&quot; attacks. The MiGs made fast and often accurate attacks against US formations from several directions (usually the MiG-17s performed head-on attacks and the MiG-21s attacked from the rear). After shooting down a few American planes and forcing some of the F-105s to drop their bombs prematurely, the MiGs did not wait for retaliation but disengaged rapidly. These &quot;guerrilla warfare in the air&quot; tactics generally proved successful during the war. In December 1966, the MiG-21 pilots of the 921st FR downed 14 F-105 Thunderchiefs without any losses.

The USAF and the US Navy had high expectations of the F-4 Phantom, assuming that their massive firepower, best available on-board radar, highest speed and acceleration properties, coupled with new tactics, would provide an advantage over the MiGs. But in confrontations with the lighter MiG-21, F-4s began to suffer losses. From May to December 1966, the USAF lost 47 aircraft, destroying only 12 VPAF fighters in return. From April 1965 to November 1968, over 268 air battles occurred over the skies of North Vietnam. North Vietnam claimed 244 downed U.S. aircraft while admitting to the loss of 85 MiGs. Of 46 air battles between F-4s and MiG-21s, losses amounted to 27 F-4 Phantoms and 20 MiG-21s.

After a million sorties and nearly 1,000 US aircraft losses, Operation Rolling Thunder came to an end on 1 November 1968. A poor air-to-air combat loss-exchange ratio against the smaller, more agile enemy MiGs during the early part of the war eventually led the US Navy to create their Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as &quot;TOPGUN&quot;, at Naval Air Station Miramar, California, on 3 March 1969. The USAF quickly followed with its own version, called the Dissimilar Air Combat Training (sometimes referred to as Red Flag) program at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. These two programs employed the subsonic Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and supersonic F-5 Tiger II, as well as the Mach 2.4-capable USAF Convair F-106 Delta Dart, to mimick the MiG-21.

The culmination of the air struggle over Vietnam in early 1972 was 10 May, when VPAF aircraft completed 64 sorties, resulting in 15 air battles. The VPAF claimed 7 F-4s were shot down (the U.S. confirmed five F-4s were lost.) The F-4s, in turn, managed to destroy two MiG-21s, three MiG-17s and one MiG-19. On 11 May, two MiG-21s, playing the &quot;bait&quot;, brought four F-4s to 2 MiG-21s circling at low altitude. The MiGs quickly stormed the Phantoms and 3 missiles shot down two F-4s. On 13 May, a MiG-21 unit intercepted a group of F-4s and a second pair of MiGs made a missile attack before being hit by two F-4s. On 18 May, VPAF aircraft made 26 sorties, eight of which resulted in combat, downing four F-4s without any VPAF losses.

Over the course of the air war, between 3 April 1965 and 8 January 1973, each side would ultimately claim favorable kill ratios. In 1972, the number of air battles between American and Vietnamese planes stood at 201. The VPAF lost 54 MiGs (including 36 MiG-21s and one MiG-21US) and claimed 90 U.S. aircraft shot down, including 74 F-4 fighters and two RF-4C reconnaissance jets (MiG-21s shot down 67 enemy aircraft while MiG-17s shot down 11 and MiG-19s downed another 12).

One MiG-21 was shot down on 21 February 1972 by a USAF F-4 Phantom based at Udorn RTAFB, Thailand and piloted by Major Lodge with 1st Lt Roger Locher as his weapon systems officer (WSO). This was claimed as the first-ever USAF MiG kill at night, and the first in four years at that time.

Two MiG-21s were claimed shot down by USAF Boeing B-52 Stratofortress tail gunners; the only confirmed air-to-air kills ever made by the B-52. The first aerial victory was scored on 18 December 1972 by tail gunner Staff Sgt Samuel Turner, who was awarded the Silver Star. The second took place on 24 December 1972, when A1C Albert E. Moore downed a MiG-21 over the Thai Nguyen railroad yards. Both actions occurred during Operation Linebacker II, also known as the Christmas Bombings. These air-to-air kills were not confirmed by VPAF.
The biggest threat to North Vietnam during the war had always been the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s B-52 bombers. Hanoi&#x27;s MiG-17 and MiG-19 interceptors could not deal with the B-52s at their flying altitude. In the summer of 1972, the VPAF was directed to train 12 MiG-21 pilots for the specific mission of shooting the B-52 bombers, with two-thirds of the pilots specifically trained in night attacks. On 26 December 1972, just two days after tail gunner Albert Moore downed a MiG-21, a VPAF MiG-21MF (number 5121) from the 921st Fighter Regiment, flown by Major Phạm Tuân over Hanoi, claimed the first aerial combat kill of a B-52. The B-52 had been above Hanoi at over when Major Tuân launched two Atoll missiles from 2 kilometres away and claimed to have destroyed one of the bombers flying in the three-plane formation. Other sources argue that the Atoll missiles failed to hit their mark, but as it was disengaging, a B-52 from a three-bomber cell in front of his target took a hit from a surface-to-air missile (SAM), exploding in mid-air: this may have caused Tuân to think his missiles destroyed the target he had been aiming for.

The Vietnamese claimed another kill on 28 December 1972 by a MiG-21 from the 921st FR, this time flown by Vu Xuan Thieu. Thieu is said to have perished in the explosion of a B-52 hit by his own missiles, having approached the target too closely. In this case, the Vietnamese version appears to be erroneous: while one MiG-21 kill was claimed by Phantoms that night (this may have been Thieu&#x27;s MiG), no B-52s were lost for any reason on the date of the claimed kill.

;Year-by-year kill claims involving MiG-21s
* 1966: U.S. claimed six MiG-21s destroyed; North Vietnam claimed seven F-4 Phantom IIs and 11 F-105 Thunderchiefs shot down by MiG-21s.
* 1967: U.S. claimed 21 MiG-21s destroyed; North Vietnam claimed 17 F-105 Thunderchiefs, 11 F-4 Phantom IIs, two RF-101 Voodoos, one A-4 Skyhawk, one Vought F-8 Crusader, one EB-66 Destroyer and three unidentified types shot down by MiG-21s.
* 1968: U.S. claimed nine MiG-21s destroyed; North Vietnam claimed 17 US aircraft shot down by MiG-21s.
* 1969: U.S. destroyed three MiG-21s; one Ryan Firebee UAV destroyed by a MiG-21.
* 1970: U.S. destroyed two MiG-21s; North Vietnam claimed one F-4 Phantom and one CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter shot down by MiG-21s.
* 1972: U.S. claimed 51 MiG-21s destroyed; North Vietnam claimed 53 US aircraft shot down by MiG-21s, including two B-52 Stratofortress bombers. Soviet General Fesenko, the main Soviet adviser to the North Vietnamese Air Force in 1972, recorded 34 MiG-21s destroyed in 1972. According to VPAF, in 1972, they lost 29 MiG-21s, 5 MiG-19s and 16 MiG-17s in aircombat

On 3 January 1968, a single MiG-21 pilot, Ha Van Chuc, entered battle with 36 American planes and claimed one F-105 Thunderchief.

During the war, the VPAF claimed 103 F-4 Phantoms were shot down by MiG-21s, and that they lost 60 MiG-21s in air combat (54 by Phantoms).

According to Russian data, the VPAF MiG-21s claimed 165 air victories, with the loss of 65 aircraft (including a few by accident or friendly fire) and 16 pilots. The losses of MiG-21 pilots were the lowest of all airplanes.

===Arab–Israeli conflicts===

The MiG-21 was also used extensively in Middle Eastern conflicts of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s by the Egyptian Air Force, Syrian Air Force and Iraqi Air Force. The MiG-21 first encountered Israeli Mirage IIICJs on 14 November 1964, but it was not until 14 July 1966 that the first MiG-21 was shot down. Another six Syrian MiG-21s were shot down by Israeli Mirages on 7 April 1967. MiG-21s also faced McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs and Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, but were later outclassed by the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, both acquired by Israel starting in the mid-1970s. During this period, Syrian pilots flying MiG-21s also independently discovered the Cobra maneuver, which became a standard defensive maneuver under the name &quot;zero speed maneuver&quot; (Syrian: مناورة السرعة صفر).

During the opening attacks of the 1967 Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) struck Arab air forces in four attack waves. In the first wave, Israeli pilots claimed to have destroyed eight Egyptian aircraft in air-to-air combat, of which seven were MiG-21s; Egypt claimed five kills scored by MiG-21PFs. During the second wave, Israel claimed four more MiG-21s downed in air-to-air combat, with the third wave resulting claimed air victories over two Syrian and one Iraqi MiG-21. The fourth wave destroyed many more Syrian MiG-21s on the ground. Overall, Egypt lost around 100 out of about 110 MiG-21s they had, almost all on the ground; Syria lost 35 of its 60 MiG-21F-13s and MiG-21PFs in the air and on the ground.

Between the end of the Six-Day War and the start of the War of Attrition, IAF Mirage fighters scored six confirmed kills of Egyptian MiG-21s, and Egyptian MiG-21s scored two confirmed and three probable kills against Israeli aircraft. Between the end of the Six-Day War to the end of the War of Attrition, Israel claimed a total of 25 destroyed Syrian MiG-21s; the Syrians claimed three confirmed and four probable kills of Israel aircraft, although Israel denied these.

High losses to Israeli aircraft and continuous bombing during the War of Attrition caused Egypt to ask the Soviet Union for help. In March 1970, Soviet pilots and SAM crews arrived with their equipment. On 13 April, during the air battle over the Red Sea coast, the Soviet MiG-21MFs, according to some data, shot down two Israeli F-4 fighters On 18 April, one Israeli scout RF-4E &quot;Phantom&quot; was damaged by a Soviet MiG-21MF. On 16 May, an Israeli aircraft was shot down in air combat, probably by a Soviet MiG-21. On 22 June 1970, a Soviet pilot flying a MiG-21MF shot down an Israeli A-4E. After that, several more successful intercepts were carried out by Soviet pilots and another Israeli A-4 was shot down on 25 June.

In response, Israel planned an ambush, calling it Operation Rimon 20. On 30 July, Israeli F-4s lured Soviet MiG-21s into an area where they were ambushed by Israeli Mirages. Asher Snir, flying a Mirage IIICJ, destroyed a Soviet MiG-21; Avihu Ben-Nun and Aviam Sela, both piloting F-4Es, each got a kill, and an unidentified pilot in another Mirage scored a fourth kill against a Soviet-flown MiG-21; the IAF suffered only a damaged Mirage. Three Soviet pilots were killed and the Soviet Union was alarmed by the losses. Yet though it was a morale-boosting achievement, &quot;Rimon 20&quot; did not change the course of the war. After the operation, other IAF aircraft were lost to Soviet MiG-21s and SAMs. A week later, on 7 August, the Soviets responded by deploying more aircraft to Egypt and luring Israeli fighter jets into an ambush of their own, &quot;Operation Kavkaz&quot;, downing two Israeli Mirage IIICJs. In all, during March and August 1970, Soviet MiG-21 pilots and SAM crews destroyed 21 Israeli aircraft (eight by SA-3 missile systems and 13 by MiG-21s) at a cost of 5 MiG-21s shot down by the IAF, helping to convince the Israelis to sign a ceasefire.

In September 1973, a large air battle erupted between Syria and Israel; Israel claimed a total of 12 Syrian MiG-21s destroyed, while Syria claimed eight kills scored by MiG-21s and admitted five losses.

During the Yom Kippur War, Israel claimed 73 kills against Egyptian MiG-21s (65 confirmed). Egypt claimed 27 confirmed kills and eight probables against Israeli aircraft by its MiG-21s. However, according to most Israeli sources, these were exaggerated claims, as Israeli air-to-air combat losses for the entire war did not exceed fifteen.

On the Syrian front, 6 October 1973 saw a flight of Syrian MiG-21MFs shoot down an Israeli A-4E and Mirage IIICJ, losing three of their own to Israeli IAI Neshers. On 7 October, Syrian MiG-21MFs downed two Israeli F-4Es, three Mirage IIICJs and an A-4E while losing two of their MiGs to Neshers and one to an F-4E, as well as two to friendly SAM fire. Iraqi MiG-21PFs also operated on this front, and on that same day destroyed two A-4Es while losing one MiG. On 8 October 1973, Syrian MiG-21PFMs downed three F-4Es, but six of their MiG-21s were lost. By the end of the war, Syrian MiG-21s claimed a total of 30 confirmed kills against Israeli aircraft; 29 MiG-21s were claimed (26 confirmed) as destroyed by the IDF.

Later on 26 April 1974, an unusual occurrence involving Pakistani fighter pilot Flight Lieutenant Sattar Alvi took place while he was on deputation to the No. 67A Squadron of the Syrian Air Force. Alvi, flying a Syrian MiG-21F-13 (Serial No. 1863) out of Syria&#x27;s Al-Dumayr Air Base with a fellow PAF pilot, was on aerial patrol near the Golan Heights when he spotted two Israeli Mirage-IIICJs intruding in Syrian airspace. According to modern Pakistani sources, Alvi and his flight leader engaged them, and after a brief dogfight, shot down one of the Mirages, flown by Captain M. Lutz. The Israeli pilot later succumbed to wounds he sustained during ejection. However, no major sources from the time reported on such an incident, and there is no mention of &quot;Captain Lutz&quot; in Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Defense&#x27;s record of Israel&#x27;s casualties of war.

Between the end of the Yom Kippur War and the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel received modern F-15s and F-16s which were far superior to the old Syrian MiG-21MFs. According to the IDF, these new aircraft shot down 24 Syrian MiG-21s over this period, though Syria did claim five IAF kills by MiG-21s armed with outdated K-13 missiles; Israel denied that it had suffered any losses.

The 1982 Lebanon War began on 6 June 1982, and during the conflict the IAF claimed to have destroyed about 45 Syrian MiG-21MFs. Syria confirmed the loss of 37 MiG-21s, including 24 MiG-21bis and 10 MiG-21MF downed and 2 MiG-21bis and 1 MiG-21MF written off Syria claimed two confirmed and 15 probable kills of Israeli aircraft. Two Israeli F-15s and one F-4 were damaged in combat with MiG-21s. In the largest air battle since the Korean War, one Israeli F-15 was heavily damaged by a Syrian MiG-21 firing a R-60 (missile), but was able to make back to base for repairs. 

===Syrian civil war===
Beginning in July 2012, at which point the Syrian civil war had lasted a year without aerial action, the Syrian Air Force started operations against Syrian insurgents. MiG-21s were among the first combat-ready aircraft used in bombings, rocket attacks and strafing runs, with numerous videos showing the attacks.

The rebels had access to heavy machine guns, different anti-aircraft guns and Russian and Chinese MANPADS, up to modern designs such as the FN-6. The first loss of a MiG-21 during the Syrian civil war was recorded on 30 August 2012. The MiG, registration number 2271, was likely downed by heavy machine gun fire on takeoff or landing at Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase, under siege by rebels. A few days later, on 4 September 2012, another MiG-21 (registration number 2280) was shot down in similar circumstances at the same base, also likely on takeoff or landing by rebels using by KPV 14.5 mm machine guns; the downing was recorded on video.

On 10 November 2014, Syrian Air Force MiG-21bis number 2204 was shot down, and its pilot killed, by rebels either using a MANPADS or antiaircraft guns, near the town of Sabburah, 45 km east of Hama Airbase where it was likely based. Video and photo evidence of the crash site later emerged.

Four months after a MiG-23 was shot down and during which time the Syrian Air Force suffered no losses from enemy fire, one of its MiG-21s was shot down on 12 March 2016 by the Jaysh al-Nasr faction over Hama near Kafr Nabudah. While the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, as suggested by video evidence, reported that the warplane had been downed by two MANPADS, Jaysh al-Nasr militants claimed to have shot it down with anti-aircraft guns. The pilot appeared to have bailed out of the stricken MiG, but died from ground fire or other causes.

On 4 March 2017, a Syrian MiG-21bis from No. 679 squadron, operating out of Hama Airbase and piloted by Col. Mohammad Sawfan, was shot down by Ahrar al-Sham rebels, crashing in Turkish territory near the border. Col. Sawfan successfully ejected but was arrested and taken to a hospital in Antakya, Turkey. A recording between the pilot and ground controller clearly showed Sawfan&#x27;s disorientation due to a malfunctioning compass, followed by a failure of the entire navigation system. He could not find his way back to base as ordered and inadvertently flew within range of rebel anti-aircraft guns. After being suspended for a number of years, Sawfan was allowed to return to service.

===Libyan–Egyptian War===
Egypt received American Sidewinder missiles, fitting them to their MiG-21s and successfully using them in combat against Libyan Mirages and MiG-23s during the brief Egyptian–Libyan War of July 1977.

===Iran–Iraq War===
During the Iran–Iraq War, 23 Iraqi MiG-21s were shot down by Iranian F-14s, as confirmed by Iranian, Western and Iraqi sources and another 29 Iraqi MiG-21s were downed by F-4s.
However, from 1980 to 1988, Iraqi MiG-21s shot down 43 Iranian fighter aircraft.

===Libya===
====Libyan Civil War (2011)====
Libyan MiG-21s saw limited service during the 2011 Libyan civil war. On 15 March 2011, one MiG-21bis and one MiG-21UM flown by defecting Libyan Air Force pilots flew from Ghardabiya Airbase near Sirte to Benina Airport to join the rebellion&#x27;s Free Libyan Air Force. On 17 March 2011, the MiG-21UM experienced a technical fault and crashed after taking off from Benina.

====Libyan Civil War (2014–2020)====
In the Second Libyan Civil War (2014–2020), the Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar is loyal to the legislative body in Tobruk, which is the Libyan House of Representatives, internationally recognised until October 2015. It fights against the now internationally recognized Government of National Accord and the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries as well as Islamic State in Libya which are common enemies for both the Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army. Both the Libyan National Army and the Government of National Accord field small airforces.
As such, a number of former Libyan Arab Air Force (LARAF) MiG-21s were returned to service with the Tobruk-based Libyan National Army, thanks to spare parts and technical assistance from Egypt and Russia, while a number of former Egyptian Air Force MiG-21s were pressed into service as well.
MiG-21s under the control of the Libyan House of Representatives have been used extensively to bomb forces loyal to the rival General National Congress in Benghazi during the 2014 Libyan Civil War.

On 29 August 2014, an LNA MiG-21bis, serial number 208, after a bombing mission over Derna, crashed in Bayda according to an official statement as a result of a technical failure of the plane, while Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries claimed it was shot down. The pilot did not eject and died in the crash.

On 2 September 2014 an LNA MiG-21bis, serial number 800, crashed in a city block of Tobruk, due to pilot error during a pull-up maneuver. It is unclear whether the pilot had been on a bombing mission on the way to Derna, further East, or had been performing an aerial ceremony for the MiG-21 pilot who died a few days earlier.

Part of the 2019 Western Libya offensive, on 9 April 2019, a Libyan National Army MiG-21 made a low altitude diving rocket attack, probably firing S-24 rockets on Mitiga airport in Tripoli, making limited damages to one of the runways.
On 14 April 2019, a Libyan National Army MiG-21MF was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, probably a MANPADS fired by the forces of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) south of Tripoli. Video evidence confirmed the MiG-21 came under fire from anti-aircraft guns, small arms and two SAMs, one of which apparently hit the target. The pilot, Colonel Jamal Ben Amer ejected safely and recovered to LNA-held territory by a Mi-35 helicopter. LNA sources confirmed the loss but blamed a technical problem.

===Horn of Africa===
During the Ogaden War of 1977–78, Ethiopian Air Force F-5As engaged Somali Air Force MiG-21MFs in combat on several occasions. In one lopsided incident, two F-5As piloted by Israeli advisers or mercenaries engaged four MiG-21MFs. The MiGs were handled incompetently by the Somali pilots, and the F-5As destroyed two while the surviving pilots collided with each other avoiding an AIM-9.

Ethiopia claimed to have shot down 10 Somali MiG-21MFs; while Somalia also claimed to have destroyed several Ethiopian MiG-21MFs, three F-5Es, one Canberra bomber and three Douglas DC-3s. Ethiopian MiG-21s were deployed largely in the ground attack role, and proved instrumental during the final offensive against Somali ground forces.

Ethiopian pilots who had flown both the F-5E and the MiG-21 and received training in both the US and the USSR considered the F-5 to be the superior fighter because of its manoeuvrability at low to medium speeds, its superior instrumentation and the fact that it was far easier to fly, allowing the pilot to focus on combat rather than controlling his airplane. This effect was enhanced by the poor quality of pilot training provided by the Soviets, which provided limited flight time and focussed exclusively on taking off and landing, with no practical training in air combat.

===Angola===
During Angola&#x27;s long-running civil war, MiG-21s of the Cuban Air Force were frequently deployed to attack ground targets manned by rebel forces or engage South African Air Force Mirage F1s conducting cross-border strikes. Most MiG-21 losses over Angola were attributed to accurate ground fire, such as an example downed by National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents near Luena with an American FIM-92 Stinger.

Despite extensive losses to man-portable air-defense systems, MiG-21s were instrumental during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale; Cuban pilots became accustomed to flying up to three sorties a day. Both the MiG-21MF and the MiG-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighter/bomber role. As interceptors, they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying South African aircraft. On 6 November 1981, a Mirage F1CZ achieved South Africa&#x27;s first confirmed air-to-air kill since the Korean War when it destroyed Cuban Lieutenant Danacio Valdez&#x27;s MiG-21MF with 30mm cannon fire. On 5 October 1982, Mirages escorting an English Electric Canberra on routine reconnaissance over Cahama were engaged by at least two MiG-21bis. A South African radar operator picked up the attacking MiGs and was able to alert the Mirage pilots in advance, instructing them to change course immediately. As they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks, however, they were pinpointed by the Cubans, who opened pursuit. In a vicious dogfight, SAAF Major John Rankin closed range and maneuvered into the MiGs&#x27; rear cones. From there, one of his two R.550 Magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead MiG and forced it down. The second aircraft, piloted by Lieutenant Raciel Marrero Rodriguez, could not detect the Mirage&#x27;s proximity until it had entered his turn radius and was perforated by Rankin&#x27;s autocannon. This damaged MiG-21 landed safely at Lubango.

Contacts between MiG-21s and SAAF Mirage F1s or Mirage IIIs became increasingly common throughout the 1980s. Between 1984 and 1988, thirteen MiG-21s were lost over Angola. On 9 August 1984, a particularly catastrophic accident occurred when the 9th Fighter Training Squadrons and the 12th Fighter Squadrons of the Cuban Air Force attempted to carry out an exercise in poor weather. A single MiG-21bis and three MiG-23s were lost. 

On 14 December 1988, an Angolan Air Force MiG-21bis, serial number C340, strayed off course and being low on fuel executed an emergency landing on an open field in South West Africa, modern-day Namibia, where it was seized by local authorities. Since Angola did not request its return after the South African Border War, the MiG was restored by Atlas Aviation and until September 2017 it was displayed at Swartkops Air Force Base, Pretoria. The jet was returned to Angola, flying in an Angolan Il-76 cargo plane, as a sign of goodwill on 15 September 2017.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
The MiG-21MFs of the 25th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the National Air Force of Angola flew ground sorties during the Second Congo War, sometimes being piloted by mercenaries. Some six MiG-21s were imported into the country during the First Congo War for the Congo Air Force, but do not appear to have seen operational service. (Cooper and Weinert, &quot;African MiGs: Volume 1: Angola to Ivory Coast&quot;).

===Yugoslavia===
Yugoslavia purchased its first batch of MiG-21s in 1962 from the Soviet Union. From 1962 to the early 1980s, Yugoslavia purchased 261 MiG-21s, of ten different variants. There were 41 MiG-21f-13, 36 MiG-21PfM, 25 MiG-21M, 6 MiG-21MF, 46 MiG-21bis, 45 MiG-21bisK, 12 MiG-21R, 18 MiG-21U, 25 MiG-21UM, and 7 MiG-21US. Yugoslav Air force units that operated MiG-21s were the 204th Fighter-Aviation Regiment at Batajnica Air Base (126th, 127th and 128th fighter-aviation squadrons), 117th fighter-aviation regiment at Željava Air Base (124th and 125th fighter-aviation squadron and 352nd recon squadron), 83rd fighter-aviation regiment at Slatina Air Base (123rd and 130th fighter aviation squadron), 185th fighter-bomber-aviation squadron (129th fighter-aviation squadron) at Pula and 129th training center at Batajnica air base.

During the early stages of the 1990s&#x27; Yugoslav wars, the Yugoslav military used MiG-21s in a ground-attack role, while Croatian and Slovene forces did not yet have air forces at that point in the conflict. Aircraft from air bases in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina were relocated to air bases in Serbia. Detailed records show at least seven MiG-21s were shot down by AA defenses in Croatia and Bosnia. A MiG-21 piloted by Serbian Yugoslav Air Force pilot shot down an EC helicopter in 1992.

Croatia acquired three MiG-21s in 1992 through defections by Croatian pilots serving with the JNA, two of which were lost in subsequent actions – one to Serbian air defenses, the other a friendly fire accident. In 1993, Croatia purchased about 40 MiG-21s in violation of an arms embargo, but only about 20 of these entered service, while the rest were used for spare parts. Croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations Flash (during which one was lost) and Storm. The only air-to-air action for Croatian MiGs was an attempt by two of them to intercept Soko J-22 Oraos of Republika Srpska&#x27;s air force on a ground attack mission on 7 August 1995. After some maneuvering, both sides disengaged without firing.

The remaining Yugoslav MiG-21s were flown to Serbia by 1992 and continued their service in the newly created Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, three MiG-21s were destroyed on the ground. The type continued to serve with the Serbian Air Force until 25 September 2020, when the country&#x27;s last active MiG-21 crashed in the village of Brasina, near Mali Zvornik, killing both pilots. The aircraft, a MiG-21UM that left the assembly line in December 1986, was the last MiG-21 ever produced in the Soviet Union.

===Romania===

In 1962, Romanian Air Force (RoAF) received the first 12 MiG-21F-13, followed by another 12 of the same variant in 1963. Deliveries continued over the next years with other variants: 38 aircraft of MiG-21RFM (PF) variant in 1965, 7 MiG-21U-400/600 in 1965–1968, 56 MiG-21RFMM (PFM) in 1966–1968, 12 MiG-21R in 1968–1972, 68 MiG-21M plus 11 MiG-21US in 1969–1970, 74 MiG-21MF/MF-75 in 1972–1975, and 27 MiG-21UM in 1972–1980 plus another 5 of the same variant in 1990, for a total number of 322 aircraft.

Beginning in 1993, Russia did not offer spare parts for the MiG-23 and MiG-29 for the RoAF. Initially, this was the context for the modernization of the Romanian MiG-21s with Elbit Systems, and because it was easier to maintain these fighter jets. In 1995–2002, a total of 111 MiG-21s were modernized, of which 71 were M and MF/MF-75 variants modernized under the LanceR A designation (for ground attack), 14 were UM variant as LanceR B designation (trainer), and another 26 MF/MF-75 variant were modernized under LanceR C designation (air superiority). Today, only 36 LanceRs are operational for the RoAF. It can use both Western and Eastern armament such as the R-60M, R-73, Magic 2, or Python III missiles.
The MiG-21s are to be retired in 2024, after another two F-16 squadrons will be ready following the purchase of 32 more F-16s from Norway. The first F-16 squadron was completed in 2021 with the arrival of the last F-16 purchased from Portugal.

Despite being one of the newest MiG-21 fleets in service, the Romanian MiG-21 LanceR fleet was grounded due to difficulties maintaining the aircraft, and since 1996 it has had an accident rate of over 30 per 100,000 hours. Serviceability rates below 50% are not uncommon.

The Romanian Air Force has suffered numerous events in recent years with its arsenal of MiG-21s. On 12 June 2017, a MiG-21 crashed in Constanța County, with Adrian Stancu, the pilot, managing to escape in time. On 7 July 2018, Florin Rotaru died during an airshow in Borcea with some 3,000 attendants while piloting a MiG-21 that suffered technical difficulties, choosing to deflect the plane and die to protect the attendants rather than ejecting himself in time. On 20 April 2021, during a training flight, a MiG-21 crashed in an uninhabited zone in Mureș County. The pilot, Andrei Criste, managed to eject safely and survived the crash.

On the March 2nd 2022, A MiG-21 LanceR crashed during adverse weather conditions near the village of Gura Dobrogei, Cogealac Commune. On 15 April 2022, the RoAF suspended all MiG-21 LanceR flights due to the high rate of accidents, and announced that it planned to speed up the acquisition of the ex-Norwegian F-16s. On 23 May, the LanceRs resumed flights for a period of one year, until 15 May 2023. On 15 May 2023, a retirement ceremony was held for the aircraft at the 71st Air Base, and at the 86th Air Base. From there, the MiG-21 took off to their final destination at the 95th Air Base.

===Bulgaria===
The Bulgarian Air Force received a total of 224 MiG-21 aircraft. From September 1963 the 19th Fighter Regiment of the Air Force received 12 MiG-21F-13s. Later some of these aircraft were converted for reconnaissance as MiG-21F-13Rs, which were submitted to the 26th Reconnaissance Regiment in 1988. In January 1965 the 18th Fighter Regiment received a squadron of 12 MiG-21PFs, some of which also were converted and used as reconnaissance aircraft (MiG-oboznachevnieto 21PFR). The 26 Regiment reconnaissance aircraft from this squadron were removed from service in 1991, the 15 Fighter Regiment in 1965 received another 12 MiG-21PF fighters and in 1977–1978 operated another 36 refurbished aircraft. This unit received two more aircraft in 1984 and operated them until 1992.
For reconnaissance, a regiment received 26 specialized reconnaissance MiG-21Rs in 1962, and in 1969–1970, 19 Fighter Aviation Regiment received 15 MiG-21m aircraft, which operated in 21 Fighter Aviation Regiment and were removed from active service in 1990. An additional 12 MiG-21MF fighters were received in 1974–1975, with a reconnaissance version of the MiG-21MFR provided to the 26th Reconnaissance Regiment and used until 2000, when removed from active service.

From 1983 to 1990, the Bulgaria Air Force received 72 MiG-21bis. Of these, 30 (six new and renovated) are under option with ACS and provided to the 19th Fighter Regiment; the rest are equipped with the &quot;Lazur&quot;. This batch was taken out of service in 2000.

Besides fighters, the Air Force has received 39 MiG-21U trainers (one in 1966), five MiG-21US in 1969–1970 and 27 MiG-21UM (new) during 1974–1980, another six refurbished ex-Soviet examples in 1990. In 1982, three MiG-21UM trainers were sold to Cambodia and in 1994 another 10 examples. MiG-21UMs were also sold to India. Other training aircraft were removed from active service in 2000. A total of 38 aircraft were lost in the period 1963–2000.

The last flight of a Bulgarian Air Force MiG-21 took off from Graf Ignatievo Air Base on 31 December 2015. On 18 December 2015, there was an official ceremony for the retirement of the type from active duty.

===Known MiG-21 aces===

Several pilots have attained ace status (five or more aerial victories/kills) while flying the MiG-21. Nguyễn Văn Cốc of the VPAF, who scored nine kills in MiG-21s is regarded as the most successful. Twelve other VPAF pilots were credited with five or more aerial victories while flying the MiG-21: Phạm Thanh Ngân, Nguyễn Hồng Nhị and Mai Văn Cường (both eight kills); Đặng Ngọc Ngự (seven kills), Vũ Ngọc Đỉnh, Nguyễn Ngọc Độ, Nguyễn Nhật Chiêu, Lê Thanh Đạo, Nguyễn Đăng Kỉnh, Nguyễn Đức Soát, and Nguyễn Tiến Sâm (six kills each), and Nguyễn Văn Nghĩa (five kills).

Additionally, three Syrian pilots are known to have attained ace status while flying the MiG-21. Syrian airmen: M. Mansour recorded five solo kills (with one additional probable), B. Hamshu scored five solo kills, and A. el-Gar tallied four solo and one shared kill, all three during the 1973–1974 engagements against Israel.

Due to the incomplete nature of available records, there are several pilots who have unconfirmed aerial victories (probable kills), which when confirmed would award them &quot;Ace&quot; Status: S. A. Razak of the Iraqi Air Force with four known kills scored during the Iran–Iraq War (until 1991; sometimes referred to as the Persian Gulf War), A. Wafai of the Egyptian Air Force with four known kills against Israel.

<doc id="61963" wikidata="Q516588" url="?curid=61963" title="List of Greek deities">
<text>Deities in ancient Greece were immortal, anthropomorphic, and powerful. They were conceived of as individual persons, rather than abstract concepts or ideas, and were described as being similar to humans in appearance, though they were considered larger and more beautiful. Though typically found in mythology and religion in an anthropomorphic visage, the gods were also capable of taking on the form of various animals. The emotions and actions of deities were largely the same as those of humans; they frequently engaged in sexual activity, and were fickle and amoral. Deities were considered far more knowledgeable than humans, and it was believed that they conversed in a language of their own. Their immortality, the most defining marker of their divinity, meant that, after having grown to a certain point, they did not age any further. In place of blood, their veins flowed with ichor, a substance which was a product of their diet, and conferred upon them their immortality. Divine power allowed the gods to intervene in mortal affairs in various ways; they could cause natural events such as rain, wind, the growing of crops, or epidemics, and were able to dictate the outcomes of complex human events, such as battles or political situations.

Ancient Greek religion was polytheistic, and a multiplicity of gods were venerated by the same groups and individuals. The identity of a deity is demarcated primarily by their name, though this name can also be accompanied by an epithet (or surname), which may refer to a specific function of the god, to an association with another deity, or to a local form of the divinity. Worship was the means by which the Greeks honoured their gods, as they believed deities had the power to bring to their lives various positive outcomes which were beyond their own control. Greek cult, or religious practice, consisted of activities such sacrifices, prayers, libations, festivals, and the building of temples. By the 8th century BC, most deities were honoured in sanctuaries (), sacred areas which often included included a temple and dining room, and which were typically dedicated to a single deity. The cult a of deity contributed to how they were viewed, based upon the kinds of sacrifices made in their honour, the relation of their rituals to the social order, and the location of their sanctuaries.

In addition to their name and cult, a god&#x27;s character was determined by their mythology (the collection of stories told about them), and their iconography (how they were depicted in ancient Greek art). Mythological stories about a deity told of their deeds (which may have related to their functions) and linked them, through genealogical connections, to other gods with similar functions. The most important surviving accounts of Greek mythology can be found in Homeric epic, which tells of encounters between gods and mortals, and Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, which explicates a genealogy of the gods. Some myths attempted to explain the origins of certain cult practices, while others may have arisen from rituals; myths known throughout Greece can also have differing local versions. Artistic representations allow us to understand how deities were depicted over time from the early archaic period, and works such as vase paintings can significantly predate literary sources. Art contributed to how the Greeks conceived of the gods, and depictions would often assign them certain symbols, such as the thunderbolt of Zeus or the trident of Poseidon.

The principal gods of the Greek pantheon were the twelve Olympians, who lived on Mount Olympus, and were connected to each other as part of a single family. Zeus was the chief god of the pantheon, though Athena and Apollo were honoured in a greater number of sanctuaries in major cities, and Dionysus is the deity who has received the most attention from modern scholars. Beyond the central divinities of the pantheon, the Greek gods were numerous. Some parts of the natural world, such as the earth, sea, or sun, were held as divine throughout Greece, though other natural deities, such the various nymphs and river gods, were primarily of local significance. Personifications of abstract concepts appeared frequently in Greek art and poetry, though many were also venerated in cult, with some being worshipped as early as the 6th century BC. Groups or societies of deities could be purely mythological in importance, such as the Titans, or they could be the subject of significant worship, such as the Muses or Charites.

==Major deities in Greek religion==
The following section is structured after Walter Burkert&#x27;s &quot;Greek Religion&quot;, particularly his section &quot;Chapter III: The Gods&quot;.

=== Twelve Olympians ===
=== Chthonic deities ===
* Hades (, &quot;Háidēs&quot;). King of the underworld and the dead. He is also a god of wealth. His consort is Persephone. His attributes are the drinking horn or cornucopia, key, sceptre, and the three-headed dog Cerberus. His sacred animals include the screech owl. He was one of three sons of Cronus and Rhea, and thus sovereign over one of the three realms of the universe, the underworld. As a chthonic god, however, his place among the Olympians is ambiguous. In the mystery religions and Athenian literature, Plouton (&quot;the Rich one&quot;) was his preferred name, because of the idea that all riches came from the earth. The term &quot;Hades&quot; was used in this literature to refer to the underworld itself. The Romans translated &quot;Plouton&quot; as Dis Pater (&quot;the Rich Father&quot;) or Pluto.
* Persephone (, &quot;Persephónē&quot;). Goddess of spring, Queen of the Underworld, wife of Hades and daughter of Demeter and Zeus. Her symbols include the pomegranate, grain, torches, wheat and the asphodelus. After her abduction by Hades, she was forced to split the year between the world of the dead with her husband and the world of the living with her mother. She was worshipped in conjunction with Demeter, especially in the Eleusinian Mysteries. In ancient art she is usually depicted as a young woman, usually in the scene of her abduction.

<doc id="61967" wikidata="Q1088842" url="?curid=61967" title="Detonator">
<text>A detonator is a device used to make an explosive or explosive device explode. Detonators come in a variety of types, depending on how they are initiated (chemically, mechanically, or electrically) and details of their inner working, which often involve several stages. Types of detonators include non-electric and electric. Non-electric detonators are typically stab or pyrotechnic while electric are typically &quot;hot wire&quot; (low voltage), exploding bridge wire (high voltage) or explosive foil (very high voltage). 

The original electric detonators invented in 1875 independently by Julius Smith and Perry Gardiner used mercury fulminate as the primary explosive. Around the turn of the century performance was enhanced in the Smith-Gardiner blasting cap by the addition of 10-20% potassium chlorate. This compound was superseded by others: lead azide, lead styphnate, some aluminium, or other materials such as DDNP (diazo dinitro phenol) to reduce the amount of lead emitted into the atmosphere by mining and quarrying operations. They also often use a small amount of TNT or tetryl in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.

==History==
The first blasting cap or detonator was demonstrated in 1745 when British physician and apothecary William Watson showed that the electric spark of a friction machine could ignite black powder, by way of igniting a flammable substance mixed in with the black powder.

In 1750, Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia made a commercial blasting cap consisting of a paper tube full of black powder, with wires leading in both sides and wadding sealing up the ends. The two wires came close but did not touch, so a large electric spark discharge between the two wires would fire the cap.

In 1832, a hot wire detonator was produced by American chemist Robert Hare, although attempts along similar lines had earlier been attempted by the Italians Volta and Cavallo. Hare constructed his blasting cap by passing a multistrand wire through a charge of gunpowder inside a tin tube; he had cut all but one fine strand of the multistrand wire so that the fine strand would serve as the hot bridgewire. When a strong current from a large battery (which he called a &quot;deflagrator&quot; or &quot;calorimotor&quot;) was passed through the fine strand, it became incandescent and ignited the charge of gunpowder.

In 1863, Alfred Nobel realized that although nitroglycerin could not be detonated by a fuse, it could be detonated by the explosion of a small charge of gunpowder, which in turn was ignited by a fuse. Within a year, he was adding mercury fulminate to the gunpowder charges of his detonators, and by 1867 he was using small copper capsules of mercury fulminate, triggered by a fuse, to detonate nitroglycerin.

In 1868, Henry Julius Smith of Boston introduced a cap that combined a spark gap ignitor and mercury fulminate, the first electric cap able to detonate dynamite.

In 1875, Smith—and then in 1887, Perry G. Gardner of North Adams, Massachusetts—developed electric detonators that combined a hot wire detonator with mercury fulminate explosive. These were the first generally modern type blasting caps. Modern caps use different explosives and separate primary and secondary explosive charges, but are generally very similar to the Gardner and Smith caps.

Smith also invented the first satisfactory portable power supply for igniting blasting caps: a high-voltage magneto that was driven by a rack and pinion, which in turn was driven by a T-handle that was pushed downwards.

Electric match caps were developed in the early 1900s in Germany, and spread to the US in the 1950s when ICI International purchased Atlas Powder Co. These match caps have become the predominant world standard cap type.

== Purpose ==

The need for detonators such as blasting caps came from the development of safer secondary and tertiary explosives . Secondary and tertiary explosives are typically initiated by an explosives train starting with the detonator. For safety, detonators and the main explosive device are typically only joined just before use.

== Design ==

A detonator is usually a multi stage device, with three parts:
# at the first stage, the initiation mean (fire, electricity, etc.) provide enough energy (as heat or mechanical shock) to activate
# an easy-to-ignite primary explosive, which in turn detonates
# a small amount of a more powerful secondary explosive, directly in contact with the primary, and called &quot;base&quot; or &quot;output&quot; explosive, able to carry out the detonation through the casing of the detonator to the main explosive device to activate it.

Explosives commonly used as primary in detonators include lead azide, lead styphnate, tetryl, and DDNP. Early blasting caps also used silver fulminate, but it has been replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives. Silver azide is still used sometimes, but very rarely due to its high price.

It is possible to construct a Non Primary Explosive Detonator (NPED) in which the primary explosive is replaced by a flammable but non-explosive mixture that propagates a shock wave along a tube into the secondary explosive. NPEDs are harder to accidentally trigger by shock and can avoid the use of lead.

As secondary &quot;base&quot; or &quot;output&quot; explosive, TNT or tetryl are typically found in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.

While detonators make explosive handling safer, they are hazardous to handle since, despite their small size, they contain enough explosive to injure people; untrained personnel might not recognize them as explosives or wrongly deem them not dangerous due to their appearance and handle them without the required care.

== Types ==

Ordinary detonators usually take the form of ignition-based explosives. While they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using a safety fuse, and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide [Pb(N3)2], silver azide [AgN3] and mercury fulminate [Hg(ONC)2].

There are three categories of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical detonators (IED), short period delay detonators (SPD) and long period delay detonators (LPD). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in nuclear weapons, exploding-bridgewire detonators are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an electric discharge. A new development is a slapper detonator, which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapons systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a laser pulse delivered to the foil by optical fiber.

A non-electric detonator is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) along the length of the tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. Non-electric detonators were invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973.

In civil mining, electronic detonators have a better precision for delays. Electronic detonators are designed to provide the precise control necessary to produce accurate and consistent blasting results in a variety of blasting applications in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Electronic detonators may be programmed in millisecond or sub-millisecond increments using a dedicated programming device.

Wireless electronic detonators are beginning to be available in the civil mining market. Encrypted radio signals are used to communicate the blast signal to each detonator at the correct time. While currently expensive, wireless detonators can enable new mining techniques as multiple blasts can be loaded at once and fired in sequence without putting humans in harm&#x27;s way.

A number 8 test blasting cap is one containing 2 grams of a mixture of 80 percent mercury fulminate and 20 percent potassium chlorate, or a blasting cap of equivalent strength. An equivalent strength cap comprises 0.40-0.45 grams of PETN base charge pressed in an aluminum shell with bottom thickness not to exceed to 0.03 of an inch, to a specific gravity of not less than 1.4 g/cc, and primed with standard weights of primer depending on the manufacturer.

== Blasting caps ==
The oldest and simplest type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end. From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a pyrotechnic fuse is inserted and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a primary explosive, and then the main detonating explosive charge. The primary hazard of pyrotechnic blasting caps is that for proper usage, the fuse must be inserted and then crimped into place by crushing the base of the cap around the fuse. If the tool used to crimp the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping. A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with one&#x27;s teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth. Fuse type blasting caps are still in active use today. They are the safest type to use around certain types of electromagnetic interference, and they have a built in time delay as the fuse burns down.

Solid pack electric blasting caps use a thin bridgewire in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a primary explosive, which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation of the primary explosive. That primary explosive then detonates a larger charge of secondary explosive. Some solid pack fuses incorporate a small pyrotechnic delay element, up to a few hundred milliseconds, before the cap fires.

Match type blasting caps use an electric match (insulating sheet with electrodes on both sides, a thin bridgewire soldered across the sides, all dipped in ignition and output mixes) to initiate the primary explosive, rather than direct contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive. The match can be manufactured separately from the rest of the cap and only assembled at the end of the process. Match type caps are now the most common type found worldwide.

The exploding-bridgewire detonator was invented in the 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons. The design goal was to produce a detonator which functioned very rapidly and predictably). Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Exploding bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, .04 inch long, .0016 diameter, (1 mm long, 0.04 mm diameter). Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrically-driven explosion causes the low-density initiating explosive (usually PETN) to detonate, which in turn detonates a higher density secondary explosive (typically RDX or HMX) in many EBW designs. In addition to firing very quickly when properly initiated, EBW detonators are much safer than blasting caps from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current will melt the bridgewire, but it cannot detonate the initiator explosive without the full high-voltage high-current charge passing through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric detonators.
Exploding foil initiators (EFI), also known as Slapper detonators are an improvement on EBW detonators. Slappers, instead of directly using the exploding foil to detonate the initiator explosive, use the electrical vaporization of the foil to drive a small circle of insulating material such as PET film or kapton down a circular hole in an additional disc of insulating material. At the far end of that hole is a pellet of high-density secondary explosive. Slapper detonators omit the low-density initiating explosive used in EBW designs and they require much greater energy density than EBW detonators to function, making them inherently safer.

Laser initiation of explosives, propellants or pyrotechnics has been attempted in three different ways, (1) direct interaction with the HE or Direct Optical Initiation (DOI); (2) rapid heating of a thin film in contact with a HE; and (3) ablating a thin metal foil to produce a high velocity flyer plate that impacts the HE (laser flyer).

<doc id="61970" wikidata="Q2264130" url="?curid=61970" title="Trichuriasis">
<text>Trichuriasis, also known as whipworm infection, is an infection by the parasitic worm &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; (whipworm). If the infection is only with a few worms, there are often no symptoms. In those who are infected with many worms, there may be abdominal pain, fatigue and diarrhea. The diarrhea sometimes contains blood. Infections in children may cause poor intellectual and physical development. Low red blood cell levels may occur due to loss of blood.
The disease usually spreads when people eat food or drink water containing these worms&#x27; eggs. This may occur when contaminated vegetables are not fully cleaned or cooked. Often these eggs are in the soil in areas where people defecate outside and where untreated human feces is used as fertilizer. These eggs originate from the feces of infected people. Young children playing in such soil and putting their hands in their mouths also become infected easily. The worms live in the large bowel and are about four centimetres in length. Whipworm is diagnosed by seeing the eggs when examining the stool with a microscope. Eggs are barrel-shaped. Trichuriasis belongs to the group of soil-transmitted helminthiases.
Prevention is by properly cooking food and hand washing before cooking. Other measures include improving access to sanitation such as ensuring use of functional and clean toilets and access to clean water. In areas of the world where the infections are common, often entire groups of people will be treated all at once and on a regular basis. Treatment is with three days of the medication: albendazole, mebendazole or ivermectin. People often become infected again after treatment.
Whipworm infection affected about 464 million in 2015. It is most common in tropical countries. Those infected with whipworm often also have hookworm and ascariasis infections. These diseases have a large effect on the economy of many countries. Work is ongoing to develop a vaccine against the disease. Trichuriasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
Light infestations (&lt;100 worms) frequently have no symptoms. Heavier infestations, especially in small children, can present gastrointestinal problems including abdominal pain and distension, bloody or mucus-filled diarrhea, and tenesmus (feeling of incomplete defecation, generally accompanied by involuntary straining). Mechanical damage to the intestinal mucosa, and toxic, or inflammatory damage to the host&#x27;s intestines may occur. While appendicitis may be brought on by damage and edema of the adjacent tissue, if there are large numbers of worms or larvae present, it has been suggested that the embedding of the worms into the ileocecal region may also make the host susceptible to bacterial infection. A severe infection with high numbers of embedded worms in the rectum leads to edema, which can cause rectal prolapse, although this is typically only seen in small children. The prolapsed, inflamed, and edematous rectal tissue may even show visible worms.

Physical growth delay, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and anemia (due to long-standing blood loss) are also characteristic of infection, and these symptoms are more prevalent and severe in children. It can cause eosinophilia but it is not common.

Coinfection of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; with other parasites is common and with larger worm burdens can cause both exacerbations of dangerous trichuriasis symptoms such as massive gastrointestinal bleeding (shown to be especially dramatic with coinfection with &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;) and exacerbation of symptoms and pathogenesis of the other parasitic infection (as is typical with coinfection with &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot;, in which higher worm burden and liver egg burden is common). Parasitic coinfection with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is also common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and helminth coinfection adversely affects the natural history and progression of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and can increase clinical malaria severity. In a study performed in Senegal, infections of soil-transmitted helminths like &quot;T. trichiura&quot; (as well as schistosome infections independently) showed enhanced risk and increased the incidence of malaria.

Heavy infestations may have bloody diarrhea. Long-standing blood loss may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin A deficiency may also result due to infection.

==Cause==
Trichuriasis is caused by a parasitic worm also known as a helminth called &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;. It belongs to the genus &quot;Trichuris&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Trichocephalus&quot;, meaning hair head, which would be a more accurate name; however the generic name is now &quot;Trichuris&quot;, which means hair tail (implying that the posterior end of the worm is the attenuated section). Infections by parasitic worms are known as helminthiasis.

===Reservoir===
Humans are the main, but not the only reservoir for &quot;T. trichiura&quot;. Recent research verified by the application of molecular techniques (PCR) that dogs are a reservoir for &quot;T. trichiura&quot;, as well as &quot;T. vulpis&quot;.

===Vector===
Non-biting cyclorrhaphan flies (&quot;Musca domestica&quot;, &quot;M. sorbens&quot;, &quot;Chrysomya rufifacies&quot;, &quot;C. bezziana&quot;, &quot;Lucina cuprina&quot;, &quot;Calliphora vicina&quot; and &quot;Wohlfarthia magnifica&quot;) have been found to carry &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;. A study in two localized areas in Ethiopia found cockroaches were carriers for several human intestinal parasites, including &quot;T. trichiura&quot;.

===Transmission===
Humans can become infected with the parasite due to ingestion of infective eggs by mouth contact with hands or food contaminated with egg-carrying soil. However, there have also been rare reported cases of transmission of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; by sexual contact. Some major outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (due to presumed soil contamination).

===Life cycle===
Unembryonated eggs (unsegmented) are passed in the feces of a previous host to the soil. In the soil, these eggs develop into a 2-cell stage (segmented egg) and then into an advanced cleavage stage. Once at this stage, the eggs embryonate and then become infective, a process that occurs in about 15 to 30 days). Next, the infective eggs are ingested by way of soil-contaminated hands or food and hatch inside the small intestine, releasing larvae into the gastrointestinal tract. These larvae burrow into a villus and develop into adults (over 2–3 days). They then migrate into the cecum and ascending colon where they thread their anterior portion (whip-like end) into the tissue mucosa and reside permanently for their year-long lifespan. About 60 to 70 days after infection, female adults begin to release unfertilized eggs (oviposit) into the cecum at a rate of 3,000 to 20,000 eggs per day, linking the life cycle to the start.

===Incubation period===
* The exact incubation period of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; is unknown, however, immature eggs in soil under favorable conditions take about three weeks to mature: 15–30 days, 10 days minimum to mature before ideal ingestion by the human host. Favorable conditions for maturation of eggs are warm to temperate climates with adequate humidity or precipitation, as ova are resistant to cold, but not resistant to drying.
* Once ingested, the larva will remain dug into a villus in the small intestine for about 2–3 days until it is fully developed for migration to the ileocecal section of the gastrointestinal tract.
* The average total life span of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; is one year, although there have been longer cases reported, lasting as long as five years (Note: inadequate treatment and re-infection are likely to play a role in this).

===Morphology===
Adult worms are usually long, with females being larger than males as is typical of nematodes. The thin, clear majority of the body (the anterior, whip-like end) is the esophagus, and it is the end that the worm threads into the mucosa of the colon. The widened, pinkish-gray region of the body is the posterior, and it is the end that contains the parasite&#x27;s intestines and reproductive organs.
&quot;T. trichiura&quot; eggs are prolate spheroids, the shape of the balls used in Rugby and Gridiron football. They are about long and have polar plugs (also known as refractile prominences) at each end.

==Diagnosis==
A stool ova and parasites exam reveals the presence of typical whipworm eggs. Typically, the Kato-Katz thick-smear technique is used for identification of the &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; eggs in the stool sample. Trichuria eggs often appear larger and more swollen on Kato-Katz preparation compared to when using other techniques.

Although colonoscopy is not typically used for diagnosis, as the adult worms can be overlooked, especially with an imperfect colon, there have been reported cases in which colonoscopy has revealed adult worms. Colonoscopy can directly diagnose trichuriasis by identification of the threadlike form of worms with an attenuated, whip-like end. Colonoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool, especially in patients infected with only a few male worms and with no eggs presenting in the stool sample.

Trichuriasis can be diagnosed when &quot;T. trichiura&quot; eggs are detected in stool examination. Eggs will appear barrel-shaped and unembryonated, having bipolar plugs and a smooth shell. Rectal prolapse can be diagnosed easily using defecating proctogram and is one of many methods for imaging the parasitic infection. Sigmoidoscopies show characteristic white bodies of adult worms hanging from inflamed mucosa (&quot;coconut cake rectum&quot;).

==Prevention==

=== Deworming ===
Limited access to essential medicine has made the eradication of trichuriasis worldwide challenging. Also, it is a public health concern that rates of post-treatment re-infection need to be determined and addressed to diminish the incidence of untreated re-infection. Lastly, with mass drug administration strategies improved diagnosis, and prompt treatment, the detection of an emergence of antihelminthic drug resistance should be examined.

Mass Drug Administration (preventative chemotherapy) has had a positive effect on the disease burden of trichuriasis in East and West Africa, especially among children, who are at highest risk for infection.

=== Sanitation ===
Infection can be avoided by proper disposal of human feces, avoiding fecal contamination of food, not eating soil, and avoiding crops fertilized with untreated human feces. Simple and effective proper hygiene such as washing hands and food is recommended for control.

Improved facilities for feces disposal have decreased the incidence of whipworm. Handwashing before food handling, and avoiding ingestion of soil by thorough washing of food that may have been contaminated with egg-containing soil are other preventive measures. In addition to washing, it is also advisable to peel and/or cook fruits and vegetables. Improvement of sanitation systems, as well as improved facilities for feces disposal, have helped to limit defecation onto soil and contain potentially infectious feces from bodily contact.

A study in a Brazilian urban centre demonstrated a significant reduction in the prevalence and incidence of soil-transmitted helminthiasis, including trichuriasis, following the implementation of a citywide sanitation program. A 33% reduction in the prevalence of trichuriasis and a 26% reduction in the incidence of trichuriasis was found in a study performed on 890 children ages 7–14 years old within 24 different sentinel areas chosen to represent the varied environmental conditions throughout the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Control of soil fertilizers has helped eliminate the potential for contact with human fecal matter and fertilizer in the soil.

==Treatment==
Trichuriasis is treated with benzimidazole anthelmintic agents such as albendazole or mebendazole, sometimes in conjunction with other medications.

Mebendazole is 90% effective in the first dose. Higher clearance rates can be obtained by combining mebendazole or albendazole with ivermectin. The safety of ivermectin in children under and pregnant women has not yet been established.

In people with diarrhea, loperamide may be added to increase the contact time between anthelmintic agents and the parasites. Oral iron supplementation may be useful in treating the iron-deficiency anemia which often accompanies trichuriasis.

==Epidemiology==
=== Regions ===
Infection of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; is most frequent in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices. Trichuriasis occurs frequently in areas in which untreated human feces is used as fertilizer or where open defecation takes place. Trichuriasis infection prevalence is 50 to 80 percent in some regions of Asia (noted especially in China and Korea) and also occurs in rural areas of the southeastern United States.

=== Infection estimates ===
&quot;T. trichiura&quot; is the third most common nematode (roundworm) infecting humans. Infection is most prevalent among children, and in North America, infection occurs frequently in immigrants from tropical or sub-tropical regions. It is estimated that 600–800 million people are infected worldwide, with 3.2 billion individuals at risk because they live in regions where this intestinal worm is common.

==History==
The first written record of &quot;T. trichiura&quot; was made by the Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, who identified the presence of the parasite in a case of worms residing in the colon in 1740. An exact morphological description and accurate drawings were first recorded in 1761 by Johann Georg Roederer, a German physician. Soon after, the name &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; was given to this species.

==Synonyms==
Human whipworm, trichocephaliasis, and tricuriasis are all synonyms for trichuriasis, human infection of the &quot;T. trichiura&quot; intestinal nematode. In Spanish, trichuriasis is called tricuriasis, while it is known as trichuriose in French and Peitschenwurmbefall in German.

== Research ==
Development of subunit vaccines requires the identification of protective antigens and their formulation in a suitable adjuvant. &quot;Trichuris muris&quot; is an antigenically similar laboratory model for &quot;T. trichiura&quot;. Subcutaneous vaccination with adult excretory-secretory products (ES) protects susceptible mouse strains from &quot;T. muris&quot;. Larval stages may contain novel and more relevant antigens which when incorporated in a vaccine induce worm expulsion earlier in infection than the adult worm products. Nematode vaccines marketed to date have been of the irradiated larval type and used exclusively for the treatment of animals. These vaccines are unstable and require annual production, involving the yearly production and sacrifice of donor animals for passage. There has been much interest in producing subunit vaccines against human and agricultural parasites since the early 1980s. Development of subunit vaccines requires the identification of protective antigens and their formulation with a suitable adjuvant to stimulate the immune response appropriately.

<doc id="61972" wikidata="Q348947" url="?curid=61972" title="Tartar sauce">
<text>Tartar sauce (; often spelled tartare sauce in the UK, Ireland, and Commonwealth countries) is a condiment made of mayonnaise, chopped pickles or relish, capers, and herbs such as tarragon and dill. Tartar sauce can also be enhanced with other herbs, lemon juice, and olives. It is most often served with seafood dishes such as fish and chips, fish sandwiches, fish fingers, fried oysters, and calamari.

==Composition==
Tartar sauce is based on either mayonnaise or aioli, with certain other ingredients added. In the UK, recipes typically add to the base capers, gherkins, lemon juice, and dill. US recipes may include chopped dill pickles, onions (or chives), and fresh parsley; many around the world combine elements of both. Chopped hard-boiled eggs or olives are sometimes added, as may be Dijon mustard and cocktail onions. Hungarian variants may include sour cream (or plain cream), powdered sugar, white pepper and white wine, besides the other core ingredients.

== History ==
Tartar sauce is named for steak tartare (and thus ultimately named for the Tatars), with which it was commonly served in 19th century France. Recipes for tartar sauce have been found in English-language cookbooks dating to the mid-19th century, including a recipe in &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; in 1860. It was also popular in Hungary in the late 19th century.

<text>Onobrychis viciifolia, also known as O. sativa or common sainfoin () was an important forage legume in temperate regions until the 1950s. During the Green Revolution it was replaced by high yielding alfalfa and clover species. Due to its anthelmintic properties, common sainfoin is a natural alternative to drugs to control nematode parasitism in the guts of small ruminants. This is the main reason why &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; returned to the scientific agenda in recent years.

== Biological, ecological and biochemical properties ==
The genus &quot;Onobrychis&quot; comprises 54 different species of which &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is of greatest agronomic importance. Two different agricultural types of &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; are known. The single-cut type is characterized by a vegetative regrowth after cutting and its origin is in Europe. A generative regrowth after cutting is typical for the second or the double-cut type. Originated in the Middle East the double-cut type grows larger than the single-cut type. Compared to other forage legumes both types are weak in competition and their regrowth after mowing is considered to be low. Also the yields of common sainfoin are significantly lower than those of alfalfa and clover.

In terms of symbiotic nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, common sainfoin is not as specific as other legumes. A relatively broad range of rhizobia genera is able to colonize the roots of &quot;O. viciifolia&quot;.
The common sainfoin is an open pollinating plant, mainly pollinated by nectar feeding insects. Therefore, &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is a promising crop to enhance biodiversity within agro-ecosystems. This pollination biology leads to certain difficulties in breeding programs resulting in a low number of registered cultivars.
The leaves of common sainfoin contain high levels of condensed tannins. This content can be more than five times higher than in clover species or alfalfa .

== Beneficial aspects in animal production ==

An animal diet containing common sainfoin is able to reduce nematode (e.g. &quot;Haemonchus contortus&quot;) parasitism in ruminant’s guts. Due to the high levels of condensed tannins, the fecundity of nematodes and the number of their eggs in the ruminant’s digestive system are reduced. Especially in goat and sheep production systems feeding of &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is a promising alternative or complement to synthetic drugs.
Besides these anthelmintic properties diets containing common sainfoin can lead to increasing daily weight gains of small ruminants. Also milk quantity and quality of these animals are not negatively affected by &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; intake. Furthermore, various studies showed that the voluntary intake of sainfoin was comparable or even higher than the intake of alfalfa or clover species.

== Cultivation of &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; ==

To reach high levels of condensed tannins common sainfoin should be sown in pure culture. Due to its low competitiveness, weed infestation has to be controlled, especially in the first year. Normally fertilizer applications are not needed to reach satisfying yields. Nevertheless, slurry or phosphate applications can promote initial growth. Pests and diseases are almost never a serious problem.
Frost and drought tolerance of common sainfoin is higher than in other forage legumes such as alfalfa or different clover species. In contrast, &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is much more intolerant to water logging than other forage legumes. Therefore, clayey soils with a bad drainage should be avoided. Also acidic soils are not appropriate for the cultivation of common sainfoin.

Seedbed preparation and sowing procedure are done in a similar manner and with the same machinery as for cereal cultivation. Around 800 seeds per square meter should be sown on a weed free seedbed between spring and late summer. In the year of establishment common sainfoin can be cut twice a year. Afterwards up to four cuts per growing season are possible. Careful mowing is important to minimize disintegration losses. Common sainfoin can be stored and fed to animals in the form of hay, pellets or silage.

<text>Bridalveil Fall is one of the most prominent waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley in California. 
The waterfall is in height and flows year round.

==Geology==

The glaciers that carved Yosemite Valley left many hanging valleys that spawned the waterfalls that pour into the valley. Most of the waterways that fed these falls carved the hanging valleys into steep cascades, but Bridalveil Creek still leaps into the valley from the edge of the precipice, although that edge has moved back into an alcove from the original edge of the valley. While Yosemite Falls seem to also fall into this category, the original course took the Yosemite Creek down a gorge to the west of its current location.

The primary source of Bridalveil Fall is Ostrander Lake, some to the south.

In a brisk wind, the falling water is often blown sideways, and when the flow is light, it may not reach the ground directly below. Because of this, the Ahwahneechee Native Americans called this waterfall &quot;Pohono&quot;, which means &quot;Spirit of the Puffing Wind&quot;. On August 5, 1856, newspaper editor Warren Baer suggested the name Bridalveil Fall, inspired by its delicate, lacy appearance in late summer.

<doc id="61976" wikidata="Q358966" url="?curid=61976" title="Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class aircraft carrying cruiser (Russian: Авиано́сцы ти́па «Кузнецо́в» &quot;Avianо́stsii Tipa &quot;Kuznetsо́v&quot;&quot;), Soviet designation Project 1143.5, is a class of STOBAR aircraft carriers operated by the Russian and Chinese navies. Originally designed for the Soviet Navy, the &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ships use a ski-jump for launching high-performance jet aircraft and arrestor gears for landing. The design represented a major advance in Soviet fleet aviation over the carriers, which do not have full-length flight deck and could only launch VSTOL aircraft. The Soviet Union&#x27;s classification for the class was as a heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser, which permits the ships to transit the Turkish Straits without violating the Montreux Convention. However, the Chinese variants are classified as aircraft carriers.

Because of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the three &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ships were built over a protracted construction period of almost four decades. Two ships were originally laid down at the Nikolayev South Shipyard in the Ukrainian SSR, to be followed by the first of the &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot;-class nuclear-powered supercarriers. Only the lead ship had been commissioned when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the ship now serves in the Russian Navy. Construction of her sister ship &quot;Varyag&quot; was abandoned until 1998, when an independent Ukraine sold the uncompleted ship to China for use as a floating casino, along with a complete set of design blueprints. After a protracted towed journey through three different oceans, &quot;Varyag&quot; arrived at the Dalian Shipyard and was eventually completed and commissioned in 2012 as China&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, the Type 001 aircraft carrier . China subsequently constructed a third ship to a modified Type 002 design, commissioning in 2019.

==Role==
The &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ships were described by their Soviet builders as &quot;Tyazholiy Avianesushchiy Kreyser&quot; (TAKR or TAVKR) – &quot;heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser&quot; – intended to support and defend strategic missile-carrying submarines, surface ships, and maritime missile-carrying aircraft of the Soviet fleet. In its fleet defense role, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;″s P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 NATO reporting name: &quot;Shipwreck&quot;) anti-ship cruise missiles, 3K95 Kinzhal (&quot;Gauntlet&quot;) surface-to-air missiles, and Su-33 (&quot;Flanker-D&quot;) aircraft are its main weapons. The fixed-wing aircraft on &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; are intended for air superiority operations to protect a deployed task force. The carrier also carries numerous helicopters for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search and rescue (SAR) operations.

===Transiting the Turkish Straits===

The Russian naval system classifies its &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ship as a heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser because it was fitted with long-range anti-ship cruise missiles. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, aircraft carriers heavier than 15,000 tons may not pass through the Turkish Straits. Since &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; exceeds the displacement limit, it would have been confined to the Black Sea if it had been classified as an aircraft carrier. However, there is no tonnage restriction on other capital ships operated by Black Sea Powers. Turkey has allowed to pass through the Straits, and no other signatory to the Montreux Convention has objected to its designation as an aircraft cruiser.

The Chinese Navy regards its Type 001 ships as aircraft carriers.
The Chinese aircraft carrier &quot;Liaoning&quot; is armed with air-defense weapons, but it is not equipped with the anti-ship or anti-submarine missiles that are on &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;. Instead, the hangar bay was extended to carry more aircraft.

== History ==

In October 1978 the Soviet government decided to continue the production of additional Project 1143 (&quot;Kiev&quot;-class) aircraft carriers, with the fifth vessel built with improved features like catapults and arresting gear. This resulted in the Project 1143.5 (&quot;Kuznetsov&quot; class) plan created by the Nevskoye Bureau and approved at the end of 1979. As originally planned, Project 1143.5 was to have a full load displacement of 65,000 tons, CATOBAR capability, and an air wing based around fixed-wing aircraft and Kamov helicopters. However, by 1980 Soviet defense minister Dmitry Ustinov ordered the deletion of the catapults, reduction of the ship&#x27;s displacement by 10,000 tons, and revision of the air component toward VSTOL aircraft. The design was revised to support only VSTOL aircraft under the project name &quot;Nitka&quot;, but then was revised again to its final configuration to provide for fixed-wing aircraft by adding a 12-degree ski-jump.

==Design==

===Hull and flight deck===
The hull design is derived from the 1982 , but is larger in both length and beam. The &quot;Kiev&quot;-class ships had only an angled flight deck, with surface weaponry on the foredeck. The &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; class is the first Soviet carrier to be designed with a full-length flight deck. The ship&#x27;s 12 anti-ship cruise missiles are located in launchers below the flight deck, just aft of the ski-jump.

The aircraft carriers are of a STOBAR configuration: Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery. Short take-off is achieved by using a 12-degree ski-jump on the bow. There is also an angled recovery deck with arresting wires, allowing aircraft to land without interfering with launching aircraft. The flight deck has a total area of . Two aircraft elevators, on the starboard side forward and aft of the island, move aircraft between the hangar deck and the flight deck.

===Air wing===
In the original project specifications, the ship should be able to carry up to 33 fixed-wing aircraft and 12 helicopters . The primary aircraft carried are Sukhoi Su-33 fighters, naval variants of the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker. Kamov Ka-27 naval utility helicopters (and subsequent variants) make up the helicopter wing, providing anti-submarine, maritime patrol and naval assault mobility capabilities. In addition, the Kamov Ka-52K &quot;Katran&quot; attack helicopter, a naval variant of the Kamov Ka-50, can also be included in its air wing.

===Armament===

The &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ships were originally designed as aircraft cruisers. &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; carried twelve launchers for P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 &quot;Shipwreck&quot;) anti-ship surface-to-surface missiles, which also form the main armament of the s. The Granits were stored in 12 vertical launchers located beneath the ship&#x27;s front deck, just before the inclined ski-jump. The top deck hatches of these launchers open to fire the missiles; however, when open they prevent the simultaneous launch of aircraft. &quot;Kuznetsov&#x27;s&quot; heavy surface armament differs from that of other countries&#x27; aircraft carriers, which carry only defensive armament and rely on their aircraft for strike power.

For long-range air defense, &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; carries 24 vertical Tor missile system (SA-N-9 &quot;Gauntlet&quot;) surface-to-air missile launchers, with 192 missiles. For close-range air defense, the ship carries eight Kashtan close-in weapon system (CIWS) mounts. Each mount has two launchers for 9M311 SAMs, twin GSh-30 30 mm rotary cannons, and a radar/optronic director. The ship also carries six AK-630 30 mm rotary cannons in single mounts. For defense against underwater attack, the ship carries the UDAV-1 ASW rocket launcher.

The Russian Navy reportedly removed the Granit missile tubes in the late 2000s to make room for a larger hangar bay, but it was never clear that the tubes were ever actually removed. During a major overhaul set to begin in September 2017, the P-700 tubes were to be replaced with new vertical launch tubes capable of housing newer Kalibr and P-800 Oniks cruise missiles. Air defense upgrades would include replacement of the Kashtan CIWS with the Pantsir-M and the 3K95 Kinzhal/Tor system with the Poliment-Redut system.

===Electronics===
&quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; has D/E band air and surface target acquisition radar (passive electronically scanned array), F band surface search radar, G/H band flight control radar, I band navigation radar, and four K band fire-control radars for the Kashtan CIWS.

The ship has hull-mounted medium- and low-frequency search and attack sonar. The ASW helicopters have surface search radar, dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and magnetic anomaly detectors.

===Propulsion and performance===
&quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; is conventionally powered by mazut fuelled steam boilers which feed four steam turbines, each producing , driving four shafts with fixed-pitch propellers. The maximum speed is , and her range at maximum speed is . At , her maximum economical range is .

===Reliability===

&quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; has been plagued by years of technical problems. The vessel&#x27;s steam turbines and turbo-pressurised boilers have been reported to be so unreliable that the carrier is accompanied by a large ocean-going tug whenever it deploys, in case it breaks down. There are also flaws in the water piping system, which causes it to freeze during winter. To prevent pipes from bursting, the water is turned off in most of the cabins, and half the latrines do not work.

===Type 001 design changes===

The Chinese Type 001 ships are configured as aircraft carriers. The cruise missile launchers were never installed, and the launcher base was removed during the refit to incorporate a larger hangar bay. The air-defense system consists of FL-3000N surface-to-air-missiles and the Type 1130 CIWS.

===Type 002 design changes===

Several design changes were made to the Type 002 aircraft carrier. Length, width, and displacement have been slightly increased. The island of the ship has been reduced in size to increase the size of the flight deck, and it carries a 3-D phased array radar. The ship claims it can carry 36 aircraft instead of the 24 J-15 fighters carried by &quot;Liaoning&quot;.

==Ships==

===&quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;===


&quot;Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov&quot; was designed by the Neva Design Bureau, St. Petersburg, and built at the Nikolayev South Shipyard (Chernomorskoye Shipyard) in the Ukrainian SSR. She was launched in 1985, commissioned in 1990, and became fully operational in 1995. The vessel was named &quot;Riga&quot;, &quot;Leonid Brezhnev&quot;, and &quot;Tbilisi&quot;, before finally being named after Soviet admiral Nikolay Kuznetsov.

During the winter of 1995–1996, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to mark the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. In late 2000, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; went to sea for recovery and salvage operations for the submarine . In late 2007 and early 2008, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; again deployed to the Mediterranean. Most recently, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean in late 2016 and early 2017 to support Russian operations in Syria.

&quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; started an overhaul and modernization program in the first quarter of 2017 to extend its service life by 25 years, but several setbacks have hampered this effort. Prior to a December 2022 fire the overhaul of the carrier was projected to last into 2024.

 the non-operational &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; is the Russian Navy&#x27;s only carrier leaving the Russian Navy without an operational aircraft carrier. Reports that the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;&#x27;s crew of 1500 has been reassigned to the Russian Army for combat duty in Ukraine have fueled speculation that there is no plan to make &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; seaworthy again.

===&quot;Liaoning&quot;===


The second member of the &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; class took a much more roundabout route to active service. Known first as &quot;Riga&quot; and then &quot;Varyag&quot;, she was laid down by the Nikolayev South Shipyard in 1985 and launched in 1988. &quot;Varyag&quot; had not yet been commissioned when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the ship was left to deteriorate in the elements. In 1998, the unfinished hull was sold by Ukraine to what was apparently a Chinese travel agency for ostensible use as a floating hotel and casino. After an eventful journey under tow, she arrived in China in February 2002 and was berthed at the Dalian naval shipyard, where she was overhauled and completed as China&#x27;s first aircraft carrier.

In September 2012, the ship was commissioned in the Chinese navy as &quot;Liaoning&quot;. The ship was named after the province where the shipyard is located, and its Chinese ship class is Type 001. Today, she serves as the first aircraft carrier of the PLAN, and its home port is Qingdao.

===&quot;Shandong&quot;===

The second Chinese aircraft carrier was constructed in China according to a modified design, known as Type 002. The ship was laid down in 2013 at the Dalian naval shipyard and was launched on 26 April 2017. Sea trials began on 13 May 2018, and the ship was commissioned as &quot;Shandong&quot; on 17 December 2019.

<text>Onobrychis, the sainfoins, are a genus of Eurasian perennial herbaceous plants of the legume family (Fabaceae). About 206 species are presently accepted. The Flora Europaea lists 23 species of &quot;Onobrychis&quot;; the main centre of diversity extends from Central Asia to Iran, with 56 species – 27 of which are endemic – in the latter country alone. &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is naturalized throughout many countries in Europe and North America grasslands on calcareous soils.

==Description==
The leaves are pinnate, alternate, with 6 to 14 pairs of oblong to linear leaflets. Sainfoins have pale pink flowers, typically blooming between June and September and pollinated by honey bees and solitary bees. The rounded single-seeded pods bear prominent spikes or similar protrusions in many species, enabling them to cling to the fur of large mammals and be thus distributed.

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Onobrychis&quot; means &quot;devoured by donkeys&quot;, from Ancient Greek (, &quot;donkey&quot;) and (, &quot;to eat greedily&quot;). This refers to sainfoin&#x27;s good properties as a forage plant for large mammalian herbivores.

&quot;Sainfoin&quot; is derived from Old French (&quot;healthy hay&quot;). In the words of the 16th-century soil scientist Olivier de Serres:
&quot;The herb is called in France, in Italy , in Provence and the Languedoc . From the inordinate praise the plant has been given, for its medical virtues and for fattening the livestock that graze on it, comes the term .&quot;

In northern European languages that have been less influenced by French, the plants&#x27; name usually derives from , the Provençal term for the similar-looking and closely related sweetvetches (&quot;Hedysarum&quot;). Examples are Danish , Dutch , German , Lithuanian , Polish , Russian &#x27; () and Swedish . Meanwhile, the Occitan name of sainfoin, , has in many languages come to mean species of the related genus &quot;Medicago&quot;, in particular Alfalfa (&quot;M. sativa&quot;).

The native name of the cock&#x27;s head (&quot;O. caput-galli&quot;) is one of the few words of the extinct Dacian language that have been recorded. The Dacians called this plant or .

==Distribution and habitat==
Sainfoins are mostly subtropical plants, but their range extends throughout Europe as far north as southern Sweden. These plants grow on grassland, agricultural land and wasteland.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Onobrychis&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, such as the case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora colutella&quot; (recorded on &quot;O. saxatilis&quot;) and the Damon Blue (&quot;Polyommatus damon&quot;) butterfly.

== Uses ==
These highly nutritious plants were an important forage for heavy working horses in agriculture, and are still an excellent source of nectar for honey production as well as pollen for bee food. Because sainfoins are rich in tannins which protect proteins from hydrolysis in the rumen, the proteins are instead absorbed in the abomasum. &quot;Onobrychis&quot; typically have a deep taproot and so are very drought resistant, but do not recover well from overgrazing. Adapted to slow but steady growth in the arid steppe belt of Eurasia, sainfoins are difficult to establish as pasture, are not persistent in grassland, and only yield one crop of hay or seeds per year. Thus they are seldom grown in any significant extent, though &quot;O. viciifolia&quot; is met with somewhat more regularly.

=== Nutrition ===
Sainfoin provides a superb forage for grazing animals and voluntary intake of sainfoin by cattle and sheep is 20% higher than for grass. Unlike many other legumes, it is non-bloating and is known to have anthelmintic properties, so reducing the problems associated with livestock worms. Sainfoin contains condensed tannins, and it is these that protect animals against bloat. Sainfoin has also been shown to increase protein absorption. This, combined with its other health benefits, mean that animals grazing sainfoin have very rapid liveweight gains, so young stock can be finished sooner and with very good carcass grades. Sainfoin is therefore extremely useful to low input and organic farmers. Yields can be very high at around 16t DM per hectare.

Methods and research techniques have been studied and developed to look specifically at Sainfoin polyphenols which include tannins and flavonoids. There are significant differences between Sainfoin types and this will lead to further development of Sainfoin plant breeding.

One method for improving nitrogen utilisation by ruminants and reduce greenhouse gases (CH, NO), without altering their nitrogen and energy value, is to use forages that contain condensed tannins, such as sainfoin. The nutritive value of sainfoin, despite its lower nitrogen content than lucerne, is high. Future research, on the nutritional impact of condensed tannins is likely not only be based on condensed tannin content, but also include structure-activity considerations. The results obtained, with sheep at maintenance fed a diet containing only sainfoin will be tested with producing animals, for example growing sheep and cattle, lactating ewes, goats or cows. In producing animals the diet will comprise different forage sources and supplement feeds.
Sainfoin is seldom used as a pure crop and is generally introduced in pasture in a grass-legume mix with cocksfoot (&quot;Dactylis&quot;), ryegrass (&quot;Lolium&quot;) or with other legumes such as red clover, white clover or lucerne. Results have shown the choice of the variety is important. A variety like Esparcette, characterised by the highest condensed tannin content, may provide beneficial effects with a lower proportion in a mixture with other legumes. Preserving legumes, as silage, is a good way to provide an on-farm source of home-grown energy and protein, offers advantages over traditional haymaking, being less weather-dependent, and allows a high quality of forage during the harvesting period. In particular, wrapped silage bales of sainfoin have great potential in animal nutrition and can be used by farmers, as found that condensed tannin effects were not reduced by this mode of preservation.

<doc id="61978" wikidata="Q206687" url="?curid=61978" title="Nelson, New Zealand">
<text>Nelson () is a city and unitary authority on the eastern shores of Tasman Bay at the top of the South Island of New Zealand. It is the oldest city in the South Island and the second-oldest settled city in the country; it was established in 1841 and became a city by British royal charter in 1858.

Nelson City is bordered to the west and south-west by the Tasman District and to the north-east, east and south-east by the Marlborough District. The Nelson urban area has a population of , making it New Zealand&#x27;s 15th most populous urban area.

Nelson is well known for its thriving local arts and crafts scene; each year, the city hosts events popular with locals and tourists alike, such as the Nelson Arts Festival.

== Etymology ==
Nelson was named in honour of Admiral Horatio Nelson, who defeated both the French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Many roads and public areas around the city are named after people and ships associated with that battle. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Nelsonians; Trafalgar Street is its main shopping axis.

Nelson&#x27;s Māori name, Whakatū, means &#x27;construct&#x27;, &#x27;raise&#x27;, or &#x27;establish&#x27;.

In an article to &quot;The Colonist&quot; newspaper on 16 July 1867, Francis Stevens described Nelson as &quot;The Naples of the Southern Hemisphere&quot;. Today, Nelson is nicknamed &quot;Sunny Nelson&quot; due to its high sunshine hours per year and the &quot;Top of the South&quot; because of its geographic location.

In New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by putting the index and middle fingers together which are raised to the nose until the fingertips touch the nose, then move the hand forward so that the fingers point slightly forward away from oneself.

==History==

===Māori settlement===
Settlement of Nelson began about 700 years ago by Māori. There is evidence that the earliest settlements in New Zealand were around the Nelson–Marlborough regions. Some of the earliest recorded iwi in the Nelson district are Ngāti Hāwea, Ngāti Wairangi, Waitaha and Kāti Māmoe. Waitaha people developed the land around the Waimea Gardens, are believed to have been the first people to quarry argillite in around Nelson. They also developed much of the Waimea Gardens complex – more than on the Waimea Plains near Nelson. In the early 1600s, Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri displaced other te Tau Ihu Māori, becoming the dominant tribe in the area until the early 1800s. Raids from northern tribes in the 1820s, led by Te Rauparaha and his Ngāti Toa, soon decimated the local population and quickly displaced them.

Today there are eight mutually recognised tribes of the northwestern region: Ngāti Kuia, Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō, Rangitāne, Ngāti Toarangatira, Ngāti Koata, Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui.

===New Zealand Company===

====Planning====
The New Zealand Company in London planned the settlement of Nelson. They intended to buy from the Māori some of land, which they planned to divide into one thousand lots and sell to intending settlers. The company earmarked profits to finance the free passage of artisans and labourers, with their families, and for the construction of public works. However, by September 1841 only about one third of the lots had sold. Despite this, the colony pushed ahead, and land was surveyed by Frederick Tuckett.

Three ships, the &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Whitby&quot;, and &quot;Will Watch&quot;, sailed from London, the expedition commanded by Captain Arthur Wakefield. Arriving in New Zealand, they discovered that the new Governor of the colony, William Hobson, would not give them a free hand to secure vast areas of land from the Māori or indeed to decide where to site the colony. However, after some delay, Hobson allowed the company to investigate the Tasman Bay area at the north end of the South Island. The Company selected the site now occupied by Nelson City because it had the best harbour in the area. But it had a major drawback: it lacked suitable arable land; Nelson City stands right on the edge of a mountain range while the nearby Waimea Plains amount to only about , less than one third of the area required by the Company plans.

The Company secured land, which was not clearly defined, from the Māori for £800: it included Nelson, Waimea, Motueka, Riwaka and Whakapuaka. This allowed the settlement to begin, but the lack of definition would prove the source of much future conflict. The three colony ships sailed into Nelson Haven during the first week of November 1841. When the first four immigrant ships – &quot;Fifeshire&quot;, &quot;Mary-Ann&quot;, &quot;Lord Auckland&quot; and &quot;Lloyds&quot; – arrived three months later, they found the town already laid out with streets, some wooden houses, tents and rough sheds. The town was laid out on a grid plan. Within 18 months, the company had sent out 18 ships with 1,052 men, 872 women and 1,384 children. However, fewer than ninety of the settlers had the capital to start as landowners.

====Cultural and religious immigrants====

The early settlement of Nelson province included a proportion of German immigrants, who arrived on the ship &quot;Sankt Pauli&quot; and formed the nucleus of the villages of Sarau (Upper Moutere) and Neudorf. These were mostly Lutheran Protestants with a small number of Bavarian Catholics.

In 1892, the New Zealand Church Missionary Society (NZCMS) was formed in a Nelson church hall.

====Problems with land====
After a brief initial period of prosperity, the lack of land and of capital caught up with the settlement and it entered a prolonged period of relative depression. The labourers had to accept a cut in their wages. Organised immigration ceased (a state of affairs that continued until the 1850s). By the end of 1843, artisans and labourers began leaving Nelson; by 1846, some 25% of the immigrants had moved away.

The pressure to find more arable land became intense. To the south-east of Nelson lay the wide and fertile plains of the Wairau Valley. The New Zealand Company tried to claim that they had purchased the land. The Māori owners stated adamantly that the Wairau Valley had not formed part of the original land sale, and made it clear they would resist any attempts by the settlers to occupy the area. The Nelson settlers led by Arthur Wakefield and Henry Thompson attempted to do just that. This resulted in the Wairau Affray, where 22 settlers and 4 Māori died. The subsequent Government inquiry exonerated the Māori and found that the Nelson settlers had no legitimate claim to any land outside Tasman Bay. Public fears of a Māori attack on Nelson led to the formation of the Nelson Battalion of Militia in 1845.

===City===

Nelson township was managed by the Nelson Provincial Council through a Board of Works constituted by the Provincial Government under the Nelson Improvement Act 1856 until 1874. It was proclaimed a Bishop&#x27;s See and city under letters patent by Queen Victoria on 27 September 1858, the second New Zealand city proclaimed in this manner after Christchurch. Nelson only had some 5,000 residents at this time. Edmund Hobhouse was the first Bishop. The Municipal Corporations Act 1876 stated that Nelson was constituted a city on 30 March 1874.

===Coat of arms===
Nelson City has a coat of arms, obtained in 1958 from the College of Arms to mark the Centenary of Nelson as a City. The blazon of the arms is:
:&quot;Barry wavy Argent and Azure a Cross Flory Sable on a Chief also Azure a Mitre proper And for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours Issuant from a Mural Crown proper a Lion rampant Gules holding between the fore paws a Sun in splendour or. The supporters on the dexter side a Huia Bird and on the sinister side a Kotuku both proper.&quot;

Motto &quot;Palmam qui meruit ferat&quot; (Let him who has earned it bear the palm). This motto is the same as that of Lord Nelson.

===Nelson Province===

From 1853 until 1876, when provincial governments were abolished, Nelson was the capital of Nelson Province. The province itself was much larger than present-day Nelson City and included all of the present-day Buller, Kaikōura, Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman, as well as the Grey District north of the Grey River and the Hurunui District north of the Hurunui River. The Marlborough Province split from Nelson Province in October 1859.

====Nelson provincial anniversary====
Nelson Anniversary Day is a public holiday observed in the northern half of the South Island of New Zealand, being the area&#x27;s provincial anniversary day. It is observed throughout the historic Nelson Province, even though the provinces of New Zealand were abolished in 1876. The modern area of observation includes all of Nelson City and includes all of the present-day Buller, Kaikōura, Marlborough, Tasman districts as well as the Grey District north of the Grey River / Māwheranui and the Hurunui District north of the Hurunui River. The holiday usually falls on the Monday closest to 1 February, the anniversary of the arrival of the first New Zealand Company boat, the &quot;Fifeshire&quot;, on 1 February 1842.

Anniversary celebrations in the early years featured a sailing regatta, horse racing, running races, shooting and ploughing matches. In 1892, the Nelson Jubilee Celebration featured an official week-long programme with church services, sports, concerts, a ball and a grand display of fireworks.

====Time gun====
In 1858, the Nelson Provincial Council erected a time gun at the spot on Brittania Heights where Captain Wakefield erected his flagpole in 1841. The gun was fired each Saturday at noon to give the correct time. The gun is now preserved as a historical relic and the Songer Tree marks the site on Signal Hill of the original flagpole.

== Geography ==
The Nelson-Tasman area comprises two unitary authorities – Nelson City, administered by the Nelson City Council, and Tasman District, administered by the Tasman District Council, based in Richmond to the southwest. It is between Marlborough, another unitary authority, to the east, and the West Coast Regional Council to the west.

For some while, there has been talk about amalgamating Nelson City and the Tasman District to streamline and render more financially economical the existing co-operation between the two councils, exemplified by the jointly owned Port Nelson and the creation of Nelson Tasman Tourism, a jointly owned tourism promotion organisation.

However, an official poll conducted in April 2012 showed nearly three-quarters of those who voted in Richmond were opposed to the proposal, with a narrow majority in favour.

Nelson has beaches and a sheltered harbour. The harbour entrance is protected by a Boulder Bank, a natural, bank of rocks transported south from Mackay Bluff via longshore drift. The bank creates a perfect natural harbour which enticed the first settlers, although the entrance was narrow. The wreck of the &quot;Fifeshire&quot; on Arrow Rock (now called Fifeshire Rock in memory of this disaster) in 1842 proved the difficulty of the passage. A cut was later made in the bank in 1906 which allowed larger vessels access to the port.

The creation of Rocks Road around the waterfront area after the Tāhunanui slump in 1892 increased the effects of the tide on Nelson city&#x27;s beach, Tāhunanui, and removed sediment. This meant the popular beach and adjoining car park were being eroded (plus the sand dunes) so a project to replace these sands was put in place and has so far proved a success, with the sand rising a considerable amount and the dunes continuing to grow.

=== Waterways ===
The Nelson territorial authority area is small (just 445 km2) and has four main waterways, the Whangamoa, Wakapuaka, Maitai and Roding Rivers. The Roding River, the southernmost in Nelson, arises in the hills between Mount Meares and Dun Mountain. From there it flows westward before entering the Tasman District where it eventually joins the Waimea River, which flows into Waimea Inlet near Rabbit Island. The Maitai River flows westward from the Dun Mountain area into the town centre of Nelson before entering the Nelson Haven then Tasman Bay via &#x27;The Cut&#x27;. Major tributaries of the Maitai River are: York and Brook Streams plus Sharland, Packer, Groom, Glen, Neds, Sclanders, Beauchamp and Mill Creeks. The Wakapuaka River, which flows north from the Saddle Hill area to its mouth at Cable Bay in North Nelson, has two main tributaries, the Lud and Teal Rivers. Entering Tasman Bay near Kokorua in the north of Nelson, the Whangamoa River is the longest waterway in Nelson.

Smaller waterways in the south of Nelson include: Saxton Creek, Orchard Stream, Poorman Valley Stream, Arapiki Stream, Jenkins Creek and Maire Stream.

=== Central city ===

The central city of Nelson, also referred to as the central business district (CBD), is bounded by Halifax Street to the north, Rutherford Street to the west, Collingwood Street to the east, and Selwyn Place to the south. Other major streets within the CBD include Trafalgar Street, Bridge Street and Hardy Street.

=== National parks ===
Nelson is surrounded by mountains on three sides and Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere on the fourth, with its region acting as the gateway to the Abel Tasman, Kahurangi, and Nelson Lakes National Parks.

It is a centre for both ecotourism and adventure tourism and has a high reputation among caving enthusiasts due to several prominent cave systems around Takaka Hill and the Wharepapa / Arthur Range, including the Nettlebed Cave and some of the largest and deepest explored caverns in the Southern Hemisphere.

Nelson is known for its great lakes, hikes and walks surrounding the town, the most popular being the Abel Tasman Coast Track, Abel Tasman National Park, and Heaphy Track. These tracks are also known for recreational activities. There are many huts and camping grounds in all three tracks for availability to stay in. There are places to fish, hunt and observe nature within the National Parks and Lakes.

=== Climate ===
Nelson has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb), with cool winters and warm summers. Nelson has rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year and has fewer frosts due to the highly marine geography of New Zealand. Winter is the stormiest time, where gales and storms are more common. Nelson has one of the sunniest climates of all major New Zealand centres, earning the nickname &#x27;Sunny Nelson&#x27; with an annual average total of over 2400 hours of sunshine. The highest recorded temperature in Nelson is , the lowest .

===&quot;Centre of New Zealand&quot; monument===

Nelson has a monument on Botanical Hill, near the centre of the city. The walk to this is called the &quot;Centre of New Zealand walk&quot;. Despite the name, this monument does not mark the actual geographic centre of New Zealand.

Instead, the monument marks the &quot;zero, zero&quot; point to which the first geodetic surveys of New Zealand were referenced. These surveys were started in the 1870s by John Spence Browning, the Chief Surveyor for Nelson. From this 360-degree viewpoint, survey marks in neighbouring regions (including Wellington in the North Island) could be triangulated and the local surveys connected.

In 1962, Dr Ian Reilly from the now defunct Department of Scientific and Industrial Research calculated the geographic centre of New Zealand (including Stewart Island and some smaller islands in addition to the North and South Island, but excluding the Chathams) to be in a forest in Spooners Range southwest of Nelson at .

Owing to the coarse nature of the underlying data (use of rectangular areas of 7.5 minutes of arc on each side), the centre calculated by Dr Reilly has quite large error margins. Recalculating the result with more modern and accurate data shows the geographic centre of New Zealand is approximately 60 km southwest of Nelson, in the Big Bush Conservation Area north of Saint Arnaud, New Zealand.

== Economy ==
The Nelson economy (and that of the neighbouring Tasman District) is based on the &#x27;big five&#x27; industries; seafood, horticulture, forestry, farming and tourism. Port Nelson is the biggest fishing port in Australasia. There are also a range of growth industries, including art and craft, aviation, engineering technology, and information technology. The region is sixth in terms of GDP growth in the 2007–10 period.

The combined sub-national GDP of Nelson and Tasman District was estimated at $3.4 billion in 2010, 1.8% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP.

Nelson is home to various business agencies that serve the city and its surrounds, including Nelson Tasman Tourism (NTT), which aims to promote the region and help advertisers reach visitors from New Zealand and overseas, and the Nelson Regional Economic Development Agency (EDA), which works to &quot;coordinate, promote, facilitate, investigate, develop, implement, support and fund initiatives relating to economic development [and] employment growth ... within the Nelson region ...&quot;

Below is a list of some of the region&#x27;s largest companies and employers:
* Former regional airline Air Nelson had its headquarters and maintenance base at Nelson Airport.
* Helicopters (NZ) has its headquarters and maintenance base at Nelson Airport.
* Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda has its New Zealand distribution centre in the Whakatu Industrial Estate in Stoke.
* Beverage company McCashins has a microbrewery in Stoke
* Sea Dragon Marine Oils has a fish oil refinery in Annesbrook.
* The Cawthron Institute has a research facility in The Wood.
* Food manufacturer, the Talley&#x27;s Group has processing facilities at Port Nelson.
* The New Zealand King Salmon Company processes Chinook salmon at its factory in Annesbrook.
* Pic&#x27;s Peanut Butter is made in its Stoke factory.

In 2013, Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio worked on a proposal that would see Australian call centres for companies such as Gen-i and Xero relocated to Nelson. The plan was in response to Australian companies moving call and contact centres out of Asia because their Australian customers preferred English-speaking centres. If the plan was successful, Mr Miccio expected 100 to 300 jobs paying NZ$50,000-plus in the first year to be created in Nelson.

== Government ==
=== Local ===
As a unitary authority, the Nelson City Council has the combined responsibilities and functions of both a territorial (local) and regional council. This is different from most other local authorities in New Zealand. More often, a regional council is a separate organisation with several territorial authorities (city or district councils) within its borders. Other unitary authorities are the Auckland Council, Gisborne District Council, Marlborough District Council, Tasman District Council and the Chatham Islands Council.

The Nelson City Council holds its elections under the first-past-the-post electoral system once every three years. Electors vote by indicating their choice for Mayor of Nelson by placing a tick beside one of the names, and the person who receives the most votes becomes Mayor. Councillors are elected the same way, but voters could cast multiple votes, with the 12 candidates who each receive the most votes becoming councillors. Voters in this system may vote for no more than 12 candidates. The elections are conducted by post over a three-week period to make it as convenient as possible for people to vote.

The other option permitted under the Local Electoral Act 2001, but not currently used in Nelson, is the single transferable vote system. Multiple-member districts are used. Electors vote by ranking candidates in order of preference by placing a number beside candidates&#x27; names. The elector can mark a preference for one or up to the total number of candidates on the paper. The number of votes required for a candidate to be elected, the quota, depends on the number of positions to be filled and the number of valid votes. (Election of mayor may be held using the Instant-runoff vote method.)

Under the Local Electoral Act 2002, the Nelson City Council can resolve to change the electoral system to be used for the next two elections, and it must review this decision every six years. A referendum was held in 2003 to decide which electoral system would be used for the 2004 and 2007 Nelson City Council elections, with the outcome that the first-past-the-post system was retained. The 2008 review retained that system for the 2010 and 2013 elections.

On 12 October 2013, Rachel Reese was elected as Nelson&#x27;s first woman mayor after receiving 1,500 votes more than incumbent mayor Aldo Miccio.

As of 13 October 2022, the current council members for the 2022 to 2025 term are:
=== National ===
Nelson is covered by one general electorate: Nelson and one Māori electorate: Te Tai Tonga.

As of the 2023 general election, Nelson is held by Rachel Boyack of the Labour Party. The Māori electorate Te Tai Tonga, which covers the entire South Island and part of Wellington in the North Island, is currently held by Te Pāti Māori and represented by Tākuta Ferris.

== Culture and the arts ==

As the major regional centre, the city offers many lodgings, restaurants, and unique speciality shopping such as at the Jens Hansen Goldsmiths where &quot;The One Ring&quot; in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy was designed.
* Nelson has a vibrant local music and arts scene and is known nationwide for its culturally idiosyncratic craftsmen. These include potters, glass blowers (such as Flamedaisy Glass Design and Höglund Art Glass Studio &amp; Gallery), and dozens of wood carvers using native New Zealand southern beech and exotic &quot;Cupressus macrocarpa.&quot; 
* Nelson is a popular visitor destination and year-round attracts both New Zealanders and international tourists.
* The Nelson Saturday Market is a popular weekly market where one can buy direct from local artists.
* The Theatre Royal was restored in 2010 and is the oldest wooden functioning theatre in the Southern Hemisphere (built 1878)
* Art organisations include the Suter Art Gallery and Nelson Arts Festival.
* The Victory Village community received the 2010 New Zealander of the Year award for Community of the Year.

The first rugby union match in New Zealand took place at the Botanic Reserve in Nelson on 14 May 1870, between the Nelson Suburbs FC and Nelson College, and an informative commemorative plaque was renovated at the western edge of the grassed area by Nelson City Council in 2006.

===Marae===

Whakatū Marae, in the suburb of Atawhai, is the &quot;marae&quot; (meeting ground) of Ngāti Kuia, Ngāti Kōata, Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu, Ngāti Toa Rangatira and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui. It includes the Kākāti &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house).

In October 2020, the Government committed $240,739 from the Provincial Growth Fund to restore the marae, creating an estimated 9 jobs.

The annual World of Wearable Art Awards was founded in Nelson in 1987 by Suzie Moncrieff. The first show was held at the restored William Higgins cob cottage in Spring Grove, near Brightwater. The show moved to Wellington in 2005 when it became too big to hold in Nelson. A local museum showcased winning designs alongside their collection of classic cars until the venture was forced to close because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The classic car museum re-opened in 2020.

===Architecture===

Unlike many towns and cities in New Zealand, Nelson has retained many Victorian buildings in its historic centre. The South Street area has been designated as having heritage value.

The tallest building is the tall Rutherford Hotel located on the west edge of Trafalgar Square. 

====Historic buildings====

* Nelson Cathedral
* Amber House
* Broadgreen Historic House was built in 1855 for Mr and Mrs Edmund Buxton, additionally with their six daughters. The house was later sold to Fred Langbein in 1901, who lived there with his family until 1965. In 1965, the house was bought by the Nelson City Council and is now used operated a museum for the general public.
* Cabragh House
* Chez Eelco
* Fairfield House
* Founders Park Windmill
* Isel House was home to one of Nelson&#x27;s first families, the Marsdens. Many of the rooms have been transformed into displays for the public to view. Restoration of the house is managed by Isel House Charitable trust under the supervision of Sally Papps, but the house and the park ground surrounding it are owned by the Nelson City Council.
* Melrose House
* Nelson Central School Renwick House
* Theatre Royal
* Victorian Rose Pub
* Redwood College (Founders Park)
* Nelson Centre of Musical Arts (formerly Nelson School of Music) Est. 1894

===Museums===
Founders Heritage Park is an interactive park that shows the history of Nelson. The park is set up as a village filled with buildings set in a historical time, including well established gardens. Throughout the park, there are stories to be learned about the history of this town. It houses a number of groups with historical themes, including transport.

The Nelson Provincial Museum houses a collection of locally significant artefacts. The Nelson Classic Car Museum houses a collection of collectable cars.

===Parks and zoo===

Nelson has a large number and variety of public parks and reserves maintained at public expense by Nelson City Council. Major reserves include Grampians Reserve, close to the suburb of Braemar, and the botanical Reserve in the east of Nelson, close to The Wood.

Natureland Wildlife Trust (formerly Natureland Zoological Park) is a small zoological facility close to Tāhunanui Beach. The facility is popular with children, where they can closely approach: monkeys (black-capped capuchins, cotton-top tamarins and pygmy marmosets), lemurs, meerkats, agoutis, porcupines, llamas and alpacas, Kune Kune pigs and peacocks. There are also green iguanas, tropical fish, kākās, keas and other birds including in a walk through aviary. Although the zoo nearly closed in 2008, the Orana Wildlife Trust took over its running instead. It looked like a bright future ahead for Natureland and its staff, but since the repeated earthquakes in Christchurch in 2011 and the damage to Orana Park, Orana Wildlife Trust are uncertain of the future of Natureland.
Orana Wildlife Trust have since pulled out of Natureland, which is now run independently.

=== Sister cities ===
Nelson has sister city relationships with:
* Miyazu, Japan (1976)
* Huangshi, China (1996)
* Yangjiang, China (2014)

== Sport ==
=== Major sports teams ===
=== Major venues ===
== Infrastructure and services ==

=== Healthcare ===
The main hospital in Nelson is the Nelson Hospital. It is the seat of the Nelson Marlborough District Health Board.

The Manuka Street Hospital is a private institution.

=== Law enforcement ===
The Nelson Central Police Station, located in St John Street, is the headquarters for the Tasman Police District. The Tasman Police District has the lowest crime rate within New Zealand.

Several gangs have established themselves in Nelson. They include the now disbanded Lost Breed and the Red Devils a support club for the Hells Angels. The Rebels Motorcycle Club also has a presence in the wider Nelson-Tasman area.

=== Electricity ===
The Nelson City Municipal Electricity Department (MED) established the city&#x27;s public electricity supply in 1923, with electricity generated by a coal-fired power station at Wakefield Quay. The city was connected to the newly commissioned Cobb hydroelectric power station in 1944 and to the rest of the South Island grid in 1958. The grid connection saw the Wakefield Quay power station was relegated to standby duty before being decommissioned in 1964.

Today, Nelson Electricity operates the local distribution network in the former MED area, which covers the CBD and inner suburbs, while Network Tasman operates the local distribution network in the outer suburbs (including Stoke, Tāhunanui and Atawhai) and rural areas.

== Transport ==

===Air transport===
Nelson Airport is located southwest of the city, at Annesbrook. The airport operates a single terminal and runway, and in 2018 was the fifth-busiest airport in New Zealand by passenger numbers. There are more than a million passenger movements through the airport terminal annually and the airport averages 90 aircraft movements every day, with a plane taking off or landing every 4.5 minutes during scheduled hours.

It is primarily used for domestic flights, with regular flights to and from Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Kapiti Coast, Palmerston North and Wellington. Nelson Airport is home to the former airline Air Nelson, which operated and maintained New Zealand&#x27;s largest domestic airline fleet and was also the headquarters of Origin Pacific Airways until its collapse in 2006. Sounds Air offers flights from Nelson to Wellington.

In 2006, the airport received restricted international airport status to facilitate small private jets.

In February 2018, the approach road to the airport was flooded when the adjoining Jenkins Creek burst its banks during a storm that brought king tides and strong winds. The airport was closed for about one hour. In 2022, the NZ SeaRise programme identified Nelson airport as one area of particular vulnerability to sea level rise, with a projected subsidence of per year. The airport&#x27;s Chief Executive said that the proposed runway extension would be planned around the latest sea level rise forecast, and that the airport was &quot;here to stay&quot;, despite the concerns over the threats posed by sea level rise.

===Maritime transport===
Port Nelson is the maritime gateway for the Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough regions and a vital hub for economic activity. The following shipping companies call at Port Nelson:
* Australian National Line / CMA CGM
* Maersk Line
* Mediterranean Shipping Company
* Pacifica Shipping
* Toyofuji Shipping
* Swire Shipping

In the mid-1994, a group of local businessmen, fronted by local politician Owen Jennings proposed building a deep-water port featuring a one-kilometre-long wharf extending from the Boulder Bank into Tasman Bay, where giant ships could berth and manoeuvre with ease. Known as Port Kakariki, the $97 million project was to become the hub to ship West Coast coal to Asia, as well as handling logs, which would be barged across Tasman Bay from Mapua.

In January 2010, the Western Blue Highway, a Nelson to New Plymouth ferry service, was proposed by Port Taranaki. However, to date, neither the Interislander nor Bluebridge have shown any interest in the route.

==== Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company ====
The &#x27;Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company&#x27; was formed 31 March 1901 from the earlier companies of Nathaniel Edwards &amp; Co (1857–1880) and the Anchor Steam Shipping Company (1880–1901). The Anchor Company never departed from its original aim of providing services to the people of Nelson and the West Coast of the South Island and was never a large company; it only owned 37 ships during its history. At its peak around 1930, there were 16 vessels in the fleet. The company operated three nightly return trips per week ferry service between Nelson and Wellington and a daily freight service was maintained between the two ports in conjunction with the Pearl Kasper Shipping Company, while another service carried general cargo on a Nelson-Onehunga route. In 1974, the Anchor Company was sold and merged into the Union Company.

=== Public transport ===
Nelson Motor Service Company ran the first motor bus in Nelson in 1906 and took over the Palace horse buses in 1907.

==== Ebus ====
Ebus provides public transport services between Nelson, Richmond, Motueka and Wakefield as well as on two local routes connecting Atawhai, Nelson Hospital, The Brook and the Airport.

The Late Late Bus is a weekend night transport service between Nelson and Richmond. NBus Cards were replaced by Bee Cards on 3 August 2020.

InterCity provides daily bus services connecting Nelson with towns and cities around the South Island.

==== Taxis and shuttle vans ====
Taxi companies in Nelson include the following:
* Nelson Bays Cabs
* Nelson City Taxis
* Sun City Taxis

=== Rail transport ===
Nelson is one of only five major urban areas in New Zealand without a rail connection – the others being Taupō, Rotorua, Gisborne and Queenstown. The Nelson Section was an isolated, gauge, government-owned railway line between Nelson and Glenhope. It operated for years between 1876 and 1955.

In 1886, a route was proposed from Nelson to the junction of the Midland Railway Company at Buller via Richmond, Waimea West, Upper Moutere, Motueka, the Motueka Valley, Tadmor and Glenhope.

The only sign of rail activity in Nelson today is a short heritage operation run by the Nelson Railway Society from Founders Heritage Park using their own line between Wakefield Grove and Grove. The society has proposed future extensions of their line, possibly into or near the city centre. There have been several proposals to connect Nelson to the South Island rail network, but none have come to fruition.

=== Horse tramway ===

The Dun Mountain Railway was a horse-drawn tramway serving a mine.

=== Road transport ===
The Nelson urban area is served by , which runs in a north to southwest direction. The highway travels through the city and nearby town of Richmond, continuing southwest across the plains of the Wairoa and Motueka Rivers. Plans to construct a motorway linking North Nelson to Brightwater in the south have so far been unsuccessful. A number of studies have been undertaken since 2007 including the 2007 North Nelson to Brightwater Study, the Southern Link Road Project and the Arterial Traffic Study. On 28 June 2013, the Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio and Nelson MP Nick Smith jointly wrote to Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee seeking for the Southern Link to be given Road of National Significance (RoNS) status.

Other significant road projects proposed over the years include a cross-city tunnel from Tāhunanui Drive to Haven Road; or from Annesbrook (or Tāhunanui) to Emano Street in Victory Square; or from Tāhunanui to Washington Valley.

The passenger and freight company Newmans Coach Lines was formed in Nelson in 1879, and merged with Transport Nelson in 1972.

== Education ==

* Garin College
* Nayland College
* Nelson College
* Nelson College for Girls

=== Tertiary institutions ===
Nelson hosts two tertiary education institutions, the main one being Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology. The institute has two main campuses, one in Nelson and the other in Blenheim, in the neighbouring Marlborough region. The institute has been providing tertiary education in the Nelson-Marlborough region for the last 100 years.

Nelson also has a University of Canterbury College of Education campus, which currently has an intake two out of every three years for the primary sector.

== Media ==
=== Broadcasting ===
The city is served by all major national radio and television stations, with terrestrial television (Freeview) and FM radio.

The city has one local television station, Mainland Television.

=== Print ===
&quot;The Nelson Examiner&quot; was the first newspaper published in the South Island. It was established by Charles Elliott (1811–1876) in 1842, within a few weeks of New Zealand Company settlers arriving in Nelson. Other early newspapers were &quot;The Colonist&quot; and the &quot;Nelson Evening Mail&quot;. Today, the &quot;Nelson Mail&quot; publishes four days a week and is owned by Stuff Ltd. The &quot;Nelson Mail&quot; also publishes the weekly community papers &quot;The Nelson Leader&quot; and &quot;The Tasman Leader&quot;. The city&#x27;s largest circulating newspaper is the locally owned &quot;Nelson Weekly&quot;, which is published every Wednesday.

&quot;WildTomato&quot; was a glossy monthly lifestyle magazine, focused on the Nelson and Marlborough regions – the Top of the South Island of New Zealand. The regional magazine was launched by Murray Farquhar as a 16-page local magazine in Nelson in July 2006, but was put into liquidation in March 2021.

<text>Canterbury () is a region of New Zealand, located in the central-eastern South Island. The region covers an area of , making it the largest region in the country by area. It is home to a population of 

The region in its current form was established in 1989 during nationwide local government reforms. The Kaikōura District joined the region in 1992 following the abolition of the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council.

Christchurch, the South Island&#x27;s largest city and the country&#x27;s second-largest urban area, is the seat of the region and home to percent of the region&#x27;s population. Other major towns and cities include Timaru, Ashburton, Rangiora and Rolleston.

== History ==
=== Natural history ===

The land, water, flora, and fauna of Canterbury has a long history, stretching from creation of the greywacke basement rocks that make up the Southern Alps to the arrival of the first humans. This history is linked to the solidification and development of tectonic plates, the development of oceans and then life itself.

The region is a part of the larger Zealandia continent, itself a part of the larger Australian and Pacific tectonic plates. In the first instance, the land is based upon the constructive tectonic forces of this convergent and transformational tectonic plate boundary. In the second instance, the erosive forces of rain, snow, ice, and rock grinding against rock have developed large gravel fans that extend out from the mountains. In the third instance, there is volcanism punching through the basement rocks and blanket of sediments to the surface. Upon this solid foundation, and slowly over the billions of years, life made up of a countless generations of interconnected adaptations developed into the unique flora and fauna of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The remnants populations of these unique species are visible today in the publicly protected conservation lands.

The species of Waitaha/Canterbury were adapted to the climate and geography that traverses inland from the coastline to the highest peaks, and from the warmer climes in the north to the colder in the south.

===Before European settlement===

Canterbury has been populated by a succession of Māori peoples over the centuries. When European settlers arrived, it was occupied by Ngāi Tahu, whose numbers had been greatly reduced by warfare, among themselves and with Te Rauparaha and his Ngāti Toa from the North Island, in the early 19th century.

=== Colonisation ===
In 1848, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a Briton, and John Robert Godley, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, founded the Canterbury Association to establish an Anglican colony in the South Island. The colony was based upon theories developed by Wakefield while in prison for eloping with a woman not-of-age. Due to ties to the University of Oxford, the Canterbury Association succeeded in raising sufficient funds and recruiting middle-class and upper-class settlers. In April 1850, a preliminary group led by Godley landed at Port Cooper – modern-day Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō – and established a port, housing and shops in preparation for the main body of settlers. In December 1850, the first wave of 750 settlers arrived at Lyttelton in a fleet of four ships.

Following 1850, the province&#x27;s economy developed with the introduction of sheep farming. The Canterbury region&#x27;s tussock plains in particular were suitable for extensive sheep farming. Since they were highly valued by settlers for their meat and wool, there were over half a million sheep in the region by the early 1850s. By the 1860s, this figure had risen to three million. During this period, the architect Benjamin Mountfort designed many civic and ecclesiastical buildings in the Gothic Revival style.

===Canterbury Province===

The Canterbury Province was formed in 1853 following the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. It was formed from part of New Munster Province and covered the middle part of the South Island, stretching from the east coast to the west coast. The province was abolished, along with other provinces of New Zealand, when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876. The modern Canterbury region has slightly different boundaries, particularly in the north, where it includes some districts from the old Nelson Province.

=== 2010–2011 earthquakes ===

==== September 2010 ====

A magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in the region on Saturday 4 September 2010, at 04:35 am. The epicentre was located west of Christchurch; south-east of Darfield, and had a depth of . The earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings and power outages, but no direct fatalities. Sewers were damaged, gas and water lines were broken, and power to up to 75% of the city was disrupted. Christchurch residents reported chimneys falling in through roofs, cracked ceilings and collapsed brick walls.

A local state of emergency was declared at 10:16 am on 4 September for the city, and evacuations of parts were planned to begin later in the day. People inside the Christchurch city centre were evacuated, and the city&#x27;s central business district remained closed until 5 September. A curfew from 7 pm on 4 September to 7 am on 5 September was put in place. The New Zealand Army was deployed to assist police and enforce the curfew.

There were 63 reported aftershocks in the first 48 hours, with three registering 5.2 magnitude. The total insurance costs of the event were estimated as up to $11 billion, according to the New Zealand Treasury.

==== February 2011 ====
A large aftershock of magnitude 6.3 occurred on at 12:51 pm. It was centred just to the north of Lyttelton, 10 kilometres south-east of Christchurch, at a depth of 5 km.
Although lower on the moment magnitude scale than the quake of September 2010, the intensity and violence of the ground shaking was measured to be VIII on the MMI, which is among the strongest ever recorded globally in an urban area due to the shallowness and proximity of the epicentre.

The quake struck on a busy weekday afternoon. This, along with the strength of the quakes, and the proximity to the city centre, resulted in 181 deaths. Many buildings and landmarks were severely damaged, including the iconic Shag Rock and Christchurch Cathedral. New Zealand&#x27;s first National State of Emergency was promptly declared.

==== June 2011 ====

On 13 June 2011 at about 1:00 pm New Zealand time, Christchurch was rocked by a magnitude 5.7 quake, followed by a magnitude 6.3 quake at 2:20 pm, centred in a similar location to that of the February quake with a depth of 6.0 kilometres. Dozens of aftershocks occurred over the following days, including several over magnitude 4.

Phone lines and power were lost in some suburbs, and liquefaction surfaced mainly in the eastern areas of the city which were worst affected following the aftershocks. Many residents in and around the hillside suburb of Sumner self-evacuated. Further damage was reported to buildings inside the cordoned central business district, with an estimate of 75 additional buildings needing demolition. Among the buildings further damaged was the Christchurch Cathedral, which lost its iconic rose window. There was one death and multiple injuries.

== Geography ==

The area administered by the Canterbury Regional Council consists of all the river catchments on the east coast of the South Island from that of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River, north of Kaikōura, to that of the Waitaki River, in South Canterbury. It is New Zealand&#x27;s largest region by area, with an area of 45,346 km2.

Canterbury was traditionally bounded in the north by the Conway River, to the west by the Southern Alps, and to the south by the Waitaki River. The area is commonly divided into North Canterbury (north of the Rakaia River to the Conway River), Mid Canterbury (from the Rakaia River to the Rangitata River), South Canterbury (south of the Rangitata River to the Waitaki River) and Christchurch City.

==Climate==
==Demographics==
Canterbury region covers . Statistics New Zealand estimates the population of Canterbury is as of , which gives a population density of people per km2. The region is home to % of New Zealand&#x27;s population.
Canterbury region had a population of 651,027 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 51,333 people (8.6%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 111,594 people (20.7%) since the 2013 census. There were 322,038 males, 326,082 females and 2,907 people of other genders in 251,661 dwellings. 3.7% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 39.1 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 113,751 people (17.5%) aged under 15 years, 125,919 (19.3%) aged 15 to 29, 297,834 (45.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 113,520 (17.4%) aged 65 or older.

The median income was $41,400, compared with $41,500 nationally. 57,885 people (10.8%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 274,113 (51.0%) people were employed full-time, 79,245 (14.7%) were part-time, and 12,546 (2.3%) were unemployed.

===Urban areas===
===Culture and identity===
People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 80.3% European (Pākehā); 10.6% Māori; 3.7% Pasifika; 13.3% Asian; 1.6% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.5% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.3%, Māori language by 2.1%, Samoan by 1.0% and other languages by 13.8%. No language could be spoken by 2.0% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.6%. The percentage of people born overseas was 24.6, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 32.2% Christian, 1.7% Hindu, 1.0% Islam, 0.3% Māori religious beliefs, 0.8% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.7% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 55.1%, and 6.8% of people did not answer the census question.
In the 2013 census, just under 20 percent of Canterbury&#x27;s population was born overseas, compared to 25 percent for New Zealand as a whole. The British Isles remains the largest region of origin, accounting for 36.5 percent of the overseas-born population in Canterbury. Around a quarter of Canterbury&#x27;s overseas-born population at the 2013 Census had been living in New Zealand for less than five years, and 11 percent had been living in New Zealand for less than two years (i.e. they moved to New Zealand after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake).
Anglicanism is the largest Christian denomination in Canterbury with 14.8 percent affiliating, while Catholicism is the second-largest with 12.7 percent affiliating.
==Economy==

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Canterbury region was estimated at NZ$44.2 billion in the year to March 2022, representing 12.4% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per filled job was $126,733, 4.6% below the national average of $132,815.

For the year ended March 2022, the manufacturing industry was the largest contributor to the Canterbury regional economy, at $4.1 billion. Primary manufacturing (the process of creating a product from raw materials) represented $2.48 billion of the total. Manufacturing industries in the region employed 10.6% of the filled jobs in the region. The construction sector represented the next highest category of regional GDP, at $3.67 billion, followed by professional, scientific and technical services at $3.64 billion.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture contributed $3.26 billion to the regional economy in the year ended March 2022. The agriculture sector is diversified into dairy farming, sheep farming and horticulture particularly viticulture. The strength of the region&#x27;s agricultural economy is displayed every November at the Canterbury A&amp;P Show. The show coincides with the regional anniversary day and Cup Week. During the interwar period, agricultural productivity was boosted by the introduction of mechanization, lime and the improvement of seed stocks. Canterbury is also New Zealand&#x27;s main producer of cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats. As of 2002, the region produced 60.7% of the nation&#x27;s supply of wheat, 51.1% of its barley stocks and 43.7% of its supply of oats.

Canterbury has 25,065 hectares of horticultural land, the largest area in New Zealand. The largest crops are potatoes (4,330 ha), peas and beans (2,700 ha), wine grapes (1,770 ha), berries (1,100 ha), and onions (1,000 ha). The region produces half of the New Zealand&#x27;s mushrooms, nuts and berries.

The region&#x27;s viticulture industry was established by French settlers in Akaroa. Since then, wine-growing is concentrated into two regions: Waipara and Burnham. Recently, there have been vintages from plantings from Kurow further to the south. White wine has typically predominated in Canterbury from Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, and to a lesser extent Pinot blanc and Pinot gris. Pinot noir has had some success in the province, particularly in Waipara.

==Environment==


Like much of the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands the Canterbury Plains have been highly modified since human settlement and now support a large agricultural industry. Prior to the arrival of Māori settlers in the 13th century, much of the modern Canterbury region was covered in scrub and beech forests. Forest fires destroyed much of the original forest cover which was succeeded by tussock grassland. By the 19th century, only ten percent of this forest cover remained, and the European settlers introduced several new exotic grass, lupin, pine and macrocarpa that gradually supplanted the native vegetation. Much of the native vegetation was isolated to the alpine zones and Banks Peninsula. From a minimum of about one percent of its original forest cover in circa 1900, the amount of forest on Banks Peninsula has increased.

The amount of dairy farming is increasing with a corresponding increase in demand for water. Water use is now becoming a contentious issue in Canterbury. Lowland rivers and streams are generally polluted and some of the aquifers are being overdrawn. The Central Plains Water scheme is a proposal for water storage that has attracted much controversy. The Canterbury Water Management Strategy is one of the many means being used to address the water issue.

The Canterbury mudfish (kowaro) is an endangered species that is monitored by the Department of Conservation.
==Government and politics==
===Local government===
The Canterbury region is administered by the Canterbury Regional Council. The area includes ten territorial authorities, including Christchurch City Council and part of the Waitaki District, the other part of which is in Otago. Following the local government reform of 1989, Kaikōura District was part of the Nelson-Marlborough Region. That region was later abolished and replaced with three unitary authorities. Kaikōura was too small to function as an independent unitary authority and was moved under the jurisdiction of the Canterbury Regional Council in 1992. However, Kaikōura remains part of Marlborough in the minds of many people. In 2006, the Banks Peninsula District was merged into Christchurch City following a 2005 referendum.

===National government===
The Canterbury region is covered by ten general electorates and one Māori electorate. The city of Christchurch as a whole consists of five of these electorates, while the electorate of Waimakariri contains a mix of Christchurch and exurban Canterbury. The Banks Peninsula, Ilam, and Waimakariri electorates are currently held by members of the governing National Party (as part of the coalition-led Sixth National Government of New Zealand) Vanessa Weenink, Hamish Campbell, and Matt Doocey. Meanwhile, the Christchurch Central, Christchurch East, and Wigram electorates are currently held by opposition (Labour Party) members Duncan Webb, Reuben Davidson, and Megan Woods respectively.

In contrast to Christchurch, much of the surrounding Canterbury region is dominated by the National Party due to its ties to rural farming and business interests. The large Kaikōura electorate covers all of the Marlborough Region and northern Canterbury and is represented by National MP Stuart Smith. The substantial Waitaki electorate, held by National MP Miles Anderson, covers most of South Canterbury and neighbouring North Otago. Rangitata and Selwyn are held by National members James Meager and Nicola Grigg respectively.

Under the Māori electorates system, Canterbury is part of the large Te Tai Tonga electorate which covers the entire South Island, the surrounding islands and most of Wellington in the North Island. It is currently held by Tākuta Ferris of Te Pāti Māori.

Judicially, the region is served by four District Courts at Christchurch, Ashburton, Timaru and Kaikōura, and two High Courts at Christchurch and Timaru. The Christchurch High Court also hosts a divisional court of the Court of Appeal.

==Transport==
State Highway 1 runs the length of Canterbury, connecting north to Blenheim and the Cook Strait ferry terminal at Picton and south to Oamaru, Dunedin and Invercargill.

Christchurch International Airport, located in Harewood on the northwest outskirts of Christchurch, is the region&#x27;s main airport. Regular flights operate from Christchurch to most major centres in New Zealand, as well as Australia, the Pacific Islands and eastern Asia. Timaru&#x27;s Richard Pearse Airport serves South Canterbury with daily flights to Wellington.

==Education==

Canterbury is served by 292 primary and secondary schools, educating around 94,000 students from ages 5 to 18. Around 13 percent of students attend state-integrated schools and 5 percent attend private schools, with the remaining 82 percent attending state schools. Christchurch and Timaru have single-sex state secondary schools.

Canterbury has two universities: the University of Canterbury located in western Christchurch, and Lincoln University located in Lincoln.

==Sport==
Sport in Canterbury has developed from the time of the initial settlement by British migrants, and remains an important part of community life. Cricket and rugby union have been popular team sports since the early years of settlement, with the first cricket club established in Christchurch in 1851, and the first rugby club in 1863. Interest in organised sports has diversified and now includes a wide range of codes. In 2022, the top five sporting codes in Canterbury based on club membership were netball, touch rugby, rugby union, golf and cricket.

There are around 1,200 sports clubs and associations in Christchurch, and in 2022 there were 140,000 affiliated members. Most of the sporting codes remain amateur, and rely upon volunteers as administrators and officials. However, there are some professional teams. Notable teams representing Christchurch or the Canterbury region include the Mainland Tactix (netball), Crusaders (rugby) and the Canterbury Kings (cricket).

The Crusaders, who play in the Super Rugby competition, are based in Christchurch. They represent Canterbury and other provinces of the upper South Island. They were formerly known as the &quot;Canterbury Crusaders&quot;. In provincial rugby, Canterbury is represented by three unions; Canterbury, Mid Canterbury and South Canterbury. For historical reasons, players from Kaikōura District still play for the Marlborough Rugby Union, which is part of the Tasman Provincial team (Nelson/Marlborough Unions combined). Other sporting teams include the Mainland Tactix (netball), Canterbury United FC (football) and Canterbury Rams (basketball).

Christchurch has hosted many international competitions including championship events. A particularly notable international event was the 1974 Commonwealth Games.

There are many outdoor sportsgrounds and a variety of indoor venues. Christchurch City Council maintains 110 sportsgrounds across Christchurch City and Banks Peninsula. The sports venues Lancaster Park and Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged beyond repair in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and were demolished. New facilities built to replace those damaged in the earthquake include the Ngā Puna Wai Sports Hub, the Parakiore Recreation and Sport Centre — an aquatic and indoor sports venue scheduled to open in 2025, and a multi–purpose covered stadium &quot;Te Kaha&quot; seating 30,000 spectators that is expected to be complete by April 2026.

==Film location==
Canterbury was the location used in the filming &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the fictional city of Edoras, Rohan, on Mount Sunday, as well as Helm&#x27;s deep backdrop, several miles down the valley.

<text>Fermín de Francisco Lasuén de Arasqueta (7 June 1736 – Mission de San Carlos (California), 26 June 1803) was a Basque Franciscan missionary to Alta California president of the Franciscan missions there, and founder of nine of the twenty-one Spanish missions in California.

==Biography==
Although he is sometimes called the &quot;forgotten friar,&quot; Fermín Lasuén actually governed the California Mission system three years longer than his more famous predecessor, Junípero Serra. Lasuén was born at Vitoria in Álava, Spain, on 7 July 1736 and joined the Franciscan order as a teenager, entering the Friary of San Francisco shortly before his fifteenth birthday on 19 March 1751. On 19 March 1751, Lasuén was ceremoniously invested with his Franciscan habit.

In 1759, Lasuén left the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu (Gipuzkoa). He then set sail from Cádiz with seventeen other friars while still a deacon to volunteer for ministry in the Americas. He arrived in New Spain in 1761 and was sent west to Las Californias in 1768. Following the establishment of Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769, he moved north to Alta California in 1773. He based himself in San Diego and remained there until 1775; he helped establish Mission San Juan Capistrano before the murder of Luís Jayme. Kumeyaay Indian unrest caused his return to San Diego.

In late 1776 he went to San Luis Obispo before again returning to San Diego in 1777 when he was made minister there. He was appointed the second &quot;Presidente&quot; of the missions in California in 1785, following the death of Junípero Serra, and transferred to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. Lasuén continued the work begun by Serra, establishing 9 more missions, bringing the total to 18 (the final total was 21). 

He died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on 26 July 1803. On his death he was succeeded by Esteban Tápis.

==Intellect, personality and character==

Although of a more introspective and brooding temperament than his predecessor Junipero Serra, Lasuén was a dedicated and capable administrator, founding the remaining California missions. Captain Alessandro Malaspina described Lasuén as such: &quot;...a man who in Christian lore, piety and conduct was truly apostolic, and his manner and learning unusual.&quot; It is clear from his diaries that Lasuén struggled with loneliness and perhaps some depression brought about by the extreme conditions he encountered in San Diego when he was asked to return to restore order after the murder of Fray Jayme. Lasuén described the ardors of missionary life as such:

At age 47, writing to his friend Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria Velez in 1783, Lasuén stated:

==Relationship with Junipero Serra and Felipe de Neve==

In 1774, Fermin Lasuén requested to return to the College of San Fernando in Mexico City. The request was denied, and Lasuén was eventually appointed by Padre Serra as rector of Mission San Diego, which was considered at the time to be the poorest and most unstable of the existing missions. Lasuén was fearful of Indian uprisings, and often wrote Serra and Felipe de Neve, Governor of California (1777 to 1782) about his difficulties, seeking advice about the placement of both friaries and the number of troops to guard the mission properties. His Christian zeal and sense of &quot;civilizing&quot; purpose led him to great lengths in order to acculturate Native Americans, even using their language in his pursuit, despite the Spanish king&#x27;s prohibition in that respect. News of the mistreatment of Native Americans in the Mission of San Francisco reached the governor of California Diego de Borica, also a Basque, who warned of a lawsuit against Lasuén should he not give up on his practices. Although it is clear that, at points during their ministry and friendship, they did not always agree about how to discipline the Indians and protect mission property, Lasuén wrote that Serra was a &quot;most exemplary superior and a holy man.&quot;

==Missions founded by Fray Fermín Lasuén==

* Mission Santa Barbara (1786)
* Mission La Purísima Concepción (1787)
* Mission Santa Cruz (1791)
* Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (1791)
* Mission San José (1797)
* Mission San Juan Bautista (1797)
* Mission San Miguel Arcángel (1797)
* Mission San Fernando Rey de España (1797)
* Mission San Luis Rey de Francia (1798)

He also oversaw the expansion of many of the California mission sites and helped many other missions like Mission San Gabriel Arcángel.

<doc id="61981" wikidata="Q933348" url="?curid=61981" title="Festschrift">
<text>In academia, a Festschrift (; plural, &quot;Festschriften&quot; ) is a book honoring a respected person, especially an academic, and presented during their lifetime. It generally takes the form of an edited volume, containing contributions from the honoree&#x27;s colleagues, former pupils, and friends. &quot;Festschriften&quot; are often titled something like &quot;Essays in Honour of...&quot; or &quot;Essays Presented to... .&quot;

==Terminology==
The term, borrowed from German, and literally meaning &quot;celebration writing&quot; (cognate with &quot;feast-script&quot;), might be translated as &quot;celebration publication&quot; or &quot;celebratory (piece of) writing&quot;. An alternative Latin term is (literally: &quot;book of friends&quot;). A comparable book presented posthumously is sometimes called a (, &quot;memorial publication&quot;), but this term is much rarer in English.

A &quot;Festschrift&quot; compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a (pronounced either or ), a term coined by the editors of the late Boris Marshak&#x27;s , &quot;Eran ud Aneran&quot;, published online in October 2003.

==History==
Originating in Germany before World War I, this European tradition of honoring special achievements in science and culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis. In the second half of the 20th century, the practice became used internationally. Since no English term for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word has been incorporated into English and is frequently used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original or anglicized as &quot;Festschrifts&quot;.

==Description==
A &quot;Festschrift&quot; contains original contributions by the honored academic&#x27;s close colleagues, often including their former doctoral students. It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree&#x27;s retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A &quot;Festschrift&quot; can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. &quot;Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt&quot;, for example, began in 1972 as a &quot;Festschrift&quot; to commemorate the 75th birthday of Joseph Vogt, a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree&#x27;s contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many &quot;Festschriften&quot; also feature a &quot;tabula gratulatoria&quot;, an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.

In the case of prominent academics, several &quot;Festschriften&quot; might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.

According to psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo, being selected by a prominent academic to edit a &quot;Festschrift&quot; can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch. Thus, being designated to prepare such a collection is considered an honor in Germany.

==Critique==
As Irving Louis Horowitz summarized, &quot;&quot;Festschriften&quot; persist and multiply. Why? Because they are not just retrospective, but prospective. That is to say the &quot;Festschrift&quot; is a &quot;Beruf&quot;, a call to further work, effort, and energy, a call to the improvement of learning, of a discipline, a science, an artistic vision, or an intellectual position. Even in this age of mass &quot;Festschriften&quot;, they remain a special literary genre&quot;.

Endel Tulving, a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that &quot;a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers.&quot;

In a review of the book &quot;Human Expeditions: Inspired by Bruce Trigger&quot;, Marxist archeologist Randall H. McGuire (at Binghamton University) observed in 2014 that &quot;the festschrift [book] and the memorial volume are dying enterprises&quot;, and suggested that creating festschrift websites instead, because many observers think that the festschrift volumes are a waste of time, often lack coherence and frequently include articles that the authors could not publish elsewhere. He suggested that because of the weaknesses, festschrifts do not sell and publishers are reluctant to publish them. However, about 3,400 &#x27;festschrifts&#x27; or &#x27;essays in honor of...&#x27; scholarly works have been published since McGuire&#x27;s 2014 review.

Philosopher Alan Soble, in a review of the book &quot;Fact and Value&quot; in honor of MIT&#x27;s philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson, has formulated – somewhat tongue-in-cheek – 13 conditions that should be satisfied by a &quot;Festschrift&quot;.

<text>Charles Robert Redford Jr. (born August 18, 1936) is an American actor and filmmaker. He has received numerous accolades such as an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and two Golden Globe Awards, as well as the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1994, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1996, the Academy Honorary Award in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2005, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, and the Honorary César in 2019. He was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014.

Appearing onstage in the late 1950s, Redford&#x27;s television career began in 1960, with appearances on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in 1961 and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in 1962. His greatest Broadway success was as the stuffy newlywed husband in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1963). Redford made his film debut in &quot;War Hunt&quot; (1962). He gained success as a leading man in films such as &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967), &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972). He received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the crime caper &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973). He continued to star in such films as &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979).

Redford made his directorial film debut with &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. During this time, he starred in films such as &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), and &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985). He released his third film as a director, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, in 1992. He went on to receive Best Director and Best Picture nominations in 1995 for &quot;Quiz Show&quot;. In 1981 Redford cofounded the Sundance Resort and Film Institute. His later film roles include &quot;All Is Lost&quot; (2013), &quot;Truth&quot; (2015), &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot; (2018). Redford portrayed Alexander Pierce in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

== Early life and education ==
Redford was born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California, to Martha Woodruff Redford (née Hart; 1914–1955), who was from Austin, Texas, and Charles Robert Redford Sr. (1914–1991), an accountant. He has a paternal half-brother, William. Redford is of Irish, Scottish, and English ancestry. His patrilineal great-great-grandfather, a Protestant Englishman named Elisha Redford, married Mary Ann McCreery, of Irish Catholic descent, in Manchester, Lancashire. They emigrated to New York City in America in 1849, immediately settling next in Stonington, Connecticut. They had a son named Charles, the first in line to have been given the name. Regarding Redford&#x27;s maternal lineage, the Harts were Irish from Galway and the Greens were Scotch-Irish who settled in the United States in the 18th century. Redford&#x27;s family lived in Van Nuys while his father worked in El Segundo. As a child, he and his family would often travel to Austin, Texas to visit his maternal grandfather and credits his environmentalism and love of nature to his childhood in Texas.

Robert attended Van Nuys High School, where he was classmates with baseball pitcher Don Drysdale. He has described himself as having been a &quot;bad&quot; student, finding inspiration outside the classroom in art and sports. He hit tennis balls with Pancho Gonzales at the Los Angeles Tennis Club to help Gonzales warm up for matches. Redford had a mild case of polio when he was 11.

After graduating from high school in 1954, he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder for a year and a half, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. While there, he worked at a restaurant/bar called The Sink, where a painting of his likeness now figures prominently among the bar&#x27;s murals. While at Colorado, Redford began drinking heavily and, as a result, lost his half-scholarship and was kicked out of school. He went on to travel in Europe, living in France, Spain, and Italy. He later studied painting at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Class of 1959) in New York City.

== Career ==
=== 1959–1966: Early roles ===
Redford&#x27;s career, like that of many major stars who emerged in the 1950s, began in New York City, where the actor found work both on stage and in television. His Broadway debut was in a small role in &quot;Tall Story&quot; (1959), followed by parts in &quot;The Highest Tree&quot; (1959) and &quot;Sunday in New York&quot; (1961). His biggest Broadway success was as the stuffy newlywed husband of Elizabeth Ashley in the original 1963 cast of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. Starting in 1960, Redford appeared as a guest star on numerous television drama programs, including &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Tate&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, among others.

Redford made his screen debut in &quot;Tall Story&quot; (1960), reprising his Broadway role. The film&#x27;s stars were Anthony Perkins, Jane Fonda (her debut), and Ray Walston. After his Broadway success, he was cast in larger feature roles in movies. In 1960, Redford was cast as Danny Tilford, a mentally disturbed young man trapped in the wreckage of his family garage, in &quot;Breakdown&quot;, one of the last episodes of the syndicated adventure series, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, starring Jim Davis and Lang Jeffries. Redford earned an Emmy nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;The Voice of Charlie Pont&quot; (ABC, 1962). One of his last television appearances until 2019 was on October 7, 1963, on &quot;Breaking Point,&quot; an ABC medical drama about psychiatry. In 1962 Redford got his second film role in &quot;War Hunt,&quot; and was soon after cast alongside screen legend Alec Guinness in the war comedy &quot;Situation Hopeless ... But Not Serious&quot;, in which he played a US soldier falsely imprisoned by a German civilian even after the war has ended. In &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965), which won him a Golden Globe for best new star, he played a bisexual movie star who marries starlet Natalie Wood, and rejoined her along with Charles Bronson for Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966) — again, as her lover, though this time in a film which achieved even greater success. The same year saw his first teaming (on equal footing) with Jane Fonda, in Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Chase&quot;. This film marked the only time Redford would star with Marlon Brando.

=== 1967–1979: Career stardom ===

Fonda and Redford were paired again in the popular big-screen version of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967) and were again co-stars many years later in Pollack&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979), followed 38 years later with a Netflix feature, &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot;. After this initial success, Redford became concerned about his blond male stereotype image and refused roles in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and &quot;The Graduate&quot;. Redford found the niche he was seeking in George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), scripted by William Goldman, in which he was paired for the first time with Paul Newman. The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star, cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy.

While Redford did not receive an Academy Award or Golden Globe nomination for playing the Sundance Kid, he won a British Academy of Film and Television Award (BAFTA) for that role and his parts in &quot;Downhill Racer&quot; (1969) and &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here&quot; (1969). The latter two films and the subsequent &quot;Little Fauss and Big Halsy&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972) were not commercially successful. Redford had long harbored ambitions to work on both sides of the camera. As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for &quot;Downhill Racer&quot;. The political satire &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972) was a moderate box office and critical success.
Starting in 1973, Redford experienced an almost-unparalleled four-year run of box office success. The western &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;″s (1972) box office earnings from early 1973 until its second re-release in 1975 would have placed it as the No. 2 highest-grossing film of 1973. The romantic period drama with Barbra Streisand, &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1973. The crime caper reunion with Paul Newman, &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), became the top-grossing film of 1974 and one of the top 20 highest-grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation, plus landed Redford the lone nomination of his career for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he starred in the romantic drama &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) starring Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston, and Bruce Dern. The film was the No. 8 highest-grossing film of 1974. &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969) placed as the No. 10 highest-grossing film for 1974 as it was re-released due to the popularity of &quot;The Sting.&quot; In 1974 Redford became the first performer since Bing Crosby in 1946 to have three films in a year&#x27;s top ten grossing titles. Each year between 1974 and 1976, movie exhibitors voted Redford Hollywood&#x27;s top box-office star.

In 1975, Redford&#x27;s hit movies included 1920s aviation drama, &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975), and the spy thriller &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), alongside Faye Dunaway, which finished at Nos. 16 and 17 in box office grosses for 1975, respectively. In 1976 he co-starred with Dustin Hoffman in the No. 2 highest-grossing film for the year, the critically acclaimed &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. In 1975, 1977 and 1978, Redford won the Golden Globe for Favorite World Film Star, a popularity-based award that is no longer awarded. In 1976, Robert Redford published &quot;The Outlaw Trail: A Journey Through Time&quot;. Redford states, &quot;The Outlaw Trail. It was a name that fascinated me - a geographical anchor in Western folklore. Whether real or imagined, it was a name that, for me, held a kind of magic, a freedom, a mystery. I wanted to see it in much the same way as the outlaws did, by horse and by foot, and document the adventure with text and photographs.&quot;

&quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), in which Redford and Hoffman play Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, was a landmark film for Redford. Not only was he the executive producer and co-star, but the film&#x27;s serious subject matter — the Watergate scandal — and its attempt to create a realistic portrayal of journalism also reflected the actor&#x27;s offscreen concerns for political causes. The film landed eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director (Alan J. Pakula), while winning for the Best Screenplay (Goldman). It won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Picture and Best Director. In 1977, Redford appeared in a segment of the war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977). Then he took a two-year hiatus from movies, before starring as past-his-prime rodeo star in the adventure-romance &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979). This film reunited him with Jane Fonda, finishing at No. 9 in the box office for 1980.

=== 1980–1998: Directorial debut ===
His first film as director was the drama film &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), a drama about the slow disintegration of an upper-middle class family after the death of a son. Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from Mary Tyler Moore, as well as superb work from Donald Sutherland and Timothy Hutton, who also won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film is one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Redford himself, and Best Picture. Critic Roger Ebert declared it &quot;an intelligent, perceptive, and deeply moving film.&quot; Later that year he appeared in the prison drama &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), playing a prison warden attempting to reform the system.
Soon after that, he starred in the baseball drama &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984). Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite Meryl Streep, became a large box office success (combined 1985 and 1986 grosses placed it at No. 5 for 1986), won a Golden Globe for Best Picture, and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture. Streep was nominated for Best Actress but Redford did not receive a nomination. The movie proved to be Redford&#x27;s biggest success of the decade and Redford and Pollack&#x27;s most successful of their seven movies together. Redford&#x27;s next film, &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986) alongside Debra Winger, was only a minor success at the box office.

Redford did not direct again until &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot; (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of John Nichols&#x27;s acclaimed novel of the Southwest. &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot; is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of Truchas in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out with tax increases. Other directorial projects have included the period drama &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992), based on Norman Maclean&#x27;s novella starring Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, and Tom Skerritt. Redford received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. In 1994 he directed the exposé &quot;Quiz Show&quot; about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s. In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by Paul Attanasio with noted cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and a strong cast that featured Paul Scofield, John Turturro, Rob Morrow, and Ralph Fiennes. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;Robert Redford may have become a more complacent movie star in the last decade, but he has become a more daring and accomplished filmmaker. &#x27;Quiz Show&#x27; is his best movie since &#x27;Ordinary People&#x27;&quot;.

Redford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He released his third film as a director, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, in 1992, which was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young Brad Pitt to greater prominence. In 1993, he played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; as a billionaire businessman who tests a couple&#x27;s morals; the film became one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits. He co-starred with Michelle Pfeiffer in the newsroom romance &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot; (1996), and with Kristin Scott Thomas and a young Scarlett Johansson in &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; (1998), which he also directed. Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as &quot;Havana&quot; (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992), in which he co-starred with River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier.

=== 1999–2012 ===

Redford also directed Matt Damon and Will Smith in &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; (2000). He appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama &quot;The Last Castle&quot; (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with Brad Pitt for &quot;Spy Game&quot;, another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of &quot;The Candidate&quot; but the project never happened. Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary &quot;Sacred Planet&quot; (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In &quot;The Clearing&quot; (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.

Redford stepped back into producing with &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future. With five years spent on the film&#x27;s making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released. Back in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director Lasse Hallström&#x27;s &quot;An Unfinished Life&quot; (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)—whom he blames for his son&#x27;s death—and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship. The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clichéd and overly sentimental.

Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with Meryl Streep 22 years after they starred in &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, for his personal project &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot; (2007), which also starred Tom Cruise. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Lions for Lambs is so square it’s like something out of the gray twilight glow of the golden age of television. Even the military plot, which clunks, seems to be taking place on stage.&quot; In 2010, Redford released &quot;The Conspirator&quot;, a period drama revolving around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Redford appeared in the 2011 documentary &quot;Buck&quot; by Cindy Meehl, where he discussed his experiences with title subject Buck Brannaman during the production of &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;. In 2012, Redford directed &quot;The Company You Keep&quot;, in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. The film starred himself, Shia LaBeouf and Julie Christie.

=== 2013–present ===

In 2013, Redford starred in &quot;All Is Lost&quot;, directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, his first time winning an acting honour from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for &quot;Downhill Racer&quot;). Ali Arikan wrote in &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;, &quot;Chandor plays to Redford&#x27;s strengths: his battered visage, calm determination, and detachment from the vagaries of a &quot;normal&quot; existence. In return, Redford gives the performance of the latter half of his career in a role that is not just physically, but also psychologically demanding&quot;.

In April 2014, Redford played the main antagonist of the Marvel Studios superhero film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier,&quot; Alexander Pierce, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and leader of the Hydra cell operating the Triskelion. Redford was a co-producer and, with Emma Thompson and Nick Nolte, acted in the film &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; (2015), based on Bill Bryson&#x27;s book of the same name. Redford had optioned the film rights for the book from Bryson after reading it more than a decade earlier, with the intent of costarring in it with Paul Newman but had shelved the project after his death.

The same year, he played news anchor Dan Rather in James Vanderbilt&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; alongside Cate Blanchett. The film received mixed reviews with Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; noting, &quot;Redford, who bears a solid resemblance to Rather but not quite enough to make you forget whom you’re watching, plays the veteran newsman with easy gravitas, inner strength and a gentle paternal twinkle, with little display of the anger and volatility for which he was often known over the course of his storied career.&quot; In 2016, he took the supporting role of Mr. Meacham in the Disney remake &quot; Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. The next year, Redford starred in &quot;The Discovery&quot; and &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot;, both released on Netflix streaming in 2017. The latter film, which was also produced by Redford, reunited him with co-star Jane Fonda for the fourth time and garnered positive reviews.

Redford played bank robber Forrest Tucker in the David Lowery directed drama film &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot;, which was released in September 2018, and for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. Alissa Wikinson wrote in &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;In The Old Man &amp; the Gun, both Redford and Lowery are returning to their roots. For Redford, a role as a lifelong bank robber feels like a fitting cap to a career effectively launched half a century ago with his role alongside Paul Newman in &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;.&quot; In August 2018, Redford announced his retirement from acting after completion of the film, though the following month, Redford stated that he &quot;regretted&quot; announcing his retirement because &quot;you never know&quot;.

He briefly reprised his role as Alexander Pierce for a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot;, filmed in 2017 prior to the completion of the former film.

==Filmography==

== Awards and honors ==

In his directing debut, Redford won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Director for the film Ordinary People. He was a 2002 Academy Honorary Award recipient at the 74th Academy Awards. In 2017, he was awarded the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 74th Venice Film Festival. On February 22, 2019, Redford received the Honorary César at the 44th César Awards in Paris.

Redford attended the University of Colorado in the 1950s and received an honorary degree in 1988. In 1989, the National Audubon Society awarded Redford its highest honor, the Audubon Medal. In 1995, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Bard College. Redford received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Brown University at the 240th Commencement exercises on May 25, 2008, with the actor also speaking at the ceremonies. He was a 2010 recipient of the New Mexico Governor&#x27;s Award for Excellence in the Arts. On May 24, 2015, Redford delivered the commencement address and received an honorary degree from Colby College in Maine.

In 1996, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton. On October 14, 2010, Redford was appointed &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by President Nicolas Sarkozy.
On November 22, 2016, President Barack Obama honored Redford with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. In December 2005, he received the Kennedy Center Honors for his contributions to American culture. The honors recipients are recognized for their lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts: whether in dance, music, theater, opera, motion pictures or television.

In 2008, Redford received The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, one of the richest prizes in the arts, given annually to &quot;a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind&#x27;s enjoyment and understanding of life.&quot; The University of Southern California (USC) School of Dramatic Arts announced the first annual &quot;Robert Redford Award for Engaged Artists&quot; in 2009. According to the school&#x27;s website, the award was created &quot;to honor those who have distinguished themselves not only in the exemplary quality, skill and innovation of their work, but also in their public commitment to social responsibility, to increasing awareness of global issues and events, and to inspiring and empowering young people.&quot;

==Sundance Institute==
With the financial proceeds of his acting success, starting with his salaries from &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and &quot;Downhill Racer&quot;, Redford bought a ski area on the east side of Mount Timpanogos northeast of Provo, Utah, called &quot;Timp Haven&quot;. He renamed it &quot;Sundance&quot; after his &quot;Sundance Kid&quot; character. Redford&#x27;s ex-wife Lola was from Utah and they had built a home in the area in 1963. Portions of the movie &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; (1972), a film which is both one of Redford&#x27;s favorites and one that has heavily influenced him, was shot near the ski area.

Redford went on to create the Sundance Film Festival, which became the country&#x27;s largest festival for independent films. In 2008, Sundance exhibited 125 feature-length films from 34 countries, with more than 50,000 attendees in Salt Lake City, and Park City, Utah.

Robert Redford also founded the Sundance Institute; Sundance Cinemas; Sundance Catalog; and the Sundance Channel; all in and around Park City, 30 miles (48 km) north of the Sundance ski area. Redford also owned a Park City restaurant, Zoom, that closed in May 2017.

===Wildwood Enterprises, Inc.===
Robert Redford is the co-owner of Wildwood Enterprises, Inc., with Bill Holderman, producer, with the following film credits: &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot;; &quot;Quiz Show&quot;; &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;; &quot;Ordinary People&quot;; &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;; &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;; &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot;; &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;; and &quot;The Conspirator&quot;.

===Sundance Productions===
Redford is the president and co-founder of Sundance Productions, with Laura Michalchyshyn.

Most recently, Sundance Productions produced &quot;Chicagoland (CNN)&quot;, &quot;Cathedrals of Culture&quot; (Berlin Film Festival), &quot;The March (PBS)&quot; and Emmy nominee &quot;All The President&#x27;s Men Revisited&quot; (Discovery), Isabella Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Green Porno Live!&quot;, and &quot;To Russia With Love&quot; on Epix.

Since founding the nonprofit Sundance Institute in Park City, Utah, in 1981, Redford has been deeply involved with independent film. Through its various workshop programs and popular film festival, Sundance has provided support for independent filmmakers. In 1995, Redford signed a deal with Showtime to start a 24-hour cable television channel devoted to airing independent films. The Sundance Channel premiered on February 29, 1996.

== Personal life ==
On August 9, 1958, Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in Las Vegas. A second reception was held at Lola&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s home on September 12. They had four children: Scott Anthony Redford (September 1, 1959 – November 17, 1959), Shauna Jean Redford (b. November 15, 1960), David James Redford (May 5, 1962 – October 16, 2020), and Amy Hart Redford (b. October 22, 1970).

Redford and Van Wagenen never publicly announced a separation or divorce, but in 1982, entertainment columnist Shirley Eder reported that the pair &quot;have been very much apart for a number of years.&quot; In 1991, &quot;Parade&quot; magazine stated, &quot;it is unclear whether the divorce has been finalized.&quot; Many websites say they were divorced in 1985.

Scott Redford died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of months and is buried at Provo City Cemetery in Provo, Utah. Shauna Redford is a painter and married to journalist Eric Schlosser. James Redford was a writer and producer, while Amy Redford is an actress, director, and producer. Redford has seven grandchildren.&lt;ref name=&quot;closerweekly/redfords-kids&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2009, Redford married his longtime girlfriend, Sibylle Szaggars, at the Louis C. Jacob Hotel in Hamburg, Germany. She had moved in with Redford in 1996 and shared his home in Sundance, Utah.

In May 2011, &quot;Robert Redford: The Biography&quot; was published by Alfred A. Knopf, written by Michael Feeney Callan over fifteen years with Redford&#x27;s input and drawn from his personal papers and diaries.

== Political activism ==

Redford supports environmentalism, Native American rights, LGBT rights, and the arts. He also supported advocacy groups, such as the Political Action Committee of the Directors Guild of America. Redford has supported Republicans, including Brent Cornell Morris in his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for Utah&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in 1990. Redford also supported Gary Herbert, another Republican and a friend, in Herbert&#x27;s successful 2004 campaign to be elected Utah&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor. Herbert later became Governor of Utah.

As an avid environmentalist, Redford is a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Redford is the first quote on the back cover of Donald Trump&#x27;s book &quot;Crippled America&quot; (2015), saying of Trump&#x27;s candidacy, &quot;I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s in there, being the way he is, and saying what he says and the ways he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that is very needed.&quot; A representative later clarified that Redford&#x27;s statement, taken from a longer conversation with Larry King, was not intended to endorse Trump for president.
In 2019, Redford penned an op-ed in which he referred to Trump&#x27;s administration as a &quot;monarchy in disguise&quot; and stated &quot;[i]t&#x27;s time for Trump to go.&quot;
Redford later co-authored another op-ed in which he criticized Trump&#x27;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic while also citing the collective public response to the pandemic as a model for how to respond to climate change. He criticized the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In July 2020, Redford penned an op-ed in which he stated President Trump lacks a &quot;moral compass.&quot; In the same piece, he announced that he would be voting for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

Redford was opposed to the TransCanada Corporation&#x27;s Keystone Pipeline. In 2013, he was identified by its CEO, Russ Girling, for leading the anti-pipeline protest movement. In April 2014, Redford, a Pitzer College Trustee, and Pitzer College President Laura Skandera Trombley announced that the college will divest fossil fuel stocks from its endowment; at the time, it was the higher education institution with the largest endowment in the US to make this commitment. The press conference was held at the LA Press Club. In November 2012, Pitzer launched the Robert Redford Conservancy for Southern California Sustainability at Pitzer College.

<text>Tannins (or tannoids) are a class of astringent, polyphenolic biomolecules that bind to and precipitate proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids. The term &quot;tannin&quot; is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups (such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with various macromolecules.

The term &quot;tannin&quot; (from scientific French &quot;tannin&quot;, from French &quot;tan&quot; &quot;crushed oak bark&quot;, &quot;tanner&quot; &quot;to tan&quot;, cognate with English &quot;tanning&quot;, Medieval Latin &quot;tannare&quot;, from Proto-Celtic &quot;*tannos&quot; &quot;oak&quot;) refers to the abundance of these compounds in oak bark, which was used in tanning animal hides into leather.

The tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where they play a role in protection from predation (acting as pesticides) and might help in regulating plant growth. The astringency from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit, red wine or tea. Likewise, the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times.

Tannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 daltons (proanthocyanidins).

== Structure and classes of tannins ==
There are three major classes of tannins: Shown below are the base unit or monomer of the tannin. Particularly in the flavone-derived tannins, the base shown must be (additionally) heavily hydroxylated and polymerized in order to give the high molecular weight polyphenol motif that characterizes tannins. Typically, tannin molecules require at least 12 hydroxyl groups and at least five phenyl groups to function as protein binders.
Oligostilbenoids (oligo- or polystilbenes) are oligomeric forms of stilbenoids and constitute a minor class of tannins.

=== Pseudo-tannins ===
Pseudo-tannins are low molecular weight compounds associated with other compounds. They do not change color during the Goldbeater&#x27;s skin test, unlike hydrolysable and condensed tannins, and cannot be used as tanning compounds. Some examples of pseudo tannins and their sources are:

== History ==
Ellagic acid, gallic acid, and pyrogallic acid were first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Julius Löwe was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide.

Maximilian Nierenstein studied natural phenols and tannins found in different plant species. Working with Arthur George Perkin, he prepared ellagic acid from algarobilla and certain other fruits in 1905. He suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by &quot;Penicillium&quot; in 1915. Tannase is an enzyme that Nierenstein used to produce m-digallic acid from gallotannins. He proved the presence of catechin in cocoa beans in 1931. He showed in 1945 that luteic acid, a molecule present in the myrobalanitannin, a tannin found in the fruit of &quot;Terminalia chebula&quot;, is an intermediary compound in the synthesis of ellagic acid.

At these times, molecule formulas were determined through combustion analysis. The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of paper chromatography provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945, including prominent work by Edgar Charles Bate-Smith and Tony Swain at Cambridge University.

In 1966, Edwin Haslam proposed a first comprehensive definition of plant polyphenols based on the earlier proposals of Bate-Smith, Swain and Theodore White, which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property. It is referred to as the White–Bate-Smith–Swain–Haslam (WBSSH) definition.

== Occurrence ==
Tannins are distributed in species throughout the plant kingdom. They are commonly found in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Mole (1993) studied the distribution of tannin in 180 families of dicotyledons and 44 families of monocotyledons (Cronquist). Most families of dicot contain tannin-free species (tested by their ability to precipitate proteins). The best known families of which all species tested contain tannin are: Aceraceae, Actinidiaceae, Anacardiaceae, Bixaceae, Burseraceae, Combretaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Ericaceae, Grossulariaceae, Myricaceae for dicot and Najadaceae and Typhaceae in Monocot. To the family of the oak, Fagaceae, 73% of the species tested contain tannin. For those of acacias, Mimosaceae, only 39% of the species tested contain tannin, among Solanaceae rate drops to 6% and 4% for the Asteraceae. Some families like the Boraginaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Papaveraceae contain no tannin-rich species.

The most abundant polyphenols are the condensed tannins, found in virtually all families of plants, and comprising up to 50% of the dry weight of leaves.

=== Cellular localization ===

In all vascular plants studied, tannins are manufactured by a chloroplast-derived organelle, the tannosome. Tannins are mainly physically located in the vacuoles or surface wax of plants. These storage sites keep tannins active against plant predators, but also keep some tannins from affecting plant metabolism while the plant tissue is alive.

Tannins are classified as ergastic substances, i.e., non-protoplasm materials found in cells. Tannins, by definition, precipitate proteins. In this condition, they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process. Idioblasts are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain non-living substances. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin or pigments etc. They also can contain tannins. In Japanese persimmon (&quot;Diospyros kaki&quot;) fruits, tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells, which are idioblasts of parenchyma cells in the flesh.

=== Presence in soils ===

The convergent evolution of tannin-rich plant communities has occurred on nutrient-poor acidic soils throughout the world. Tannins were once believed to function as anti-herbivore defenses, but more and more ecologists now recognize them as important controllers of decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes. As concern grows about global warming, there is great interest to better understand the role of polyphenols as regulators of carbon cycling, in particular in northern boreal forests.

Leaf litter and other decaying parts of kauri (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;), a tree species found in New Zealand, decompose much more slowly than those of most other species. Besides its acidity, the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols, most notably tannins, that are harmful to microorganisms.

=== Presence in water and wood ===
The leaching of highly water soluble tannins from decaying vegetation and leaves along a stream may produce what is known as a blackwater river. Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown color from dissolved peat tannins. The presence of tannins (or humic acid) in well water can make it smell bad or taste bitter, but this does not make it unsafe to drink.

Tannins leaching from an unprepared driftwood decoration in an aquarium can cause pH lowering and coloring of the water to a tea-like tinge. A way to avoid this is to boil the wood in water several times, discarding the water each time. Using peat as an aquarium substrate can have the same effect. Many hours of boiling the driftwood may need to be followed by many weeks or months of constant soaking and many water changes before the water will stay clear. Raising the water&#x27;s pH level, e.g. by adding baking soda, will accelerate the process of leaching.

Tannins in water can lead to feather staining on wild and domestic waterfowl which frequent the water; mute swans, which are typically white in colour, can often be observed with reddish-brown staining as a result of coming into contact with dissolved tannins, though dissolved iron compounds also play a role.

Softwoods, while in general much lower in tannins than hardwoods, are usually not recommended for use in an aquarium so using a hardwood with a very light color, indicating a low tannin content, can be an easy way to avoid tannins. Tannic acid is brown in color, so in general white woods have a low tannin content. Woods with a lot of yellow, red, or brown coloration to them (like cedar, redwood, red oak, etc.) tend to contain a lot of tannin.

== Extraction ==
There is no single protocol for extracting tannins from all plant material. The procedures used for tannins are widely variable. It may be that acetone in the extraction solvent increases the total yield by inhibiting interactions between tannins and proteins during extraction or even by breaking hydrogen bonds between tannin-protein complexes.

== Tests for tannins ==
There are three groups of methods for the analysis of tannins: precipitation of proteins or alkaloids, reaction with phenolic rings, and depolymerization.

=== Alkaloid precipitation ===
Alkaloids such as caffeine, cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method.

=== Goldbeater&#x27;s skin test ===
When goldbeater&#x27;s skin or ox skin is dipped in HCl, rinsed in water, soaked in the tannin solution for 5 minutes, washed in water, and then treated with 1% FeSO4 solution, it gives a blue black color if tannin was present.

=== Ferric chloride test ===
The following describes the use of ferric chloride (FeCl3) tests for phenolics in general: Powdered plant leaves of the test plant (1.0 g) are weighed into a beaker and 10 ml of distilled water are added. The mixture is boiled for five minutes. Two drops of 5% FeCl3 are then added. Production of a greenish precipitate is an indication of the presence of tannins. Alternatively, a portion of the water extract is diluted with distilled water in a ratio of 1:4 and few drops of 10% ferric chloride solution is added. A blue or green color indicates the presence of tannins (Evans, 1989).

=== Other methods ===
The hide-powder method is used in tannin analysis for leather tannin and the Stiasny method for wood adhesives. Statistical analysis reveals that there is no significant relationship between the results from the hide-powder and the Stiasny methods.

;Hide-powder method
400 mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water. 3 g of slightly chromated hide-powder previously dried in vacuum for 24h over CaCl2 are added and the mixture stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The suspension is filtered without vacuum through a sintered glass filter. The weight gain of the hide-powder expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material is equated to the percentage of tannin in the sample.

;Stiasny&#x27;s method
100 mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 10 ml distilled water. 1 ml of 10M HCl and 2 ml of 37% formaldehyde are added and the mixture heated under reflux for 30 min. The reaction mixture is filtered while hot through a sintered glass filter. The precipitate is washed with hot water (5× 10 ml) and dried over CaCl2. The yield of tannin is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material.

=== Reaction with phenolic rings ===
The bark tannins of &quot;Commiphora angolensis&quot; have been revealed by the usual color and precipitation reactions and by quantitative determination by the methods of Löwenthal-Procter and of Deijs (formalin-hydrochloric acid method).

Colorimetric methods have existed such as the Neubauer-Löwenthal method which uses potassium permanganate as an oxidizing agent and indigo sulfate as an indicator, originally proposed by Löwenthal in 1877. The difficulty is that the establishing of a titer for tannin is not always convenient since it is extremely difficult to obtain the pure tannin. Neubauer proposed to remove this difficulty by establishing the titer not with regard to the tannin but with regard to crystallised oxalic acid, whereby he found that 83 g oxalic acid correspond to 41.20 g tannin. Löwenthal&#x27;s method has been criticized. For instance, the amount of indigo used is not sufficient to retard noticeably the oxidation of the non-tannins substances. The results obtained by this method are therefore only comparative. A modified method, proposed in 1903 for the quantification of tannins in wine, Feldmann&#x27;s method, is making use of calcium hypochlorite, instead of potassium permanganate, and indigo sulfate.

== Food items with tannins ==
=== Pomegranates ===
=== Accessory fruits ===
Strawberries contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins.

=== Berries ===

Most berries, such as cranberries, and blueberries, contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins.

=== Nuts ===
Nuts vary in the amount of tannins they contain. Some species of acorns of oak contain large amounts. For example, acorns of &quot;Quercus robur&quot; and &quot;Quercus petraea&quot; in Poland were found to contain 2.4–5.2% and 2.6–4.8% tannins as a proportion of dry matter, but the tannins can be removed by leaching in water so that the acorns become edible. Other nuts – such as hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds – contain lower amounts. Tannin concentration in the crude extract of these nuts did not directly translate to the same relationships for the condensed fraction.

=== Herbs and spices ===
Cloves, tarragon, cumin, thyme, vanilla, and cinnamon all contain tannins.

=== Legumes ===
Most legumes contain tannins. Red-colored beans contain the most tannins, and white-colored beans have the least. Peanuts without shells have a very low tannin content. Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) have a smaller amount of tannins.

=== Chocolate ===
Chocolate liquor contains about 6% tannins.

=== Drinks with tannins ===
Principal human dietary sources of tannins are tea and coffee. Most wines aged in charred oak barrels possess tannins absorbed from the wood. Soils high in clay also contribute to tannins in wine grapes. This concentration gives wine its signature astringency.

Coffee pulp has been found to contain low to trace amounts of tannins.

==== Fruit juices ====
Although citrus fruits do not contain tannins, orange-colored juices often contain tannins from food colouring. Apple, grape and berry juices all contain high amounts of tannins. Sometimes tannins are even added to juices and ciders to create a more astringent feel to the taste.

==== Beer ====
In addition to the alpha acids extracted from hops to provide bitterness in beer, condensed tannins are also present. These originate both from malt and hops. Trained brewmasters, particularly those in Germany, consider the presence of tannins to be a flaw. However, in some styles, the presence of this astringency is acceptable or even desired, as, for example, in a Flanders red ale.

In lager type beers, the tannins can form a precipitate with specific haze-forming proteins in the beer resulting in turbidity at low temperature. This chill haze can be prevented by removing part of the tannins or part of the haze-forming proteins. Tannins are removed using PVPP, haze-forming proteins by using silica or tannic acid.

== Properties for animal nutrition ==
Tannins have traditionally been considered antinutritional, depending upon their chemical structure and dosage.

Many studies suggest that chestnut tannins have positive effects on silage quality in the round bale silages, in particular reducing NPNs (non-protein nitrogen) in the lowest wilting level.

Improved fermentability of soya meal nitrogen in the rumen may occur. Condensed tannins inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes (for more on that topic, see plant defense against herbivory). Histatins, another type of salivary proteins, also precipitate tannins from solution, thus preventing alimentary adsorption.

Legume fodders containing condensed tannins are a possible option for integrated sustainable control of gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants, which may help address the worldwide development of resistance to synthetic anthelmintics. These include nuts, temperate and tropical barks, carob, coffee and cocoa.

== Tannin uses and market ==

Tannins have been used since antiquity in the processes of tanning hides for leather, and in helping preserve iron artifacts (as with Japanese iron teapots).

Industrial tannin production began at the beginning of the 19th century with the industrial revolution, to produce tanning material for the need for more leather. Before that time, processes used plant material and were long (up to six months).

There was a collapse in the vegetable tannin market in the 1950s–1960s, due to the appearance of synthetic tannins, which were invented in response to a scarcity of vegetable tannins during World War II. At that time, many small tannin industry sites closed. Vegetable tannins are estimated to be used for the production of 10–20% of the global leather production.

The cost of the final product depends on the method used to extract the tannins, in particular the use of solvents, alkali and other chemicals used (for instance glycerin). For large quantities, the most cost-effective method is hot water extraction.

Tannic acid is used worldwide as clarifying agent in alcoholic drinks and as aroma ingredient in both alcoholic and soft drinks or juices. Tannins from different botanical origins also find extensive uses in the wine industry.

=== Uses ===
Tannins are an important ingredient in the process of tanning leather. Tanbark from oak, mimosa, chestnut and quebracho tree has traditionally been the primary source of tannery tannin, though inorganic tanning agents are also in use today and account for 90% of the world&#x27;s leather production.

Tannins produce different colors with ferric chloride (either blue, blue black, or green to greenish-black) according to the type of tannin. Iron gall ink is produced by treating a solution of tannins with iron(II) sulfate.

Tannins can also be used as a mordant, and is especially useful in natural dyeing of cellulose fibers such as cotton. The type of tannin used may or may not have an impact on the final color of the fiber.

Tannin is a component in a type of industrial particleboard adhesive developed jointly by the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization and Forintek Labs Canada. &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; tannins has been investigated for the production of wood adhesives.

Condensed tannins, e.g., quebracho tannin, and Hydrolyzable tannins, e.g., chestnut tannin, appear to be able to substitute a high proportion of synthetic phenol in phenol-formaldehyde resins for wood particleboard.

Tannins can be used for production of anti-corrosive primers for treating rusted steel surfaces prior to painting, converting rust to iron tannate and consolidating and sealing the surface.

The use of resins made of tannins has been investigated to remove mercury and methylmercury from solution. Immobilized tannins have been tested to recover uranium from seawater.

<text>James Francis Edward Stuart (10 June 16881 January 1766) was the House of Stuart claimant to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1701 until his death in 1766. The only son of James II of England and his second wife, Mary of Modena, he was Prince of Wales and heir until his Catholic father was deposed and exiled in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. His Protestant half-sister Mary II and her husband William III became co-monarchs. As a Catholic, he was subsequently excluded from the succession by the Act of Settlement 1701.

Raised primarily in France and Italy, when his father died in September 1701, James claimed the thrones. As part of the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1708 Louis XIV of France backed a landing in Scotland on his behalf. This failed, as did further attempts in 1715 and 1719. Led by his elder son Charles Edward Stuart, the 1745 Rising was the last serious effort to restore the House of Stuart.

==Birth and childhood==
James Francis Edward Stuart was born on 10 June 1688, at St. James&#x27;s Palace, first and only son of James II of England and his second wife, Mary of Modena, both Catholics. As the eldest surviving son of the reigning monarch he was automatically Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth, and was created Prince of Wales in July 1688.

His birth was unexpected, coming five years after his mother&#x27;s tenth and last pregnancy, none of which produced a child that survived more than a few days. The birth reignited controversies of religion, as the new son would be raised Catholic. Wild rumours spread among British Anglicans: that the child had died stillborn, and that the baby feted as the new prince was an impostor smuggled into the royal birth chamber in a warming pan. Protestants found it suspicious that everyone attending the birth was supposedly Catholic, although the Protestant Lady Bellasyse testified that she &quot;saw the child taken out of the bed with the navel string hanging to its belly&quot;. Another rumour was that James II had not been the father; he was said to be impotent after a bout with venereal disease years earlier. In an attempt to quash these rumours, James published the testimonies of over seventy witnesses to the birth. The line of succession to the throne was thrust into doubt. James II&#x27;s eldest legitimate daughters, Mary and Anne, had been raised as Protestants. British Protestants had expected Mary, from his father&#x27;s first marriage, to succeed their father. This possibility had kept Protestants somewhat content, with his rule a temporary inconvenience. Now that Mary or Anne&#x27;s succession was in doubt with this new Catholic son and heir, discontent grew, already stoked by James II&#x27;s actions which had alienated Tory Anglicans who had previously been inclined to honour him as sovereign even if they differed in religion. This movement would become the Glorious Revolution; Mary&#x27;s husband William of Orange landed in England, backed by an army of English and Scottish exiles, as well as Dutch soldiers. Much of the English army promptly defected to William&#x27;s cause, causing James II and his family to flee rather than stay and fight.
On 9 December, Mary of Modena disguised herself as a laundress and escaped with the infant James to France. Young James was brought up at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which Louis XIV had turned over to the exiled James II. Both the ex-king and his family were held in great consideration by the French king (who was his first cousin), and they were frequent visitors at Versailles where Louis XIV and his court treated them as ruling monarchs. In June 1692 his sister Louisa Maria was born.

He later received a military education overseen by Richard Hamilton and Dominic Sheldon, two veterans of the Irish Army.

==Struggle for the throne==
On his father&#x27;s death in 1701, James was proclaimed as rightful king by Louis XIV of France, despite having previously recognised the legitimacy of William III under the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. Spain, the Papal States, and Modena also recognised him as king of England, Ireland and Scotland and refused to recognise William III, Mary II, or Anne as legitimate sovereigns. As a result of his claiming his father&#x27;s lost thrones, James was attainted for treason in London on 2 March 1702, and his titles were forfeited under English law.

===Early attempts===
Though delayed in France by an attack of measles, James attempted invasion, trying to land at the Firth of Forth on 23 March 1708. The fleet of Admiral Sir George Byng intercepted the French ships, which, combined with bad weather, prevented a landing.

James served for a time as a volunteer in the French army, as his father had done during the interregnum. Between August and September 1710, Queen Anne appointed a new Tory administration led by Robert Harley, who entered into a secret correspondence with de Torcy, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which he claimed to desire James&#x27;s accession to the throne should James convert to Protestantism. A year later, however, the British government pushed for James&#x27;s expulsion from France as a precondition for a peace treaty with France. In accordance with the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Harley and Lord Bolingbroke, the Secretary of State, colluded with the French in exiling James to the Duchy of Lorraine.

Queen Anne became severely ill at Christmas 1713 and seemed close to death. In January 1714, she recovered but clearly had little time to live. Through de Torcy and his London agent, Abbé François Gaultier, Harley maintained the correspondence with James and Bolingbroke entered into a separate correspondence with him. They both stated to James that his conversion to Protestantism would facilitate his accession. However, James, a devout Catholic, replied to Torcy: &quot;I have chosen my own course, therefore it is for others to change their sentiments.&quot; In March came James&#x27;s refusal to convert, following which Harley and Bolingbroke reached the opinion that James&#x27;s accession was not feasible, though they maintained their correspondence with him.

As a result, in August 1714, James&#x27;s second cousin, the Elector of Hanover, George Louis, a German-speaking Lutheran who was the closest Protestant relative of the now-deceased Queen Anne, became king of the recently created Kingdom of Great Britain as George I. James denounced him, noting &quot;we have beheld a foreign family, aliens to our country, distant in blood, and strangers even to our language, ascend the throne&quot;. Following George&#x27;s coronation in October 1714, major riots broke out in provincial England.

===The Fifteen===

In the following year, Jacobites started uprisings in Scotland and Cornwall aimed at putting &quot;James III and VIII&quot; on the throne. On 22 December 1715, James reached Scotland after the Jacobite defeats at the Battle of Sheriffmuir (13 November 1715) and Battle of Preston (1715). He landed at Peterhead and soon fell ill with fever, his illness made more severe by the icy Scottish winter. In January 1716, he set up court at Scone Palace. Reputedly Jane Stuart, a half-sister, came from Wisbech in England to visit him. Learning of the approach of government forces, he returned to France, sailing from Montrose on 5 February 1716. The abandonment of his rebel allies caused ill-feeling against him in Scotland; nor was he welcomed on his return to France. His patron, Louis XIV, had died on 1 September 1715, and the French government found him a political embarrassment. When France, hitherto his main protector, allied with Britain, this effectively secured the Hanoverian dynasty&#x27;s monarchy over the Kingdom of Great Britain.

==Court-in-exile==

After the unsuccessful invasion of 1715, James lived in Papal territory, first at Avignon (April 1716 – February 1717), then at Pesaro (1717) and Urbino (July 1717 – November 1718). Pope Clement XI offered James the Palazzo Muti or Palazzo del Re in Rome as his residence, which he accepted. Pope Innocent XIII, like his predecessor, showed much support. Thanks to his friend Cardinal Filippo Antonio Gualterio, James was granted a life annuity of 12,000 Roman scudi. Such help enabled him to organise a Jacobite court at Rome, where, although he lived in splendour, he continued to suffer from fits of melancholy.

Further efforts to restore the Stuarts to the British throne were planned. In 1719 a major expedition left Spain but was forced to turn back due to weather. A small landing took place in the Scottish Highlands, but the Jacobite rising of 1719 was defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel. James had gone to Spain in the hope he could take part in the invasion, but following its abandonment was forced to return to Italy. A further attempt was planned in 1722, but following the exposure of the Atterbury Plot it came to nothing.

In exercise of his pretended position, James purported to create titles of nobility, now referred to as Jacobite Peerages, for his British supporters and members of his court, none of which have ever been recognised in Britain.

The court-in-exile became a popular stop for English travellers making a Grand Tour, regardless of political affiliation. For many, it functioned as an unofficial consulate. Those in need of medical attention preferred being treated by one of their own countrymen. In 1735 court physicians tended to Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and thirty years later to James Boswell.

James remained well-treated in Rome until his death. He was allowed to hold Protestant services at Court, and was given land where his Protestant adherents could receive a public burial.

===Marriage and progeny===
Louise Adélaïde d&#x27;Orléans (), daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, was at one time suggested as a wife for James, but nothing came of it. In March 1717, while James was visiting Modena, he became engaged to his cousin Benedetta d&#x27;Este, but her father Duke Rinaldo put an end to the engagement to preserve his relations with Hanover and Great Britain.

On 3 September 1719, James married Maria Clementina Sobieska (1702–1735), granddaughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland. The wedding was held in the chapel of the Episcopal Palace in Montefiascone, near Viterbo. By his wife he had two sons:
# Charles Edward Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), nicknamed &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;
# Henry Benedict Stuart (11 March 1725 – 13 July 1807), a cardinal of the Catholic Church

===Bonnie Prince Charlie===
Following James&#x27;s failure, attention turned to his son Charles, &quot;the Young Pretender&quot;, who led the major uprising of 1745. With the failure of this second rebellion, the Stuart hopes of regaining the British throne were effectively destroyed. James and Charles later clashed repeatedly, and relations between them broke down completely when James played a role in the appointment of his son Henry as a cardinal. Henry then took holy orders, which required him to maintain celibacy, ending the possibility that he would produce a legitimate heir, infuriating Charles, who had not been consulted.

===Later years===
After the 1745 rising, there were no other plots to restore the Stuart dynasty except for when, in 1759, the French government briefly considered a scheme to have James (then aged 70) crowned King of Ireland as part of their plans to invade Britain, but the offer was never formally made to James. Several separate plans also involved Charles being given control of a French-backed independent Ireland, though that too was aborted after Charles showed up at a meeting with the French to discuss the plan late, argumentative, and idealistic in expectations, so that the French dismissed the possibility of Jacobite assistance.

===Death===
After a lingering illness, James died aged 77 on 1 January 1766, at his home, the Palazzo Muti in Rome, and was buried in the crypt of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in present-day Vatican City. His grave is marked by the Monument to the Royal Stuarts. His claimed reign had lasted for 64 years, 3 months and 16 days, longer than any British monarch until Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign surpassed it on 23 May 2016.

==End of papal support==
Following James&#x27;s death the pope refused to recognise the claim to the British and Irish thrones of his elder son Charles, which had severely exacerbated the hostility between England and the Catholic Church. Instead, from 14 January 1766, in stages over the following decade, Rome accepted the Hanoverian dynasty as the legitimate rulers of Britain and Ireland; this was accompanied by a gradual relaxation and reform of the anti-Catholic &quot;penal laws&quot; in Britain and Ireland. Two months after James&#x27;s death, on 14 March, the royal arms of England were removed from the doorway of the Palazzo Muti. In 1792, the papacy specifically referred to George III as the &quot;King of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, which elicited a protest from James&#x27;s younger son Henry, who was by then the Jacobite claimant.

==Titles and honours==

James was created Prince of Wales on 4 July 1688.

===Honours===
*&quot;Jacobite&quot;, KG: Knight of the Garter, &quot;1692–1766&quot;

===Arms===
As Prince of Wales, James bore a coat of arms consisting of those of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points&quot;.

<text>Trilobites (; meaning &quot;three-lobed entities&quot;) are extinct marine arthropods that form the class Trilobita. Trilobites form one of the earliest known groups of arthropods. The first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage of the Early Cambrian period () and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic before slipping into a long decline, when, during the Devonian, all trilobite orders except the Proetida died out. The last trilobites disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about 251.9 million years ago. Trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, existing in oceans for almost 270 million years, with over 22,000 species having been described.

By the time trilobites first appeared in the fossil record, they were already highly diversified and geographically dispersed. Because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossilized mineralised exoskeleton, they left an extensive fossil record. The study of their fossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy, paleontology, evolutionary biology, and plate tectonics. Trilobites are placed within the clade Artiopoda, which includes many organisms that are morphologically similar to trilobites, but are largely unmineralised. The relationship of Artiopoda to other arthropods is uncertain.

Trilobites evolved into many ecological niches; some moved over the seabed as predators, scavengers, or filter feeders, and some swam, feeding on plankton. Some even crawled onto land. Most lifestyles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites, with the possible exception of parasitism (where scientific debate continues). Some trilobites (particularly the family Olenidae) are even thought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food. The largest trilobites were more than long and may have weighed as much as .

==Evolution==

===Trilobite relatives===
Trilobites belong to the Artiopoda, a group of extinct arthropods morphologically similar to trilobites, though only the trilobites had mineralised exoskeletons. Thus, other artiopodans are typically only found in exceptionally preserved deposits, mostly during the Cambrian period.

The exact relationships of artiopods to other arthropods is uncertain. They have been considered closely related to chelicerates (which include horseshoe crabs and arachnids) as part of a clade called Arachnomorpha, while others consider them to be more closely related to Mandibulata (which contains insects, crustaceans and myriapods) as part of a clade called Antennulata.

====Fossil record of early trilobites====

The earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are redlichiids and ptychopariid bigotinids dated to around 520 million years ago. Contenders for the earliest trilobites include &quot;Profallotaspis jakutensis&quot; (Siberia), &quot;Fritzaspis&quot; spp. (western USA), &quot;Hupetina antiqua&quot; (Morocco) and &quot;Serrania gordaensis&quot; (Spain). Trilobites appeared at a roughly equivalent time in Laurentia, Siberia and West Gondwana.

All Olenellina lack facial sutures (see below), and this is thought to represent the original state. The earliest sutured trilobite found so far (&quot;Lemdadella&quot;), occurs almost at the same time as the earliest Olenellina, suggesting the trilobites origin lies before the start of the Atdabanian, but without leaving fossils. Other groups show secondary lost facial sutures, such as all Agnostina and some Phacopina. Another common feature of the Olenellina also suggests this suborder to be the ancestral trilobite stock: early protaspid stages have not been found, supposedly because these were not calcified, and this also is supposed to represent the original state. Earlier trilobites may be found and could shed more light on their origins.

Three specimens of a trilobite from Morocco, &quot;Megistaspis hammondi&quot;, dated 478 million years old contain fossilized soft parts. In 2024, researchers discovered soft tissues and other structures including the labrum in well-preserved trilobite specimens from Cambrian Stage 4 of Morocco, providing new anatomical information regarding the external and internal morphology of trilobites, and the cause of such extraordinary preservation is probably due to their rapid death after an underwater pyroclastic flow.

===Divergence and extinction===

Trilobites saw great diversification over time. For such a long-lasting group of animals, it is no surprise that trilobite evolutionary history is marked by a number of extinction events where some groups perished, and surviving groups diversified to fill ecological niches with comparable or unique adaptations. Generally, trilobites maintained high diversity levels throughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods before entering a drawn-out decline in the Devonian, culminating in the final extinction of the last few survivors at the end of the Permian period.

====Evolutionary trends====
Principal evolutionary trends from primitive morphologies, such as exemplified by &quot;Eoredlichia&quot;, include the origin of new types of eyes, improvement of enrollment and articulation mechanisms, increased size of pygidium (micropygy to isopygy), and development of extreme spinosity in certain groups. Changes also included narrowing of the thorax and increasing or decreasing numbers of thoracic segments. Specific changes to the cephalon are also noted; variable glabella size and shape, position of eyes and facial sutures, and hypostome specialization. Several morphologies appeared independently within different major taxa (e.g. eye reduction or miniaturization).

Effacement, the loss of surface detail in the cephalon, pygidium, or the thoracic furrows, is also a common evolutionary trend. Notable examples of this were the orders Agnostida and Asaphida, and the suborder Illaenina of the Corynexochida. Effacement is believed to be an indication of either a burrowing lifestyle or a pelagic one. Effacement poses a problem for taxonomists since the loss of details (particularly of the glabella) can make the determination of phylogenetic relationships difficult.

====Cambrian====
Although it has historically been suggested that trilobites originated during the Precambrian this is no longer supported, and it is thought that trilobites originated shortly before they appeared in the fossil record. Very shortly after trilobite fossils appeared in the lower Cambrian, they rapidly diversified into the major orders that typified the Cambrian—Redlichiida, Ptychopariida, Agnostida, and Corynexochida. The first major crisis in the trilobite fossil record occurred in the Middle Cambrian; surviving orders developed isopygius or macropygius bodies and developed thicker cuticles, allowing better defense against predators (see Thorax below). The end-Cambrian mass extinction event marked a major change in trilobite fauna; almost all Redlichiida (including the Olenelloidea) and most Late Cambrian stocks became extinct. A continuing decrease in Laurentian continental shelf area is recorded at the same time as the extinctions, suggesting major environmental upheaval.

Notable trilobite genera appearing in the Cambrian include:
*&quot;Abadiella&quot; (Lower Cambrian)
*&quot;Buenellus&quot; (Lower Cambrian)
*&quot;Judomia&quot; (Lower Cambrian)
*&quot;Olenellus&quot; (Lower Cambrian)
*&quot;Ellipsocephalus&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Elrathia&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Paradoxides&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Peronopsis&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Xiuqiella&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Yiliangella&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Yiliangellina&quot; (Middle Cambrian)
*&quot;Olenus&quot; (Late Cambrian)

====Ordovician====
The Early Ordovician is marked by vigorous radiations of articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and graptolites, with many groups appearing in the fossil record for the first time. Although intra-species trilobite diversity seems to have peaked during the Cambrian, trilobites were still active participants in the Ordovician radiation event, with a new fauna taking over from the old Cambrian one. Phacopida and Trinucleioidea are characteristic forms, highly differentiated and diverse, most with uncertain ancestors. The Phacopida and other &quot;new&quot; clades almost certainly had Cambrian forebears, but the fact that they have avoided detection is a strong indication that novel morphologies were developing very rapidly. Changes within the trilobite fauna during the Ordovician foreshadowed the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician, allowing many families to continue into the Silurian with little disturbance.
Ordovician trilobites were successful at exploiting new environments, notably reefs. The Ordovician mass extinction did not leave the trilobites unscathed; some distinctive and previously successful forms such as the Telephinidae and Agnostida became extinct. The Ordovician marks the last great diversification period amongst the trilobites: very few entirely new patterns of organisation arose post-Ordovician. Later evolution in trilobites was largely a matter of variations upon the Ordovician themes. By the Ordovician mass extinction, vigorous trilobite radiation has stopped, and gradual decline is foreshadowed.

Some of the genera of Trilobites appearing in the Ordovician include:

*&quot;Cyclopyge&quot; (Early to Late Ordovician)
*&quot;Selenopeltis&quot; (Early to Late Ordovician)
*&quot;Parabolina&quot; (Early Ordovician)
*&quot;Cheirurus&quot; (Middle Ordovician)
*&quot;Eodalmanitina &quot;(Middle Ordovician)
*&quot;Trinucleus&quot; (Middle Ordovician)
*&quot;Triarthrus&quot; (Late Ordovician)

====Silurian and Devonian====
Most Early Silurian families constitute a subgroup of the Late Ordovician fauna. Few, if any, of the dominant Early Ordovician fauna survived to the end of the Ordovician, yet 74% of the dominant Late Ordovician trilobite fauna survived the Ordovician. Late Ordovician survivors account for all post-Ordovician trilobite groups except the Harpetida.

Silurian and Devonian trilobite assemblages are superficially similar to Ordovician assemblages, dominated by Lichida and Phacopida (including the well-known Calymenina). A number of characteristic forms do not extend far into the Devonian and almost all the remainder were wiped out by a series of dramatic Middle and Late Devonian extinctions. Three orders and all but five families were exterminated by the combination of sea level changes and a break in the redox equilibrium (a meteorite impact has also been suggested as a cause). Only a single order, the Proetida, survived into the Carboniferous.

Genera of trilobites during the Silurian and Devonian periods include:

*&quot;Dalmanites&quot; (Early to Late Silurian)
*&quot;Calymene&quot; (Silurian)
*&quot;Encrinurus&quot; (Silurian)
*&quot;Exallaspis&quot; (Middle to Late Silurian)
*&quot;Paralejurus&quot; (Early Devonian)
*&quot;Lioharpes&quot; (Early-Middle Devonian)
*&quot;Phacops&quot; (Middle to Late Devonian)

====Carboniferous and Permian====
The Proetida survived for millions of years, continued through the Carboniferous period and lasted until the end of the Permian (when the vast majority of species on Earth were wiped out). It is unknown why the order Proetida alone survived the Devonian. The Proetida maintained relatively diverse faunas in both deep and shallow water shelf environments throughout the Carboniferous. For many millions of years the Proetida existed untroubled in their ecological niche. An analogy would be today&#x27;s crinoids, which mostly exist as deep-water species; in the Paleozoic era, vast &#x27;forests&#x27; of crinoids lived in shallow near-shore environments.

Some of the genera of trilobites during the Carboniferous and Permian periods include:

*&quot;Archegonus &quot;(Early to Middle Carboniferous)
*&quot;Hesslerides&quot; (Middle Carboniferous)
*&quot;Endops&quot; (Middle Permian)
*&quot;Triproetus&quot; (Late Carboniferous to Early Permian)
*&quot;Ditomopyge &quot;(Late Carboniferous to Late Permian)
*&quot;Pseudophillipsia &quot;(Late carboniferous to Late Permian)

====Final extinction====
Exactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear; with repeated extinction events (often followed by apparent recovery) throughout the trilobite fossil record, a combination of causes is likely. After the extinction event at the end of the Devonian period, what trilobite diversity remained was bottlenecked into the order Proetida. Decreasing diversity of genera limited to shallow-water shelf habitats coupled with a drastic lowering of sea level (regression) meant that the final decline of trilobites happened shortly before the end Permian mass extinction event. With so many marine species involved in the Permian extinction, the end of nearly 300 million successful years for the trilobites would not have been unexpected at the time.

==Fossil distribution==


Trilobites appear to have been primarily marine organisms, since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods, crinoids, and corals. Some trackways suggest trilobites made at least temporary excursions onto land. Within the marine paleoenvironment, trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. Trilobites, like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected. The remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which it shed in the process known as ecdysis. In addition, the tracks left behind by trilobites living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils.

There are three main forms of trace fossils associated with trilobites: &quot;Rusophycus&quot;, &quot;Cruziana&quot; and &quot;Diplichnites&quot;—such trace fossils represent the preserved life activity of trilobites active upon the sea floor. &quot;Rusophycus&quot;, the resting trace, are trilobite excavations involving little or no forward movement and ethological interpretations suggest resting, protection and hunting. &quot;Cruziana&quot;, the feeding trace, are furrows through the sediment, which are believed to represent the movement of trilobites while deposit feeding. Many of the &quot;Diplichnites&quot; fossils are believed to be traces made by trilobites walking on the sediment surface. Care must be taken as similar trace fossils are recorded in freshwater and post-Paleozoic deposits, representing non-trilobite origins.

Trilobite fossils are found worldwide, with thousands of known species. Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent index fossils, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. They were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention, and new species are being discovered every year.

In the United States, the best open-to-the-public collection of trilobites is located in Hamburg, New York. The shale quarry, informally known as Penn Dixie, stopped mining in the 1960s. The large amounts of trilobites were discovered in the 1970s by Dan Cooper. As a well-known rock collector, he incited scientific and public interest in the location. The fossils are dated to the Givetian (387.2–382.7 million years ago) when the Western New York Region was 30 degrees south of the equator and completely covered in water. The site was purchased from Vincent C. Bonerb by the Town of Hamburg with the cooperation of the Hamburg Natural History Society to protect the land from development. In 1994, the quarry became Penn Dixie Fossil Park &amp; Nature Reserve when they received 501(c)3 status and was opened for visitation and collection of trilobite samples. The two most common found samples are &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; and &quot;Greenops&quot;.

A famous location for trilobite fossils in the United Kingdom is Wren&#x27;s Nest, Dudley, in the West Midlands, where &quot;Calymene blumenbachii&quot; is found in the Silurian Wenlock Group. This trilobite is featured on the town&#x27;s coat of arms and was named the &quot;Dudley Bug&quot; or &quot;Dudley Locust&quot; by quarrymen who once worked the now abandoned limestone quarries. Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, is another famous trilobite location. The well-known &quot;Elrathia kingi&quot; trilobite is found in abundance in the Cambrian Wheeler Shale of Utah.

Spectacularly preserved trilobite fossils, often showing soft body parts (legs, gills, antennae, etc.) have been found in British Columbia, Canada (the Cambrian Burgess Shale and similar localities); New York, U.S.A. (Ordovician Walcott–Rust quarry, near Russia, and Beecher&#x27;s Trilobite Bed, near Rome); China (Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shales near Chengjiang); Germany (the Devonian Hunsrück Slates near Bundenbach) and, much more rarely, in trilobite-bearing strata in Utah (Wheeler Shale and other formations), Ontario, and Manuels River, Newfoundland and Labrador.

Sites in Morocco also yield very well-preserved trilobites, many buried in mudslides alive and so perfectly preserved. An industry has developed around their recovery, leading to controversies about practices in restoral. The variety of eye and upper body forms and fragile protuberances is best known from these samples preserved similarly to bodies in Pompeii.

The French palaeontologist Joachim Barrande (1799–1883) carried out his landmark study of trilobites in the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian of Bohemia, publishing the first volume of &quot;Système silurien du centre de la Bohême&quot; in 1852.

==Importance==
The study of Paleozoic trilobites in the Welsh-English borders by Niles Eldredge was fundamental in formulating and testing punctuated equilibrium as a mechanism of evolution.

Identification of the &#x27;Atlantic&#x27; and &#x27;Pacific&#x27; trilobite faunas in North America and Europe implied the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (producing the Iapetus suture), thus providing important supporting evidence for the theory of continental drift.

Trilobites have been important in estimating the rate of speciation during the period known as the Cambrian explosion because they are the most diverse group of metazoans known from the fossil record of the early Cambrian.

Trilobites are excellent stratigraphic markers of the Cambrian period: researchers who find trilobites with alimentary prosopon, and a micropygium, have found Early Cambrian strata. Most of the Cambrian stratigraphy is based on the use of trilobite marker fossils.

Trilobites are the state fossils of Ohio (&quot;Isotelus&quot;), Wisconsin (&quot;Calymene celebra&quot;) and Pennsylvania (&quot;Phacops rana&quot;).

== Taxonomy ==

The 10 most commonly recognized trilobite orders are Agnostida, Redlichiida, Corynexochida, Lichida, Odontopleurida, Phacopida, Proetida, Asaphida, Harpetida and Ptychopariida. In 2020, an 11th order, Trinucleida, was proposed to be elevated out of the asaphid superfamily Trinucleioidea. Sometimes the Nektaspida are considered trilobites, but these lack a calcified exoskeleton and eyes. Some scholars have proposed that the order Agnostida is polyphyletic, with the suborder Agnostina representing non-trilobite arthropods unrelated to the suborder Eodiscina. Under this hypothesis, Eodiscina would be elevated to a new order, Eodiscida.

Over 20,000 species of trilobite have been described.

Despite their rich fossil record with thousands of described genera found throughout the world, the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites have many uncertainties. Except possibly for the members of the orders Phacopida and Lichida (which first appear during the early Ordovician), nine of the eleven trilobite orders appear prior to the end of the Cambrian. Most scientists believe that order Redlichiida, more specifically its suborder Redlichiina, contains a common ancestor of all other orders, with the possible exception of the Agnostina. While many potential phylogenies are found in the literature, most have suborder Redlichiina giving rise to orders Corynexochida and Ptychopariida during the Lower Cambrian, and the Lichida descending from either the Redlichiida or Corynexochida in the Middle Cambrian. Order Ptychopariida is the most problematic order for trilobite classification. In the 1959 Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, what are now members of orders Ptychopariida, Asaphida, Proetida and Harpetida were grouped together as order Ptychopariida; subclass Librostoma was erected in 1990 to encompass all of these orders, based on their shared ancestral character of a natant (unattached) hypostome. The most recently recognized of the nine trilobite orders, Harpetida, was erected in 2002. The progenitor of order Phacopida is unclear.

==Morphology==
When trilobites are found, only the exoskeleton is preserved (often in an incomplete state) in all but a handful of locations. A few locations (&quot;&quot;) preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs, gills, musculature &amp; digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g. fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton. Of the 20,000 known species only 38 have fossils with preserved appendages.

Trilobites range in length from minute (less than ) to very large (over ), with an average size range of . Supposedly the smallest species is &quot;Acanthopleurella stipulae&quot; with a maximum of . The world&#x27;s largest-known trilobite specimen, assigned to &quot;Isotelus rex&quot; is in length. It was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of Hudson Bay. However, a partial specimen of the Ordovician trilobite &quot;Hungioides bohemicus&quot; found in 2009 in Arouca, Portugal is estimated to have measured when complete in length.
Only the upper (dorsal) part of their exoskeleton is mineralized, composed of calcite and calcium phosphate minerals in a lattice of chitin, and is curled round the lower edge to produce a small fringe called the &quot;doublure&quot;. Their appendages and soft underbelly were non-mineralized. 
 Three distinctive &quot;tagmata&quot; (sections) are present: cephalon (head); thorax (body) and pygidium (tail).

===Terminology===
As might be expected for a group of animals comprising genera, the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex. Despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics which distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, dorsal, chitinous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a thorax comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield (pygidium). When describing differences between trilobite taxa, the presence, size, and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned.

During moulting, the exoskeleton generally splits between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups facial sutures on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to lobsters and crabs, trilobites would have physically &quot;grown&quot; between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.

===Cephalon===

A trilobite&#x27;s cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the &quot;crop&quot; or &quot;stomach&quot;. Generally, the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome, a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.

Hypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described. The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific ecological niches.

The anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the Harpetida, in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch. Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.

====Facial sutures====
Facial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the cephalon of trilobites. Their function was to assist the trilobite in shedding its old exoskeleton during ecdysis (or molting).

All species assigned to the suborder Olenellina, that became extinct at the very end of the Early Cambrian (like &quot;Fallotaspis&quot;, &quot;Nevadia&quot;, &quot;Judomia&quot;, and &quot;Olenellus&quot;) lacked facial sutures. They are believed to have never developed facial sutures, having pre-dated their evolution. Because of this (along with other primitive characteristics), they are thought to be the earliest ancestors of later trilobites.

Some other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily. The type of sutures found in different species are used extensively in the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites.

====Dorsal sutures====
The dorsal surface of the trilobite cephalon (the frontmost tagma, or the &#x27;head&#x27;) can be divided into two regions—the cranidium and the librigena (&quot;free cheeks&quot;). The cranidium can be further divided into the glabella (the central lobe in the cephalon) and the fixigena (&quot;fixed cheeks&quot;). The facial sutures lie along the anterior edge, at the division between the cranidium and the librigena.

Trilobite facial sutures on the dorsal side can be roughly divided into five main types according to where the sutures end relative to the genal angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge).
*Absent – Facial sutures are lacking in the Olenellina. This is considered a primitive state, and is always combined with the presence of eyes. 
*Proparian – The facial suture ends in front of the genal angle, along the lateral margin. Example genera showing this type of suture include &quot;Dalmanites&quot; of Phacopina (Phacopida) and &quot;Ekwipagetia&quot; of Eodiscina (Agnostida).
*Gonatoparian – The facial suture ends at the tip of the genal angle. Example genera showing this type of suture include &quot;Calymene&quot; and &quot;Trimerus&quot; of Calymenina (Phacopida).
*Opisthoparian – The facial suture ends at the posterior margin of the cephalon. Example genera showing this type of suture include &quot;Peltura&quot; of Olenina (Ptychopariida) and &quot;Bumastus&quot; of Illaenina (Corynexochida). This is the most common type of facial suture.
* Hypoparian or marginal – In some trilobites, dorsal sutures may be secondarily lost. Several exemplary time series of species show the &quot;migration&quot; of the dorsal suture until it coincides with the margins of the cephalon. As the visual surface of the eye is on the diminishing free cheek (or librigena), the number of lenses tends to go down, and eventually the eye disappears. The loss of dorsal sutures may arise from the proparian state, such as in some Eodiscina like &quot;Weymouthia&quot;, all Agnostina, and some Phacopina such as &quot;Ductina&quot;. The marginal sutures exhibited by the harpetids and trinucleioids are derived from opisthoparian sutures. On the other hand, blindness is not always accompanied by the loss of facial sutures.
The primitive state of the dorsal sutures is proparian. Opisthoparian sutures have developed several times independently. There are no examples of proparian sutures developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry. Trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian sutures as adults commonly have proparian sutures as instars (known exceptions being &quot;Yunnanocephalus&quot; and &quot;Duyunaspis&quot;). Hypoparian sutures have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites.

The course of the facial sutures from the front of the visual surface varies at least as strongly as it does in the rear, but the lack of a clear reference point similar to the genal angle makes it difficult to categorize. One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks. This is known in &quot;Triarthrus&quot;, and in the Phacopidae, but in that family the facial sutures are not functional, as can be concluded from the fact that free cheeks are not found separated from the cranidium.

There are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the compound eyes of trilobites. They are:
*Ocular sutures – are sutures surrounding the edges of the compound eye. Trilobites with these sutures lose the entire surface of the eyes when molting. It is common among Cambrian trilobites.
*Palpebral sutures – are sutures which form part of the dorsal facial suture running along the top edges of the compound eye.

=====Ventral sutures=====

Dorsal facial sutures continue downward to the ventral side of the cephalon where they become the Connective sutures that divide the doublure. The following are the types of ventral sutures.

*Connective sutures – are the sutures that continue from the facial sutures past the front margin of the cephalon.
*Rostral suture – is only present when the trilobite possesses a rostrum (or rostral plate). It connects the rostrum to the front part of the dorsal cranidium.
*Hypostomal suture – separates the hypostome from the doublure when the hypostome is of the attached type. It is absent when the hypostome is free-floating (i.e. natant). it is also absent in some coterminant hypostomes where the hypostome is fused to the doublure.
*Median suture – exhibited by asaphid trilobites, they are formed when instead of becoming connective sutures, the two dorsal sutures converge at a point in front of the cephalon then divide straight down the center of the doublure.

====Rostrum====
The rostrum (or the rostral plate) is a distinct part of the doublure located at the front of the cephalon. It is separated from the rest of the doublure by the rostral suture.

During molting in trilobites like &quot;Paradoxides&quot;, the rostrum is used to anchor the front part of the trilobite as the cranidium separates from the librigena. The opening created by the arching of the body provides an exit for the molting trilobite.

It is absent in some trilobites like &quot;Lachnostoma&quot;.

====Hypostome====
 The hypostome is the hard mouthpart of the trilobite found on the ventral side of the cephalon typically below the glabella. The hypostome can be classified into three types based on whether they are permanently attached to the rostrum or not and whether they are aligned to the anterior dorsal tip of the glabella.

* Natant – Hypostome not attached to doublure. Aligned with front edge of glabella.
* Conterminant – Hypostome attached to rostral plate of doublure. Aligned with front edge of glabella.
* Impendent – Hypostome attached to rostral plate but not aligned to glabella.

===Thorax===
The thorax is a series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium. The number of segments varies between 2 and 103 with most species in the 2 to 16 range.

Each segment consists of the central axial ring and the outer pleurae, which protected the limbs and gills. The pleurae are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached, although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton. Determining a junction between thorax and pygidium can be difficult and many segment counts suffer from this problem.

===Volvation===

Trilobite fossils are often found &quot;enrolled&quot; (curled up) like modern pill bugs for protection; evidence suggests enrollment (&quot;volvation&quot;) helped protect against the inherent weakness of the arthropod cuticle that was exploited by anomalocarid predators. The earliest evidence of volvation is a little over 510 million years old and has been found in Olenellidae, but these forms didn&#x27;t have any of the interlocking mechanisms found in later trilobites.

Some trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g. &quot;Phacops&quot;), while others with long pleural spines (e.g. &quot;Selenopeltis&quot;) left a gap at the sides or those with a small pygidium (e.g. &quot;Paradoxides&quot;) left a gap between the cephalon and pygidium. In &quot;Phacops&quot;, the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure. The doublure carries a Panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation and achieve a good seal. Even in an agnostid, with only 2 articulating thoracic segments, the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition.

===Pygidium===
The pygidium is formed from a number of segments and the telson fused together. Segments in the pygidium are similar to the thoracic segments (bearing biramous limbs) but are not articulated. Trilobites can be described based on the pygidium being micropygous (pygidium smaller than cephalon), subisopygous (pygidium sub equal to cephalon), isopygous (pygidium equal in size to cephalon), or macropygous (pygidium larger than cephalon).

===Prosopon (surface sculpture)===

Trilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called prosopon. Prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g. hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features, such as ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging and perforations. The exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening, sensory pits or hairs, preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled. In one example, alimentary ridge networks (easily visible in Cambrian trilobites) might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions.

===Spines===
Some trilobites such as those of the order Lichida evolved elaborate spiny forms, from the Ordovician until the end of the Devonian period. Examples of these specimens have been found in the Hamar Laghdad Formation of Alnif in Morocco. There is a serious counterfeiting and fakery problem with much of the Moroccan material that is offered commercially. Spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western Russia; Oklahoma, USA; and Ontario, Canada.

Some trilobites had horns on their heads similar to several modern beetles. Based on the size, location, and shape of the horns it has been suggested that these horns may have been used to combat for mates. Horns were widespread in the family Raphiophoridae (Asaphida).
Another function of these spines was protection from predators. When enrolled, trilobite spines offered additional protection.
This conclusion is likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well, such as in the Phacopid trilobite genus &quot;Walliserops,&quot; that developed spectacular tridents.

==Soft body parts==
Only 21 or so species are described from which soft body parts are preserved, so some features (e.g. the posterior antenniform cerci preserved only in &quot;Olenoides serratus&quot;) remain difficult to assess in the wider picture.

===Appendages===
Trilobites had a single pair of preoral antennae and otherwise undifferentiated biramous limbs (two, three or four cephalic pairs, followed by one pair per thoracic segment and some pygidium pairs). Each endopodite (walking leg) had six or seven segments, homologous to other early arthropods. Endopodites are attached to the coxa, which also bore a feather-like exopodite, or gill branch, which was used for respiration and, in some species, swimming. A 2021 study found that the upper limb branch of trilobites is a &quot;well-developed gill&quot; that oxygenates the hemolymph, comparable to the book gill in modern horseshoe crab &quot;Limulus&quot;. In &quot;Olenoides&quot;, the partially articulated junction with the body is distinct from the exopods of Chelicerata or Crustacea. The inside of the coxa (or gnathobase) carries spines, probably to process prey items. The last exopodite segment usually had claws or spines. Many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding (as for the gnathobases) or sensory organs to help with walking.

===Digestive tract and diet===
The toothless mouth of trilobites was situated on the rear edge of the hypostome (facing backward), in front of the legs attached to the cephalon. The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The &quot;intestine&quot; led backward from there to the pygidium. The &quot;feeding limbs&quot; attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly &quot;slicing&quot; the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Recent propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography, or (PPC-SRμCT), which is a 3d imagining of tissue related to an organism&#x27;s function, of a sample of &quot;Bohemolichas incola&quot; show large concentrations of undigestible fragments of &quot;Conchoprimitia osekensis,&quot; a small-shelled species now extinct&quot;,&quot; in the &quot;B. incola&quot; sample digestive tract.

The fragments are indicative of durophagous predation (shell crushing). As the composition of the shells found were not taxonomically significant, rather based on physical properties regarding the shell strength and size, &quot;B. incola&quot; was opportunistic for food classifying feeding habits to be similar to scavengers. The remains of shells address another digestive aspect of &quot;B. incola&quot;, in the enzymatic ways in which these indigestible shells were siphoned out of little nutrition leaving only fragments behind. These remnants build on the concept of early Trilobites potentially having glands that secrete enzymes that aid in the digestive process.

===Internal organs===
While there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although &quot;present&quot; in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence.

===Musculature===
Although rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to midway down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.

==Sensory organs==
Many trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of antennae. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution. Other trilobites (e.g., &quot;Phacops rana&quot; and &quot;Erbenochile erbeni&quot;) had large eyes that were for use in well lit, predator-filled waters.

===Antennae===

The pair of antennae suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. One species (&quot;Olenoides serratus&quot;) preserves antenna-like cerci, which project from the rear of the trilobite.

===Eyes===
Even the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes), confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the Cambrian. Improving eyesight of both predator and prey in marine environments has been suggested as one of the evolutionary pressures furthering an apparent rapid development of new life forms during what is known as the Cambrian explosion.

Trilobite eyes were typically compound, with each lens being an elongated prism. The number of lenses in such an eye varied: some trilobites had only one, while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye. In compound eyes, the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally. The fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time, which compensates to some extent for the lack of preservation of soft internal parts.

Lenses of trilobites&#x27; eyes were made of calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO3). Pure forms of calcite are transparent, and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented, clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each eye. Rigid calcite lenses would have been unable to accommodate to a change of focus like the soft lens in a human eye would; in some trilobites, the calcite formed an internal doublet structure, giving superb depth of field and minimal spherical aberration, according to optical principles discovered by French scientist René Descartes and Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century. A living species with similar lenses is the brittle star &quot;Ophiocoma wendtii&quot;.

In other trilobites, with a Huygens interface apparently missing, a gradient-index lens is invoked with the refractive index of the lens changing toward the center.

Sublensar sensory structures have been found in the eyes of some phacopid trilobites. The structures consist of what appear to be several sensory cells surrounding a rhadomeric structure, resembling closely the sublensar structures found in the eyes of many modern arthropod apposition eyes, especially &quot;Limulus&quot;, a genus of horseshoe crabs.

*Holochroal eyes had a great number (sometimes over 15,000) of small (30–100 μm, rarely larger) lenses. Lenses were hexagonally close packed, touching each other, with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses. Each lens was in direct contact with adjacent lenses. Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders except the Agnostida, and through the entirety of the Trilobites&#x27; existence. Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface. The spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on light intensity, circular motion, receptor density, registered light angle, and the extent to which the signal of individual rhabdoms are neurally combined. This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for &quot;Pricyclopyge&quot;, when comparing it to &quot;Carolinites&quot;), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the ommatidia directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as &quot;Carolinites&quot;) have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back. Thus eye morphology can be used to make assumptions about the ecosystem of trilobites.
*Schizochroal eyes typically had fewer (around 700), larger lenses than holochroal eyes and are found only in Phacopina. Each lens had a cornea, and adjacent lenses were separated by thick interlensar cuticle, known as sclera. Schizochroal eyes appear quite suddenly in the early Ordovician, and were presumably derived from a holochroal ancestor. Field of view (all-around vision), eye placement and coincidental development of more efficient enrollment mechanisms point to the eye as a more defensive &quot;early warning&quot; system than directly aiding in the hunt for food. Modern eyes that are functionally equivalent to the schizochroal eye were not thought to exist, but are found in the modern insect species &quot;Xenos peckii&quot;.
*Abathochroal eyes are found only in Cambrian Eodiscina, and have around 70 small separate lenses that had individual cornea. The sclera was separate from the cornea, and was not as thick as the sclera in schizochroal eyes. Although well preserved examples are sparse in the early fossil record, abathochroal eyes have been recorded in the lower Cambrian, making them among the oldest known. Environmental conditions seem to have resulted in the later loss of visual organs in many Eodiscina.

Secondary blindness is not uncommon, particularly in long lived groups such as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida and Phacopina from western Europe and particularly Tropidocoryphinae from France (where there is good stratigraphic control), there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness.

Several other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors. Of particular interest are &quot;macula&quot;, the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome. In some trilobites macula are suggested to function as simple &quot;ventral eyes&quot; that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down.

===Sensory pits===
There are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals. The connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of Harpetida and Trinucleoidea with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a &quot;compound ear&quot;.

==Development==

Trilobites grew through successive moult stages called instars, in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the anamorphic phase of development. This was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton. The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods.

Trilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments, and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into three stages), which are not readily-comparable with those of other arthropods. Actual growth and change in external form of the trilobite would have occurred when the trilobite was soft shelled, following moulting and before the next exoskeleton hardened.

Trilobite larvae are known from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous and from all sub-orders. As instars from closely related taxa are more similar than instars from distantly related taxa, trilobite larvae provide morphological information important in evaluating high-level phylogenetic relationships among trilobites.

Despite the absence of supporting fossil evidence, their similarity to living arthropods has led to the belief that trilobites multiplied sexually and produced eggs.
Some species may have kept eggs or larvae in a brood pouch forward of the glabella, particularly when the ecological niche was challenging to larvae. Size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa, suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others. Early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility (suggested for fallotaspids), but so is calcification and hatching coinciding.

The earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the &quot;protaspid&quot; stages (anamorphic phase). Starting with an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments. Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium, but all segments remain fused together.

The &quot;meraspid&quot; stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. Prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure—the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid stages, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax. Segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30%–40%, probably took place in the meraspid stages.

The &quot;holaspid&quot; stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable, mature number of segments has been released into the thorax. Moulting continued during the holaspid stages, with no changes in thoracic segment number. Some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual, albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity.

Some trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called &quot;trilobite metamorphosis&quot;. Radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life. A change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of evolutionary pressure, as the trilobite could pass through several ecological niches on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivorship and dispersal of trilobite taxa. It is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages solely planktonic and later meraspid stages benthic (e.g. asaphids) failed to last through the Ordovician extinctions, while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g. lichids, phacopids). Pelagic larval life-style proved ill-adapted to the rapid onset of global climatic cooling and loss of tropical shelf habitats during the Ordovician.

There is no evidence that trilobites reabsorbed their exoskeletons during moulting. Some authors have argued that the failure of trilobites to reabsorb their mineralised exoskeletons when they moulted was a functional disadvantage when compared to modern arthropods that generally do reabsorb their cuticles, as it took substantially longer to reconstruct their exoskeletons, making them more vulnerable to predators.

== History of usage and research ==
Rev. Edward Lhwyd published in 1698 in The &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, the oldest scientific journal in the English language, part of his letter &quot;Concerning Several Regularly Figured Stones Lately Found by Him&quot;, that was accompanied by a page of etchings of fossils. One of his etchings depicted a trilobite he found near Llandeilo, probably on the grounds of Lord Dynefor&#x27;s castle, he described as &quot;the skeleton of some flat Fish&quot;.

The discovery of &quot;Calymene blumenbachii&quot; (the Dudley locust) in 1749 by Charles Lyttleton, could be identified as the beginning of trilobite research. Lyttleton submitted a letter to the Royal Society of London in 1750 concerning a &quot;petrified insect&quot; he found in the &quot;limestone pits at Dudley&quot;. In 1754, Manuel Mendez da Costa proclaimed that the Dudley locust was not an insect, but instead belonged to &quot;the crustaceous tribe of animals&quot;. He proposed to call the Dudley specimens &quot;Pediculus marinus major trilobos&quot; (large trilobed marine louse), a name which lasted well into the 19th century. German naturalist Johann Walch, who executed the first inclusive study of this group, proposed the use of the name &quot;trilobite&quot;. He considered it appropriate to derive the name from the unique three-lobed character of the central axis and a pleural zone to each side.

Written descriptions of trilobites date possibly from the third century BC and definitely from the fourth century AD. The Spanish geologists Eladio Liñán and Rodolfo Gozalo argue that some of the fossils described in Greek and Latin lapidaries as scorpion stone, beetle stone, and ant stone, refer to trilobite fossils. Less ambiguous references to trilobite fossils can be found in Chinese sources. Fossils from the Kushan formation of northeastern China were prized as inkstones and decorative pieces.

In the New World, American fossil hunters found plentiful deposits of &quot;Elrathia kingi&quot; in western Utah in the 1860s. Until the early 1900s, the Ute Native Americans of Utah wore these trilobites, which they called &quot;pachavee&quot; (little water bug), as amulets. A hole was bored in the head and the fossil was worn on a string. According to the Ute themselves, trilobite necklaces protect against bullets and diseases such as diphtheria. In 1931, Frank Beckwith uncovered evidence of the Ute use of trilobites. Travelling through the badlands, he photographed two petroglyphs that most likely represent trilobites. On the same trip he examined a burial, of unknown age, with a drilled trilobite fossil lying in the chest cavity of the interred. Since then, trilobite amulets have been found all over the Great Basin, as well as in British Columbia and Australia.

In the 1880s, archaeologists discovered in the Grotte du Trilobite (Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure, Yonne, France) a much-handled trilobite fossil that had been drilled as if to be worn as a pendant. The occupation stratum in which the trilobite was found has been dated as 15,000 years old. Because the pendant was handled so much, the species of trilobite cannot be determined. This type of trilobite is not found around Yonne, so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere.

<text>The Battle of the Coral Sea, from 4 to 8 May 1942, was a major naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and naval and air forces of the United States and Australia. Taking place in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, the battle was the first naval action in which the opposing fleets neither sighted nor fired upon one another, attacking over the horizon from aircraft carriers instead. It was also the first military battle between two aircraft carriers.
To strengthen their defensive position in the South Pacific, the Japanese decided to invade and occupy Port Moresby (in New Guinea) and Tulagi (in the southeastern Solomon Islands). The plan, Operation &quot;MO&quot;, involved several major units of Japan&#x27;s Combined Fleet. Two fleet carriers and a light carrier were assigned to provide air cover for the invasion forces, under the overall command of Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue. The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan through signals intelligence and sent two U.S. Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-American cruiser force to oppose the offensive, under the overall command of U.S. Admiral Frank J. Fletcher.

On 3–4 May, Japanese forces invaded and occupied Tulagi, although several supporting warships were sunk or damaged in a surprise attack by the U.S. carrier . Alerted to the presence of enemy aircraft carriers, the Japanese fleet carriers advanced towards the Coral Sea to locate and destroy the Allied naval forces. On the evening of 6 May, the two carrier fleets closed to within but did not detect each other in the darkness. The next day, both fleets launched airstrikes against what they thought were the enemy fleet carriers, but both sides actually attacked other targets. The U.S. sank the Japanese light carrier , and the Japanese sank the destroyer , and damaged the fleet oiler . On 8 May, both sides finally located and attacked the other&#x27;s fleet carriers, leaving the Japanese fleet carrier damaged, the U.S. fleet carrier critically damaged and later scuttled, and the fleet carrier &quot;Yorktown&quot; lightly damaged.

Both sides having suffered heavy aircraft losses and carriers sunk or damaged, the two forces disengaged and retired from the area. Because of the loss of carrier air cover, Inoue also recalled the Port Moresby invasion fleet. Although the battle was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it has been described as a strategic victory for the Allies. The battle marked the first time since the start of the war that a major Japanese advance had been turned back. More important, the damage to &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and the aircraft losses of prevented both ships from participating in the Battle of Midway the following month.

==Background==

===Japanese expansion===

On 8 December 1941 (7 December U.S. time), Japan declared war on the U.S. and the British Empire, after Japanese forces attacked Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong as well as the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. In launching this war, Japanese leaders sought to neutralize the U.S. fleet, seize territory rich in natural resources, and obtain strategic military bases to defend their far-flung empire. In the words of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Combined Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Secret Order Number One&quot;, dated 1 November 1941, the goals of the initial Japanese campaigns in the impending war were to &quot;[eject] British and American strength from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines, [and] to establish a policy of autonomous self-sufficiency and economic independence.&quot;

To support these goals, during the first few months of 1942, besides Malaya, Japanese forces attacked and took control of the Philippines, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, Wake Island, New Britain, the Gilbert Islands and Guam, inflicting heavy losses on opposing Allied land, naval and air forces. Japan planned to use these conquered territories to establish a perimeter defense for its empire from which it expected to employ attritional tactics to defeat or exhaust any Allied counterattacks.

Shortly after the war began, Japan&#x27;s Naval General Staff recommended an invasion of Northern Australia to prevent Australia from being used as a base to threaten Japan&#x27;s perimeter defences in the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) rejected the recommendation, stating that it did not have the forces or shipping capacity available to conduct such an operation. At the same time, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, commander of the IJN&#x27;s Fourth Fleet (also called the South Seas Force) which consisted of most of the naval units in the South Pacific area, advocated the occupation of Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands and Port Moresby in New Guinea, which would put Northern Australia within range of Japanese land-based aircraft. Inoue believed the capture and control of these locations would provide greater security and defensive depth for the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The navy&#x27;s general staff and the IJA accepted Inoue&#x27;s proposal and promoted further operations, using these locations as supporting bases, to seize New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa and thereby cut the supply and communication lines between Australia and the United States.

In April 1942, the army and navy developed a plan that was titled Operation &quot;MO&quot;. The plan called for Port Moresby to be invaded from the sea and secured by 10 May. The plan also included the seizure of Tulagi on 2–3 May, where the navy would establish a seaplane base for potential air operations against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific and to provide a base for reconnaissance aircraft. Upon the completion of &quot;MO&quot;, the navy planned to initiate Operation RY, using ships released from &quot;MO&quot;, to seize Nauru and Ocean Island for their phosphate deposits on 15 May. Further operations against Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia (Operation FS) were to be planned once &quot;MO&quot; and &quot;RY&quot; were completed. Because of a damaging air attack by Allied land- and carrier-based aircraft on Japanese naval forces invading the Lae-Salamaua area in New Guinea in March, Inoue requested Japan&#x27;s Combined Fleet send carriers to provide air cover for &quot;MO&quot;. Inoue was especially worried about Allied bombers stationed at air bases in Townsville and Cooktown, Australia, beyond the range of his own bombers, based at Rabaul and Lae.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, was concurrently planning an operation for June that he hoped would lure the U.S. Navy&#x27;s carriers, none of which had been damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack, into a decisive showdown in the central Pacific near Midway Atoll. In the meantime Yamamoto detached some of his large warships, including two fleet carriers, a light carrier, a cruiser division, and two destroyer divisions, to support &quot;MO&quot;, and placed Inoue in charge of the naval portion of the operation.

===Allied response===
Unknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy, led by the Communication Security Section of the Office of Naval Communications, had for several years enjoyed increasing success with penetrating Japanese communication ciphers and codes. By March 1942, the U.S. was able to decipher up to 15% of the IJN&#x27;s &quot;Ro&quot; or &quot;Naval Codebook D&quot; code (called &quot;JN-25B&quot; by the U.S.), which was used by the IJN for about half of its communications. By the end of April, the U.S. was reading up to 85% of the signals broadcast in the &quot;Ro&quot; code.

In March 1942, the U.S. first noticed mention of the &quot;MO&quot; operation in intercepted messages. On 5 April, the U.S. intercepted an IJN message directing a carrier and other large warships to proceed to Inoue&#x27;s area of operations. On 13 April, the British deciphered an IJN message informing Inoue that the Fifth Carrier Division, consisting of the fleet carriers and , was en route to his command from Formosa via the main IJN base at Truk. The British passed the message to the U.S., along with their conclusion that Port Moresby was the likely target of &quot;MO&quot;.

Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the new commander of U.S. forces in the Central Pacific, and his staff discussed the deciphered messages and agreed that the Japanese were likely initiating a major operation in the Southwest Pacific in early May with Port Moresby as the probable target. The Allies regarded Port Moresby as a key base for a planned counteroffensive, under General Douglas MacArthur, against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific area. Nimitz&#x27;s staff also concluded that the Japanese operation might include carrier raids on Allied bases in Samoa and at Suva. Nimitz, after consultation with Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet, decided to contest the Japanese operation by sending all four of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s available aircraft carriers to the Coral Sea. By 27 April, further signals intelligence confirmed most of the details and targets of the &quot;MO&quot; and &quot;RY&quot; plans.

On 29 April, Nimitz issued orders that sent his four carriers and their supporting warships towards the Coral Sea. Task Force 17 (TF 17), commanded by Rear Admiral Fletcher and consisting of the carrier , escorted by three cruisers and four destroyers and supported by a replenishment group of two oilers and two destroyers, was already in the South Pacific, having departed Tongatabu on 27 April en route to the Coral Sea. TF 11, commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch and consisting of the carrier with two cruisers and five destroyers, was between Fiji and New Caledonia. TF 16, commanded by Vice Admiral William F. Halsey and including the carriers and , had just returned to Pearl Harbor from the Doolittle Raid in the central Pacific. TF 16 immediately departed but would not reach the South Pacific in time to participate in the battle. Nimitz placed Fletcher in command of Allied naval forces in the South Pacific area until Halsey arrived with TF 16. Although the Coral Sea area was under MacArthur&#x27;s command, Fletcher and Halsey were directed to continue to report to Nimitz while in the Coral Sea area, not to MacArthur.

Based on un-encrypted intercepted radio traffic from TF 16 as it returned to Pearl Harbor, the Japanese assumed that all but one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s carriers were in the central Pacific. The Japanese did not know the location of the remaining carrier, but did not expect a U.S. carrier response to &quot;MO&quot; until the operation was well under way.

==Battle==

===Prelude===
During late April, the Japanese submarines and reconnoitered the area where landings were planned. The submarines investigated Rossel Island and the Deboyne Group anchorage in the Louisiade Archipelago, Jomard Channel, and the route to Port Moresby from the east. They did not sight any Allied ships in the area and returned to Rabaul on 23 and 24 April respectively.

The Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Force, commanded by Rear Admiral Kōsō Abe, included 11 transport ships carrying about 5,000 soldiers from the IJA&#x27;s South Seas Detachment plus about 500 troops from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF). Escorting the transports was the Port Moresby Attack Force with one light cruiser and six relatively old and s under the command of Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka. Abe&#x27;s ships departed Rabaul for the trip to Port Moresby on 4 May and were joined by Kajioka&#x27;s force the next day. The ships, proceeding at , planned to transit the Jomard Channel in the Louisiades to pass around the southern tip of New Guinea to arrive at Port Moresby by 10 May. The Allied garrison at Port Moresby numbered around 5,333 men, but only half of these were infantry and all were badly equipped and undertrained.
Leading the invasion of Tulagi was the Tulagi Invasion Force, commanded by Rear Admiral Kiyohide Shima, consisting of two minelayers, two older &quot;Mutsuki&quot;-class destroyers, five minesweepers, two subchasers and a transport ship carrying about 400 troops from the 3rd Kure SNLF. Supporting the Tulagi force was the Covering Group with the light carrier , the IJN&#x27;s four / heavy cruisers, and one destroyer, commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō. A separate Cover Force (sometimes referred to as the Support Group), commanded by Rear Admiral Kuninori Marumo and consisting of two light cruisers, the seaplane tender and three gunboats, joined the Covering Group in providing distant protection for the Tulagi invasion. Once Tulagi was secured on 3 or 4 May, the Covering Group and Cover Force were to reposition to help screen the Port Moresby invasion. Inoue directed the &quot;MO&quot; operation from the cruiser , with which he arrived at Rabaul from Truk on 4 May.

Gotō&#x27;s force left Truk on 28 April, cut through the Solomons between Bougainville and Choiseul and took station near New Georgia Island. Marumo&#x27;s support group sortied from New Ireland on 29 April headed for Thousand Ships Bay, Santa Isabel Island, to establish a seaplane base on 2 May to support the Tulagi assault. Shima&#x27;s invasion force departed Rabaul on 30 April.

The Carrier Strike Force, with the carriers &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, two heavy cruisers, and six destroyers, sortied from Truk on 1 May. The strike force was commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi (flag on cruiser ), with Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, on &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, in tactical command of the carrier air forces. The Carrier Strike Force was to proceed down the eastern side of the Solomon Islands and enter the Coral Sea south of Guadalcanal. Once in the Coral Sea, the carriers were to provide air cover for the invasion forces, eliminate Allied air power at Port Moresby, and intercept and destroy any Allied naval forces which entered the Coral Sea in response.

En route to the Coral Sea, Takagi&#x27;s carriers were to deliver nine Zero fighter aircraft to Rabaul. Bad weather during two attempts to make the delivery on 2–3 May compelled the aircraft to return to the carriers, stationed from Rabaul, and one of the Zeros was forced to ditch in the sea. In order to try to keep to the &quot;MO&quot; timetable, Takagi was forced to abandon the delivery mission after the second attempt and direct his force towards the Solomon Islands to refuel.

To give advance warning of the approach of any Allied naval forces, the Japanese sent submarines , , and to form a scouting line in the ocean about southwest of Guadalcanal. Fletcher&#x27;s forces had entered the Coral Sea area before the submarines took station, and the Japanese were therefore unaware of their presence. Another submarine, , which was sent to scout around Nouméa, was attacked by &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft on 2 May. The submarine took no damage and apparently did not realize that it had been attacked by carrier aircraft. &quot;Ro-33&quot; and &quot;Ro-34&quot; were also deployed in an attempt to blockade Port Moresby, arriving off the town on 5 May. Neither submarine engaged any ships during the battle.
On the morning of 1 May, TF 17 and TF 11 united about northwest of New Caledonia (). Fletcher immediately detached TF 11 to refuel from the oiler , while TF 17 refueled from . TF 17 completed refueling the next day, but TF 11 reported that they would not be finished fueling until 4 May. Fletcher elected to take TF 17 northwest towards the Louisiades and ordered TF 11 to meet TF 44, which was en route from Sydney and Nouméa, on 4 May once refueling was complete. TF 44 was a joint Australia–U.S. warship force under MacArthur&#x27;s command, led by Australian Rear Admiral John Crace and made up of the cruisers , , and , along with three destroyers. Once it completed refueling TF 11, &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; departed the Coral Sea to deliver its remaining fuel to Allied ships at Efate.

===Tulagi===
Early on 3 May, Shima&#x27;s force arrived off Tulagi and began disembarking the naval troops to occupy the island. Tulagi was undefended: the small garrison of Australian commandos and a Royal Australian Air Force reconnaissance unit evacuated just before Shima&#x27;s arrival. The Japanese forces immediately began construction of a seaplane and communications base. Aircraft from &quot;Shōhō&quot; covered the landings until early afternoon, when Gotō&#x27;s force turned towards Bougainville to refuel in preparation to support the landings at Port Moresby.

At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was notified that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been sighted the day before, approaching the southern Solomons. Unknown to Fletcher, TF 11 completed refueling that morning ahead of schedule and was only east of TF 17, but was unable to communicate its status because of Fletcher&#x27;s orders to maintain radio silence. TF 17 changed course and proceeded at towards Guadalcanal to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning.

On 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), a total of 60 aircraft from TF 17 launched three consecutive strikes against Shima&#x27;s forces off Tulagi. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft surprised Shima&#x27;s ships and sank the destroyer () and three of the minesweepers, damaged four other ships, and destroyed four seaplanes which were supporting the landings. The U.S. lost one torpedo bomber and two fighters in the strikes, but all of the aircrew were eventually rescued. After recovering its aircraft late in the evening of 4 May, TF 17 retired towards the south. In spite of the damage suffered in the carrier strikes, the Japanese continued construction of the seaplane base and began flying reconnaissance missions from Tulagi by 6 May.

Takagi&#x27;s Carrier Striking Force was refueling north of Tulagi when it received word of Fletcher&#x27;s strike on 4 May. Takagi terminated refueling, headed southeast, and sent scout planes to search east of the Solomons, believing that the U.S. carriers were in that area. Since no Allied ships were in that area, the search planes found nothing.

===Air searches and decisions===
At 08:16 on 5 May, TF 17 rendezvoused with TF 11 and TF 44 at a predetermined point south of Guadalcanal (). At about the same time, four Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from &quot;Yorktown&quot; intercepted a Kawanishi H6K reconnaissance flying boat from the Yokohama Air Group of the 25th Air Flotilla based at the Shortland Islands and shot it down from TF 11. The aircraft failed to send a report before it crashed, but when it didn&#x27;t return to base the Japanese correctly assumed that it had been shot down by carrier aircraft.

A message from Pearl Harbor notified Fletcher that radio intelligence deduced the Japanese planned to land their troops at Port Moresby on 10 May and their fleet carriers would likely be operating close to the invasion convoy. Armed with this information, Fletcher directed TF 17 to refuel from &quot;Neosho&quot;. After the refueling was completed on 6 May, he planned to take his forces north towards the Louisiades and do battle on 7 May.

In the meantime, Takagi&#x27;s carrier force steamed down the east side of the Solomons throughout the day on 5 May, turned west to pass south of San Cristobal (Makira), and entered the Coral Sea after transiting between Guadalcanal and Rennell Island in the early morning hours of 6 May. Takagi commenced refueling his ships west of Tulagi in preparation for the carrier battle he expected would take place the next day.

On 6 May, Fletcher absorbed TF 11 and TF 44 into TF 17. Believing the Japanese carriers were still well to the north near Bougainville, Fletcher continued to refuel. Reconnaissance patrols conducted from the U.S. carriers throughout the day failed to locate any of the Japanese naval forces, because they were located just beyond scouting range.

At 10:00, a Kawanishi reconnaissance flying boat from Tulagi sighted TF 17 and notified its headquarters. Takagi received the report at 10:50. At that time, Takagi&#x27;s force was about north of Fletcher, near the maximum range for his carrier aircraft. Takagi, whose ships were still refueling, was not yet ready to engage in battle. He concluded, based on the sighting report, TF 17 was heading south and increasing the range. Furthermore, Fletcher&#x27;s ships were under a large, low-hanging overcast which Takagi and Hara felt would make it difficult for their aircraft to find the U.S. carriers. Takagi detached his two carriers with two destroyers under Hara&#x27;s command to head towards TF 17 at in order to be in position to attack at first light the next day while the rest of his ships completed refueling.

U.S. B-17 bombers based in Australia and staging through Port Moresby attacked the approaching Port Moresby invasion forces, including Gotō&#x27;s warships, several times during the day on 6 May without success. MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters radioed Fletcher with reports of the attacks and the locations of the Japanese invasion forces. MacArthur&#x27;s fliers&#x27; reports of seeing a carrier (&quot;Shōhō&quot;) about northwest of TF 17 further convinced Fletcher fleet carriers were accompanying the invasion force.

At 18:00, TF 17 completed fueling and Fletcher detached &quot;Neosho&quot; with a destroyer, , to take station further south at a prearranged rendezvous (). TF 17 then turned to head northwest towards Rossel Island in the Louisiades. Unbeknownst to the two adversaries, their carriers were only away from each other by 20:00 that night. At 20:00 (), Hara reversed course to meet Takagi who completed refueling and was now heading in Hara&#x27;s direction.

Late on 6 May or early on 7 May, &quot;Kamikawa Maru&quot; set up a seaplane base in the Deboyne Islands in order to help provide air support for the invasion forces as they approached Port Moresby. The rest of Marumo&#x27;s Cover Force then took station near the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Islands to help screen Abe&#x27;s oncoming convoy.

===Carrier battle, first day===

====Morning strikes====
At 06:25 on 7 May, TF 17 was south of Rossel Island (). At this time, Fletcher sent Crace&#x27;s cruiser force, now designated Task Group 17.3 (TG 17.3), to block the Jomard Passage. Fletcher understood that Crace would be operating without air cover since TF 17&#x27;s carriers would be busy trying to locate and attack the Japanese carriers. Detaching Crace reduced the anti-aircraft defenses for Fletcher&#x27;s carriers. Nevertheless, Fletcher decided the risk was necessary to ensure the Japanese invasion forces could not slip through to Port Moresby while he engaged the carriers.

Believing Takagi&#x27;s carrier force was somewhere north of him, in the vicinity of the Louisiades, beginning at 06:19, Fletcher directed &quot;Yorktown&quot; to send 10 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers as scouts to search that area. Hara in turn believed Fletcher was south of him and advised Takagi to send the aircraft to search that area. Takagi, about east of Fletcher (), launched 12 Nakajima B5Ns at 06:00 to scout for TF 17. Around the same time, Gotō&#x27;s cruisers and launched four Kawanishi E7K2 Type 94 floatplanes to search southeast of the Louisiades. Augmenting their search were several floatplanes from Deboyne, four Kawanishi H6Ks from Tulagi, and three Mitsubishi G4M bombers from Rabaul. Each side readied the rest of its carrier attack aircraft to launch immediately once the enemy was located.

At 07:22 one of Takagi&#x27;s carrier scouts, from &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, reported U.S. ships bearing 182° (just west of due south), from Takagi. At 07:45, the scout confirmed that it had located &quot;one carrier, one cruiser, and three destroyers&quot;. Another &quot;Shōkaku&quot; scout aircraft quickly confirmed the sighting. The &quot;Shōkaku&quot; aircraft actually sighted and misidentified the oiler &quot;Neosho&quot; and destroyer &quot;Sims&quot;, which had earlier been detailed away from the fleet to a southern rendezvous point. Believing that he had located the U.S. carriers, Hara, with Takagi&#x27;s concurrence, immediately launched all of his available aircraft. A total of 78 aircraft—18 Zero fighters, 36 Aichi D3A dive bombers, and 24 torpedo aircraft—began launching from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; at 08:00 and were on their way by 08:15 towards the reported sighting. The strike force was under overall command of Lieutenant Commander Kakuichi Takahashi, while Lieutenant Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki led its torpedo bombers.

At 08:20, one of the &quot;Furutaka&quot; aircraft found Fletcher&#x27;s carriers and immediately reported it to Inoue&#x27;s headquarters at Rabaul, which passed the report on to Takagi. The sighting was confirmed by a &quot;Kinugasa&quot; floatplane at 08:30. Takagi and Hara, confused by the conflicting sighting reports they were receiving, decided to continue with the strike on the ships to their south, but turned their carriers towards the northwest to close the distance with &quot;Furutaka&#x27;s&quot; reported contact. Takagi and Hara considered that the conflicting reports might mean that the U.S. carrier forces were operating in two separate groups.

At 08:15, a &quot;Yorktown&quot; SBD piloted by John L. Nielsen sighted Gotō&#x27;s force screening the invasion convoy. Nielsen, making an error in his coded message, reported the sighting as &quot;two carriers and four heavy cruisers&quot; at , northwest of TF17. Fletcher concluded that the Japanese main carrier force was located and ordered the launch of all available carrier aircraft to attack. By 10:13, the U.S. strike of 93 aircraft—18 Grumman F4F Wildcats, 53 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 22 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers—was on its way. At 10:19, Nielsen landed and discovered his coding error. Although Gotō&#x27;s force included the light carrier &quot;Shōhō&quot;, Nielsen thought that he saw two cruisers and four destroyers and thus the main fleet. At 10:12, Fletcher received a report of an aircraft carrier, ten transports, and 16 warships south of Nielsen&#x27;s sighting at . The B-17s actually saw the same thing as Nielsen: &quot;Shōhō&quot;, Gotō&#x27;s cruisers, plus the Port Moresby Invasion Force. Believing that the B-17&#x27;s sighting was the main Japanese carrier force (which was in fact well to the east), Fletcher directed the airborne strike force towards this target.
At 09:15, Takahashi&#x27;s strike force reached its target area, sighted &quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot;, and searched in vain for the U.S. carriers for a couple of hours. Finally, at 10:51 &quot;Shōkaku&quot; scout aircrews realized they were mistaken in their identification of the oiler and destroyer as aircraft carriers. Takagi now realized the U.S. carriers were between him and the invasion convoy, placing the invasion forces in extreme danger. At 11:15, the torpedo bombers and fighters abandoned the mission and headed back towards the carriers with their ordnance, while the 36 dive bombers attacked the two U.S. ships.

Four dive bombers attacked &quot;Sims&quot; and the rest dived on &quot;Neosho&quot;. The destroyer was hit by three bombs, broke in half, and sank immediately, killing all but 14 of her 192-man crew. &quot;Neosho&quot; was hit by seven bombs. One of the dive bombers, hit by anti-aircraft fire, crashed into the oiler. Heavily damaged and without power, &quot;Neosho&quot; was left drifting and slowly sinking (). Before losing power, &quot;Neosho&quot; was able to notify Fletcher by radio that she was under attack and in trouble, but garbled any further details as to just who or what was attacking her and gave wrong coordinates () for her position.

The U.S. strike aircraft sighted &quot;Shōhō&quot; a short distance northeast of Misima Island at 10:40 and deployed to attack. The Japanese carrier was protected by four Zeros and two Mitsubishi A5M fighters flying combat air patrol (CAP), as the rest of the carrier&#x27;s aircraft were being prepared below decks for a strike against the U.S. carriers. Gotō&#x27;s cruisers surrounded the carrier in a diamond formation, off each of &quot;Shōhō&quot;″s corners.

Attacking first, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s air group, led by Commander William B. Ault, hit &quot;Shōhō&quot; with two bombs and five torpedoes, causing severe damage. At 11:00, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s air group attacked the burning and now almost stationary carrier, scoring with up to 11 more bombs and at least two torpedoes. Torn apart, &quot;Shōhō&quot; sank at 11:35 (). Fearing more air attacks, Gotō withdrew his warships to the north, but sent the destroyer back at 14:00 to rescue survivors. Only 203 of the carrier&#x27;s 834-man crew were recovered. Three U.S. aircraft were lost in the attack: two SBDs from &quot;Lexington&quot; and one from &quot;Yorktown&quot;. All of &quot;Shōhō&quot;″s aircraft complement of 18 was lost, but three of the CAP fighter pilots were able to ditch at Deboyne and survived. At 12:10, using a prearranged message to signal TF 17 on the success of the mission, &quot;Lexington&quot; SBD pilot and squadron commander Robert E. Dixon radioed &quot;Scratch one flat top! Signed Bob.&quot;

====Afternoon operations====
The U.S. aircraft returned and landed on their carriers by 13:38. By 14:20, the aircraft were rearmed and ready to launch against the Port Moresby Invasion Force or Gotō&#x27;s cruisers. Fletcher was concerned that the locations of the rest of the Japanese fleet carriers were still unknown. He was informed that Allied intelligence sources believed that up to four Japanese carriers might be supporting the &quot;MO&quot; operation. Fletcher concluded that by the time his scout aircraft found the remaining carriers it would be too late in the day to mount a strike. Thus, Fletcher decided to hold off on another strike this day and remain concealed under the thick overcast with fighters ready in defense. Fletcher turned TF 17 southwest.

Apprised of the loss of &quot;Shōhō&quot;, Inoue ordered the invasion convoy to temporarily withdraw to the north and ordered Takagi, at this time located east of TF 17, to destroy the U.S. carrier forces. As the invasion convoy reversed course, it was bombed by eight U.S. Army B-17s, but was not damaged. Gotō and Kajioka were told to assemble their ships south of Rossel Island for a night surface battle if the U.S. ships came within range.

At 12:40, a Deboyne-based seaplane sighted and reported Crace&#x27;s detached cruiser and destroyer force on a bearing of 175°, from Deboyne. At 13:15, an aircraft from Rabaul sighted Crace&#x27;s force but submitted an erroneous report, stating the force contained two carriers and was located, bearing 205°, from Deboyne. Based on these reports, Takagi, who was still awaiting the return of all of his aircraft from attacking &quot;Neosho&quot;, turned his carriers due west at 13:30 and advised Inoue at 15:00 that the U.S. carriers were at least west of his location and that he would therefore be unable to attack them that day.
Inoue&#x27;s staff directed two groups of attack aircraft from Rabaul, already airborne since that morning, towards Crace&#x27;s reported position. The first group included 12 torpedo-armed G4M bombers and the second group comprised 19 Mitsubishi G3M land attack aircraft armed with bombs. Both groups found and attacked Crace&#x27;s ships at 14:30 and claimed to have sunk a &quot;-type&quot; battleship and damaged another battleship and cruiser. In reality, Crace&#x27;s ships were lightly damaged and shot down four G4Ms. A short time later, three U.S. Army B-17s mistakenly bombed Crace, but caused no damage. At the conclusion of the attack, the detachment of cruisers suffered several wounded and a few men killed aboard the &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Crace at 15:26 radioed Fletcher he could not complete his mission without air support. Crace retired southward to a position about southeast of Port Moresby to increase the range from Japanese carrier- or land-based aircraft while remaining close enough to intercept any Japanese naval forces advancing beyond the Louisiades through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Crace&#x27;s ships were low on fuel, and as Fletcher was maintaining radio silence (and had not informed him in advance), Crace had no idea of Fletcher&#x27;s location, status, or intentions.

Shortly after 15:00, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; monitored a message from a Deboyne-based reconnaissance aircraft reporting (incorrectly) that Crace&#x27;s force had altered course to 120° true (southeast). Takagi&#x27;s staff assumed the aircraft was shadowing Fletcher&#x27;s carriers and determined if the Allied ships held that course, they would be within striking range shortly before nightfall. Takagi and Hara were determined to attack immediately with a select group of aircraft, minus fighter escort, even though it meant the strike would return after dark.

To try to confirm the location of the U.S. carriers, at 15:15 Hara sent a flight of eight torpedo bombers as scouts to sweep westward. About that same time, the dive bombers that had attacked &quot;Neosho&quot; returned and landed. Six of the weary dive bomber pilots were told they would be immediately departing on another mission. Choosing his most experienced crews, including Takahashi, Shimazaki and Lieutenant Tamotsu Ema, at 16:15 Hara launched 12 dive bombers and 15 torpedo planes with orders to fly on a heading of 277° to . The eight scout aircraft reached the end of their search leg and turned back without seeing Fletcher&#x27;s ships.

At 17:47, TF 17 – operating under thick overcast west of Takagi – detected the Japanese strike on radar heading in their direction, turned southeast into the wind, and vectored 11 CAP Wildcats, led by Lieutenant Commanders Paul H. Ramsey and James H. Flatley, to intercept. Taking the Japanese formation by surprise, the Wildcats shot down seven torpedo bombers and one dive bomber, and heavily damaged another torpedo bomber (which later crashed), at a cost of three Wildcats lost.

Having taken heavy losses in the attack, which also scattered their formations, the Japanese strike leaders canceled the mission after conferring by radio. The Japanese aircraft all jettisoned their ordnance and reversed course to return to their carriers. The sun set at 18:30. Several of the Japanese dive bombers encountered the U.S. carriers in the darkness, around 19:00, and briefly confused as to their identity, circled in preparation for landing before anti-aircraft fire from TF 17&#x27;s destroyers drove them away. By 20:00, TF 17 and Takagi were about apart. Takagi turned on his warships&#x27; searchlights to help guide the 18 surviving aircraft back and all were recovered by 22:00.

In the meantime, at 15:18 and 17:18 &quot;Neosho&quot; was able to radio TF 17 she was drifting northwest in dire straits. &quot;Neosho&quot;″s 17:18 report gave wrong coordinates, which hampered subsequent U.S. rescue efforts to locate the oiler. More significantly, the news informed Fletcher his only nearby available fuel supply was gone.

As nightfall ended aircraft operations for the day, Fletcher ordered TF 17 to head west and prepared to launch a 360° search at first light. Crace also turned west to stay within striking range of the Louisiades. Inoue directed Takagi to make sure he destroyed the U.S. carriers the next day, and postponed the Port Moresby landings to 12 May. Takagi elected to take his carriers north during the night so he could concentrate his morning search to the west and south and ensure that his carriers could provide better protection for the invasion convoy. Gotō and Kajioka were unable to position and coordinate their ships in time to attempt a night attack on the Allied warships.

Both sides expected to find each other early the next day, and spent the night preparing their strike aircraft for the anticipated battle as their exhausted aircrews attempted to get a few hours&#x27; sleep. In 1972, U.S. Vice Admiral H. S. Duckworth, after reading Japanese records of the battle, commented, &quot;Without a doubt, May 7, 1942, vicinity of Coral Sea, was the most confused battle area in world history.&quot; Hara later told Yamamoto&#x27;s chief of staff, Admiral Matome Ugaki, he was so frustrated with the &quot;poor luck&quot; the Japanese experienced on 7 May that he felt like quitting the navy.

===Carrier battle, second day===

====Attack on the Japanese carriers====
At 06:15 on 8 May, from a position east of Rossel Island (), Hara launched seven torpedo bombers to search the area bearing 140–230°, out to from the Japanese carriers. Assisting in the search were three Kawanishi H6Ks from Tulagi and four G4M bombers from Rabaul. At 07:00, the carrier striking force turned to the southwest and was joined by two of Gotō&#x27;s cruisers, &quot;Kinugasa&quot; and &quot;Furutaka&quot;, for additional screening support. The invasion convoy, Gotō, and Kajioka steered towards a rendezvous point east of Woodlark Island to await the outcome of the carrier battle. During the night, the warm frontal zone with low clouds which had helped hide the U.S. carriers on 7 May moved north and east and now covered the Japanese carriers, limiting visibility to between .

At 06:35, TF 17 – operating under Fitch&#x27;s tactical control and positioned southeast of the Louisiades, launched 18 SBDs to conduct a 360° search out to . The skies over the U.S. carriers were mostly clear, with visibility.

At 08:20, a &quot;Lexington&quot; SBD piloted by Joseph G. Smith spotted the Japanese carriers through a hole in the clouds and notified TF 17. Two minutes later, a &quot;Shōkaku&quot; search plane commanded by Kenzō Kanno sighted TF 17 and notified Hara. The two forces were about apart. Both sides raced to launch their strike aircraft.

At 09:15, the Japanese carriers launched a combined strike of 18 fighters, 33 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo planes, commanded by Takahashi, with Shimazaki again leading the torpedo bombers. The U.S. carriers each launched a separate strike. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s group consisted of 6 fighters, 24 dive bombers, and 9 torpedo planes and was on its way by 09:15. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s group of 9 fighters, 15 dive bombers, and 12 torpedo planes was off at 09:25. Both the U.S. and Japanese carrier warship forces turned to head directly for each other&#x27;s location at high speed in order to shorten the distance their aircraft would have to fly on their return legs.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s dive bombers, led by William O. Burch, reached the Japanese carriers at 10:32, and paused to allow the slower torpedo squadron to arrive so that they could conduct a simultaneous attack. At this time, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; were about apart, with &quot;Zuikaku&quot; hidden under a rain squall of low-hanging clouds. The two carriers were protected by 16 CAP Zero fighters. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; dive bombers commenced their attacks at 10:57 on &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and hit the radically maneuvering carrier with two bombs, tearing open the forecastle and causing heavy damage to the carrier&#x27;s flight and hangar decks. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; torpedo planes missed with all of their ordnance. Two U.S. dive bombers and two CAP Zeros were shot down during the attack.

&quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft arrived and attacked at 11:30. Two dive bombers attacked &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, hitting the carrier with one bomb, causing further damage. Two other dive bombers dove on &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, missing with their bombs. The rest of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s dive bombers were unable to find the Japanese carriers in the heavy clouds. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s TBDs missed &quot;Shōkaku&quot; with all 11 of their torpedoes. The 13 CAP Zeros on patrol at this time shot down 3 Wildcats.

With her flight deck heavily damaged and 223 of her crew killed or wounded, having also suffered explosions in her gasoline storage tanks and an engine repair workshop destroyed, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was unable to conduct further aircraft operations. Her captain, Takatsugu Jōjima, requested permission from Takagi and Hara to withdraw from the battle, to which Takagi agreed. At 12:10, &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, accompanied by two destroyers, retired to the northeast.

====Attack on the U.S. carriers====
At 10:55, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s CXAM-1 radar detected the inbound Japanese aircraft at a range of and vectored nine Wildcats to intercept. Expecting the Japanese torpedo bombers to be at a much lower altitude than they actually were, six of the Wildcats were stationed too low, and thus missed the Japanese aircraft as they passed by overhead. Because of the heavy losses in aircraft suffered the night before, the Japanese could not execute a full torpedo attack on both carriers. Lieutenant Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki, commanding the Japanese torpedo planes, sent 14 to attack &quot;Lexington&quot; and 4 to attack &quot;Yorktown&quot;. A Wildcat shot down one and patrolling SBDs (8 from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, 15 from &quot;Lexington&quot;) destroyed 3 more as the Japanese torpedo planes descended to take attack position. In return, escorting Zeros shot down 4 &quot;Yorktown&quot; SBDs. One of the survivors, Swede Vejtasa, claimed 3 Zeros during the onslaught (though none were lost).
The Japanese attack began at 11:13 as the carriers, stationed apart, and their escorts opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. The four torpedo planes which attacked &quot;Yorktown&quot; all missed. The remaining torpedo planes successfully employed a pincer attack on &quot;Lexington&quot;, which had a much larger turning radius than &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and, at 11:20, hit her with two Type 91 torpedoes. The first torpedo buckled the port aviation gasoline stowage tanks. Undetected, gasoline vapors spread into surrounding compartments. The second torpedo ruptured the port water main, reducing water pressure to the three forward firerooms and forcing the associated boilers to be shut down. The ship could still make with her remaining boilers. Four of the Japanese torpedo planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.

The 33 Japanese dive bombers circled to attack from upwind, and thus did not begin their dives from until three to four minutes after the torpedo planes began their attacks. The 19 &quot;Shōkaku&quot; dive bombers, under Takahashi, lined up on &quot;Lexington&quot; while the remaining 14, directed by Tamotsu Ema, targeted &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Escorting Zeros shielded Takahashi&#x27;s aircraft from four &quot;Lexington&quot; CAP Wildcats which attempted to intervene, but two Wildcats circling above &quot;Yorktown&quot; were able to disrupt Ema&#x27;s formation. Takahashi&#x27;s bombers damaged &quot;Lexington&quot; with two bomb hits and several near misses, causing fires which were contained by 12:33. At 11:27, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was hit in the centre of her flight deck by a single , semi-armour-piercing bomb which penetrated four decks before exploding, causing severe structural damage to an aviation storage room and killing or seriously wounding 66 men, as well as damaging the superheater boilers which rendered them inoperable. Up to 12 near misses damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s hull below the waterline. Two of the dive bombers were shot down by a CAP Wildcat during the attack. 
As the Japanese aircraft completed their attacks and began to withdraw, believing that they inflicted fatal damage to both carriers, they ran a gauntlet of CAP Wildcats and SBDs. In the ensuing aerial duels, three SBDs and three Wildcats for the U.S., and three torpedo bombers, one dive bomber, and one Zero for the Japanese were downed. By 12:00, the U.S. and Japanese strike groups were on their way back to their respective carriers. During their return, aircraft from the two adversaries passed each other in the air, resulting in more air-to-air altercations. Kanno&#x27;s and Takahashi&#x27;s aircraft were shot down, killing both of them. Two future U.S. destroyers were named after naval pilots lost in this confrontation: the USS &quot;Rinehart&quot; and USS &quot;Mason&quot;.

====Recovery, reassessment and retreat====
The strike forces, with many damaged aircraft, reached and landed on their respective carriers between 12:50 and 14:30. In spite of damage, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; were able to recover aircraft from their returning air groups. During recovery operations, for various reasons the U.S. lost an additional five SBDs, two TBDs, and a Wildcat, and the Japanese lost two Zeros, five dive bombers, and one torpedo plane. Forty-six of the original sixty-nine aircraft from the Japanese strike force returned from the mission and landed on &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. Of these, three more Zeros, four dive bombers and five torpedo planes were judged damaged beyond repair and were immediately jettisoned into the sea.

As TF 17 recovered its aircraft, Fletcher assessed the situation. The returning aviators reported they heavily damaged one carrier, but that another had escaped damage. Fletcher noted that both his carriers were hurt and that his air groups had suffered high fighter losses. Fuel was also a concern due to the loss of &quot;Neosho&quot;. At 14:22, Fitch notified Fletcher that he had reports of two undamaged Japanese carriers and that this was supported by radio intercepts. Believing that he faced overwhelming Japanese carrier superiority, Fletcher elected to withdraw TF 17 from the battle. Fletcher radioed MacArthur the approximate position of the Japanese carriers and suggested that he attack with his land-based bombers.

Around 14:30, Hara informed Takagi that only 24 Zeros, 8 dive bombers, and 4 torpedo planes from the carriers were currently operational. Takagi was worried about his ships&#x27; fuel levels; his cruisers were at 50% and some of his destroyers were as low as 20%. At 15:00, Takagi notified Inoue his fliers had sunk two U.S. carriers – &quot;Yorktown&quot; and a &quot;-class&quot; – but heavy losses in aircraft meant he could not continue to provide air cover for the invasion. Inoue, whose reconnaissance aircraft sighted Crace&#x27;s ships earlier that day, recalled the invasion convoy to Rabaul, postponed &quot;MO&quot; to 3 July, and ordered his forces to assemble northeast of the Solomons to begin the &quot;RY&quot; operation. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and her escorts turned towards Rabaul while &quot;Shōkaku&quot; headed for Japan.

Aboard &quot;Lexington&quot;, damage control parties put out the fires and restored her to operational condition, but at 12:47, sparks from unattended electric motors ignited gasoline fumes near the ship&#x27;s central control station. The resulting explosion killed 25 men and started a large fire. Around 14:42, another large explosion occurred, starting a second severe fire. A third explosion occurred at 15:25 and at 15:38 the ship&#x27;s crew reported the fires as uncontrollable. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s crew began abandoning ship at 17:07. After the carrier&#x27;s survivors were rescued, including Admiral Fitch and the ship&#x27;s captain, Frederick C. Sherman, at 19:15 the destroyer fired five torpedoes into the burning ship, which sank in 2,400 fathoms at 19:52 (). Two hundred and sixteen of the carrier&#x27;s 2,951-man crew went down with the ship, along with 36 aircraft. &quot;Phelps&quot; and the other assisting warships left immediately to rejoin &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her escorts, which departed at 16:01, and TF 17 retired to the southwest. Later that evening, MacArthur informed Fletcher that eight of his B-17s had attacked the invasion convoy and that it was retiring to the northwest.

That evening, Crace detached &quot;Hobart&quot;, which was critically low on fuel, and the destroyer , which was having engine trouble, to proceed to Townsville. Crace overheard radio reports saying the enemy invasion convoy had turned back, but, unaware Fletcher had withdrawn, he remained on patrol with the rest of TG 17.3 in the Coral Sea in case the Japanese invasion force resumed its advance towards Port Moresby.

==Aftermath==
On 9 May, TF 17 altered course to the east and proceeded out of the Coral Sea via a route south of New Caledonia. Nimitz ordered Fletcher to return &quot;Yorktown&quot; to Pearl Harbor as soon as possible after refueling at Tongatabu. During the day, U.S. Army bombers attacked Deboyne and &quot;Kamikawa Maru&quot;, inflicting unknown damage. In the meantime, having heard nothing from Fletcher, Crace deduced that TF17 had departed the area. At 01:00 on 10 May, hearing no further reports of Japanese ships advancing towards Port Moresby, Crace turned towards Australia and arrived at Cid Harbor, south of Townsville, on 11 May.

At 22:00 on 8 May, Yamamoto ordered Inoue to turn his forces around, destroy the remaining Allied warships, and complete the invasion of Port Moresby. Inoue did not cancel the recall of the invasion convoy, but ordered Takagi and Gotō to pursue the remaining Allied warship forces in the Coral Sea. Critically low on fuel, Takagi&#x27;s warships spent most of 9 May refueling from the fleet oiler &quot;Tōhō Maru&quot;. Late in the evening of 9 May, Takagi and Gotō headed southeast, then southwest into the Coral Sea. Seaplanes from Deboyne assisted Takagi in searching for TF 17 on the morning of 10 May. Fletcher and Crace were already well on their way out of the area. At 13:00 on 10 May, Takagi concluded that the enemy was gone and decided to turn back towards Rabaul. Yamamoto concurred with Takagi&#x27;s decision and ordered &quot;Zuikaku&quot; to return to Japan to replenish her air groups. At the same time, &quot;Kamikawa Maru&quot; packed up and departed Deboyne. At noon on 11 May, a U.S. Navy PBY on patrol from Nouméa sighted the drifting &quot;Neosho&quot; (). The U.S. destroyer responded and rescued 109 &quot;Neosho&quot; and 14 &quot;Sims&quot; survivors later that day, then scuttled the tanker with gunfire.

On 10 May, Operation RY commenced. After the operation&#x27;s flagship, minelayer , was sunk by the U.S. submarine on 12 May (), the landings were postponed until 17 May. In the meantime, Halsey&#x27;s TF 16 reached the South Pacific near Efate and, on 13 May, headed north to contest the Japanese approach to Nauru and Ocean Island. On 14 May, Nimitz, having obtained intelligence concerning the Combined Fleet&#x27;s upcoming operation against Midway, ordered Halsey to make sure that Japanese scout aircraft sighted his ships the next day, after which he was to return to Pearl Harbor immediately. At 10:15 on 15 May, a Kawanishi reconnaissance aircraft from Tulagi sighted TF 16 east of the Solomons. Halsey&#x27;s feint worked. Fearing a carrier air attack on his exposed invasion forces, Inoue immediately canceled &quot;RY&quot; and ordered his ships back to Rabaul and Truk. On 19 May, TF 16 – which returned to the Efate area to refuel – turned towards Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 26 May. &quot;Yorktown&quot; reached Pearl the following day.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; reached Kure, Japan, on 17 May, almost capsizing en route during a storm due to her battle damage. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; arrived at Kure on 21 May, having made a brief stop at Truk on 15 May. Acting on signals intelligence, the U.S. placed eight submarines along the projected route of the carriers&#x27; return paths to Japan, but the submarines were not able to make any attacks. Japan&#x27;s Naval General Staff estimated that it would take two to three months to repair &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and replenish the carriers&#x27; air groups. Thus, both carriers would be unable to participate in Yamamoto&#x27;s upcoming Midway operation. The two carriers rejoined the Combined Fleet on 14 July and were key participants in subsequent carrier battles against U.S. forces. The five &quot;I&quot;-class submarines supporting the &quot;MO&quot; operation were retasked to support an attack on Sydney Harbour three weeks later as part of a campaign to disrupt Allied supply lines. En route to Truk the submarine &quot;I-28&quot; was torpedoed on 17 May by the U.S. submarine and sank with all hands.

==Significance==

The public on both sides were informed of victory with overstatement of enemy losses and understatement of their own—the Americans claimed to have sunk between 18 and 37 ships. In terms of actual ships lost, the Japanese won a tactical victory by sinking the U.S. fleet carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;, an oiler, and a destroyer——versus a light carrier, a destroyer, and several smaller warships——sunk by the U.S. side. &quot;Lexington&quot; represented, at that time, 25% of U.S. carrier strength in the Pacific.

From a strategic perspective, however, the battle was an Allied victory as it averted the seaborne invasion of Port Moresby, lessening the threat to the supply lines between the U.S. and Australia. Although the withdrawal of &quot;Yorktown&quot; from the Coral Sea conceded the field, the Japanese were forced to abandon the operation that had initiated the Battle of the Coral Sea in the first place.

The battle marked the first time that a Japanese invasion force was turned back without achieving its objective, which greatly lifted the morale of the Allies after a series of defeats by the Japanese during the initial six months of the Pacific Theatre. Port Moresby was vital to Allied strategy and its garrison could well have been overwhelmed by the experienced Japanese invasion troops. The U.S. Navy also exaggerated the damage it inflicted, which later caused the press to treat its reports of Midway with more caution.

The results of the battle had a substantial effect on the strategic planning of both sides. Without a hold in New Guinea, the subsequent Allied advance, arduous as it was, would have been even more difficult. For the Japanese, who focused on the tactical results, the battle was seen as merely a temporary setback. The results of the battle confirmed the low opinion held by the Japanese of U.S. fighting capability and supported their overconfident belief that future carrier operations against the U.S. were assured of success.

===Forces available for Midway===
One of the most significant effects of the Coral Sea battle was the temporary loss of &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; to Yamamoto&#x27;s planned battle against the U.S. carriers at Midway. (&quot;Shōhō&quot; was to have been employed at Midway in a tactical role supporting the Japanese invasion ground forces.) Although &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was undamaged, she had lost a large number of aircraft in the battle, and the Japanese apparently did not even consider trying to include &quot;Zuikaku&quot; in the forthcoming operation. No effort appears to have been made to combine the surviving &quot;Shōkaku&quot; aircrews with &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s air groups or to quickly provide &quot;Zuikaku&quot; with replacement aircraft. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; herself was unable to conduct further aircraft operations, with her flight deck heavily damaged, and she required almost three months of repair in Japan.

The Japanese believed that they sank two carriers in the Coral Sea, but this still left at least two more U.S. Navy carriers, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;, to help defend Midway. In fact, &quot;Yorktown&quot; had only been damaged, but she had also lost a large number of planes in the battle. Unlike the Japanese, the U.S. Navy put forth a maximum effort to make &quot;Yorktown&quot; available for the coming battle. Although the damage was estimated to take 90 days to repair, Nimitz gave the shipyard only three days, and only the most critical repairs were made to make the ship seaworthy. &quot;Yorktown&quot; left Pearl Harbor with three of her boilers inoperative and a maximum speed of 27 knots. Unlike the Japanese, the U.S. Navy was willing to put one aircraft carrier&#x27;s air group on another ship. To make up aircraft losses from the Coral Sea, three of the four &quot;Yorktown&quot; squadrons were sent ashore and replaced by squadrons from &quot;Saratoga&quot;, which had been sent to the West Coast for repairs after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. &quot;Yorktown&quot; would go into battle with her own scouting squadron, but &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s torpedo bomber, dive bomber, and fighter squadrons.

The U.S. aircraft carriers had slightly larger aircraft complements than the Japanese carriers, which, when combined with the land-based aircraft at Midway, the availability of &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and the loss of two Japanese carriers, meant that the Japanese Navy and the U.S. Navy would have near parity in aircraft for the impending battle. At Midway, aircraft flying from &quot;Yorktown&quot; played crucial roles in the American victory. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s planes sank the , located , and helped &quot;Enterprise&quot; planes sink &quot;Hiryū&quot;. &quot;Yorktown&quot; also absorbed both Japanese aerial counterattacks at Midway which otherwise would have been directed at &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;.

Historians H. P. Willmott, Jonathan Parshall, and Anthony Tully believe Yamamoto made a significant strategic error in his decision to support &quot;Operation MO&quot; with strategic assets. Since Yamamoto had decided the decisive battle with the U.S. was to take place at Midway, he should not have diverted any of his important assets, especially fleet carriers, to a secondary operation like &quot;MO&quot;. Yamamoto&#x27;s decision meant Japanese naval forces were weakened just enough at both the Coral Sea and Midway battles to allow the Allies to defeat them in detail. Willmott adds, if either operation was important enough to commit fleet carriers, then all of the Japanese carriers should have been committed to each in order to ensure success. By committing crucial assets to &quot;MO&quot;, Yamamoto made the more important Midway operation dependent on the secondary operation&#x27;s success.

Moreover, Yamamoto apparently missed the other implications of the Coral Sea battle: the unexpected appearance of U.S. carriers in exactly the right place and time (due to cryptanalysis) to effectively contest the Japanese, and U.S. Navy carrier aircrews demonstrating sufficient skill and determination to do significant damage to the Japanese carrier forces. These would be repeated at Midway, for the same reason, and as a result, Japan lost four fleet carriers, the core of her naval offensive forces, and thereby lost the strategic initiative in the Pacific War. Parshall and Tully point out that, due to U.S. industrial strength, once Japan lost its numerical superiority in carrier forces as a result of Midway, Japan could never regain it. Parshall and Tully add, &quot;The Battle of the Coral Sea had provided the first hints that the Japanese high-water mark had been reached, but it was the Battle of Midway that put up the sign for all to see.&quot;

===Situation in the South Pacific===
The Australians and U.S. forces in Australia were initially disappointed with the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea, fearing the &quot;MO&quot; operation was the precursor to an invasion of the Australian mainland and the setback to Japan was only temporary. In a meeting held in late May, the Australian Advisory War Council described the battle&#x27;s result as &quot;rather disappointing&quot; given that the Allies had advance notice of Japanese intentions. General MacArthur provided Australian Prime Minister John Curtin with his assessment of the battle, stating that &quot;all the elements that have produced disaster in the Western Pacific since the beginning of the war&quot; were still present as Japanese forces could strike anywhere if supported by major elements of the IJN.
Because of the severe losses in carriers at Midway, the Japanese were unable to support another attempt to invade Port Moresby from the sea, forcing Japan to try to take Port Moresby by land. Japan began its land offensive towards Port Moresby along the Kokoda Track on 21 July from Buna and Gona. By then, the Allies had reinforced New Guinea with additional troops (primarily Australian) starting with the Australian 14th Brigade which embarked at Townsville on 15 May. The added forces slowed, then eventually halted the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby in September 1942, and defeated an attempt by the Japanese to overpower an Allied base at Milne Bay.

In the meantime, the Allies learned in July that the Japanese had begun building an airfield on Guadalcanal. Operating from this base the Japanese would threaten the shipping supply routes to Australia. To prevent this from occurring, the U.S. chose Tulagi and nearby Guadalcanal as the target of their first offensive. The failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby, and their defeat at Midway, had the effect of dangling their base at Tulagi and Guadalcanal without effective protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi and Guadalcanal were four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base.

Three months later, on 7 August 1942, 11,000 United States Marines landed on Guadalcanal, and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo and the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured an airfield under construction by the Japanese. Thus began the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns that resulted in a series of attritional, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next year which, in tandem with the New Guinea campaign, eventually neutralized Japanese defenses in the South Pacific, inflicted irreparable losses on the Japanese military—especially its navy—and contributed significantly to the Allies&#x27; eventual victory over Japan.

The delay in the advance of Japanese forces also allowed the Marine Corps to land on Funafuti on 2 October 1942, with a Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) building airfields on three of the atolls of Tuvalu from which USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers of the Seventh Air Force operated. The atolls of Tuvalu acted as a staging post during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which was the implementation of Operation Galvanic.

===New type of naval warfare===
The battle was the first naval engagement in history in which the participating ships never sighted or fired directly at each other. Instead, manned aircraft acted as the offensive artillery for the ships involved. Thus, the respective commanders were participating in a new type of warfare, carrier-versus-carrier, with which neither had any experience. In H. P. Willmot&#x27;s words, the commanders &quot;had to contend with uncertain and poor communications in situations in which the area of battle had grown far beyond that prescribed by past experience but in which speeds had increased to an even greater extent, thereby compressing decision-making time.&quot; Because of the greater speed with which decisions were required, the Japanese were at a disadvantage as Inoue was too far away at Rabaul to effectively direct his naval forces in real time, in contrast to Fletcher who was on-scene with his carriers. The Japanese admirals involved were often slow to communicate important information to one another.

Research has examined how commanders’ choices affected the battle’s outcome. Two studies used mathematical models to estimate the impact of various alternatives. For example, suppose the U.S. carriers had chosen to sail separately (though still nearby), rather than together. The models indicated the Americans would have suffered slightly less total damage, with one ship sunk but the other unharmed. However, the battle’s overall outcome would have been similar. By contrast, suppose one side had located its opponent early enough to launch a first strike, so that only the opponent’s survivors could have struck back. The modeling suggested striking first would have provided a decisive advantage, even more beneficial than having an extra carrier.

The experienced Japanese carrier aircrews performed better than those of the U.S., achieving greater results with an equivalent number of aircraft. The Japanese attack on the U.S. carriers on 8 May was better coordinated than the U.S. attack on the Japanese carriers. The Japanese suffered much higher losses to their carrier aircrews, losing ninety aircrew killed in the battle compared with thirty-five for the U.S. side. Japan&#x27;s cadre of highly skilled carrier aircrews with which it began the war were, in effect, irreplaceable because of an institutionalised limitation in its training programs and the absence of a pool of experienced reserves or advanced training programs for new airmen. Coral Sea started a trend which resulted in the irreparable attrition of Japan&#x27;s veteran carrier aircrews by the end of October 1942.

The U.S. did not perform as expected, but it learned from its mistakes in the battle and made improvements to its carrier tactics and equipment, including fighter tactics, strike coordination, torpedo bombers and defensive strategies, such as anti-aircraft artillery, which contributed to better results in later battles. Radar gave the U.S. a limited advantage in this battle, but its value to the U.S. Navy increased over time as the technology improved and the Allies learned how to employ it more effectively. Following the loss of &quot;Lexington&quot;, improved methods for containing aviation fuel and better damage control procedures were implemented by the U.S. Coordination between the Allied land-based air forces and the U.S. Navy was poor during this battle, but this too would improve over time.

Japanese and U.S. carriers faced off against each other again in the battles of Midway, the Eastern Solomons, and the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942; and the Philippine Sea in 1944. Each of these battles was strategically significant, to varying degrees, in deciding the course and ultimate outcome of the Pacific War.

<text>John Ray Grisham Jr. (; born February 8, 1955) is an American novelist, lawyer, and former member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, known for his best-selling legal thrillers. According to the American Academy of Achievement, Grisham has written 37 consecutive number-one fiction bestsellers, and his books have sold 300 million copies worldwide. Along with Tom Clancy and J.K. Rowling, Grisham is one of only three anglophone authors to have sold two million copies on the first printing.

Grisham graduated from Mississippi State University and earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981. He practiced criminal law for about a decade and served in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1983 to 1990. Grisham&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; was published in June 1989, four years after he began writing it. It was later adapted into the 1996 feature film of the same name. Grisham&#x27;s first bestseller, &quot;The Firm&quot;, sold more than seven million copies, and was also adapted into a 1993 feature film of the same name, starring Tom Cruise, and a 2012 TV series that continues the story ten years after the events of the film and novel. Seven of his other novels have also been adapted into films: &quot;The Chamber&quot;, &quot;The Client&quot;, &quot;A Painted House&quot;, &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, and &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;.

==Early life==
Grisham, the second of five children, was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Wanda (née Skidmore) and John Ray Grisham. His father was a construction worker and a cotton farmer, and his mother was a homemaker. When Grisham was four years old, his family settled in Southaven, Mississippi, near Memphis, Tennessee. As a child, he wanted to be a baseball player. As noted in the foreword to &quot;Calico Joe&quot;, Grisham gave up playing baseball at the age of 18, after a game in which a pitcher aimed a beanball at him and narrowly missed doing the young Grisham grave harm.

Although Grisham&#x27;s parents lacked formal education, his mother encouraged him to read and prepare for college. He drew on his childhood experiences for his novel &quot;A Painted House&quot;. Grisham started working for a plant nursery as a teenager, watering bushes for $1.00 an hour. He was soon promoted to a fence crew for $1.50 an hour. He wrote about the job: &quot;there was no future in it&quot;. At 16, Grisham took a job with a plumbing contractor but says he &quot;never drew inspiration from that miserable work&quot;.

Initially, Grisham attended Horn Lake High School, a school that was so overcrowded some classes met in a church or a gymnasium. In 1971, he transferred to Southaven High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He credits his 12th grade English teacher, Frances McGuffey, for inspiring his love for reading and for introducing him to the works of John Steinbeck in particular.

Through one of his father&#x27;s contacts, Grisham managed to find work on a highway asphalt crew in Mississippi at age 17. It was during this time that an unfortunate incident got him &quot;serious&quot; about college. A fight with gunfire broke out among the crew, causing Grisham to run to a nearby restroom to find safety. He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators. He hitchhiked home and started thinking about college. His next work was in retail, as a sales clerk in a department store men&#x27;s underwear section, which he described as &quot;humiliating&quot;. By this time, Grisham was halfway through college. Planning to become a tax lawyer, he was soon overcome by &quot;the complexity and lunacy&quot; of it, deciding instead to return to his hometown as a trial lawyer.

Grisham attended the Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi, where he hoped to launch his baseball career but was benched instead. He and two close friends, Bubba Logan and Parker Pickle, transferred to Delta State University in Cleveland where Grisham hoped to revive his baseball career as a walk on player, but he was cut from the team and he left school after one semester. Ultimately, Grisham changed colleges three times before completing a degree. Although he started there as an economics major, he eventually graduated from Mississippi State University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting after being inspired by a fellow student, a Vietnam veteran, who planned to go to law school. He later enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law intending to become a tax lawyer, but his interest shifted to general civil litigation. He graduated in 1981 with a J.D. degree.

==Career==
===Law and politics===
Grisham practiced law for about a decade and won election as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives, serving from 1983 to 1990. He challenged the incumbent after becoming embarrassed by Mississippi&#x27;s national reputation and inspired by the passage of the Education Reform Act of 1982. Grisham represented the 7th District, which included DeSoto County, Mississippi. By his second term in the state legislature, he was the vice-chairman of the Apportionment and Elections Committee and a member of several other committees. He supported Representative Ed Perry&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the House speakership in 1987. With a different speaker elected at the beginning of the 1988 legislative session, Grisham was out of favor with the new legislative leaders and assigned to more minor committee roles. Not as busy with political affairs, he devoted more time to his novel, &quot;The Firm&quot;. Grisham later reflected that if Perry had become speaker he might have been given more committee responsibilities and thus unable to write.

Grisham&#x27;s writing career blossomed with the success of his second book, &quot;The Firm&quot;, and he gave up practicing law, except for returning briefly in 1996 to represent the family of a railroad worker who was killed on the job. His official website states: &quot;He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer. Grisham successfully argued his clients&#x27; case, earning them a jury award of $683,500 — the biggest verdict of his career.&quot;

===Writing career===

Although he failed English in community college, Grisham received praise for his writing while taking a business correspondence course during law school. Grisham said a case that inspired his first novel came in 1984, but it was not his case. He heard a 12-year-old girl telling a jury what had happened to her. Her story intrigued Grisham. He saw how the members of the jury cried as she told them about having been raped and beaten. &quot;I remember staring at the defendant and wishing I had a gun.&quot; It was then, Grisham later wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that a story was born. Over the next three years, he wrote his first book, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. The book was rejected by 28 publishers before Wynwood Press, an unknown publisher, agreed to give it a modest 5,000 copy printing. It was published in June 1988.

The day after Grisham completed &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, he began work on his second novel, &quot;The Firm&quot;. &quot;The Firm&quot; remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 47 weeks, and became the seventh bestselling novel of 1991. This would begin a streak of having one of the top 10 best selling novels of the year for nearly the next two decades. In 1992 and 1993 he had the second-bestselling book of the year with &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; and &quot;The Client&quot;, and from 1994 to 2000 he had the number one bestselling book every year. In 2001 Grisham did not have the bestselling book of the year, but had both the second and third books on the list with &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; and &quot;A Painted House&quot;.

In 1992, &quot;The Firm&quot; was made into a film starring Tom Cruise and Ed Harris and was released in June 1993, grossing $270 million. A feature film version of &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington was released later that year and grossed $195 million. Following their success, Regency Enterprises paid Grisham $2.25 million for the rights to &quot;The Client&quot; which was released in 1994 starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. Universal Pictures then commissioned Grisham with the highest amount ever for an unpublished novel, paying $3.75 million for the rights to &quot;The Chamber&quot;. In August 1994, New Regency paid a record $6 million for the rights to &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, with Grisham asking for a guarantee that Joel Schumacher, the director of &quot;The Client&quot;, would direct.

Beginning with &quot;A Painted House&quot;, Grisham broadened his focus from law to the more general rural South but continued to write legal thrillers at the rate of one per year. In 2002 he once again claimed the number one book of the year with &quot;The Summons&quot;. In 2003 and 2004 he missed the number one bestseller of the year due to the success of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by Dan Brown, but he once again produced two novels which ended the year in the top 5. In 2004, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; ended the year at number four, and in 2005 he overtook &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and returned to number one for the year with &quot;The Broker&quot;. The year 2006 marked the first time since 1990 that he did not have one of the top-selling books of the year, but he returned to number two in 2007, number one in 2008, and number two in 2009. Grisham has also written sports fiction and comedy fiction. He wrote the original screenplay for and produced the 2004 baseball movie &quot;Mickey&quot;, which starred Harry Connick Jr.

In 2005, Grisham received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award, which is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust. In 2010, Grisham started writing a series of legal thrillers for children. They feature Theodore Boone, a 13-year-old who gives his classmates legal advice on a multitude of scenarios, ranging from rescuing impounded dogs to helping their parents prevent their house from being repossessed. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m hoping primarily to entertain and interest kids, but at the same time I&#x27;m quietly hoping that the books will inform them, in a subtle way, about law.&quot; He also stated that it was his daughter, Shea, who inspired him to write the Theodore Boone series. &quot;My daughter Shea is a teacher in North Carolina and when she got her fifth grade students to read the book, three or four of them came up afterwards and said they&#x27;d like to go into the legal profession.&quot;

In an October 2006 interview on the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; show, Grisham stated that he usually takes only six months to write a book, and his favorite author is John le Carré. In 2011 and 2012, his novels &quot;The Litigators&quot; and &quot;The Racketeer&quot; claimed the top spot in &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list. The novels were among the best selling books of those years, spending several weeks atop various best seller lists. In 2013, he again reached the top five in the US best-seller list. In November 2015, his novel &quot;Rogue Lawyer&quot; was at the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Fiction Best Seller for two weeks.

In 2017, Grisham released two legal thrillers. &quot;Camino Island&quot; was published on June 6, 2017. The book appeared at the top of several best seller lists including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The Rooster Bar&quot;, published on October 24, 2017, was called &quot;his most original work yet&quot;, in &quot;The News Herald&quot;, and a “buoyant, mischievous thriller” in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

====Southern settings====
Several of Grisham&#x27;s legal thrillers are set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, in the equally fictional Ford County, a northwest Mississippi town still deeply divided by racism. The first novel set in Clanton was &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. Other stories set there include &quot;The Last Juror&quot;, &quot;The Summons&quot;, &quot;The Chamber&quot;, &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, &quot;A Time for Mercy&quot; and &quot;Sycamore Row&quot;. The stories in the collection &quot;Ford County&quot; are also set in and around Clanton. Other Grisham novels have non-fictional Southern settings, for example &quot;The Partner&quot;, &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, and &quot;The Boys from Biloxi&quot; are set in Biloxi, and large portions of &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; in New Orleans. &quot;A Painted House&quot; is set in and around the town of Black Oak, Arkansas, where Grisham spent some of his childhood.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
Grisham married Renee Jones on May 8, 1981. The couple have two children.

===Real estate holdings===
The family splits their time among their home in Charlottesville, Virginia, a home in Destin, Florida, and a condominium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Their former and longtime Victorian home on a farm outside Oxford, Mississippi, was given to the University of Mississippi after 2011.
Grisham owns a beachfront home on Amelia Island in Florida.

===Religion===
Grisham is a member of the University Baptist Church in Charlottesville, Virginia, itself a constituent of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Grisham opposes a literalist understanding of the Bible, and endorses the American separation of church and state. In 1993, he created with his wife a foundation, entirely financed by his royalties, which contributes to Baptist missionaries in Brazil for the purchase of medicines and the construction of chapels, clinics and schools. He also participated in some missionary work in Brazil, under the First Baptist Church of Oxford.

===Baseball===
Grisham has a lifelong passion for baseball, demonstrated partly by his support of Little League activities in both Oxford, Mississippi, and in Charlottesville. In 1996, Grisham built a $3.8 million youth baseball complex. In &quot;A Painted House&quot;, a novel with strong autobiographical elements, the protagonist, a seven-year-old farmer boy, manifests a strong wish to become a baseball player. He remains a fan of Mississippi State University&#x27;s baseball team and wrote about his ties to the university and the Left Field Lounge in the introduction for the book &quot;Dudy Noble Field: A Celebration of MSU Baseball&quot;. Since moving to the Charlottesville area, Grisham has become a supporter of Virginia Cavaliers athletics and is regularly seen sitting courtside at basketball games. Grisham also contributed to a $1.2 million donation to the Cavalier baseball team in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was used in the 2002 renovation of Davenport Field. His son Ty played college baseball for the University of Virginia.

==Political activism==
Grisham is a member of the board of directors of the Innocence Project, which campaigns to free and exonerate unjustly convicted people on the basis of DNA evidence. The Innocence Project contends that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects. Grisham has testified before Congress on behalf of the Innocence Project.

Grisham has appeared on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot; on PBS, and other programs. He wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2013 about an unjustly held prisoner at Guantanamo. Grisham opposes capital punishment, a position very strongly manifested in the plot of &quot;The Confession&quot;. He believes that prison rates in the United States are excessive, and the justice system is &quot;locking up far too many people&quot;. Citing examples including &quot;black teenagers on minor drugs charges&quot; to &quot;those who had viewed child porn online&quot;, he controversially added that he believed not all viewers of child pornography are necessarily pedophiles. After hearing from numerous people against this position, he later recanted this statement in a Facebook post. He went on to clarify that he was defending a former friend from law school who was caught in a sting thinking he was looking at adult porn but it was in reality sixteen- and seventeen-year-old minors and went on to add, &quot;I have no sympathy for real pedophiles. God, please lock those people up. Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure ... Should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.&quot;

The Mississippi State University Libraries, Manuscript Division, maintains the John Grisham Room, an archive containing materials generated during the author&#x27;s tenure as Mississippi State Representative and relating to his writings. In 2012, the Law Library at the University of Mississippi School of Law was renamed in his honor. It had been named for more than a decade after the late Senator James Eastland. In 2015, Grisham, along with about 60 others, signed a letter published in the &quot;Clarion-Ledger&quot; urging that an inset within the flag of Mississippi containing a Confederate flag be removed. He co-authored the letter with author Greg Iles; the pair contacted various public figures from Mississippi for support. Grisham supported Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2016. In his 2018 Fall Convocation address to new students, Grisham described Mississippi State University as a place where he felt at home, noting, &quot;I loved the big lecture halls, and I came to enjoy the professors. For the first time, after being at several schools, I was on a real campus with a diverse student body, different professors from around the world, big time sports, all of the activities that a big college can bring, and I really fell in love with State.&quot;

<text>Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel (born August 14, 1947) is an American writer, best known for her romance novels. She is the bestselling living author and one of the best-selling fiction authors of all time, with over 800 million copies sold. As of 2021, she has written 190 books, including over 140 novels.

Based in California for most of her career, Steel has produced several books a year, often juggling up to five projects at once. All of her novels have been bestsellers, including those issued in hardback, despite &quot;a resounding lack of critical acclaim&quot; (&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;). Her books often involve rich families facing a crisis, threatened by dark elements such as prison, fraud, blackmail, and suicide. Steel has also published children&#x27;s fiction and poetry, as well as creating a foundation that funds mental illness-related organizations. Her books have been translated into 43 languages, with 22 adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations.

==Early life==
Steel was born Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel in New York City to a German father and a Portuguese mother. Her father, John Schuelein-Steel, was a German-Jewish immigrant and a descendant of owners of Löwenbräu beer. Her mother, Norma da Camara Stone dos Reis, was the daughter of a Portuguese diplomat. She spent much of her childhood in France, where from an early age she was included in her parents&#x27; dinner parties, giving her an opportunity to observe the habits and lives of the wealthy and famous. Her parents divorced when she was eight, and she was raised primarily by her father, rarely seeing her mother.

Steel started writing stories as a child, and by her late teens had begun writing poetry. Raised Catholic, she thought of becoming a nun during her early years. A 1965 graduate of the &quot;Lycée Français de New York&quot;, she studied literature design and fashion design, first at Parsons School of Design and then at New York University.

==Career==
===1965–1971: Career beginnings===
While still attending New York University, Steel began writing, completing her first manuscript at 19. Steel worked for a public-relations agency in New York called Supergirls. A client, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; editor John Mack Carter, encouraged her to focus on writing, having been impressed with her freelance articles. He suggested she write a book, which she did. She later moved to San Francisco and worked as a copywriter for Grey Advertising.

===1972–1981: First novels and growing success===
Her first novel, &quot;Going Home&quot;, was published in 1973. The novel contained many of the themes that her writing would become well known for, including a focus on family issues and human relationships. Her relationship with her second husband influenced &quot;Passion&#x27;s Promise&quot; and &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, the two novels that launched her career. With the success of her fourth book, &quot;The Promise&quot;, she became a participant in San Francisco high society.

===1981–1996: Fame and expansion to new genres===
Beginning in 1991, Steel had become a near-permanent fixture on &quot;The New York Times&quot; hardcover and paperback bestsellers lists. In 1999, she was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for having a book on the &quot;New York Times Bestseller List&quot; for the most consecutive weeks of any author—456 consecutive weeks at that time. Steel is a prolific author, often releasing several books per year. Each book takes 2½ years to complete, so Steel has developed an ability to juggle up to five projects at once, researching one book while outlining another, then writing and editing additional books. Since her first book was published, every one of her novels has hit bestseller lists in paperback, and each one released in hardback has also been a hardback bestseller.

During this time, Steel also expanded to non-fiction work. &quot;Having a Baby&quot; was published in 1984 and featured a chapter by Steel about suffering through miscarriage. The same year she published a book of poetry, &quot;Love: Poems.&quot; She also ventured into children&#x27;s fiction, penning a series of 57 illustrated books for young readers. These books, known as the &quot;Max and Martha&quot; series, aim to help children face real-life problems: new baby, new school, loss of loved one, etc. In addition, Steel has authored the &quot;Freddie&quot; series. These four books address other real-life situations: first night away from home, trip to the doctor, etc.

In 1993, Steel sued writer Lorenzo Bene, who had intended to disclose in his book that her son Nick was adopted by her then-current husband John Traina, despite the fact that adoption records are sealed in California. A San Francisco judge made a highly unusual ruling allowing the seal on Nick&#x27;s adoption to be overturned, although he was still a minor. This order was confirmed by a California Appellate Judge, who ruled that because Steel was famous, her son&#x27;s adoption did not have the same privacy right, and the book was allowed to be published.

===1997–present: Continued success and awards===
After years of near-constant writing, in 2003 Steel opened an art gallery in San Francisco, Steel Gallery, which showed contemporary work and exhibited the paintings and sculptures of emerging artists. The gallery closed in 2007. She continues to curate shows a few times a year for the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco.

In 2002, Steel was decorated by the French government as an &quot;Officier&quot; of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot;, for her contributions to world culture.

She has additionally received:
* Induction into the California Hall of Fame, December 2009.
* &quot;Distinguished Service in Mental Health Award&quot; (first time awarded to a non-physician) from New York Presbyterian Hospital, Department of Psychiatry and Columbia University Medical School and Cornell Medical College, May 2009.
* &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot; for work with adolescents from Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco, May 2003.
* &quot;Service to Youth Award&quot; for improving the lives of adolescents and children with mental accessibility issues from the University of San Francisco Catholic Youth Organization and St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center, November 1999.
* &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot; in Mental Health from the California Psychiatric Association
* &quot;Distinguished Service Award&quot; from the American Psychiatric Association

In 2006 Steel reached an agreement with Elizabeth Arden to launch a new perfume, Danielle by Danielle Steel.

In 2014, she wrote an article for SFGate writing about her concern that San Francisco was losing its heart.

== Personal life ==
Steel married French banker Claude-Éric Lazard in 1965 at age 18 and gave birth to their daughter Beatrix. Steel and Lazard separated in 1972. While still married to Lazard, Steel met Danny Zugelder while interviewing an inmate in a prison near Lompoc, California, where Zugelder was also incarcerated. He moved in with Steel when he was paroled in June 1973, but returned to prison in early 1974 on robbery and rape charges. After receiving her divorce from Lazard in 1975, she married Zugelder in the prison canteen. During their relationship, Steel suffered multiple miscarriages. She divorced Zugelder in 1978.

Steel married her third husband, William George Toth, in 1978, while pregnant with their son, Nick. They divorced in March 1981.

Steel married for the fourth time in 1981, to John Traina, a shipping and cruise magnate and later vintner and art collector who was the ex-husband of Dede Wilsey. Together they had five children, Samantha, Victoria, Vanessa, Maxx, and Zara. Traina adopted Steel&#x27;s son Nick and gave him his family name and Steel also became stepmother of Traina&#x27;s sons Trevor and Todd. Determined to spend as much time as possible with her children, Steel often wrote at night, making do with only four hours of sleep. Steel and Traina divorced in 1995.

Her fear of flying created many challenges in the early 1980s; she went through an eight-week course based at the San Francisco airport to overcome her fear.

Steel married for a fifth time, to Silicon Valley financier Thomas James Perkins, but the marriage ended after four years in 2002. Steel has said that her novel &quot;The Klone and I&quot; was inspired by a private joke between herself and Perkins. In 2006, Perkins dedicated his novel &quot;Sex and the Single Zillionaire&quot; to Steel.

Steel&#x27;s longtime residence was in San Francisco, but she now spends most of her time at a second home in Paris. Her 55-room San Francisco home, Spreckels Mansion, was built in c.1912 as the mansion of sugar tycoon Adolph B. Spreckels.

Despite her public image and varied pursuits, Steel is known to be shy and because of that and her desire to protect her children from the tabloids, she rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances.

=== Nick Traina and Yo Angel Foundations ===
Steel&#x27;s son, Nick Traina, died by suicide in 1997. Traina was the lead singer of San Francisco punk bands Link 80 and Knowledge. To honor his memory, Steel wrote the nonfiction book &quot;His Bright Light&quot;, about Nick&#x27;s life and death. Proceeds of the book, which reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction Bestseller List, were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation, which Steel runs, to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental accessibility issues. To gain more recognition for children&#x27;s mental health, Steel has lobbied for legislation in Washington, and previously held a fundraiser every two years (known as The Star Ball) in San Francisco. In 2002, she founded Yo Angel Foundation to assist the homeless.

==Writing style==
Steel&#x27;s novels, often described as &quot;formulaic,&quot; tend to involve the characters in a crisis that threatens their relationship. The novels sometimes explore the world of the rich and famous and frequently deal with serious life issues like illness, death, loss, family crises, and relationships. There are claims that her popular story lines are based on the events of her life. Despite a reputation among critics for writing &quot;fluff&quot;, Steel often delves into the less savory aspects of human nature, including incest, suicide, divorce, war, and even the Holocaust. As time has progressed, Steel&#x27;s writing has evolved. Her later heroines tend to be stronger and more authoritative, who, if they do not receive the level of respect and attention they desire from a man, move on to a new life. In recent years Steel has also been willing to take more risks with her plots. &quot;Ransom&quot; focuses more on suspense than romance, and follows three sets of seemingly unconnected characters as their lives begin to intersect. &quot;Toxic Bachelors&quot; departs from her usual style by telling the story through the eyes of the three title characters, men who are relationship phobic and ultimately discover their true loves.

To avoid comparisons to her previous novels, Steel does not write sequels. Although many of her earliest books were released with initial print runs of 1 million copies, by 2004 her publisher had decreased the number of books initially printed to 650,000 due to the decline in book purchasing. However, her fan base was still extremely strong at that time, with Steel&#x27;s books selling out atop charts worldwide.

=== Adaptations ===
Twenty-two of her books have been adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations. One is &quot;Jewels&quot;, the story of the survival of a woman and her children in World War II Europe, and the family&#x27;s eventual rebirth as one of the greatest jewelry houses in Europe. Columbia Pictures was the first movie studio to make an offer for one of her novels, purchasing the rights to &quot;The Ghost&quot; in 1998. Steel also reached an agreement with New Line Home Entertainment in 2005 to sell the film rights to 30 of her novels for DVDs.

===Writing process===
Steel spends two to three years on each book, juggling multiple projects at once. According to Steel, once she has an idea for a story, her first step is to make notes, which are mostly about the characters. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2018: &quot;I make notes for a while before I start work on the outline. The notes are usually more about the characters. I need to know the characters really well before I start — who they are, how they think, how they feel, what has happened to them, how they grew up.&quot; In a 2019 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she reported often spending 20- to 30-hour periods on her typewriter, gaining her attention and criticism.

Steel has written all of her novels on Olympia SG1 standard typewriters. She has two that she primarily writes on: one at her home in San Francisco and another at her home in Paris. Her typewriter at her home in San Francisco has been in her possession since she bought it while working on her first book. According to Steel, she bought it second hand for $20.

==Bibliography==

Danielle Steel has written more than 185 books, including over 141 novels. Her books have been translated into 43 languages and can be found in 69 countries across the globe.

Her works consist of novels, non-fiction, picture books, and two series of children&#x27;s books: the Max &amp; Martha series and the Freddie series.

<doc id="62000" wikidata="Q643873" url="?curid=62000" title="Legal drama">
<text>Legal drama, also called courtroom drama, is a genre of film and television that generally focuses on narratives regarding legal practice and the justice system. The American Film Institute (AFI) defines &quot;courtroom drama&quot; as a genre of film in which a system of justice plays a critical role in the film&#x27;s narrative. Legal dramas have also followed the lives of the fictional attorneys, defendants, plaintiffs, or other persons related to the practice of law present in television show or film. Legal drama is distinct from police crime drama or detective fiction, which typically focus on police officers or detectives investigating and solving crimes. The focal point of legal dramas, more often, are events occurring within a courtroom, but may include any phases of legal procedure, such as jury deliberations or work done at law firms. Some legal dramas fictionalize real cases that have been litigated, such as the play-turned-movie, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, which fictionalized the Scopes Monkey Trial. As a genre, the term &quot;legal drama&quot; is typically applied to television shows and films, whereas legal thrillers typically refer to novels and plays.

== Themes ==
Legal dramas typically portray moral dilemmas that occur with the practice of the law or participating in the justice system, many of which mirrors dilemmas in real life. The American Bar Association Journal has interpreted the public&#x27;s enjoyment of legal dramas occur because &quot;stories about the legal system are laced with human vulnerability.&quot; Indeed, even though &quot;there are no car chases [and]... [g]uns are never drawn&quot;, legal dramas retain strong followings because of their presentation of moral intrigue in a setting that actually reflects what occurs in the world.

Legal dramas may present stories of the miscarriages of justice, such as persons wrongly convicted of a crime they did not commit. At times, stories may involve the moral implications of police misconduct, such as placing or tampering with evidence, such as in the 1993 film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;. More often, legal dramas focus on the attorneys&#x27; point of view when faced with these difficulties. For instance, in &quot;The Practice&quot;, a television legal drama series revolving around a firm of criminal defense attorneys, a common theme presented is the difficulty of defending clients known or believed to be guilty.

Finally, many legal dramas present themes that reflect politicized issues. In the 1960 film, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, the politicized issue portrayed was the legality of a Tennessee statute that made it unlawful to teach the theory of evolution in a public school. As laws and public policy opinions change, so do the themes presented in legal dramas. The 1992 film &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; explored the psychology of superior orders, e.g. excusing criminal actions because they were only committed from &#x27;following orders&#x27;. The film &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993) addressed homophobia, and the discrimination and public fear of HIV/AIDs carriers. In 1996, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; portrays the early years of &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot; and issues of obscenity and freedom of speech. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; (2010) is a fictional biographic film about Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the legal actions he faced as a result of providing euthanasia services to terminal patients. Racial injustice remains a common theme from as far back as &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in 1962 to the 2017 film &quot;Marshall&quot;.

== History ==
Legal drama in American film has an extensive history stemming from as early as the 1908 film, &quot;Falsely Accused!&quot; The 1950s and 1960s presented a number of legal drama films including, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957), &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959), &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; (1959), &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962). Arguably, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; stand as the cornerstones of early legal dramas, garnering extensive acclaim, recognition, and awards. Despite underwhelming box office performance, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; was nominated in three different categories at the 30th Academy Awards and appears on half of the AFI 100 Years... series lists of films, which celebrate the greatest films in American cinema. Likewise, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; received even more acclaim, garnering three academy awards out of eight total nominations at the 35th Academy Awards, appears on seven of the AFI&#x27;s ten lists celebrating the greatest films, including ranking as the best courtroom drama, and selected for preservation United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Other countries also premiered legal dramas or courtrooms dramas in the early 1900s, such as the French silent film &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928).

Other legal drama films have not focused on even the practice of law, such as &quot;Paper Chase&quot;, a film presenting the difficulty and anxiety of entering law school.

== Legal thrillers ==

== Television ==
Early American television programs considered legal dramas include &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Judd, for the Defense&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones: The Lawyers&quot;, &quot;Petrocelli&quot;, and &quot;Matlock&quot;. More recent examples of serious legal dramas are &quot;Murder One&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;Pearson&quot;.

The examples of legal comedy dramas are &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, both of which David E. Kelley created and produced, with &quot;Suits&quot; as one of the most popular legal drama during the 2010s. &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; also achieved popularity following its first season in 2015.

Legal dramas are becoming more in demand from the public, more popular for many people to watch, and beginning to feature stronger female leads.

== Inaccurate portrayal of legal practice ==
It is widely believed by most practicing lawyers that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process. Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story. For example, because conflict between parties make for an interesting story, legal dramas emphasize the trial and ignore the fact that the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in the United States are settled out of court. Trials in legal dramas are often shown to be more emphatic by disregarding actual rules in trials that prevent prejudicing defendants from juries.

Besides the actual practice of law, legal dramas may also misrepresent the character of lawyers in general. The lawyers in question fall under different variations, the character representations include the zealous heroic lawyers fighting to save their client&#x27;s case, or putting criminals in jail, another is the sleazy distrustful attorney performing morally questionable acts to win the case, another may be the conflicted lawyer who is forced into a moral dilemma of having to defend a guilty client. These representations are not reflective of how lawyers act in real life as their job is to remain neutral to the law and ensure every person gets a fair and equal trial, regardless of their guilt.

Speaking at a screening of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; during the 2010 Fordham University Law School Film festival, US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that seeing &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11&#x27;s monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film&#x27;s example, because most of the jurors&#x27; conclusions are based on speculation, not fact. Sotomayor noted that events from the film such as entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a mistrial (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).

<text>The Boulevard Périphérique (), often called the Périph, is a limited-access dual-carriageway ring road in Paris, France. With a few exceptions (see &quot;Structure and Layout&quot;), it is situated along Paris&#x27;s administrative limit.

The speed limit along the Périphérique is 50 km/h (31 mph) as of 1 October 2024. Each ring generally has four traffic lanes, with no hard shoulder. Its major interchanges are called &quot;portes&quot;. At junctions, vehicles in the rightmost lane (separated from other lanes in these areas by a continuous white line to the left) must yield to entering vehicles.

When travelling at the legal speed limit, it takes approximately 40 minutes to complete a full circuit of the Périphérique.

==History==
In 1846, the French War Ministry completed the defensive Thiers wall around Paris, including fortifications, a dry moat, a &quot;Rue Militaire&quot; and a large berm. In 1859, the military engineering department gave conditional control of the perimeter to the precursor of the current Paris city council. The expansion of Paris in 1860, achieved through annexation of bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything outside was not. The Thiers wall led to a profound disruption of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs.

In 1861, the Paris city council started converting some sections of the &quot;Rue Militaire&quot; into boulevards. In the 1920s, the complete dismantling of the Thiers wall allowed further construction of what is today a series of over 20 connected boulevards encircling the city. This inner quasi-ring road came to be known as the Boulevards of the Marshals, as most of the boulevards bear the name of a marshal who served under Napoleon I. The road construction largely helped to reconnect Paris with its burgeoning suburbs. The Boulevards of the Marshals were almost fully completed by 1932, though the final three sections would not be added until 2005, closing the ring over 80 years after construction began. The Boulevards of the Marshals were built just inside the city limits, leaving a ring of vacant land just outside their perimeter.

Construction of the Périphérique began in 1958 on the remaining area once occupied by the Thiers Wall; the space not already taken up by the Boulevards of the Marshals measured anywhere from a few meters to the width of a city block. Unlike the Boulevards of the Marshals, the road bears only a single name, Boulevard Périphérique. In order to alleviate traffic congestion, the Périphérique was built more like a motorway than a wide boulevard, and was completed on 25 April 1973 under the presidency of Georges Pompidou. Used in a quarter of all Parisian traffic movements, it quickly became the busiest road in France. The Périphérique became a victim of its own success, plagued by widespread congestion and blocked from expansion by dense surrounding urban areas.

The top speed of the périphérique was lowered multiple times in its history. while initially being of 90 km/h, it was lowered to 70 km/h in 2014 then 50 km/h in 2024.

==Périphérique intérieur vs. extérieur==
The Périphérique consists of two concentric carriageways: the &quot;intérieur&quot; (&quot;inner ring&quot;) and the &quot;extérieur&quot; (&quot;outer ring&quot;). Vehicles travel clockwise on the inner ring and counterclockwise on the outer ring. Stretches of the road are sometimes referred to by cardinal direction. For example, in the southern half of the highway, the &quot;inner ring&quot; is designated as the &quot;Périphérique Ouest&quot; (&quot;Western Ring&quot;), as traffic there flows westbound, whereas the &quot;outer ring&quot; is designated as the &quot;Périphérique Est&quot; (&quot;Eastern Ring&quot;), as traffic flows eastbound. In the northern half, these designations are reversed.

==Structure and layout==
The structure of the Boulevard Périphérique is similar to most French autoroutes, UK and Commonwealth nation motorways, and American freeways in the following ways:
* It is a two-ring, multiple-lane controlled access road with no at-grade crossings or traffic lights. Maximum longitudinal slope is 4%.
* Traffic in opposite directions is separated by a median strip.

But the Périphérique is also different from some of its domestic and foreign counterparts:
* Motorists entering the right-hand lane have the right-of-way, i.e. priority over vehicles already on the ring road. This stems from the traditional rules governing Parisian boulevards.
* The right-hand lane is reserved for vehicles entering or preparing to leave the &quot;normal&quot; movement of vehicles in the other lanes, or the Boulevard itself. A solid white line separates recently entered traffic and circulating traffic. This is to prevent entering traffic from disrupting the flow of circulating traffic in the inner lanes, since all traffic would otherwise have to yield to any entering traffic, across all lanes.
* There is no hard shoulder (emergency lane), except around the Porte de Gentilly. This means that crashes can cause considerable disruption to traffic, making it difficult for emergency services to reach the scene of a crash.

There are generally four lanes in each of the two rings of the Boulevard. Variations exist:
* A two-lane section between the Porte d&#x27;Italie and the Porte d&#x27;Orléans
* A five-lane section between the Porte de Montreuil and Porte de Bagnolet
* A three-lane section between the Porte d&#x27;Orléans and the Porte de Sèvres.

The entire Boulevard Périphérique is 35.04 kilometres long, as measured along the central median strip. The route closely follows the municipal boundaries of Paris, but diverges in the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes (where the roadway is cut and covered), and the Paris Heliport. Because the Boulevard was built over the old Thiers Wall, its entrance/exit ramps and interchanges coincide with locations of the wall&#x27;s former city gates, or &quot;portes&quot;. The road crosses the River Seine via bridges upstream at Charenton/Bercy and downstream at Saint-Cloud/Issy.

Small distance markers are distributed evenly alongside the roadway:
* The 00.0 kilometre point is over the River Seine, upstream of the Porte de Bercy, at the bridge&#x27;s expansion joints.
* Distances from this point increase in the clockwise direction.
* The distance markers on the sign are underlined in red on the inner ring road, and in blue on the outer ring.

The roadway varies in elevation:
* 50% is elevated above its surroundings, i.e. above grade.
* 40% is constructed in trench sections, i.e. below grade.
* 10% is at ground level, i.e. at grade.

The Boulevard Périphérique can carry the heaviest vehicles allowed by French regulations. There is a height restriction of 4.75 metres (15 feet, 8 inches).

==Speed control==
The Boulevard Périphérique is equipped with speed cameras to enforce the 70 km/h (43.5 mph) speed limit. The cameras are oriented to photograph vehicle plates from behind, and are reportedly located near the following interchanges:

On the inner ring, at:

* Porte de Sèvres
* Porte de Champerret
* crossing the Quai d&#x27;Ivry, at the end of the bridge
* Porte de Bagnolet

On the outer ring, at:

* Porte de Châtillon
* Porte de Clichy
* Porte de Pantin
* Porte d&#x27;Auteuil

In addition, the Périphérique&#x27;s exit ramps are often monitored with hand-held binocular-type radar devices; these are triggered when the 50 km/h (31 mph) exiting limit is exceeded.

Finally, during rush hour, radar-equipped police vehicles are often positioned in hidden areas for further spot checks.

==Network monitoring and traffic management==
Approximately one hundred traffic cameras are installed along the Périphérique, directly connected to the control room of its traffic management office. There are 166 emergency telephones, located every 500 metres along the ring road (every 250 metres underground), which handle 7,000 calls per year. The emergency phones are all numbered, with odd-numbered phones on the outer ring and even-numbered ones on the inner ring road.

Eight police vehicles continuously patrol the Périphérique during the day; four do so at night.

750 sensors embedded in the road surface record each passing vehicle, measuring flow rate, occupancy rate and/or traffic velocity on given portions of the Périphérique. Variable-message signs provide information on the estimated journey time to the next major exit, automatically generating updates every minute via a computer system using data from the sensors. The system also displays general information on accidents, road closures and road work.

==Other ring roads==
The Boulevard Périphérique is not the only means of bypassing the interior of the French capital:

* Within the city boundaries, the Boulevards des Marechaux (Boulevards of the Marshals) encircle Paris, approximately 100 m inside the Périphérique. This is a collection of urban streets with standard crossings with other streets or tunnels under some major routes of entry. The speed limit is 50 km/h.
* Beyond the city boundaries, the A86 (also known as the &quot;super-périphérique&quot;) encircles Paris at a distance of 2–7 km from the Périphérique.
* Approximately 20 km from the Périphérique, a partially completed ring road called the Francilienne.
* Another project, the Grand contournement de Paris, has also been partially constructed.

==List of junctions==

==Statistics==

<text>Lozère (; ) is a landlocked department in the region of Occitanie in Southern France, located near the Massif Central, bounded to the northeast by Haute-Loire, to the east by Ardèche, to the south by Gard, to the west by Aveyron, and the northwest by Cantal. It is named after Mont Lozère. With 76,604 inhabitants as of 2019, Lozère is the least populous French department.

==History==
Lozère was created in 1790 during the French Revolution, when the whole of France was divided into departments, replacing the old provinces. Lozère was formed from part of the old province of Languedoc.

Pliny&#x27;s Natural History praised the cheese of Lozère:
:The kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome, where the various good things of all nations are to be judged of by comparison, are those that come from the provinces of Nemausus, and more especially the area there of Lesura and Gabalis (Lozère and Gévaudan); but its excellence is only very short-lived, and it must be eaten while it is fresh.

Between 1764 and 1767, the Beast of Gévaudan, a creature believed to be a large wolf or an exotic animal, terrorized the general area in the Margeride Mountains of the former province of Gévaudan (nearly identical with the modern Lozère department).

==Geography==
Lozère has an area of . It is the northernmost department of the current Occitanie region and is surrounded by five departments belonging to two regions: Cantal, Haute-Loire and Ardèche departments of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, and Gard and Aveyron departments of the Occitanie region.
The geography of Lozère is complicated, covering four mountain ranges. In the north-west, the basalt plateau of Aubrac rises between , with a cold humid climate influenced by the Atlantic. The north and north-east of the department contains the Margeride mountains, which are formed of granite, and have peaks between . The climate here is also cold, but drier than in Aubrac, with less snow.

The Causses are a series of very dry limestone plateaus in the south-west, and the south-east contains the Cévennes, which include the highest point in the department, the granite Mont Lozère at .

The department also contains numerous rivers, above and below ground, including the Tarn, whose source is on Mont Lozère, and which flows through the Gorges du Tarn in the Causses.

==Demographics==
Population development since 1801:
Lozère is the least populated French department, and the least densely populated in Metropolitan France. Its 2019 population of 76,604 gives it a population density of inhabitants/km2. The department boasts a population similar in size to that of the country of Andorra, the neighbouring country that borders to the south. Since the end of the 19th century the department has seen its population decline due to negative migration, the last fifteen years have nevertheless shown a new upward trend. The reasons given for this trend are the quality of the living environment, the improvement of the road transport and communication network and to a lesser extent heliotropism. It is nevertheless an elderly population with high purchasing power. The inhabitants of Lozère are known, in French, as &quot;Lozériens&quot; and &quot;Lozériennes&quot;.

The population is concentrated in three main urban centers: Mende, Saint-Chély-d&#x27;Apcher and Marvejols which together account for a third of the department&#x27;s population. Some other small centers (Langogne, Florac, Aumont-Aubrac, La Canourgue, etc.) appear as small living areas but are unable to attract young people, including the exodus towards neighboring metropolises (Clermont-Ferrand in the north, Montpellier and Nîmes to the south) is increasingly important.

Because of its low population density, it is considered to fall within the empty diagonal.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Mende, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 3 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

==Administration==
The département is managed by the Departmental Council of Lozère in Mende. , the President of the council is Sophie Pantel. Lozère is part of the region of Occitanie.

===Administrative divisions===
There are 2 arrondissements, 13 cantons and 152 communes in Lozère.

The following is a list of the 13 cantons of the Lozère department (with their INSEE codes), following the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015:

# Bourgs sur Colagne 
# La Canourgue 
# Le Collet-de-Dèze 
# Florac Trois Rivières 
# Grandrieu 
# Langogne 
# Marvejols 
# Mende-1 
# Mende-2 
# Peyre en Aubrac 
# Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole 
# Saint-Chély-d&#x27;Apcher 
# Saint-Étienne-du-Valdonnez 
==Economy==
The main activities are cattle farming and tourism. There is barely any arable farming in Lozère due to poor soil quality. The hardy Aubrac is the most commonly farmed cattle breed here.

The region has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in France, which may be attributed to the enforced long-standing tradition whereby young people emigrate to cities such as Lyon, Marseille, and Montpellier when they reach working age.

===Land use===
Lozère is a rural department, with relatively little land taken up by roads and buildings. Overall the land use is divided as follows:
* Forest 43.81%
* Heath &amp; other open land 31.19%
* Arable land 12.74%
* Fields 11.36%
* Roads and buildings 0.54%
* Rivers and ponds 0.3%

===Current National Assembly Representative===

==Tourism==
Tourist activities include caving and a variety of sports, such as skiing and kayaking. Lozère contains a part of the Cévennes National Park. Lozère is considered one of the best areas in France for trout fishing. Rivers such as the Lot, Tarn and Truyère are particularly noted for their trout populations.
