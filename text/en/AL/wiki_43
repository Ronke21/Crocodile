<text>Amphitryon (; Ancient Greek: Ἀμφιτρύων, &quot;gen&quot;.: Ἀμφιτρύωνος; usually interpreted as &quot;harassing either side&quot;, Latin: Amphitruo), in Greek mythology, was a son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns in Argolis. His mother was named either Astydameia, the daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia, or Laonome, daughter of Guneus, or else Hipponome, daughter of Menoeceus. Amphitryon was the brother of Anaxo (wife of Electryon), and Perimede, wife of Licymnius. He was a husband of Alcmene, Electryon&#x27;s daughter, and stepfather of the Greek hero Heracles.

== Mythology ==
Born—according to tradition—in Tiryns,
in Argolis in the eastern part of the Peloponnese, Amphitryon became King of Troezen
and regent of Mycenae.
He was a friend of Panopeus.

Having accidentally killed his prospective father-in-law, Electryon, king of Mycenae, Amphitryon was driven out of Mycenae by Electryon&#x27;s brother, Sthenelus. However, there is an earlier tradition that Amphitryon killed Electryon in a fit of anger over some cattle. He fled with Alcmene to Thebes, where he was cleansed from the guilt of blood by Creon, king of Thebes.

Alcmene, who was pregnant and had been betrothed to Amphitryon by her father, refused to marry him until he had avenged the deaths of her brothers, all but one of whom had fallen in battle against the Taphians. (It was on his return from this expedition that Electryon had been killed.) Amphitryon accordingly took the field against the Taphians, accompanied by Creon, who had agreed to assist him on condition that he slew the Teumessian fox which had been sent by Dionysus to ravage the Theban countryside.

The Taphians, however, remained invincible until Comaetho, the king&#x27;s daughter, out of love for Amphitryon, plucked out the single golden hair of her father, Pterelaos, the possession of which had rendered him immortal. Having defeated the enemy, Amphitryon put Comaetho to death and handed over the kingdom of the Taphians to Cephalus. On his return to Thebes he married Alcmene, who gave birth to twin sons, Iphicles and Heracles. Only Iphicles was the son of Amphitryon - in a case of heteropaternal superfecundation, Heracles was the son of Zeus, who had visited Alcmene during Amphitryon&#x27;s absence. Zeus, disguised as Amphitryon, described the victory over the sons of Pterelaus in such convincing detail that Alcmene accepted him as her betrothed. Amphitryon and Alcmene also had a daughter named Laonome.

Amphitryon fell in battle against the Minyans, against whom he had undertaken an expedition, accompanied by the youthful Heracles, to deliver Thebes from a disgraceful tribute. In the play &quot;Heracles&quot; by Euripides, Amphitryon survives to witness the murders of Heracles&#x27; children and wife.

==Dramatic treatments==
* &quot;Amphitryon&quot; was the title of a lost tragedy of Sophocles, but most others who have used this story have rendered comic treatments instead. Plautus, the Roman comedian, used this tale to present &quot;Amphitryon&quot;, a burlesque play. The dramatic treatment by Plautus has enjoyed a sustaining presence on the stage since its premiere. It was the only play by Plautus that was still performed during the Middle Ages, albeit in a modified form. It was staged regularly during the Renaissance, and was the second ancient comedy to be translated into the English language. 
* Plautus&#x27; play inspired several other theatrical works during the 16th century, including three Spanish language plays, two Italian plays, and a comedy in Portuguese by Luís de Camões. In 1636 Jean Rotrou translated Plautus&#x27; work into a successful French language production, &quot;Les Deux Sosies&quot;. This work inspired Molière&#x27;s highly successful &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1668). From Molière&#x27;s line &quot;&quot;Le véritable Amphitryon est l&#x27;Amphitryon où l&#x27;on dîne&quot;,&quot; the name Amphitryon has come to be used in the sense of a generous entertainer, a good host; the Spanish word for &quot;host&quot; is in fact &quot;anfitrión&quot; and in Portuguese it is &quot;anfitrião&quot;. Several other continental versions inspired by Plautus followed Molière, including a Christianized version by Johannes Burmeister.
* The first English language work that was loosely based on Plautus was an interlude in &quot;Jacke Juggler&quot; (ca. 1550). John Marston&#x27;s &quot;What You Will&quot; (1607) was also partly based on Plautus. The first large scale work where Plautus was the chief source was Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Age&quot; (1613). John Dryden&#x27;s 1690 &quot;Amphitryon&quot; is based on Molière&#x27;s 1668 version as well as on Plautus. Notable innovations from Dryden&#x27;s adaptation include music by Henry Purcell and the character of Phaedra, who flirts with Sosia but is eventually won over by Mercury&#x27;s promises of wealth. A modern comic adaptation was made by George Maxim Ross in the 1950s under the title &quot;Too Much Amphitryon.&quot;
* In Germany, Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1807), which began as a translation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1668) but developed into an original adaptation of the myth in its own right, remains the most frequently performed version of the myth, with Kleist using Alkmene&#x27;s inability to distinguish between Jupiter and her husband to explore metaphysical issues; Giselher Klebe wrote in 1961 his opera &quot;Alkmene&quot; based on this play. Other German dramatic treatments include Georg Kaiser&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Double Amphitryon&quot; (&quot;Zweimal Amphitryon&quot;, 1943) and Peter Hacks&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1968).
* In France, Molière&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1668) is the most famous and seminal treatment of the myth. It was also the subject of a play by Jean Giraudoux, &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot; (1929), the number in the title being Giraudoux&#x27;s whimsical approximation of how many times the story had been told onstage previously. It was adapted into English by S. N. Behrman and enjoyed a successful run on Broadway in 1938. Plautus&#x27; version was the basis of Cole Porter&#x27;s 1950 musical &quot;Out of This World&quot;. In 1991 it was the basis for the Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;Hélas pour moi&quot;.
* The classic 1935 Nazi-era but anti-Nazi film version, &quot;Amphitryon&quot;, was based on Kleist.
* The comic opera Amfitrion by the Croatia composer Boris Papandopulo (composed in 1937) which premiered in 1940.
* The musical &quot;Olympus on My Mind&quot; is based on Kleist&#x27;s adaptation of the play.
* Irish author John Banville&#x27;s play &quot;God&#x27;s Gift&quot; (Gallery Books, 2000) is a version of Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot;.
*The late Mexican writer Ignacio Padilla&#x27;s novel &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (2000), is a loose retelling of the ancient myth set in Nazi Germany and Europe, largely exploring the complex subjects of identity, time, and memory. The English translation is titled &quot;Shadow Without a Name&quot; (2003).

<text>In geology, a boulder (or rarely bowlder) is a rock fragment with size greater than in diameter. Smaller pieces are called cobbles and pebbles. While a boulder may be small enough to move or roll manually, others are extremely massive. In common usage, a boulder is too large for a person to move. Smaller boulders are usually just called rocks or stones.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;boulder&quot; derives from &quot;boulder stone&quot;, from Middle English &quot;bulderston&quot; or Swedish &quot;bullersten&quot;.

== About ==
In places covered by ice sheets during ice ages, such as Scandinavia, northern North America, and Siberia, glacial erratics are common. Erratics are boulders picked up by ice sheets during their advance, and deposited when they melt. These boulders are called &quot;erratic&quot; because they typically are of a different rock type than the bedrock on which they are deposited. One such boulder is used as the pedestal of the Bronze Horseman in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Some noted rock formations involve giant boulders exposed by erosion, such as the Devil&#x27;s Marbles in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, the Horeke basalts in New Zealand, where an entire valley contains only boulders, and The Baths on the island of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands.

Boulder-sized clasts are found in some sedimentary rocks, such as coarse conglomerate and boulder clay.

<text>Amphion ( ()) and Zethus (; Ζῆθος &quot;Zēthos&quot;) were, in ancient Greek mythology, the twin sons of Zeus (or Theobus) by Antiope. They are important characters in one of the two founding myths of the city of Thebes, because they constructed the city&#x27;s walls. Zethus or Amphion had a daughter who was called Neis (Νηίς), the Neitian gate at Thebes was believed to have derived its name from her.

== Mythology ==
===Childhood===
Amphion and Zethus were the sons of Antiope, who fled in shame to Sicyon after Zeus raped her, and married King Epopeus there. However, either Nycteus or Lycus attacked Sicyon in order to carry her back to Thebes and punish her. On the way back, she gave birth to the twins and was forced to expose them on Mount Cithaeron. Lycus gave her to his wife, Dirce, who treated her very cruelly for many years.

Antiope eventually escaped and found her sons living near Mount Cithaeron. After they were convinced that she was their mother, they killed Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull, gathered an army, and conquered Thebes, becoming its joint rulers. They also either killed Lycus or forced him to give up his throne.

===Rule of Thebes===
Amphion became a great singer and musician after his lover Hermes taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. Zethus became a hunter and herdsman, with a great interest in cattle breeding. As Zethus was associated with agriculture and the hunt, his attribute was the hunting dog, while Amphion’s - the lyre. Amphion and Zethus built fortifications of Thebes. They built the walls around the Cadmea, the citadel of Thebes at the command of Apollo. While Zethus struggled to carry his stones, Amphion played his lyre and his stones followed after him and gently glided into place.

Amphion married Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, the Lydian king. Because of this, he learned to play his lyre in the Lydian mode and added three strings to it. Zethus married Thebe, after whom the city of Thebes was named. Otherwise, the kingdom was named in honour of their supposed father Theobus.

===Later misfortunes===
Amphion&#x27;s wife Niobe had many children, but had become arrogant and because of this she insulted the goddess Leto, who had only two children, Artemis and Apollo. Leto&#x27;s children killed Niobe&#x27;s children in retaliation (see Niobe). Niobe’s overweening pride in her children, offending Apollo and Artemis, brought about her children’s deaths. In Ovid, Amphion commits suicide out of grief; according to Telesilla, Artemis and Apollo murder him along with his children. Hyginus, however, writes that in his madness he tried to attack the temple of Apollo, and was killed by the god&#x27;s arrows.

Zethus had only one son, who died through a mistake of his mother Thebe, causing Zethus to kill himself. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, however, Zethus&#x27;s wife is called Aëdon, a daughter of Pandareus in book 19, who killed her son Itylus in a fit of madness and became a nightingale. Later authors would clarify that Aëdon tried to kill Niobe and Amphion&#x27;s firstborn Amaleus out of jealousy that Niobe had borne many children, while she and Zethus only had one. However in the dark of the night, Aëdon by mistake killed Itylus, and in her mourning she was transformed into a nightingale by her father-in-law Zeus when Zethus began to chase her down in rage for murdering their son. Alternatively, Aëdon was afraid that her husband (here, mistakenly perhaps, spelled Zetes) was having an affair with a nymph, and that Itylus was assisting his father in his infidelity, so she killed him.

After the deaths of Amphion and Zethus, Laius returned to Thebes and became king.

<text>In Roman mythology, [[Romulus]] and Remus (, ) are twin brothers whose story tells of the events that led to the founding of the city of Rome and the Roman Kingdom by Romulus, following his fratricide of Remus. The image of a she-wolf suckling the twins in their infancy has been a symbol of the city of Rome and the ancient Romans since at least the 3rd century BC. Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome around 750 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. Possible historical bases for the story, and interpretations of its local variants, are subjects of ongoing debate.

==Overview==
Romulus and Remus were born in Alba Longa, one of the many ancient Latin cities near the Seven hills of Rome. Their mother Rhea Silvia, also known as Ilia, was a Vestal Virgin and the daughter of former king Numitor, who had been displaced by his brother Amulius. In some sources, Rhea Silvia conceived them when the god Mars visited her in a sacred grove dedicated to him.

Seeing them as a possible threat to his rule, King Amulius ordered them to be killed and they were abandoned on the bank of the river Tiber to die. They were saved by the god Tiberinus, Father of the River, and survived with the care of others at the site of future Rome. In the best-known episode, the twins were suckled by a she-wolf in a cave now known as the Lupercal. Eventually, they were adopted by Faustulus, a shepherd. They grew up tending flocks, unaware of their true identities. Over time, they became natural leaders and attracted a company of supporters from the community.
When they were young adults, they became involved in a dispute between supporters of Numitor and Amulius. As a result, Remus was taken prisoner and brought to Alba Longa. Both his grandfather and the king suspected his true identity. Romulus, meanwhile, had organized an effort to free his brother and set out with help for the city. During this time, they learned of their past and joined forces with their grandfather to restore him to the throne. Amulius was killed and Numitor was reinstated as king of Alba. The twins set out to build a city of their own.

After arriving back in the area of the seven hills, they disagreed about the hill upon which to build. Romulus preferred the Palatine Hill, above the Lupercal; Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. When they could not resolve the dispute, they agreed to seek the gods&#x27; approval through a contest of augury. Remus saw 6 auspicious birds, but Romulus saw 12 and claimed to have won divine approval. They disputed the result; Remus insulted Romulus&#x27; new city and was killed, either by Romulus or by one of his supporters. Romulus then went on to found the city of Rome, its institutions, government, military, and religious traditions. He reigned for many years as its first king.

==Primary sources==
The origins of the different elements in Rome&#x27;s foundation myth are a subject of ongoing debate. They may have come from the Romans&#x27; own Italic origins, or from Hellenic influences that were included later. Definitively identifying those original elements has so far eluded classicists. Roman historians dated the founding of Rome around 753 BC, but the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. There is an ongoing debate about how and when the &quot;complete&quot; fable came together.

Some elements are attested earlier than others, and the storyline and the tone were variously influenced by the circumstances and tastes of the different sources as well as by contemporary Roman politics and concepts of propriety. Whether the twins&#x27; myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development is the subject of an ongoing debate. Sources often contradict one another. They include the histories of Livy, Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Tacitus as well as the work of Virgil and Ovid.
Quintus Fabius Pictor&#x27;s work became authoritative to the early books of Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;, Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27;s &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Romulus&quot;.

These three works have been among the most widely read versions of the myth. In all three works, the tales of the lupercal and the fratricide are overshadowed by that of the twins&#x27; lineage and connections to Aeneas and the deposing of Amulius. The latter receives the most attention in the accounts. Plutarch dedicates nearly half of his account to the overthrow of their uncle.

===&quot;Roman Antiquities&quot; (Dionysius)===

Dionysius cites, among others, the histories of Pictor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Cato the Elder, Lucius Cincius Alimentus.

The first book of Dionysius&#x27; twenty-volume history of Rome does not mention Remus until chapter 71. After spending another 8 chapters discussing the background of their birth in Alba, he dedicates a total of 9 chapters to the tale (79–87). Most of that is spent discussing the conflict with Amulius.

He goes on to discuss the various accounts of the city&#x27;s founding by others, and the lineage and parentage of the twins for another 8 chapters until arriving at the tale of their abandonment by the Tiber River. He spends the better part of the chapter 79 discussing the survival in the wild. Then the end of chapters 79 through 84 focuses on the account of their struggle with Amulius. Chapter 84 is an alternate, non-fantastical account of their survival; the augury and fratricide are discussed in chapters 85 to 88.

===&quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; (Livy)===
Livy discusses the myth in chapters 4, 5, and 6 of his work&#x27;s first book. p. 7 parentage 4 p. 8 survival. p. 8 the youth. 5 9–10 the struggle with Amulius. 6 p. 11 (the beginning only) the augury and fratricide.

===Life of Romulus (Plutarch)===

Plutarch relates the legend in chapters 2–10 of &quot;the Life of Romulus&quot;. He dedicates the most attention, nearly half the entire account, to conflict with Amulius.

===&quot;Fasti&quot; (Ovid)===
&quot;Fasti&quot;, the epic Latin poem by Ovid from the early 1st century AD, contains a complete account of the twins&#x27; tale. Notably, it relates a tale wherein the ghost of Remus appears to Faustulus and his wife, whom the poet calls &quot;Acca&quot;. In the story, Remus appears to them while in bed and expresses his anger at Celer for killing him and his own, as well as Romulus&#x27; unquestioned fraternal love.

===&quot;Roman History&quot; (Dio)===
&quot;Roman History&quot; by Cassius Dio survives in fragments from various commentaries. They contain a more-or-less complete account. In them, he mentions an oracle that had predicted Amulius&#x27; death by a son of Numitor as the reason the Alban king expelled the boys. There is also a mention of &quot;another Romulus and Remus&quot; and another Rome having been founded long before on the same site.

===&quot;Origo Gentis Romanae&quot; (unknown)===
This work contains a variety of versions of the story. In one, there is a reference to a woodpecker bringing the boys food during the time they were abandoned in the wild. In one account of the conflict with Amulius, the capture of Remus is not mentioned. Instead, Romulus, upon being told of his true identity and the crimes suffered by him and his family at the hands of the Alban king, simply decided to avenge them. He took his supporters directly to the city and killed Amulius, afterwards restoring his grandfather to the throne.

===Fragments and other sources===

*&quot;Annals&quot; by Ennius is lost, but fragments remain in later histories.
*&quot;Roman History&quot; by Appian, in Book I &quot;Concerning the Kings&quot; is a fragment containing an account of the twins&#x27; parentage and origins.
*&quot;The City of God&quot; by Saint Augustine, claims, in passing, that Remus was alive after the city&#x27;s founding. Both he and Romulus established the Roman Asylum after the traditional accounts claimed that he had died.
*&quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; by Diodorus Siculus, is a universal history, which survives mostly intact in fragments and has a complete recounting of the twins&#x27; origins, their youth in the shepherd community, and the contest of the augury and fratricide. In this version, Remus sees no birds at all and he is later killed by Celer, Romulus&#x27; worker.
*&quot;Origines&quot; by Cato the Elder, fragments of which survive in the work of later historians, is cited by Dionysius.
*Roman poet Juvenal calls them &quot;geminos Quirinos&quot;, an allusion to Quirinus.

===Lost sources===
*Quintus Fabius Pictor wrote in the 3rd century BC. His &quot;History&quot;, written in Greek, is the earliest-known history of Rome. He is cited by all three canonical works.
*Diocles of Peparethus wrote a history of Rome that is cited by Plutarch.
*Lucius Calpurnius Piso wrote a history cited by Dionysius.
*Quintus Aelius Tubero wrote a history cited by Dionysius.
*Marcus Octavius (otherwise unknown) wrote an account cited in the &quot;Origo Gentis&quot;.
*Licinius Macer (died 66 BC) wrote an account cited in the &quot;Origo Gentis&quot;.
*Vennonius wrote an account cited in the &quot;Origo Gentis&quot;.
*Juba II wrote a history cited by Plutarch

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship approaches the various known stories of Romulus and Remus as cumulative elaborations and later interpretations of Roman origin myth. Particular versions and collations were presented by Roman historians as an authoritative, official history trimmed of contradictions and untidy variants, to justify contemporary developments, genealogies and actions in relation to Roman morality. Other narratives appear to represent popular or folkloric tradition; some of these remain inscrutable in purpose and meaning. Wiseman sums the whole as the mythography of an unusually problematic foundation and early history.

The three canonical accounts of Livy, Dionysius, and Plutarch provide the broad literary basis for studies of Rome&#x27;s founding mythography. They have much in common, but each is selective to its purpose. Livy&#x27;s is a dignified handbook, justifying the purpose and morality of Roman traditions of his own day. Dionysius and Plutarch approach the same subjects as interested outsiders, and include founder-traditions not mentioned by Livy, untraceable to a common source and probably specific to particular regions, social classes or oral traditions. A Roman text of the late Imperial era, &quot;Origo gentis Romanae&quot; (The origin of the Roman people) is dedicated to the many &quot;more or less bizarre&quot;, often contradictory variants of Rome&#x27;s foundation myth, including versions in which Remus founds a city named Remuria, five miles from Rome, and outlives his brother Romulus.

Roman historians and Roman traditions traced most Roman institutions to Romulus. He was credited with founding Rome&#x27;s armies, its system of rights and laws, its state religion and government, and the system of patronage that underpinned all social, political and military activity. In reality, such developments would have been spread over a considerable span of time. Some were much older and others much more recent. To most Romans, the evidence for the veracity of the legend and its central characters seemed clear and concrete, an essential part of Rome&#x27;s sacred topography. One could visit the Lupercal, where the twins were suckled by the she-wolf, or offer worship to the deified Romulus-Quirinus at the &quot;shepherd&#x27;s hut&quot;, or see it acted out on stage, or simply read the Fasti.

The legend as a whole encapsulates Rome&#x27;s ideas of itself, its origins and moral values. For modern scholarship, it remains one of the most complex and problematic of all foundation myths, particularly in the manner of Remus&#x27;s death. Ancient historians had no doubt that Romulus gave his name to the city. Most modern historians believe his name a back-formation from the name Rome; the basis for Remus&#x27;s name and role remain subjects of ancient and modern speculation. The myth was fully developed into something like an &quot;official&quot;, chronological version in the Late Republican and early Imperial era; Roman historians dated the city&#x27;s foundation to between 758 and 728 BC, and Plutarch reckoned the twins&#x27; birth year as 771 BC. A tradition that gave Romulus a distant ancestor in the semi-divine Trojan prince Aeneas was further embellished, and Romulus was made the direct ancestor of Rome&#x27;s first Imperial dynasty. Possible historical bases for the broad mythological narrative remain unclear and disputed. The image of the she-wolf suckling the divinely fathered twins became an iconic representation of the city and its founding legend, making Romulus and Remus pre-eminent among the feral children of ancient mythography.

===Historicity===

Current scholarship offers little evidence to support any particular version of the Roman foundation myth, including a historical Romulus or Remus. Starting with Fabius Pictor, the written accounts must have reflected the commonly-held history of the city to some degree. The archaeologist Andrea Carandini is one of very few modern scholars who accept Romulus and Remus as historical figures, and dates an ancient wall on the north slope of the Palatine Hill to the mid-8th century BC and names it the &quot;Murus Romuli&quot;.

==Iconography==
Ancient pictures of the Roman twins usually follow certain symbolic traditions, depending on the legend they follow: they either show a shepherd, the she-wolf, the twins under a fig tree, and one or two birds (Livy, Plutarch); or they depict two shepherds, the she-wolf, the twins in a cave, seldom a fig tree, and never any birds (Dionysius of Halicarnassus).

The twins and the she-wolf were featured on what might be the earliest silver coins minted in Rome.

The Franks Casket, an Anglo-Saxon ivory box (early 7th century AD) shows Romulus and Remus in an unusual setting, two wolves instead of one, a grove instead of one tree or a cave, four kneeling warriors instead of one or two gesticulating shepherds. According to one interpretation, and as the runic inscription (&quot;far from home&quot;) indicates, the twins are cited here as the &quot;Dioscuri&quot;, helpers at voyages such as Castor and Polydeuces. Their descent from the Roman god of war predestines them as helpers on the way to war. The carver transferred them into the Germanic holy grove and has Odin&#x27;s second wolf join them. Thus the picture served—along with five other ones—to influence &quot;wyrd&quot;, the fortune and fate of a warrior king.

==Depictions in art==

The myth has been an inspiration to artists throughout the ages. Particular focus has been paid to the rape of Ilia by Mars and the suckling of the twins by the she-wolf.

===Palazzo Magnani===

In the late 16th century, the wealthy Magnani family from Bologna commissioned a series of artworks based on the Roman foundation myth. The artists contributing works included a sculpture of Hercules with the infant twins by Gabriele Fiorini, featuring the patron&#x27;s own face. The most important works were an elaborate series of frescoes collectively known as &quot;Histories of the Foundation of Rome&quot; by the Brothers Carracci: Ludovico, Annibale, and Agostino Carracci.

<doc id="60788" wikidata="Q21560738" url="?curid=60788" title="Amphion">
<text>There are several characters named Amphion in Greek mythology:

* Amphion, son of Zeus and Antiope, and twin brother of Zethus (see Amphion and Zethus). Together, they are famous for building Thebes. Pausanias recounts an Egyptian legend according to which Amphion employed magic to build the walls of the city. Amphion married Niobe, and killed himself after the loss of his wife and children (the Niobids) at the hands of Apollo and Artemis. Diodorus Siculus calls Chloris his daughter, but the other accounts of her parentage identify her father as another Amphion, the ruler of Minyan Orchomenus (see below).
* Amphion, king of the Minyan Orchomenus and son of Iasus. By Persephone, daughter of Minyas, he became the father of Chloris, wife of Neleus and Phylomache, wife of Pelias; these husbands are sons of Tyro and Poseidon.
* Amphion, son of Hyperasius, son of Pelles, son of Phorbas. From Achaean Pellene, he and his brother Asterius were counted among the Argonauts that sailed to Colchis. In two separate accounts, Hypso was called their mother while Hippasus was said to be their father.
* Amphion of Elis, an Achaean warrior who took part in the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks. He was a commander of the Epeans, together with Meges and Dracius.
*Amphion, friend of the celebrated architect Epeius. He was killed by Aeneas.
*Amphion, centaur who attended Pirithous&#x27; wedding, fought against the Lapiths, tried to plunder Pholus of his wine and was killed by Heracles.

<text>Castor and Pollux (or Polydeuces) are twin half-brothers in Greek and Roman mythology, known together as the Dioscuri or Dioskouroi.

Their mother was Leda, but they had different fathers; Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, while Pollux was the divine son of Zeus, who seduced Leda in the guise of a swan. The pair are thus an example of heteropaternal superfecundation. Though accounts of their birth are varied, they are sometimes said to have been born from an egg, along with their twin sisters Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra.

In Latin, the twins are also known as the Gemini (&quot;twins&quot;) or Castores, as well as the Tyndaridae or Tyndarids. Pollux asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with his twin to keep them together, and they were transformed into the constellation Gemini. The pair were regarded as the patrons of sailors, to whom they appeared as St. Elmo&#x27;s fire. They were also associated with horsemanship, in keeping with their origin as the Indo-European horse twins.

==Birth==
There is much contradictory information regarding the parentage of the Dioscuri. In the Homeric &quot;Odyssey&quot; (11.298–304), they are the sons of Tyndareus alone, but they were sons of Zeus in the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue&quot; (fr. 24 M–W). The conventional account (attested first in Pindar, Nemean 10) combined these paternities so that only Pollux was fathered by Zeus, while Leda and her husband Tyndareus conceived Castor. This explains why they were granted an alternate immortality. The figure of Tyndareus may have entered their tradition to explain their archaic name &quot;Tindaridai&quot; in Spartan inscriptions, or &quot;Tyndaridai&quot; in literature, in turn occasioning incompatible accounts of their parentage. Their other sisters were Timandra, Phoebe, and Philonoe.

Castor and Pollux are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Pollux. In Homer&#x27;s&quot; Iliad&quot;, Helen looks down from the walls of Troy and wonders why she does not see her brothers among the Achaeans. The narrator remarks that they are both already dead and buried back in their homeland of Lacedaemon, thus suggesting that at least in some early traditions, both were mortal. Their death and shared immortality offered by Zeus was material of the lost &quot;Cypria&quot; in the Epic cycle.

The Dioscuri were regarded as helpers of mankind and held to be patrons of travellers and of sailors in particular, who invoked them to seek favourable winds. Their role as horsemen and boxers also led to them being regarded as the patrons of athletes and athletic contests. They characteristically intervened at the moment of crisis, aiding those who honoured or trusted them.

==Classical sources==
Ancient Greek authors tell a number of versions of the story of Castor and Pollux. Homer portrays them initially as ordinary mortals, treating them as dead in the &quot;Iliad&quot;:
: &quot;... there are two commanders I do not see,
: Castor the horse breaker and the boxer
: Polydeuces, my brothers ...&quot;
:::: – Helen, &quot;Iliad&quot;
but in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; they are described as both being alive, even though &quot;the grain-bearing earth holds them&quot;. The author describes them as &quot;having honour equal to gods&quot;, living on alternate days because of the intervention of Zeus. In both the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and in Hesiod, they are described as the sons of Tyndareus and Leda. In Pindar, Pollux is the son of Zeus, while Castor is the son of the mortal Tyndareus. The theme of ambiguous parentage is not unique to Castor and Pollux; similar characterisations appear in the stories of Herakles and Theseus. The Dioscuri are also invoked in Alcaeus&#x27; fragment 34a, though whether this poem antedates the Homeric Hymn to the twins is unknown. They appear together in two plays by Euripides, &quot;Helen&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot;.

Cicero tells the story of how Simonides of Ceos was rebuked by Scopas, his patron, for devoting too much space to praising Castor and Pollux in an ode celebrating Scopas&#x27; victory in a chariot race. Shortly afterwards, Simonides was told that two young men wished to speak to him; after he had left the banqueting room, the roof fell in and crushed Scopas and his guests.

According to the ancient sources the horse of Castor was named &quot;Cyllarus&quot;.

==Mythology==
Both Dioscuri were excellent horsemen and hunters who participated in the hunting of the Calydonian Boar and later joined the crew of Jason&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Argo&quot;.

===As Argonauts===
During the expedition of the Argonauts, Pollux took part in a boxing contest and defeated King Amycus of the Bebryces, a savage mythical people in Bithynia. After returning from the voyage, the Dioscuri helped Jason and Peleus to destroy the city of Iolcus in revenge for the treachery of its king Pelias.

===Rescuing Helen===
When their sister Helen was abducted by Theseus, the half-brothers invaded his kingdom of Attica to rescue her. In revenge they abducted Theseus&#x27;s mother Aethra and took her to Sparta while setting his rival, Menestheus, on the throne of Athens. Aethra was then forced to become Helen&#x27;s slave. She was ultimately returned to her home by her grandsons Demophon and Acamas after the fall of Troy.

===Leucippides, Lynceus, and death===

Castor and Pollux aspired to marry the Leucippides (&quot;daughters of the white horse&quot;), Phoebe and Hilaeira, whose father was Leucippus (&quot;white horse&quot;). Both women were already betrothed to cousins of the Dioscuri, the twin brothers Lynceus and Idas of Messenia, sons of Tyndareus&#x27;s brother Aphareus. Castor and Pollux carried the women off to Sparta wherein each had a son; Phoebe bore Mnesileos to Pollux and Hilaeira bore Anogon to Castor. This began a family feud among the four sons of the brothers Tyndareus and Aphareus.

The cousins carried out a cattle-raid in Arcadia together but fell out over the division of the meat. After stealing the herd, but before dividing it, the cousins butchered, quartered, and roasted a calf. As they prepared to eat, the gigantic Idas suggested that the herd be divided into two parts instead of four, based on which pair of cousins finished their meal first. Castor and Pollux agreed. Idas quickly ate both his portion and Lynceus&#x27; portion. Castor and Pollux had been duped. They allowed their cousins to take the entire herd, but vowed someday to take revenge.

Some time later, Idas and Lynceus visited their uncle&#x27;s home in Sparta. The uncle was on his way to Crete, so he left Helen in charge of entertaining the guests, which included both sets of cousins, as well as Paris, prince of Troy. Castor and Pollux recognized the opportunity to exact revenge, made an excuse that justified leaving the feast, and set out to steal their cousins&#x27; herd. Idas and Lynceus eventually set out for home, leaving Helen alone with Paris, who then kidnapped her. Thus, the four cousins helped set into motion the events that gave rise to the Trojan War.
Meanwhile, Castor and Pollux had reached their destination. Castor climbed a tree to keep a watch as Pollux began to free the cattle. Far away, Idas and Lynceus approached. Lynceus, named for the lynx because he could see in the dark, spied Castor hiding in the tree. Idas and Lynceus immediately understood what was happening. Idas, furious, ambushed Castor, fatally wounding him with a blow from his spear – but not before Castor called out to warn Pollux. In the ensuing brawl, Pollux killed Lynceus. As Idas was about to kill Pollux, Zeus, who had been watching from Mount Olympus, hurled a thunderbolt, killing Idas and saving his son.

Returning to the dying Castor, Pollux was given the choice by Zeus of spending all his time on Mount Olympus or giving half his immortality to his mortal brother. He opted for the latter, enabling the twins to alternate between Olympus and Hades. The brothers became the two brightest stars in the constellation Gemini (&quot;the twins&quot;): Castor (Alpha Geminorum) and Pollux (Beta Geminorum). As emblems of immortality and death, the Dioscuri, like Heracles, were said to have been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries. In some myths, Poseidon rewarded them with horses to ride and power to aid shipwrecked men.

==Iconography==

Castor and Pollux are consistently associated with horses in art and literature. They are widely depicted as helmeted horsemen carrying spears. The Pseudo-Oppian manuscript depicts the brothers hunting, both on horseback and on foot.
On votive reliefs they are depicted with a variety of symbols representing the concept of twinhood, such as the &quot;dokana&quot; (δόκανα – two upright pieces of wood connected by two cross-beams), a pair of amphorae, a pair of shields, or a pair of snakes. They are also often shown wearing felt caps, sometimes with stars above. They are depicted on metopes (an element of a Doric frieze) from Delphi showing them on the voyage of the &quot;Argo&quot; (Ἀργώ) and rustling cattle with Idas. Greek vases regularly show them capturing Phoebe and Hilaeira, as Argonauts, as well as in religious ceremonies and at the delivery to Leda of the egg containing Helen. They can be recognized in some vase-paintings by the skull-cap they wear, the &quot;pilos&quot; (πῖλος), which was already explained in antiquity as the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.

They were described by Dares Phrygius as &quot;blond haired, large eyed, fair complexioned, and well-built with trim bodies&quot;.

===Dokana===
Dokana were ancient symbolical representation of the Dioscuri. It consisted of two upright beams with others laid across them transversely. The Dioscuri were worshipped as gods of war, and their images accompanied the Spartan kings whenever they took the field against an enemy. But when in the year 504 B.C. the two kings, during their invasion of Attica, failed in their undertaking on account of their secret enmity towards each other, it was decreed at Sparta, that in future only one king should command the army, and in consequence should only be accompanied by one of the images of the Dioscuri. It is not improbable that these images, accompanying the kings into the field, were the ancient δόκανα, which were now disjointed, so that one-half of the symbol remained at Sparta, while the other was taken into the field by one of the kings.

The name δόκανα seems that it comes from δοκός which meant beam, but Suda and the Etymologicum Magnum state that δόκανα was the name of the graves of the Dioscuri at Sparta, and derived from the verb δέχομαι.

==Shrines and rites==
The Dioskouroi were worshipped by the Greeks and Romans alike; there were temples to the twins in Athens, such as the Anakeion, and Rome, as well as shrines in many other locations in the ancient world.

The Dioskouroi and their sisters grew up in Sparta, in the royal household of Tyndareus; they were particularly important to the Spartans, who associated them with the Spartan tradition of dual kingship and appreciated that two princes of their ruling house were elevated to immortality. Their connection there was very ancient: a uniquely Spartan aniconic representation of the Tyndaridai was as two upright posts joined by a cross-bar; as the protectors of the Spartan army the &quot;beam figure&quot; or &quot;dókana&quot; was carried in front of the army on campaign. Sparta&#x27;s unique dual kingship reflects the divine influence of the Dioscuri. When the Spartan army marched to war, one king remained behind at home, accompanied by one of the Twins. &quot;In this way the real political order is secured in the realm of the Gods&quot;.

Their &quot;herōon&quot; or grave-shrine was on a mountain top at Therapne across the Eurotas from Sparta, at a shrine known as the &quot;Meneláeion&quot; where Helen, Menelaus, Castor and Pollux were all said to be buried. Castor himself was also venerated in the region of Kastoria in northern Greece.
They were commemorated both as gods on Olympus worthy of holocaust, and as deceased mortals in Hades, whose spirits had to be propitiated by libations. Lesser shrines to Castor, Pollux and Helen were also established at a number of other locations around Sparta. The pear tree was regarded by the Spartans as sacred to Castor and Pollux, and images of the twins were hung in its branches. The standard Spartan oath was to swear &quot;by the two gods&quot; (in Doric Greek: νά τώ θεὼ, &quot;ná tō theō&quot;, in the Dual number).

The rite of &quot;theoxenia&quot; (θεοξενία), &quot;god-entertaining&quot;, was particularly associated with Castor and Pollux. The two deities were summoned to a table laid with food, whether at individuals&#x27; own homes or in the public hearths or equivalent places controlled by states. They are sometimes shown arriving at a gallop over a food-laden table. Although such &quot;table offerings&quot; were a fairly common feature of Greek cult rituals, they were normally made in the shrines of the gods or heroes concerned. The domestic setting of the &quot;theoxenia&quot; was a characteristic distinction accorded to the Dioskouroi.

The image of the twins attending a goddess are widespread and link the Dioskouroi with the male societies of initiates under the aegis of the Anatolian Great Goddess and the great gods of Samothrace. During the Archaic period, the Dioscuri were venerated in Naukratis. The Dioscuri are the inventors of war dances, which characterize the Kuretes.

Anakeia (ἀνάκεια) or Anakeion (ἀνάκειον) was a festival held at Athens in honor of the Dioscuri who also had the name Anakes (Ἄνακες).

==City of Dioscurias==

The ancient city of Dioscurias or Dioskurias (Διοσκουριάς) on the Black Sea coast, modern Sokhumi, was named after them. In addition, according to legend the city was founded by them. According to another legend, the city was founded by their charioteers, Amphitus and Cercius of Sparta.

==Island of Dioscuri==
The island of Socotra, located between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea, was called by the Greeks &quot;Dioskouridou&quot; (Διοσκουρίδου νήσος), meaning &quot;the island of the Dioscuri&quot;.

==Indo-European analogues==
The heavenly twins appear in Indo-European tradition as the effulgent Vedic brother-horsemen called the Ashvins, Lithuanian Ašvieniai, and possibly Germanic Alcis.

==Etruscan Kastur and Pultuce==
The Etruscans venerated the twins as &quot;Kastur&quot; and &quot;Pultuce&quot;, collectively as the &quot;tinas cliniiaras&quot;, &quot;Sons of Tinia&quot;, Etruscan counterpart of Zeus. They were often portrayed on Etruscan mirrors. As was the fashion in Greece, they could also be portrayed symbolically; one example is seen in the Tomb of the Funereal Bed at Tarquinia where a &quot;lectisternium&quot; is painted for them. Another is symbolised in a painting depicted as two pointed caps crowned with laurel, referring to the Phrygian caps.

==Italy and the Roman Empire==
From the 5th century BCE onwards, the brothers were revered by the Romans, probably as the result of cultural transmission via the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. An archaic Latin inscription of the 6th or 5th century BCE found at Lavinium, which reads &quot;Castorei Podlouqueique qurois&quot; (&quot;To Castor and Pollux, the Dioskouroi&quot;), suggests a direct transmission from the Greeks; the word &quot;qurois&quot; is virtually a transliteration of the Greek word &quot;κούροις&quot;, while &quot;Podlouquei&quot; is effectively a transliteration of the Greek &quot;Πολυδεύκης&quot;.
The construction of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, located in the Roman Forum at the heart of their city, was undertaken to fulfill a vow &quot;(votum)&quot; made by Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis in gratitude at the Roman victory in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 495 BCE. The establishment of a temple may also be a form of &quot;evocatio&quot;, the transferral of a tutelary deity from a defeated town to Rome, where cult would be offered in exchange for favor. According to legend, the twins fought at the head of the Roman army and subsequently brought news of the victory back to Rome. The Locrians of Magna Graecia had attributed their success at a legendary battle on the banks of the Sagras to the intervention of the Twins. The Roman legend could have had its origins in the Locrian account and possibly supplies further evidence of cultural transmission between Rome and Magna Graecia.

The Romans believed that the twins aided them on the battlefield. Their role as horsemen made them particularly attractive to the Roman &quot;equites&quot; and cavalry. Each year on July 15, Feast Day of the Dioskouroi, 1,800 equestrians would parade through the streets of Rome in an elaborate spectacle in which each rider wore full military attire and whatever decorations he had earned.

Castor and Pollux are also represented in the Circus Maximus by the use of eggs as lap counters.

In translations of comedies by Plautus, women generally swear by Castor, and men by Pollux; this is exemplified by the slave-woman character Staphyla in &quot;A Pot of Gold&quot; (act i, ll. 67–71) where she swears by Castor in line 67, then the negative prefix in line 71 denotes a refutation against swearing by Pollux.

Photius wrote that Polydeuces was a lover of Hermes, and the god made him a gift of Dotor (), the Thessalian horse.

===Christianization===

Even after the rise of Christianity, the Dioskouroi continued to be venerated. The 5th century pope Gelasius I attested to the presence of a &quot;cult of Castores&quot; that the people did not want to abandon. In some instances, the twins appear to have simply been absorbed into a Christian framework; thus 4th century CE pottery and carvings from North Africa depict the Dioskouroi alongside the Twelve Apostles, the Raising of Lazarus or with Saint Peter. The church took an ambivalent attitude, rejecting the immortality of the Dioskouroi but seeking to replace them with equivalent Christian pairs. Saints Peter and Paul were thus adopted in place of the Dioskouroi as patrons of travelers, and Saints Cosmas and Damian took over their function as healers. Some have also associated Saints Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Melapsippus with the Dioskouroi.

The New Testament scholar Dennis MacDonald identifies Castor and Pollux as models for James son of Zebedee and his brother John in the Gospel of Mark. MacDonald cites the origin of this identification to 1913 when J. Rendel Harris published his work Boanerges, a Greek version probably of an Aramaic name meaning &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;, thunder being associated with Zeus, father of Pollux, in what MacDonald calls a form of early Christian Dioscurism.

More directly, the Acts of the Apostles mentions the Dioskouroi in a neutral context, as the figurehead of an Alexandrian ship boarded by Paul in Malta (Acts 28:11).

The iconography of Castor and Pollux influenced or has close parallels with depictions of divine male twins in cultures with Greco-Roman relations.

<text>Council Bluffs is a city in and the county seat of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The population was 62,799 at the 2020 census, making it the state&#x27;s tenth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southwest Iowa. The Omaha metropolitan region of which Council Bluffs is a part, is the 58th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 983,969 (2023). It is located on the east bank of the Missouri River, across from Omaha, Nebraska. Until about 1853 Council Bluffs was known as Kanesville. Kanesville was the historic starting point of the Mormon Trail. Kanesville is also the northernmost anchor town of the other emigrant trails because there was a steam-powered boat which ferried the settlers&#x27; wagons and cattle across the Missouri River. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad to California was connected to the existing U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs.

==History==
===1804–1843: Pottawattamie reservation and Caldwell&#x27;s Camp===
The first Council Bluff (which is singular) was on the Nebraska side of the river at Fort Atkinson, about northwest of the city of Council Bluffs. It was named by Lewis and Clark for a bluff where they met the Otoe people on August 2, 1804.

The Iowa side of the river became an Indian Reservation in the 1830s for members of the Council of Three Fires of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi who were forced to leave the Chicago area under the Treaty of Chicago clearing the way for the city of Chicago to incorporate.

The largest group of Native Americans who moved to the area were the Pottawatomi, who were led by their chief Sauganash (&quot;one who speaks English&quot;), the son of the British loyalist William Caldwell, who founded Canadian communities on the south side of the Detroit River, and a Pottawatomi woman.

Seeking to avoid confrontation with the Sioux, who were natives of the Council Bluffs area, the 1,000 to 2,000 Pottawattamie initially had settled east of the Missouri River in Indian territory between Leavenworth, Kansas and St. Joseph, Missouri. When the area was bought from Ioway, Sac and Fox tribes in the Platte Purchase and part of Missouri in 1837, Sauganash and the Pottawatomi were forced to move to their assigned reservation in Council Bluffs. Sauganash&#x27;s English name was Billy Caldwell, and his village was called Caldwell&#x27;s Camp. The tribe were sometimes called the Bluff Indians. U.S. Army Dragoons built a small fort nearby.

In 1838–39, the missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet founded St. Joseph&#x27;s Mission to minister to the Potawatomi. De Smet was appalled by the violence and brutality caused by the whiskey trade, and tried to protect the tribe from unscrupulous traders. However, he had little success in persuading tribal members to convert to Christianity and resorted to secret baptisms of Indian children.

During this time, De Smet contributed to Joseph Nicollet&#x27;s work in mapping the upper midwest. De Smet produced the first European-recorded, detailed map of the Council Bluffs area; it detailed the Missouri River valley system, from below the Platte River to the Big Sioux River.

De Smet wrote an early description of the Potawatomi settlement:

Imagine a great number of cabins and tents, made of the bark of trees, buffalo skins, coarse cloth, rushes and sods, all of a mournful and funereal aspect, of all sizes and shapes, some supported by one pole, others having six, and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable, and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion, and you will have an Indian village.

As more Native Americans were pushed into the Council Bluffs area by pressure of European-American settlement to the east, intertribal conflict increased, fueled by the illegal whiskey trade. The US Army built Fort Croghan in 1842, to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the Missouri River. However the fort was destroyed in a flood later in the same year.

By 1846 the Pottawatomi were forced to move again to a new reservation at Osawatomie, Kansas.

===1844–1851: Mormon community of Kanesville===
In 1844, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party crossed the Missouri River here, on their way to blaze a new path into California across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Beginning in 1846 there was a large influx of Latter-day Saints into the area, although in the winter of 1847–1848 most Latter-day Saints crossed to the Nebraska side of the Missouri River. Initially, the area was called &quot;Miller&#x27;s Hollow&quot;, after Henry W. Miller, who would be the first member of the Iowa State Legislature from the area. Miller also was the foreman for the construction of the Kanesville Tabernacle.

By 1848, the town had become known as Kanesville, named for benefactor Thomas L. Kane who had helped negotiate federal permission in Washington, D.C. for the Mormons to use Indian land along the Missouri as their winter encampment of 1846–47. Built next to or at Caldwell&#x27;s Camp, Kanesville became the main outfitting point for the Mormon Exodus to Utah; it is the recognized head end of the Mormon Trail.

Edwin Carter, who would become a noted naturalist in Colorado, worked here from 1848 to 1859 in a dry goods store. He helped supply Mormon wagon trains.

Settlers who departed west from Kanesville into the sparsely settled, unorganized parts of the Territory of Missouri traveled to the Oregon Country and the newly conquered California Territory. They traversed the (eventual) Nebraska Territory traveling in wagon trains along the much-storied Oregon, Mormon, or California Trails into the newly expanded United States western lands.

After the first large organized wagon trains left Missouri in 1841, the annual migration waves began in earnest by the spring of 1843. They built up thereafter, with the opening of the Mormon Trail (1846) and peaked in the later 1860s, when news of the progress of railroads had a braking effect on the number of travelers.

By the 1860s, virtually all migration wagon trains passed near the town now named Council Bluffs. The wagon train trails became less important with the advent of the first complete transcontinental railway in 1869, but while trail use diminished after that, their use continued on at lesser rates until late in the nineteenth century.

The Mormon Battalion began its march from Kanesville to California during the Mexican–American War. The area was where plural marriage first began to be openly practiced. Orson Hyde began to publish &quot;The Frontier Guardian&quot; newspaper, and Brigham Young was named as the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). The community was transformed by the California Gold Rush, and the majority of Mormons left for Utah by 1852.
===1852–1900: Council Bluffs and the beginning of the railroad era===
By 1852, the number of Mormons was declining due to their further westward movement, and the town was renamed Council Bluffs after a cliff called Council Bluff 20 miles to the north on which Fort Atkinson was built in 1820. The bluff itself was named after the so-called Otoe council, an August 1804 meeting of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with the members of the Otoe and Missouria Native American tribes.

The town continued as a major outfitting point on the Missouri River for the Emigrant Trail and Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush, and entertained a lively steamboat trade.

In 1863 an anonymous soldier on his way to fight the Dakota Uprising passed through Council Bluffs describing it as a hardscrabble town:

Council Bluffs (rather than Omaha) was designated by President Abraham Lincoln as the official starting point of the transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869. The official &quot;Mile 0&quot; start is at 21st Street and 9th Avenue which is now marked by a gold spike that was used for the promotion of the movie Union Pacific. Council Bluffs&#x27; physical connection to the Transcontinental Railroad was delayed until 1872 when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge opened (railroad cars had to be ferried across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs to Omaha in the early days of the Transcontinental).

The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company arrived in 1867. Other railroads operating in the city were the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, Chicago Great Western Railway, Wabash Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as well as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.

===1901–present===

In 1926, the portion of Council Bluffs west of the Missouri River seceded to form Carter Lake, Iowa. Carter Lake had been cut off by a change in the course of the Missouri River.

By the 1930s, Council Bluffs had grown into the country&#x27;s fifth largest rail center. The railroads helped the city become a center for grain storage, and massive grain elevators continue to mark the city&#x27;s skyline. Other industries in the city included Blue Star Foods, Dwarfies Cereal, Frito-Lay, Georgie Porgie Cereal, Giant Manufacturing, Kimball Elevators, Mona Motor Oil, Monarch, Reliance Batteries, Woodward&#x27;s Candy, and World Radio. During the 1940s Meyer Lansky operated a greyhound racing track in Council Bluffs.

Restructuring of the railroad industry caused the loss of many jobs after the mid-20th century, as did the restructuring of heavy industry. Many jobs moved offshore. By the late 20th century the city and region were suffering economic stagnation and a declining population, as they struggled to develop a new economy. Downtown urban renewal was undertaken to create a new future while emphasizing the strengths of heritage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Council Bluffs covers a unique topographic region originally composed of prairie and savanna in the Loess Hills with extensive wetlands and deciduous forest along the Missouri River. Excellent vistas can be had from KOIL Point at Fairmont Park, the Lincoln Monument, Kirn Park, and the Lewis and Clark Monument. Lake Manawa State Park is located at the southern edge of the city.

===Neighborhoods===


====Downtown Council Bluffs====

Downtown Council Bluffs historically was the area along West Broadway and adjacent streets from Old Town west to the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company Railroad passenger depot at 11th Street. The downtown area developed as the economic rival of Old Town after the 1853 opening of the Pacific House Hotel by Samuel S. Bayliss and until the 1867 completion of the Chicago and Northwestern. In 1899, the Illinois Central passenger depot opened at 12th St. and West Broadway.

Downtown declined as the city&#x27;s primary retail center after the 1955 completion of the Broadway Viaduct, 1970s urban renewal, and the 1984 opening of the Kanesville Boulevard U.S. Route 6 bypass. Remaining buildings of note include the 1959 Council Bluffs Post Office and Federal Building at 6th Street, the 1986 &quot;Red&quot; Nelson Building, the 501 Main Building, the substantially altered 1909 City National Bank Building, and the 1968 First Federal Building. The 1947 State Savings Bank Building at 509 West Broadway and the seven-story 1924 Bennett Building at 405 West Broadway are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 100 Block of West Broadway is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the 1892 Broadway United Methodist Church at West Broadway and 1st St. remains a prominent community landmark.

====Old Town Council Bluffs====
Old Town Council Bluffs was adjudged by Judge Frank Street in the 1850s to be the area between West Broadway and Glen Avenue and East Broadway and Frank Street from Harmony Street south to Pierce Street. Today the area encompasses Billy Caldwell&#x27;s settlement of Potawatomi on Indian Creek during the 1830s and Kanesville established by the Mormons as Miller&#x27;s Hollow in 1848. Kanesville was the home of Mormon leaders Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, and Ezra T. Benson and was a major outfitting point on the Mormon Trail during the California Gold Rush. The reconstructed Kanesville Tabernacle in the 300 block of East Broadway is operated as a museum by the LDS Church.

====The West End====
The West End is a geographically large area on the flood plain east of the Missouri River and downtown Omaha, Nebraska, west of 10th St. and the Broadway Viaduct, and north of 9th Ave. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards. These neighborhoods of long, tree-shaded avenues are divided by the commercial corridor of West Broadway (U.S. Route 6), once part of the Lincoln Highway. This stretch of West Broadway has traditionally had several drive-in fast food restaurants and automobile dealerships with several grain elevators adjacent along 1st Avenue. West Broadway ends at the Interstate 480 bridge to downtown Omaha. Iowa Highway 192 follows North 16th St. from West Broadway to Interstate 29. Neighborhood landmarks include the 1890s Illinois Central Railroad Missouri River bridge, Stan Bahnsen Park, the Golden Spike monument, the Narrows River Park, Big Lake Park, the site of Dodge Park Playland, the Dodge Christian Church (built with the N.P. Dodge Memorial funds and now known as Citylight West Council Bluffs), and many examples of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture. The West End was used as a location by film director Alexander Payne in the movies &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; and &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.

====Casino Row====
Casino Row is located on and near the Missouri River south of West Broadway and Interstate 480, west of South 35th St. and Interstate 29, and north of Interstate 80 along 23rd Avenue west of South 24th St. The opening of the Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986, now the Horseshoe Council Bluffs, was followed in the mid-1990s by riverboat casinos operated by Ameristar and Harvey&#x27;s Casino Hotel (now Harrah&#x27;s Council Bluffs). New development in this previously industrial area has included the Mid-America Center, several restaurants and hotels, and other businesses. The appearance of legalized gambling in Council Bluffs became a major issue in neighboring Omaha where Mayor Hal Daub had declared Iowa an &quot;XXX state&quot; in 1995 as horse-racing came to an end at Ak-Sar-Ben.

====Twin City====
Twin City is located south of where Interstate 29 splits from Interstate 80, east of South Omaha, Nebraska, west of Indian Creek, and north of the South Omaha Bridge Road (U.S. Route 275 and Iowa Highway 92). This neighborhood developed mostly during the 1960s for workers in nearby Omaha factories and at Offutt Air Force Base. The Interstate 80 Exit at 1-B at South 24th Street includes two large truck stops along with several motels, the Western Historic Trails Center, the Bluffs Acres manufactured home development, and The Marketplace shopping area. The Willows on the South Omaha Bridge Road is an example of mid-20th century roadside motel architecture and Bart&#x27;s Motel further east at South 24th St featured prominent neon signage, was used as a location in the motion picture &quot;The Indian Runner&quot;, and has since been demolished.

====Manawa====
Manawa is the portion of Council Bluffs from the combined Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the city limits between Mosquito and Indian Creeks. The area was developed as a trolley park by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company after the former channel of the Missouri River was &quot;cut-off&quot; during an 1881 flood to become modern Lake Manawa State Park. Later development followed the establishment of U.S. Route 275 and the completion of Interstate 80 with additional growth during the 1990s. A variety of fast food restaurants, motels, big-box stores, automobile dealerships, a large truck stop and other businesses are located between Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the state park. The Lake Manawa Inn hosts early examples of roadside cabin architecture. In February and March, bald eagles and red-tailed hawks can frequently be seen at Lake Manawa, particularly along the southwest shore.

====The South End====
The South End is bordered by 12th Avenue on the north, South 16th St. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards on the west, Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 on the south, and the South Expressway (Iowa Highway 192) on the east. This neighborhood developed during the late 19th century with the railroads, especially the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In the early 20th century much of the area was dubbed &quot;Dane Town&quot; or &quot;Little Copenhagen&quot; for the large number of Danish immigrants with several Croatian and Mexican families closer to the Union Pacific railyards at &quot;Little Vienna&quot;. Neighborhood landmarks include Peterson Park, Longfellow School, and the 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific passenger depot, now the RailsWest Railroad Museum.

====Oakland-Fairview====
Oakland-Fairview developed during the 1890s and features a wealth of 19th-century architecture, including the Judge Finley Burke mansion at 510 Oakland built in 1893 out of Minnesota granite. The neighborhood is also home to the Lincoln Monument. Located at the western end of Lafayette Avenue, the monument was erected in 1911 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution that, according to folklore, commemorates the spot where Abraham Lincoln decided on the location of the transcontinental railroad in 1859. The monument offers expansive views across the West End in the Missouri River Valley to Omaha, Nebraska. Nearby is the entrance to Fairview Cemetery, situated on the north side of Lafayette Avenue, which predates the establishment of the present city and includes the Kinsman Monument and the burial place of many early settlers, including Amelia Bloomer. At the east end of Lafayette Avenue where it intersects with North Second Street stands the Ruth Anne Dodge Memorial, the &quot;Black Angel&quot; designed by Daniel Chester French, although the wife of Grenville Dodge is actually buried elsewhere in Council Bluffs.

====Madison Avenue====
Madison Avenue is the area of Council Bluffs adjacent to Exit 5 of Interstate 80 along Madison and Bennett avenues, Valley View Drive, and the area between Iowa Highway 92 north to McPherson Avenue. Mosquito Creek flows through this area which was originally notable for the Potawatomi gristmill and now includes the usual roadside gas stations, fast food restaurants, motels, and the tracks of the Iowa Interstate Railroad. Plans for a shopping mall here first appeared in 1972 and construction finally began on the Mall of the Bluffs in 1985. Residential growth east of the railroad tracks towards State Orchard Road and the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport and north to U.S. Route 6 has included developments outside the Council Bluffs city limits.

====Huntington Avenue====
Huntington Avenue consists of early 20th century Craftsman homes which wind along the top of the Loess Hills past the 1925 studio of radio station KOIL; the station is now apartments.

The historic &quot;Council Bluffs&#x27; Red-light district&quot; was formed during the late 19th century, when at least 10 separate brothels were located on Pierce Street east of Park Avenue with another three brothels down the block on the south side of West Broadway east of Park. One 1890 newspaper article referenced in Lt. RL Miller&#x27;s &quot;Selected History of the Council Bluffs Police&quot; noted the &quot;places of vice and corruption on Pierce&quot; and Stella Long&#x27;s above the Ogden House along with the &quot;terrible den at the corner of Market and Vine&quot; and Belle Clover&#x27;s bagnio at 8th St. and West Broadway.

===Environmental problems===
In 2010, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources found that air in central Council Bluffs measured above the national air quality standard for lead, most likely due to lead emissions in this area by Griffin Pipe Products Company. In 2011, EPA found numerous violations of the Clean Water Act, because the plant&#x27;s contaminated stormwater commingled with treated process wastewater and was pumped out to the storm sewer, which discharged into the Missouri River.

==Economy==
The liberalization of Iowa gambling laws was followed by the opening of The Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986. By 2005, Council Bluffs was the 19th largest casino market in the United States, with revenue equaling nearly $434 million. Casinos include Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs, Harrah&#x27;s Council Bluffs, and the Horseshoe Council Bluffs.

Council Bluffs industry includes &quot;frozen foods, robotics, dairy products, plastics, railroading, electrical products, and pork and beef packaging&quot; per the city&#x27;s website. American Games (a manufacturer of lottery gaming products), Barton Solvents, Con-Agra, Grundorf, Katelman Foundry, Omaha Standard Palfinger (a truck body manufacturer established in 1926), Red Giant Oil, and Tyson Foods have manufacturing plants in the city.

Griffin Pipe Products, established in 1921, closed its plant employing about 250 people in March 2014, when it was bought by U.S. Pipe and Foundry, based in Birmingham, Alabama. Griffin Wheels, a part of American Steel Foundries, was one of the largest US manufacturers of iron railroad-car wheels until it switched to pipes in the 1960s.

Mid-American Energy built a new coal-fired plant in 2007; the billion dollar investment was the single largest private investment in Iowa&#x27;s history up until then.

In 2007, Google began construction of a server farm on the former site of the Council Bluffs drive-in theater on Veterans Memorial Highway. This first phase, completed in 2009, was to create &quot;200 high quality jobs&quot;. The second Google campus, on Bunge Avenue, had an open house in October 2013, employing 50 people who are &quot;installing and upgrading Google servers and providing maintenance on equipment&quot;. In March 2014, a third phase, the Southlands expansion, was announced, creating 35 additional jobs and bringing Google&#x27;s investment up to $1.5 billion, the largest private investment in Iowa&#x27;s history to date. The state increased its tax abatement of sales and use tax for Google from $9.6 million to $16.8 million. Google stated it created 130 jobs and as of June 2016 &quot;over 300 jobs&quot; on site. In particular, the server farms are backing the entire &quot;us-central1&quot; region of the Google Cloud Platform.

==Arts and culture==
Council Bluffs is the location of the Pottawattamie County &quot;Squirrel Cage&quot; Jail, in use from 1885 until 1969, which is one of three remaining examples of a Rotary Jail. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was built as a rotary jail with pie-shaped cells on a turntable. To access individual cells, the jailer turned a crank to rotate the cylinder until the desired cell lined up with a fixed opening on each floor. According to the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County, the Squirrel Cage Jail is the only three-story rotary jail constructed. Although the rotary mechanism was disabled in 1960, the building remained the county jail for another 9 years. Similar, smaller examples of the concept can be seen in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Gallatin, Missouri.

The city&#x27;s strong ties to the railroad industry are commemorated by three local museums. The Union Pacific Museum is located in the former Council Bluffs Free Public Library (a Carnegie library), at Pearl Street and Willow Avenue; the Grenville Dodge Home is on Third Street; and the RailsWest Railroad Museum is at South Main Street and Sixteenth Avenue. RailsWest is housed in an 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad passenger depot later shared with the Milwaukee Road, which was used by the &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot;, the &quot;Arrow&quot;, and the &quot;Midwest Hiawatha&quot;. RailsWest features an outdoor display of historic train cars, including a Railway Post Office car, two steam locomotives, two cabooses, a Burlington Lounge car, and a 1953 switcher produced by the Plymouth Locomotive Works.

The Iowa West Foundation, the charitable wing of the local gambling industry, funded a public art planning process for Council Bluffs in 2004 which emphasized a 2015 goal for the city to become &quot;a prosperous urban area known for its cultural enlightenment and public art collection.&quot; To this end the city renovated Bayliss Park in downtown, which was re-dedicated in early 2007 with a new fountain dubbed Wellspring. Its performance pavilion, known as Oculus, was designed by sculptor Brower Hatcher. This was the first installation of the Iowa West Public Art, a foundation established during the Public Art Master Planning process. The Iowa West Foundation then established IWPA along with a public art website. 

In 2008 a -tall Molecule Man sculpture by Jonathan Borofsky was installed at the Mid-America Center; nearby sculptures were designed by William King and Jun Kaneko. Albert Paley designed elements of the nearby South 24th Street bridge at Exit 1B of the combined Interstate 29 and Interstate 80 at Council Bluffs and Ed Carpenter designed Gateway for the West Broadway viaduct. Artist Dan Corson and the Big Mo by Mark di Suvero are featured at Tom Hanfan&#x27;s River&#x27;s Edge Park along the banks of the Missouri River.

Council Bluffs is also home to the Chanticleer Community Theater, TVI Filtration Corporation (a major supplier of discount automotive products), and Hamilton College (Iowa) which is now part of Kaplan University – Council Bluffs.

The black squirrel is the city&#x27;s mascot. John James Audubon wrote about these squirrels in 1843, along the Missouri River at Council Bluffs.

For one week in late July/early August, the annual Pottawattamie County Fair is held at Westfair grounds. There are carnival rides, concerts, gun shows, tractor races, and a queen contest.

==Sports==
The Iowa Blackhawks (later known as the Council Bluffs Express) of the American Professional Football League played at the Mid-America Center from 2004 until 2012. The Mid-America Center was also home to the Omaha Lancers from 2002 until 2008. 
Iowa Rampage Arena Football to kick-off in 2024 with relaunch of Arena Football League 

Council Bluffs hosted two minor league baseball teams. The Council Bluffs Rails played in 1935 and were preceded by the 1903 Council Bluffs Bluffers. The Bluffers played as members of the Class D level Iowa-South Dakota League in 1903 and the 1935 Rails were members of the Class A level Western League. The teams hosted minor league home games at Broadway Park in 1935 and the Lake Manawa Ballpark in 1903.

==Education==
Public education in the city of Council Bluffs is provided by two school districts: Council Bluffs Community School District and Lewis Central Community School District. Most of the city is located within the Council Bluffs Community School District which operates these public schools: 10 elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools (Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson), Tucker Career &amp; College Center, Anne E. Nelson Early Learning Center, and Kanesville Alternative Learning Center. As of the 2008–2009 school year, the district had a total enrollment of 9,246. The Lewis Central Community School District (one high school, one middle school, and two elementary schools) serves the southern portion of Council Bluffs and enrolled 3,047 students as of the 2008–2009 school year.

There are several private schools in Council Bluffs including Community Christian School, Heartland Christian School, Liberty Christian School, Saint Albert Catholic Schools (of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines), and Trinity Lutheran Interparish School.

The Iowa School for the Deaf moved to the south edge of Council Bluffs in 1870 along what is now Iowa Highway 92. It is open to all students in both Iowa and Nebraska who are younger than 21 and whose hearing loss places them at a disadvantage in the public schools.

Iowa Western Community College is located on the eastern edge of Council Bluffs near the intersection of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 6 and is the home of the radio station KIWR. Buena Vista University also has a location in Council Bluffs and partners with Iowa Western Community College to offer bachelor&#x27;s degree completion programs to IWCC graduates.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The city is well served by Interstate 80, Interstate 29, U.S. Route 6, and the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway. The Union Pacific, BNSF, Iowa Interstate, and Canadian National Railroads all connect in Council Bluffs and carry important freight traffic. MidAmerican Energy has a large coal-burning power plant near the southern city limits.

An extensive system of off-street paved trails aids in walking and bicycling around the city, including the currently under construction FIRST AVE trail spanning the city&#x27;s West End. Walking, bicycling, and other active transportation access across the Missouri River into Omaha currently exists at two points: the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge and a trail connection across the South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge on US-275.
Transit access around Council Bluffs is available via two Metro bus lines, the blue and yellow routes. Each route originates in downtown Omaha and provides access across the Missouri River as well as between various points around Council Bluffs. According to city plans it is possible that a streetcar line may be constructed along the First Avenue right-of-way. The streetcar line would terminate near Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital in the east and in downtown Omaha in the west; it would have a connection to the planned Omaha Streetcar. In order to facilitate streetcar access across the Missouri River, plans call for a new multimodal bridge to be constructed just south of the existing I-480 bridge. The multimodal bridge would be built approximately where the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge once stood and carry multimodal traffic between Council Bluffs and Omaha.

Commercial air travel for Council Bluffs occurs primarily out of Omaha&#x27;s Eppley Airfield. The Council Bluffs Municipal Airport also serves the general aviation needs of Council Bluffs and surrounding areas.

<text>Dubuque (, ) is a city in and the county seat of Dubuque County, Iowa, United States, located along the Mississippi River. At the time of the 2020 United States census, the population of Dubuque was 59,667. The city lies at the junction of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin, a region locally known as the Tri-State Area. It serves as the main commercial, industrial, educational, and cultural center for the area. Geographically, it is part of the Driftless Area, a portion of North America that escaped all three phases of the Wisconsin Glaciation.

Dubuque is a regional tourist destination featuring the city&#x27;s unique architecture, casinos and riverside location. It is home to five institutions of higher education. While Dubuque has historically been a center of manufacturing, the local economy also includes health care, publishing, and financial service sectors.

==History==
Spain gained control of the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River following the 1763 defeat of the French; the British took over all territory to the east. The first permanent European settler in what is now Dubuque was Quebecois pioneer Julien Dubuque, who arrived in 1785. In 1788, he received permission from the Spanish government and the local Meskwaki people to mine the area&#x27;s rich lead deposits. Control of Louisiana and Dubuque&#x27;s mines shifted briefly back to France in 1800, then to the United States in 1803, following the Louisiana Purchase. The Meskwaki continued to mine with the full support of the U.S. government until 1830 when the Meskwaki were illegally pushed out of the mine region by American prospectors.

The current City of Dubuque was named after Julien Dubuque, who settled at the southern end of a large flat plain adjacent to the Mississippi River. The city was officially chartered in 1833, located in unorganized territory of the United States. The region was designated as the Iowa Territory in 1838 and was included in the newly created State of Iowa in 1846. After the lead resources were exhausted, the city became home to numerous industries. Dubuque became a center for the timber industry because of its proximity to forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and was later dominated by various mill working businesses. Also important were boat building, brewing, and later, the railroad industry. In 1874, the Diamond Jo Line moved its company headquarters to Dubuque. Diamond Jo Line established a shipyard at Eagle Point in 1878. Just two years later, the company was the largest employer in Dubuque, putting 78 people to work, 75 of whom worked at the shipyard earning their collective $800$1,000 per week in wages.

Between 1860 and 1880, Dubuque was one of the 100 largest urban areas in the United States. Iowa&#x27;s first church was built by Methodists in 1833. Since then, Iowans have followed a variety of religious traditions.

Beginning in the mid-19th century and into the early 20th century, thousands of poor German and Irish Catholic immigrants came to the city to work in the manufacturing centers. The city&#x27;s large Roman Catholic congregations led to its designation as the seat of the newly established Archdiocese of Dubuque. Numerous convents, abbeys, and other religious institutions were built. The ethnic German and Irish descendants maintain a strong Catholic presence in the city. Nicholas E. Gonner (1835–1892), a Catholic immigrant from Pfaffenthal in Luxembourg, founded the Catholic Publishing Company of Dubuque, Iowa. His son Nicholas E. Gonner Jr. (1870–1922) took over in 1892, editing two German-language weeklies, an English-language weekly, and the &quot;Daily Tribune,&quot; the only Catholic daily newspaper ever published in the United States.

Early in the 20th century, Dubuque was one of several sites of a brass era automobile company, Adams-Farwell; like most others, it folded. Subsequently, Dubuque grew significantly, and industrial activity remained its economic mainstay until the 1980s. Tommy John, who pitched for the Dubuque Packers in 1961, recalled that the town was &quot;about 98 percent Catholic&quot; back then. &quot;Dubuque was the epitome of small-town life,&quot; John wrote. &quot;The people were friendly, everyone knew everybody else, and there wasn&#x27;t a thing to do: no excitement, few restaurants or recreation choices, a decaying slum section. So we spent as much time as we could at the ball park. At certain times of the year, the fish flies fester in hordes like a biblical plague.&quot;

A series of changes in manufacturing and the onset of the Farm Crisis in the 1980s led to a large decline in the sector and the city&#x27;s economy as a whole. In the 1990s, the economy diversified rapidly, shifting away from heavy industry. Tourism, technology, and publishing are now among the largest and fastest-growing businesses. Dubuque attracts over 2 million tourists annually. The city has encouraged the development of the America&#x27;s River Project&#x27;s tourist attractions in the Port of Dubuque, the expansion of the city&#x27;s colleges, and the continued growth of shopping centers, such as Kennedy Mall.

Since its founding, Dubuque has had, and continues to have, a strong religious tradition. Local Catholic settlers established what would become the first Christian church in Iowa, St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral, in 1833.

The City of Dubuque operates on the council-manager form of government, employing a full-time city manager and part-time city council. The city manager, Michael C. Van Milligen, runs the day-to-day operations of the city, and serves as the city&#x27;s executive leader.

Dubuque has been using its city-owned Community Broadband Network to become a smart city. In 2014, city government officials created four apps to monitor data related to water use, electricity use, transit patterns, and waste recycling efforts. The City of Dubuque Sustainability Coordinator, Cori Burbach, stated this was &quot;for educating citizens and implementing behavior changes that they control based on the data these applications provide&quot;. However, Dubuque has been reaching the limits of its network and lack sufficient services from giant providers.

Policy and financial decisions are made by the city council, which serves as the city&#x27;s legislative body. The council comprises the mayor, Brad Cavanaugh, who serves as its chairman, 4 ward-elected members, and 2 at-large members. The city council members are: Susan R. Farber (Ward 1), Laura Roussell (Ward 2), Danny Sprank (Ward 3), Katy Wethal (Ward 4), Ric W. Jones (at-large), and David T. Resnick (at-large). The city council meets at 6 P.M. on the first and third Mondays of every month in the council chamber of the Historic Federal Building. The city is divided into 4 electoral wards and 21 precincts, as stated in Chapter 17 of the Dubuque City Code.

In the 89th Iowa General Assembly, Dubuque is represented by Senators Pam Jochum (D) for Senate District 29 and Carrie Koelker (R) for Senate District 50 in the Iowa Senate, and Representatives Charles Isenhart (D) for House District 100, Shannon Lundgren (R) for House District 57, and Lindsay James (D) for House District 99 in the Iowa House of Representatives.

At the federal level in the 117th Congress, it is within Iowa&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Ashley Hinson (R) in the U.S. House of Representatives. Dubuque, and all of Iowa are represented by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R) and Joni Ernst (R).

===Political climate===
For most of its history, Dubuque has been mostly Democratic due to the large numbers of working-class people and Catholics living in the city. At times, Dubuque was called &quot;The State of Dubuque&quot; because the political climate in Dubuque was very different from the rest of Iowa.

However, at the turn of the twentieth century, the United States Congress was led by two Dubuque Republicans. Representative David B. Henderson ascended to Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1899, at the same time Senator William B. Allison served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. Dubuque has experienced a shift toward the Republican party in the 2010s.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
Dubuque is served by the Dubuque Community School District, which covers roughly the eastern half of Dubuque County and enrolled 10,735 students in 20 school buildings in 2006. The district has 13 elementary schools, three middle schools, three high schools, and one preschool complex. Public high schools in Dubuque include Dubuque Senior High School and Hempstead High School.

The city has a large number of students who attend private schools. All Catholic schools are run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque. The Archdiocese oversees the Holy Family Catholic Schools, which operates 11 schools in the city, including nine early childhood programs, four elementary schools (one of which is a Spanish immersion program), one middle school, and one high school, Wahlert Catholic High School. , Holy Family Catholic Schools enrolled 1,954 students in grades K-12. Dubuque also had one Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod affiliated elementary school, the Dubuque Lutheran School. It closed in 2019.

===Higher education===
Dubuque is home to several higher education institutions. Loras College and Clarke University are two four-year colleges operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque. Protestant colleges in the city include the University of Dubuque, which is associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), and Emmaus University, connected with the Plymouth Brethren movement.

Three theological seminaries operate in the city: St. Pius X Seminary (Roman Catholic, associated with Loras College), the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary (Presbyterian), and Wartburg Theological Seminary (Lutheran).

Other post-secondary schools in the area include Northeast Iowa Community College, which operates its largest campus in nearby Peosta, Iowa and has a satellite campus in Dubuque; the Roman Catholic Divine Word College missions seminary in nearby Epworth, Iowa; and Capri Cosmetology College in Dubuque.

==Media==
===Print===
The &quot;Telegraph Herald&quot;, a local newspaper, had a daily circulation of nearly 31,000 as of January 27, 2007. Other papers and journals operating in the city include &quot;Tri-State Business Times&quot; (monthly business paper), &quot;365ink Magazine&quot; (biweekly alt/cultural magazine), &quot;Julien&#x27;s Journal&quot; (monthly lifestyle magazine), the &quot;Dubuque Advertiser&quot; (advertisement paper), and the &quot;Tri-States Sports Look&quot; (local sports publication).

Several other airlines, mostly regional carriers, have historically served DBQ including Northwest Airlink, American Eagle and several smaller regional carriers. DBQ also serves general aviation and cargo traffic for the Dubuque area.

====Highways====
Dubuque is served by four U.S. Highways (20, 151, 61 and 52) and one state highway (3). Highway 20 going east, connects into Illinois over the Julien Dubuque Bridge.

Highway 151 connects Dubuque with Madison, Wisconsin (via the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge) to the northeast and Cedar Rapids to the southwest.

Iowa State Highway 3 begins in Dubuque, connecting the city with central and western Iowa. The four-lane divided Northwest Arterial (former Iowa State Highway 32) acts as a beltway for parts of the North End and West Side, connecting Highways 3 and 20. Less than from the junction of the Northwest Arterial and Highway 20, the Southwest Arterial is a expressway carrying Highway 52 southeast from Highway 20 to Highways 151 and 61 near Key West and the Dubuque Regional Airport.

====Public transit====

In Dubuque, public transportation is provided by the city transit division The Jule. The Jule operates multiple bus routes and on-demand paratransit Minibus service throughout the city.

These loops serve neighborhoods, shopping areas, medical offices, and industrial parks and provide connections to other areas of the city with the 15-minute cross-town Express route. The system&#x27;s three major transfer stations are Downtown Intermodal (9th &amp; Elm St), Midtown (North Grandview &amp; University Avenues), and the West End (Kennedy Circle/John F. Kennedy Road).

<text>The University of Northern Iowa (UNI) is a public university in Cedar Falls, Iowa, United States. UNI offers more than 90 majors across five colleges. The fall 2023 total enrollment was 9,021 students.

The university was initially founded in 1876 as the &quot;Iowa State Normal School,&quot; with a purpose of training school teachers and educators. The University of Northern Iowa is one of three public universities in Iowa, all of which are governed by the Iowa Board of Regents.

==History==
The University of Northern Iowa was founded as a result of two influential forces of the nineteenth century. First, Iowa wanted to care for orphans of its Civil War veterans, and secondly, Iowa needed a public teacher training institution. In 1876, when Iowa no longer needed an orphan home, legislators Edward G. Miller and H. C. Hemenway started the Iowa State Normal School.

The school&#x27;s first building opened in 1867 and was known as Central Hall. The building contained classrooms, common areas, and a living facility for most of the students. It was also a home to the college&#x27;s first principal, James Cleland Gilchrist. The building was the heart and soul of the school, allowing students to study courses of two-year, three-year, and four-year degrees. In 1965, a fire destroyed Central Hall, and school faculty and Cedar Falls citizens donated over $5,000 to start building Gilchrist Hall.

The school has been known under the following names:
*Iowa State Normal School, 1876–1909
*Iowa State Teachers College, 1909–1961
*State College of Iowa, 1961–1967
*University of Northern Iowa, 1967–present
From 2014 through 2018 the UNI hosted the &quot;Midwest Summer Institute: Inclusion and Communication for All&quot;, a two-day conference on facilitated communication sponsored by the Inclusion Connection and Syracuse University&#x27;s Institute on Communication and Inclusion. Facilitated Communication is a discredited practice, and in 2018 UNI decided to discontinue the conference at the urging of multiple nationwide academics.

=== Presidents ===

Since its founding, the university has had eleven presidents.

* James Cleland Gilchrist, 1876–1886
* Homer Horatio Seerley, 1886–1928
* Orval Ray Latham, 1928–1940
* Malcolm Poyer Price, 1940–1950
* James William Maucker, 1950–1970
* John Joseph Kamerick, 1970–1983
* Constantine William Curris, 1983–1995
* Robert D. Koob, 1995–2006
* Benjamin J. Allen, 2006–2013
* William Ruud, 2013–2016
* Mark Nook, 2017–present

==Academics==
University of Northern Iowa colleges include:
* Wilson College of Business
* Education
* Humanities, Arts and Sciences
* Social and Behavioral Sciences
* Graduate College

===Study Abroad Center===
UNI provides an opportunity for the students to study in 25+ countries and select from over 40 programs. It is also available to all students attending the university. The mission of the Study Abroad Center at the University of Northern Iowa is to provide service and leadership in international education to UNI students, faculty, staff, the community and the State of Iowa.

===Culture and Intensive English Program===
The Culture and Intensive English Program (CIEP) is an intensive program in English for non-native speakers. It is designed to prepare students for academic work at the undergraduate or graduate degree level. University of Northern Iowa students are also encouraged to participate in the Conversation Partner Program to help foreign students with their English ability and foster cross-cultural relationships while gaining mutual understanding.

===North American Review===

The university is the publisher of &quot;The North American Review&quot; (called the NAR), a celebrated literary magazine that began originally in Boston in 1815. Its past editors have included James Russell Lowell, Charles Eliot Norton, and Henry Adams; while among its past contributors are Mark Twain, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Walt Whitman, Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates, Guy Davenport and Margaret Atwood. In 1968, when the magazine was purchased by UNI, Robley Wilson was appointed editor, a position he continued in until his retirement in 2000. The current editors are Rachel Morgan, Jeremy Schraffenberger, Grant Tracey, and Brooke Wonders.

===Teaching and Research Greenhouse===
The University of Northern Iowa Teaching and Research Greenhouse is a greenhouse complex incorporating botanical gardens for research and education. It is located on the campus of the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

The greenhouse contains plants from many ecotypes, including 250 tropical plants, two live birds, an extensive collection of arid climate plants, and the Aquatic Learning Center.

== Athletics ==

The school&#x27;s mascot is the Panther, represented as a sibling pair of mascots known as TC (The Cat) and his sister TK. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I (I-FCS for football) in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) for most other sports, and the Big 12 Conference for wrestling. The major arena on campus is the UNI-Dome, currently the home of the football team. The Dome also serves as a venue for many local concerts, high school football playoffs, trade shows, and other events. In 2006, the university opened a new arena, the McLeod Center, to serve as the home for several athletic programs that had previously played in the UNI-Dome, including the volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams.

The UNI athletics program has enjoyed recent success, with the men&#x27;s basketball team competing in the NCAA tournament three consecutive times in 2004, 2005, 2006, again in 2009 and 2010 and in 2015 and 2016. On March 20, 2010, the men&#x27;s basketball team defeated the heavily favored, top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks to advance to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. It was the school&#x27;s first appearance in the Sweet Sixteen. The Jayhawks were favored to win the NCAA championship. Their Cinderella potential ended with a loss to Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen, 59–52. The win over Kansas earned them the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Upset.
Jacqui Kalin helped lead the women&#x27;s basketball team to consecutive NCAA Tournament berths, as the team won back-to-back MVC Tournament titles. In 2010-11 she was named the Jackie Stiles MVC Player of the Year. In 2012-13 she led the league in scoring (19.5 ppg; a school record), had the fourth-highest season free throw percentage in NCAA Division 1 history-and the highest of any senior (95.5%), and was again named the Jackie Stiles MVC Player of the Year. For her career Kalin was first all-time at UNI in scoring (2,081), 3-point field goals made (265), free throws made (484), and free throw percentage (.920) the NCAA Division 1 career record.

The football team has been ranked in the I-AA (FCS) top 25 almost every year for the last two decades. The team appeared in the I-AA championship game in 2005, only to lose a close game to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. During 2007, the team was ranked #1 in the country by the TSN FCS poll for several weeks. The football team went undefeated in 2007 with an 11–0 record, a first for any school in the 23-year history of the Gateway conference. In 2001 and 2002 the volleyball team reached the NCAA Sweet 16 round, and in 2006 made it to the second round, and has competed in the tournament numerous times. The track team is also very successful (usually ranked in the top 25), as are the wrestling and volleyball teams.

The University of Northern Iowa wrestling team won the NCAA Division I national championship as ISTC in 1949 and NCAA Division II national championships in 1975 and 1978. They competed in the Western Wrestling Conference until 2012, when UNI became an associate member of the Mid-American Conference since the MVC is a non-wrestling conference. In 2017, UNI wrestling joined the Big 12 Conference. In 1977 the women&#x27;s softball team won the AIAW national championship.

Bryce Paup won the Defensive Player of Year Award by the Associated Press in 1995. In 1999 and 2001, UNI alumnus Kurt Warner was named NFL MVP by the AP.

During the 2014–2015 season, the men&#x27;s basketball team ended the regular season ranked #11 by the AP Poll, the highest ranking in school history, and #9 by USA Today.

<text>Remembrance Day (also known as Poppy Day owing to the tradition of wearing a remembrance poppy) is a memorial day observed in Commonwealth member states since the end of the First World War to honour armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. The day is also marked by war remembrances in several other non-Commonwealth countries. In most countries, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November to recall the end of First World War hostilities. Hostilities ended &quot;at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month&quot; of 1918, in accordance with the armistice signed by representatives of Germany and the Entente between 5:12 and 5:20 that morning. (&quot;At the 11th hour&quot; refers to the &quot;passing&quot; of the 11th hour, or 11:00 am.) The First World War formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919.

The tradition of Remembrance Day evolved out of Armistice Day. The initial Armistice Day was observed at Buckingham Palace, commencing with King George V hosting a &quot;Banquet in Honour of the President of the French Republic&quot; during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day was subsequently held on the grounds of Buckingham Palace the following morning. During the Second World War, many countries changed the name of the holiday. Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations adopted Remembrance Day, while the US chose Veterans Day.

==Observance in the Commonwealth==
The common British, Canadian, South African, and ANZAC tradition includes a one or two-minute silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00 am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when the armistice became effective.

The Service of Remembrance in many Commonwealth countries generally includes the sounding of the &quot;Last Post&quot;, followed by the period of silence, followed by the sounding of &quot;Reveille&quot; or sometimes just &quot;The Rouse&quot;. The Service of Remembrance is finished by a recitation of the &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot;. The &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;, &quot;O Valiant Hearts&quot;, &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot; are often played during the service. Services also include wreaths laid to honour the fallen, blessings, and national anthems.

The central ritual at cenotaphs throughout the Commonwealth is a stylised night vigil. &quot;The Last Post&quot; was the common bugle call at the close of the military day, and &quot;The Rouse&quot; was the first call of the morning. For military purposes, the traditional night vigil over the slain was not just to ensure they were indeed dead and not unconscious or in a coma, but also to guard them from being mutilated or despoiled by the enemy, or dragged off by scavengers. This makes the ritual more than just an act of remembrance but also a pledge to guard the honour of war dead. The act is enhanced by the use of dedicated cenotaphs (literally Greek for &quot;empty tomb&quot;) and the laying of wreaths—the traditional means of signalling high honours in ancient Greece and Rome.

===Australia===

In Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle. Some institutions observe two-minutes&#x27; silence at 11 am through a program named Read 2 Remember, children read the &quot;Pledge of Remembrance&quot; by Rupert McCall, and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times. Services are held at 11 am at war memorials and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the &quot;Last Post&quot; is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed. Some institutions observe this solemn occasion at 1111h on the day, adding two more soldiers to the ranks. When Remembrance Day falls on a normal working day in Melbourne and other major cities, buglers from the Australian Defence Force often play the &quot;Last Post&quot; at major street corners in the CBD. While this occurs, the majority of passers-by stop and observe a moment of silence while waiting for the bugler to finish the recital.

====History in Australia====

In interwar Australia, Remembrance Day (then often referred to as Armistice Day) was a popular public commemoration. But from 1946 to the 1970s, Australians observed Remembrance Sunday following the British pattern. It is only in the 1980s and 1990s that Remembrance Day was once again systematically observed on 11 November. The resurgence of Remembrance Day became official on 30 October 1997, when the Governor-General, under the Howard government, proclaimed that &quot;(a) 11 November in each year shall be known and observed as Remembrance Day; and (b) all Australians are urged to observe, unless impractical, a minute&#x27;s silence at 11:00 on Remembrance Day each year&quot;.

In recent decades, Remembrance Day has been largely eclipsed as the national day of war commemoration by ANZAC Day (25 April), which is a public holiday in all states. Attendance at Anzac Day services boomed, while that of Remembrance Day services continued to decline. Historian Romain Fathi explains, &quot;In Australia, ANZAC Day has addressed the question of the meaning of the war far better than Remembrance Day or Remembrance Sunday. It can acknowledge loss and suffering with a nod to the sacred, while simultaneously representing imagined distinct national values such as mateship, laconic humour and stoicism. This capacity to connect the national community to the numinous explains Anzac Day&#x27;s primacy over Remembrance Day.&quot;

===Barbados===

In Barbados, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. It is recognised as 11 November, but the parade and ceremonial events are carried out on Remembrance Sunday.
The day is commemorated to recognise the Barbadian soldiers who died fighting in the First and Second World Wars. The parade is held at National Heroes&#x27; Square, where an interdenominational service is held. The Governor-General and Barbadian Prime Minister are among those who attend, along with other government dignitaries and the heads of the police and military forces. During the main ceremony a gun salute, wreaths, and prayers are also performed at the war memorial Cenotaph at the heart of Heroes&#x27; Square in Bridgetown.

===Belize===
In Belize, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November. It is not a public holiday.

===Bermuda===
In the British Overseas Territory and former Imperial fortress of Bermuda, which sent the first colonial volunteer unit to the Western Front in 1915, and which had more people per capita in uniform during the Second World War than any other part of the Empire, Remembrance Day is still an important holiday. The parade in Hamilton had historically been a large and colourful one, as contingents from the Royal Navy, British Regular Army and Territorial Army units of the Bermuda Garrison, the Canadian Forces, the US Army, Air Force, and Navy, and various cadet corps and other services all at one time or another marched with the veterans. Since the closing of British, Canadian, and American bases in 1995, the parade has barely grown smaller. In addition to the ceremony held in the City of Hamilton on Remembrance Day itself, marching to the Cenotaph (a smaller replica of the one in London), where wreaths are laid and orations made, the Royal Navy and the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps held a parade the same day at the memorial in Hamilton, and a smaller military parade is also held in St. George&#x27;s on the nearest Sunday to Remembrance Day before the Royal Garrison Artillery memorial in the King&#x27;s Square.

===Canada===
Veterans Affairs Canada states that Remembrance Day () is intended for &quot;remembrance for the men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country during times of war, conflict and peace&quot;; particularly the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, and all conflicts since then in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces have participated. The department runs a program called Canada Remembers, with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, &quot;come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict, and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country.&quot;

Remembrance Day is a statutory holiday for federally regulated employees and a provincial and territorial statutory holiday in six of the 10 provinces and all three territories. Nova Scotia recognizes the day under separate legislation. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec are the only three provinces where the day is not a statutory holiday. The Royal Canadian Legion is officially against making the day a national statutory holiday, in part because its leadership believes the time free from work or school would eventually overtake the memorial purpose of the occasion, whereas, having schools in regular session on that day would be an opportunity for children to be taught the day&#x27;s true significance in a mandatory fashion. In a more informal manner, there has been opinion voiced against the trend of Christmas creep, so that the conclusion of Remembrance Day should be the earliest acceptable time in which to mark the beginning of the Christmas holidays.

====History in Canada====
Canadians began to commemorate their veterans and war dead as early as 1890, when Decoration Day began to be observed on 2 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866. A further observance was, from 1900 to 1918, held on 27 February to mark the Canadian victory over the Boers at the Battle of Paardeberg.
The first Armistice Day commemoration was in 1919, when King George V called on all countries in the British Empire to observe it. It was later placed on a statutory footing in 1921, after the Parliament of Canada provided that Thanksgiving and Armistice Day would both be held on the Monday of the week in which 11 November fell. Charles Dickie, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Nanaimo, campaigned to change the name from Armistice Day to Remembrance Day, which was approved in 1931, when Parliament accordingly amended the act, with its observance fixed on 11 November.

Several other days of remembrance for veterans were also created, including the National Aboriginal Veterans Day, inaugurated in 1994 to recognise the contribution of Aboriginal soldiers. In 2001, Merchant Navy Remembrance Day was created by the Canadian Parliament, designating 3 September as a day to recognise the contributions and sacrifice of Canadian merchant mariners.

====Ceremonies====
The national ceremonies organized by the federal government is held at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. These are presided over by the governor general of Canada (who acts as commander-in-chief in the monarch&#x27;s name) and attended by the prime minister, other dignitaries, the Silver Cross mother, and public observers. Occasionally, a member of the Canadian royal family may also be present (such as Prince Charles in 2009 and Princess Anne in 2014).

English and French languages were used throughout the ceremony because Ottawa is officially bilingual, and the Ottawa-Gatineau census metropolitan area is a mix of anglophones and francophones.

Before the start of the event, four sentries and three sentinels (two flag sentinels and one nursing sister) are posted at the foot of the cenotaph. The commemoration then typically begins with the tolling of the carillon in the Peace Tower, during which current members of the Armed Forces arrive at Confederation Square, followed by the Ottawa diplomatic corps, ministers of the Crown, special guests, the RCL, the royal party (if present), and the viceregal party. The arrival of the governor general is announced by a trumpeter sounding the &quot;Alert&quot;, whereupon the viceroy is met by the dominion president of the RCL and escorted to a dais to receive the &quot;Vice Regal Salute&quot;, after which the national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;, is played and sung in English and French by the Ottawa Children&#x27;s Choir, accompanied by the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces

The moment of remembrance begins with the bugling of &quot;Last Post&quot;, immediately before 11:00 am, when the 21-gun salute fires and the bells of the Peace Tower toll the hour. Two minutes pass between the first and second volleys of the gun salute to maintain silence for that period, as instituted across the Commonwealth by King George V. The cessation of the two minutes of silence is cued by the playing of a lament, the bugling of &quot;The Rouse&quot;, and the reading of the &quot;Act of Remembrance&quot;. A flypast of Royal Canadian Air Force craft then occurs, upon the completion of which a choir sings &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.
The various parties then lay their wreaths at the base of the memorial. By tradition, the Governor General always lays the first wreath followed by the Silver Cross mother (a recent recipient of the Memorial Cross) on behalf of all mothers whose children died in conflicts in which Canada participated. The viceregal and royal group return to the dais to receive the playing of the Canadian royal anthem, &quot;God Save the King&quot;, sung in French and English, prior to the assembled armed forces personnel and veterans performing a march past in front of the viceroy and any royal guest, bringing about the end of the official ceremonies. A tradition of paying a more personal tribute has emerged since the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was installed at the Canadian National War Memorial in 2000: after the official ceremony, the general public place their poppies atop the tomb.

Similar ceremonies take place in provincial capitals across the country, officiated by the relevant lieutenant governor, as well as in other cities, towns, and even hotels or corporate headquarters. Schools will usually hold special assemblies for the first half of the day or on the school day prior, with various presentations concerning the remembrance of the war dead. The ceremony participants include veterans, current members of the Canadian forces, and sea, army, and air cadet units.

===India===

In India, the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments. There are memorial services in some churches such as St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral and St. John&#x27;s Church in Bangalore. At Kohima and Imphal in the remote hillsides of Northeast India, services of remembrance supported by the Indian Army are observed at Kohima and Imphal War Cemeteries (maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The day is also marked at the Delhi War Cemetery. In other places in India this event is not observed. In 2013, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked the day in Mumbai&#x27;s St. John the Evangelist Church.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the Ex-servicemen of the First and the Second World Wars. The KAFOCA and Kenyan government recognise Remembrance Day.

===New Zealand===

Armistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day. As in other countries, New Zealand&#x27;s Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II. However, by the mid-1950s, the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans&#x27; organisations.

As a result, New Zealand&#x27;s national day of remembrance is Anzac Day, 25 April. Poppy Day&quot; usually occurs on the Friday before Anzac Day. The reason for New Zealand having their remembrance on Anzac Day happened in 1921. The paper Poppies for Armistice that year arrived by ship too late for 11 November 1921, so an RSA branch distributed them at the next commemoration date (25 April 1922, which happened to be Anzac Day) and that date stuck as the new Poppy Day in New Zealand.

===Saint Lucia===

Like Barbados, Saint Lucia does not recognise Remembrance Day as a public holiday. Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday. The parade is held at the central square, namely the Derek Walcott Square, where the Cenotaph is located. There, members of the Royal St Lucia Police Force and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St. Lucian men and women who fought in the war.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the &quot;Last Post&quot; is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence. Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the Cenotaph in Cape Town, and in Pretoria at the Voortrekker Monument cenotaph and the War Memorial at the Union Buildings. Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the Border War. In addition, the South African Legion of Military Veterans holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans.

===United Kingdom===

Wreath-laying ceremonies, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion, are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11 am on 11 November, with two minutes of silence observed; a custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the early 1990s. The silence is also broadcast as a special programme on BBC with a voice over usually saying &quot;This is BBC One. Now on the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month. The traditional two-minute silence for Armistice Day.&quot; The programme starts with a close up of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and then the programme shows different parts of the world observing the silence. The programme ends with a bugler sounding &quot;The Rouse&quot; and then normal programming is resumed.

Many employers and businesses invite their staff and customers to observe the two minutes&#x27; silence at 11:00 am. The beginning and end of the two minutes&#x27; silence is often marked in large towns and cities by the firing of field artillery gun, often provided by the local Royal Artillery battery.

The first two-minute silence held in London (11 November 1919) was reported in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; on 12 November 1919:

The first stroke of eleven produced a magical effect.

The tram cars glided into stillness, motors ceased to cough and fume, and stopped dead, and the mighty-limbed dray horses hunched back upon their loads and stopped also, seeming to do it of their own volition.

Someone took off his hat, and with a nervous hesitancy the rest of the men bowed their heads also. Here and there an old soldier could be detected slipping unconsciously into the posture of &#x27;attention&#x27;. An elderly woman, not far away, wiped her eyes, and the man beside her looked white and stern. Everyone stood very still ... The hush deepened. It had spread over the whole city and become so pronounced as to impress one with a sense of audibility. It was a silence which was almost pain ... And the spirit of memory brooded over it all.

====Remembrance Sunday====
In the United Kingdom, the main observance is Remembrance Sunday, held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November. There is a National Service of Remembrance in London, as well as other services and ceremonies in the regions. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys&#x27; Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army. A minute&#x27;s or two minutes&#x27; silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.

British diplomatic missions also organise services on Remembrance Sunday. Services organised by British missions in Israel include one at the Jerusalem British War Cemetery, organised by the British Consul in Jerusalem; and another at Ramleh Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, organised by the British embassy in Tel Aviv. The Ramleh ceremony is the larger and is also attended by veterans of the Second World War.

====Commemorative coins and exhibitions====
In 2014, the Royal Mint issued a colour-printed Alderney £5 coin, designed by engraver Laura Clancy, to commemorate Remembrance Day.

Also in 2014, to commemorate the outbreak of World War I a huge display called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, consisting of 888,246 ceramic poppies was installed in the moat of the Tower of London, each poppy representing a British Empire fatality.

On 5 November 2018 and set to continue for 4 months, about 10,000 torches were lit at the foot of the Tower&#x27;s walls, in its dry moat to mark the centenary of the end of the World War I.

====Northern Ireland====

Remembrance Day is officially observed in Northern Ireland in the same way as in the rest of United Kingdom, although it tends to be associated more with the unionist community. Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organised by the Royal British Legion. This is mainly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The bombing was widely condemned and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years. The Republic of Ireland has a National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who have died in war.

==Related observances elsewhere==
Alongside Commonwealth countries, several other countries also commemorate their war dead on 11 November, the anniversary of the Armistice of Compiègne. Several other countries observe the anniversary of other notable events in World War I to commemorate the war dead from that conflict, such as the date of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which went into effect on 4 November.

===Belgium and France===

Remembrance Day (11 November) is a national holiday in France and Belgium. It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, which took effect at 11:00 am—the &quot;eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.&quot; Armistice Day is one of the most important military commemorations in France, since it was a major French victory, and the French paid a heavy price in blood to achieve it. The First World War was considered in France as the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot;. Almost all French villages feature memorials dedicated to those fallen during the conflict. In France the blue cornflower &quot;(Bleuet de France)&quot; is used symbolically rather than the poppy.

===Hong Kong===
Remembrance Day was formerly observed in British Hong Kong, although it has not been a public holiday since the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in July 1997.

However, members of the Hong Kong Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Association continue to organise a Remembrance Sunday multi-faith memorial service at the Cenotaph in Central, Hong Kong. The service has been attended by various government officials and the representatives of religious groups. The memorial service resembles the services performed in other Commonwealth countries. The service includes the sounding of &quot;Last Post&quot;, two minutes of silence, the sounding of &quot;Reveille&quot;, the laying of wreaths, and prayers, and ends with a recitation of the &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot;. The Hong Kong Police Band continues to perform their ceremonial duty at the service. Members of the Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps (including the Ceremonial Squadron), Hong Kong Adventure Corps, Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps and scouting organisations are also in attendance.

===Italy===

In Italy, the National Unity and Armed Forces Day is observed on 4 November to commemorate the country&#x27;s victory in World War I, and the completion of the unification of Italy. The date is the anniversary of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which effectively ended combat between the Allies of World War I and Austria-Hungary in 1918.
Since 1977, this day has not been a public holiday; now, many services are held on the first Sunday in November.

===Russia===
In Russia, the Russian Day of Remembrance of Victims of World War I is observed on 1 August to honour Russian soldiers from that conflict. The date is the anniversary of the German declaration of war on Russia in 1914, resulting in the Russian entry into World War I.

===Serbia===
Serbia has observed Armistice Day on 11 November since 2012. The statutory holiday was created to commemorate the victims of World War I. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear Natalie&#x27;s ramonda as a symbol of remembrance.

===United States===

Veterans Day is observed in the United States on 11 November and is both a federal holiday and a state holiday in all states. In the United States, and some other allied nations, 11 November was formerly known as Armistice Day; in the United States it was given its new name in 1954 at the end of the Korean War to honour all veterans. Veterans Day is observed with memorial ceremonies, salutes at military cemeteries, and parades. However, the function of the observance elsewhere is more closely matched by Memorial Day, another commemorative holiday held in May.

==Similar holidays commemorating veterans==
===Croatia===

In Croatia, Day of Remembrance for the Victims of the Homeland War and Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Vukovar and Škabrnja is a national public holiday and a non-working day in memory of all victims of the Homeland War in Croatia. The holiday is celebrated on November 18, the day of the fall of the city of Vukovar in the 1991 Homeland War, when the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and Serbian paramilitaries committed the two most massive crimes in Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence in two Croatian towns, Vukovar and Škabrnja. These events are known as Vukovar massacre and Škabrnja massacre. In memory of these events, the Croatian Parliament in 2019 adopted a new law which introduced a new holiday, a day of remembrance for all victims of the Croatian War of Independence.

=== Denmark ===
In 2009 the Danish government established Veterans&#x27; Day with early events on 5 September where past and present members of the armed forces, who have done service in armed conflict, are remembered.

===Germany===
The German national day of mourning is the secular public holiday of Volkstrauertag, which since 1952 has been observed two Sundays before the first Sunday of Advent; in practice this is the Sunday closest to 16 November. The anniversary of the Armistice itself is not observed in Germany.

===Ireland===

The Republic of Ireland holds a National Day of Commemoration in July for Irish men and women who have died in war. The national day is typically held close to the anniversary date of when the truce for the Irish War of Independence went into effect in 1921.

Remembrance Sunday itself is marked by a ceremony in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, which the President of Ireland attends, although it is not a recognised holiday in Ireland. It is estimated that some 200,000 Irish soldiers fought on the British side in the First World War with up to 35,000 killed. Additionally, some 70,000 citizens of the then independent state of Ireland served in the British armed services during the Second World War and the Roll of Honour in Trinity College Dublin lists 3617 of those who died on active service.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, Remembrance of the Dead is commemorated annually on 4 May. It is not a public holiday. Throughout the country, military personnel and civilians fallen in various conflicts since World War II are remembered. The main ceremonies are at the Waalsdorpervlakte near The Hague, the Grebbeberg near Wageningen and Dam Square in Amsterdam. Two minutes of silence are observed at 8:00 pm. Remembrance Day is followed by Liberation Day on 5 May.

===Norway===

In Norway the Norwegian Armed Forces commemorate Veteran&#x27;s Day. The Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, decreed that Veteran&#x27;s Day would be observed on the same day as Victory in Europe Day, in Norway known as &quot;Frigjøringsdagen&quot;, or Liberation Day. The ceremonies are held annually in Akershus Fortress, with the King of Norway, Harald V, present. The first of such ceremonies was held on 8 May 2011, with two Norwegian Special Forces Operators being awarded the War Cross for deployments in the recent War in Afghanistan. The ceremonies are observed with memorials and military salutes.

===Poland===

Polish Independence Day is celebrated on 11 November, and is a public holiday. Although the holiday occurs on the same day as Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth, the holiday is intended to celebrate the independence of Poland and the regaining of freedom and unity for the Polish people after 123 years of partitioning.

However, some commemorations for war dead do occur on Polish Independence Day, as the independence of Poland was caused by the end of the First World War. Major events include laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by members of the government and highest authorities, other public ceremonies and church services and school commemorations.

===Romania===

Since 2007, the War Veterans Day is commemorated on 29 April in Romania. The date was chosen as 29 April 1902 was the date when King Carol I established the title of &quot;war veteran&quot; for soldiers that fought in the War of Independence. Since 2014, Romania also commemorates Veterans&#x27; Day on 11 November, known as the Combat Theatre Veterans Day, marking both the armistice of Compiègne and the end of World War I, as well as the day when the first Romanian soldier was killed during the war in Afghanistan – 11 November 2003. Since 2015, the Romanian peony is worn on both occasions similarly to the remembrance poppy.

===South Korea===
The &quot;Turn to Busan&quot; remembrance ceremony has occurred at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery on 11 November annually since 2007. The ceremony commemorates veterans and war dead from 22 countries that fought under the United Nations Command during the Korean War. The ceremony was conceived by Vincent Courtenay, a Canadian veteran of the conflict.

===Sri Lanka===

Remembrance Day in Sri Lanka, also known as the National War heroes commemoration day, marks the capitulation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the end to the Sri Lankan Civil War on 18 May 2009. The day is a war heroes commemoration day as well as a remembrance day for civilians who died in the war from both sides. The celebrations are marked by speeches and a moment of silence. From its inception, under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2010 the day was known as Victory Day and originally included a military parade, but in 2015 the day was renamed Remembrance Day by President Maithripala Sirisena.

<text>Agnes I (c. 1090 – 29 December 1125) was Abbess of Gandersheim and Quedlinburg.

She was the second daughter of Judith of Swabia and Władysław I Herman, Duke of Poland. She was the granddaughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. Agnes became abbess at Gandersheim Abbey, the place of several famous women, such as Hroswitha of Gandersheim, recorded by Conrad Celtes.

She was Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1110 until 1125. She was excommunicated by Pope Calixtus II for her loyalty to her maternal cousin, Henry V, the King of the Romans in 1119.

She died in Quedlinburg.

The denomination 399 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Thrasybulus leads the democratic resistance to the new oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, that the victorious Spartans have imposed on Athens. He commands a small force of exiles that invades Attica and, in successive battles, defeats first a Spartan garrison and then the forces of the oligarchic government (which includes the Spartan general, Lysander) in the Battle of Munychia. The leader of the Thirty Tyrants, Critias, is killed in the battle.
* The Battle of Piraeus is fought between Athenian exiles, who have defeated the government of the Thirty Tyrants and occupied Piraeus, and a Spartan force sent to combat them. In the battle, the Spartans narrowly defeat the exiles, with both sides suffering large numbers of casualties. After the battle, the Agiad King of Sparta, Pausanias arranges a settlement between the two parties which allows the reunification of Athens and Piraeus, and the re-establishment of democratic government in Athens. The remaining oligarchic Thirty Tyrants are allowed to flee to Eleusis.
* Thrasybulus restores democratic institutions to Athens and grants amnesties to all except the oligarchic extremists. He is helped by Lysias, the Athenian orator, in arguing the case against the oligarchy.
* Andocides, Athenian orator and politician, who has been implicated in the mutilation of the Herms on the eve of the departure of the Athenian expedition against Sicily in 415 BC, returns from exile under the general amnesty.

==== China ====
* The states of Han, Zhao and Wei receive official recognition as Marquesses from the Eastern Zhou dynasty, confirming the Partition of Jin. This is one of the traditional starting points of the Warring States period.
* Marquis Wen of Wei ascends to power in Wei. He sponsors Confucianism and employs able political advisors such as Li Kui, Wu Qi, and Ximen Bao.
* Marquis Lie of Zhao becomes the ruler of the state of Zhao.
* Marquis Jing of Han ascends to power in Han.

==== Rome ====
* Rome elects eight military tribunes with consular power; Manlius Aemilius Mamercus, Lucius Valerius Potitus, Appius Claudius Crassus, Marcus Quinctilius Varus, Lucius Julius Julus, Marcus Postumius, Marcus Furius Camillus, and Marcus Postumius

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Callicratidas is appointed as the navarch of the Spartan fleet, replacing Lysander. Callicratidas assembles a fleet and sails to Methymna, on Lesbos, to which he lays siege. This move threatens the Athenian grain supply.
* Alcibiades is replaced by a board of generals. Athens sends a member of the board, Admiral Conon, to relieve the siege of Mytilene. To defend Lesbos, Conon is forced to move his numerically inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi islands near Methymna. When Callicratidas attacks him, Conon is forced back to Mytilene, where he is blockaded by Callicratidas&#x27; Spartan fleet.
* Athens wins the Battle of Arginusae, near Lesbos, and the blockade of Conon is broken. To relieve Conon, the Athenians assemble a new fleet composed largely of newly constructed ships crewed by inexperienced sailors. This inexperienced fleet is inferior to the Spartans, but its commanders employ new and unorthodox tactics, which allow the Athenians to secure a dramatic and unexpected victory. The Spartan force is soundly defeated, and Callicratidas is killed.
* Returning to Athens after the battle, Theramenes leads Athenian agitation against the eight generals who have commanded in the engagement; the six who have returned to Athens are condemned for negligence in not having picked up survivors from the ships disabled in the battle. The Athenian generals (including Pericles&#x27; son) are put to death.
* Sparta sues for peace, which the Athenian leader Cleophon rejects. Sparta yields to demands by the Persian satrap Cyrus that Lysander command a fleet in the Hellespont.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman forces begin a decade-long siege against Veii.

==== Carthage ====
* The Carthaginians again invade Sicily and attack Agrigentum (Acragas). Plague breaks out in their camp and Hannibal Mago dies. Himilco assumes command and captures Agrigentum (Acragas), Gela and Camarina. Gela is destroyed and its treasures sacked. The survivors take refuge in Syracuse. The plague is carried back to Carthage by its soldiers.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

* The Athenian general Thrasybulus recaptures Abdera and Thasos.
* The Spartan admiral Lysander refuses to be lured out of Ephesus to do battle with Alcibiades. However, while Alcibiades is away seeking supplies, the Athenian squadron is placed under the command of Antiochus, his helmsman, who is routed by the Spartan fleet (with the help of the Persians under Cyrus) in the Battle of Notium (or Ephesus).
* The defeat gives the enemies of Alcibiades an excuse to strip him of his command. He never returns again to Athens. He sails north to land he owns in the Thracian Chersonese. Except for a brief appearance at Aegospotami, Alcibiades&#x27; involvement in the Peloponnesian War is over.

<text>Immanuel ben Solomon ben Jekuthiel of Rome (Immanuel of Rome, Immanuel Romano, Manoello Giudeo) (1261 in Rome – ca. 1335 in Fermo, Italy) was a Jewish poet and writer who lived in the Papal States and composed works in Hebrew and Italian. Immanuel’s most well-known work is his Hebrew-language &quot;maqama&quot; collection, the &quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot;.

==Biography==
Immanuel was born in Rome in 1261 to the Zifroni family. His cousin, Judah ben Moses Romano, was an author and translator employed by the King of Naples, Robert of Anjou. Immanuel served as the head of correspondence for Rome’s Jewish community and likely occupied another prominent position during his lifetime. 
He left Rome in 1321, perhaps in response to a papal edict of that year which ordered the expulsion of Jews from Rome. After this, he travelled around Italy, possibly residing in Gubbio. Immanuel likely died around 1335.

==Works==
Immanuel wrote in both in Hebrew and Italian. He is the only Jewish author from this time with surviving Italian-language works. Apart from the &quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot;, his most-known composition, he authored biblical commentaries, a work of Hermeneutics, a treatise on the esoteric aspects of the Hebrew alphabet (not extant), and five poems in Italian. He is the first poet to author a sonnet in a language other than Italian.

===Mahberot Immanuel===
Immanuel is most celebrated for the &quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot;, a Hebrew collection of &quot;maqamat&quot;. The &quot;maqama&quot;, also referred to in Hebrew as &quot;mahberet&quot; is a genre of rhymed prose that originated in Arabic but flourished in both Arabic and Hebrew in medieval Iberia. In his introduction to the &quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot;, Immanuel references Judah al-Harizi’s &quot;Takhemoni&quot;. Hebrew was not a spoken language in either medieval Iberia or 14th century Italy and authors re-worked Biblical Hebrew to suit their literary exploits.

&quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot; consists of 28 chapters that each deal with various subjects and inter-weave rhymed prose and metered verse. It reflects elements of Hebrew literary tradition as well as contemporary Italian literary trends. Immanuel’s sonnets employ motifs characteristic of Dante and Cecco Angiolieri, two contemporaries of Immanuel. The beloved is referred to both as a “gazelle”, typical of Arabic and Hebrew literary heritage, and as a “lady,” Immanuel’s translation of the Italian &quot;donna&quot;.

This &quot;maqama&quot; collection includes thirty-eight sonnets. Immanuel employs a meter that combines both Hebrew quantitative meter (itself an Andalusian adaptation from Arabic) and Italian syllabic meter. These sonnets were included amongst the 28 stories of the Mahberot. For example, in the third chapter, lovers exchange sonnets with each other.

Immanuel’s &quot;Mahberot Immanuel&quot; was a highly popular work amongst Hebrew readers. It was one of the early Hebrew works printed after the advent of the printing press, particularly since Italy was a center for Hebrew printing. Further proof of its notoriety is attested by its prohibition for reading on the Sabbath according to the 16th legal code Shulchan Aruch.

Two of the most-known stories of the &quot;Mahberot&quot; Immanuel are the &quot;Scroll of Love&quot; (&quot;megilat ha-hesheq&quot;) and the &quot;Tale of Hell and Paradise&quot; (&quot;Mahberet ha-Tophet veha-&#x27;Eden&quot;).

Through a series of rhymed letters, the &quot;Scroll of Love&quot; recounts the story of Immanuel whose patron entices him to romantically pursue a nun who he has never seen. The pair exchange ten letters, four of them sonnets. Immanuel’s poetic chops convince the nun to run away with him however the tale turns sour when Immanuel discovers she is his patron’s half-sister. His patron threatens to cut off his support of Immanuel and so Immanuel is forced to end the budding romance. Heartbroken and humiliated, the woman stops eating and drinking and quickly dies. Immanuel mourns her death with a sonnet

The &quot;Tale of Hell and Paradise&quot; is an account of hell and heaven delivered by Immanuel’s literary persona who was guided by Daniel. Daniel is either a reference to the biblical prophet or to Dante. He includes a description of a sinner bound to a post crowned with thorns, possibly an allusion to Jesus. Notably, this man is being punished for his heretical and sexually improper acts. Daniel and Immanuel meet other biblical and contemporary people in hell and heaven. Scholars have pointed to similarities between this story of Immanuel’s and Dante’s Divine Comedy. Unlike Dante, Immanuel does not include purgatory which is not present in Jewish theology. Interestingly, this section is the lone story to feature exclusively rhymed prose. Immanuel does not mix in metered verse.

===Italian poems===
Immanuel is the only Jewish poet from this period with extant Italian poetry. Immanuel authored five poems in Italian – four sonnets and &quot;Bisbidis&quot;. &quot;Bisbidis&quot; was well-received and included in poetic anthologies from this time. &quot;Bisbidis&quot; has received scholarly attention for its inventiveness and rich onomatopoeia.

<doc id="60815" wikidata="Q2743766" url="?curid=60815" title="Otaniemi">
<text>Otaniemi (Finnish), or Otnäs (Swedish), is a district of Espoo, Finland. It is located near the border of Helsinki, the capital of Finland.

Otaniemi is located on the southern shore of the Laajalahti bay, next to the district of Tapiola near the border to Helsinki. It is part of the Greater Tapiola major district. Otaniemi and Tapiola are separated by the Ring I beltway. The Aalto University metro station, located in Otaniemi, was taken into use in 2017.

Otaniemi is the home of Aalto University&#x27;s campus, thus &quot;Otaniemi&quot; is often used as a synonym for Aalto. However, several research and business facilities are also located in Otaniemi. The most prominent institutions for science and engineering in Otaniemi are the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). Business is represented in the area by the business incubator Technopolis. In 2010, Otaniemi became home to Aalto University, formed from the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and the Helsinki School of Economics.

==History==
The oldest signs of human activity in the Otaniemi area can be found in front of the courtyard of what is now Jämeräntaival 1 (the so-called summer hotel): a pile of rocks dating from the Bronze Age (also called &quot;the grave of the primordial teekkari&quot;), about 3000 years old. Graves of this kind have apparently also been built as memorial for the disappeared, because no bones of the dead were found from this pile. The graves were apparently built on islets, which the Jämeräntaival hill also used to be. Ancient fishermen were active in the area because the main course of the Vantaa river used to flow into the Iso Huopalahti bay at the bottom of Laajalahti at the time.

The etymology of the name &quot;Otaniemi&quot; is not certain. It is thought to have come from the Finnish word &quot;oka&quot; meaning the point of a spear, because of the sharp shape of the peninsula, or from &quot;ohto&quot; meaning a bear, which is also supported by the names of nearby places such as Otsolahti and Karhusaari, or from the Sámi word &quot;outa&quot; meaning a forested lowland. The latter might well be the correct etymology, because in late medieval sources the name Otaniemi also appears as Outnäs, Owttenes or Outenesby (later Otnäs). Because of the diphthong &quot;ou&quot; which is rarely used in Swedish, it can be deduced that there have been southern Sámi people or Tavastians in the ara in ancient times. There are also other place names of Sámi ancestry in Espoo, the most notable of which is probably Nuuksio.

The village of Otaniemi, which according to tax documents from 1540 included three houses, originally belonged to Helsingin pitäjä, where the masters of the village often served as jurors in court sessions. During the Russo-Swedish War, on the icy cold winter of 1577 the Tatars attacked the coast of Espoo over the Gulf of Finland and burned the entire village of Otaniemi to the ground. In 1602 the lands were given to the experienced war hero, ensign Daniel Golovachev. The lord of the Turku Castle, Anders Nilsson (Hyttner) received control of the houses in Otaniemi in the 1630s and at that time they formed a unified farmstead for the first time in their history, a manor exempt from equipping cavalry.

The mayor of Helsinki Gabriel Tavast bought Otaniemi in 1653 and almost ten years later in 1662 it was transferred to the state as a manor of the crown. Otaniemi was accepted as a farmstead required to equip cavalry in 1695. The area had already become part of Espoo before this. After the Great Wrath, the lands of Otaniemi were bought by colonel Henrik Wright who had served in the army of King Charles XII of Sweden. This took place in 1734, and thus two new crofts were formed, Björnholm (Karhusaari) at the eastern shore of the Otsolahti bay and Lakör at the point of the Otaniemi peninsula. When the immense construction work of Sveaborg started, the farmstead of Otaniemi was transferred to the ownership of Karl von Numers in 1746.

The construction workers and garrison men of Sveaborg required large amounts of accommodation space, and new residential buildings were built also in the Otaniemi area. One of these so-called military crofts later developed into the Hagalund manor, which still remains at its place, near the Otaniemi water tower. In 1810 the farmstead was split in two between the grandsons of Karl von Numers. One of them received the lands of the Hagalund manor and the other received the farmstead proper with its main building. The Otaniemi manor was later sold in 1832 to banker Johan Norrman, who himself sold the entire property to beer merchant Pavel Sinebrychoff 25 years later. Sinebrychoff then expanded his property and also bought the Hagalund manor in 1859.

After the death of Pavel Sinebrychoff in 1883 the entire area was transferred to his older son Nikolai, who travelled abroad three years later to take care of his health. Control of the area was taken by Nikolai&#x27;s younger brother Paul, who had married actress Fanny Grahn. The couple moved to the Otaniemi manor in 1904. Their marriage did not result in children. Paul died in 1917 and Fanny died four years later. According to their will, the area was split in 1922. The smaller part (consisting of the current university campus and the Teekkarikylä student residence) was given to director Carl af Forselles, the husband of Fanny&#x27;s niece, and the larger part, including the Hagalund manor, was given to Fanny&#x27;s nephew, doctor and tennis player Arne Grahn, also known as the &quot;father&quot; of the district of Westend.

In 1927 the Af Forselles family sold Otaniemi to three private persons, who founded the company Ab Otnäs Gård in the area. In the 1930s ownership of the company was transferred to Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and it was renamed Otaniemi Oy. In 1949 the state of Finland bought an area of about 107 hectares north of Lehtisaarentie from the company, on the initiative of the Helsinki University of Technology. At the same time, the student body of the university acquired about two hectares of land at Otaniemi for the construction of the Teekkarikylä student residence.

The Otaniemi manor and its surroundings make an appearance in Nyrki Tapiovaara&#x27;s film &quot;The Stolen Death&quot; (1938), which contains a scene where the cossacks pursue activists and ride right into the courtyard of the manor.
As late as the 1940s, Otaniemi was part of the Hagalund manor and used as a park and farmland, from where an old linden allée survives. In 1949, the Government of Finland purchased the lands of Hagalund Manor for use as the campus of the Helsinki University of Technology and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. First to be built was the student campus of the Helsinki University of Technology, which also served as one of the Olympic Villages in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Several thousand students currently live in Otaniemi. The region has since been built up around TKK and VTT, and is at the core of Finnish scientific and technological activities.

Preparations for the move of the Helsinki University of Technology from the Hietalahdentori square in Helsinki started in the turn of the 1940s and 1950s. Construction of the Teekkarikylä student residence started in 1950. Its first houses, designed by Heikki and Kaija Siren were built in May 1952. Construction materials included bricks that had been taken from the ruins of the embassy of the Soviet Union, which had been destroyed in the bombing of Helsinki during World War II. The Otaniemi Chapel, designed by the same architects, was built 1957. As soon as the houses in Teekkarikylä were completed, they served to accommodate athletes in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Construction of Teekkarikylä and the prominent actions of the teekkari students in 1956 sped up the university&#x27;s move to Otaniemi from its old, cramped premises in the Helsinki city centre. Construction of the main building of the university started in 1961, when the old manor located at the same time, dating from the late 18th or early 19th century, was dismantled. The main building was completed in 1964 and officially inaugurated in 1966. The VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland moved from Helsinki to Otaniemi at the same time as the university.

The Teekkarikylä residence in Otaniemi also served as accommodation in the 1983 and 2005 World Championships in Athletics. Because of the 2005 championships, construction of new student apartments sped up and right before the event, six new buildings were built into Teekkarikylä at Jämeränaukio and Otaranta.

The Haukilahti gymnasium moved to Otaniemi in autumn 2016. During the autumn semester 2019 the Otaniemi gymnasium with 800 students also started operating in Otaniemi, transferred over from the Pohjois-Tapiola and Olari gymnasiums, which were discontinued.

==Architecture==
The area is architecturally unique, boasting buildings designed by leading Finnish architects including Alvar Aalto, Heikki and Kaija Siren, and Reima and Raili Pietilä. Alvar Aalto was an alumnus of the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), one of the three merger schools that later formed Aalto University, and the designer of both the city plan for the Otaniemi area and the main building of TKK.

==Demographics==
Otaniemi hosts a student community especially concentrated in the several blocks of student housing called Teekkarikylä (, literally &quot;technology students&#x27; village&quot;). Some buildings of Teekkarikylä are owned by the student association of Aalto University AYY; others are owned by HOAS. There are very few non-student apartments in Otaniemi, as almost all inhabitants are students. Due to the nature of its demographic, Otaniemi is also the poorest ZIP code area in Finland: according to an investigation made by Statistics Finland in 2015, the median income per resident was reported to be only 11 062 euros.

==Politics==
In the 2017 municipal elections, the Liberal Party won one council seat in Espoo; in there, the party&#x27;s support was greatest in Otaniemi, where it received 6.6 percent of the vote.

==Education==

On 1 January 2010, Otaniemi became home to Aalto University, formed from the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and the Helsinki School of Economics. Art and business teaching has been gradually moved from Aalto&#x27;s Helsinki locations to Otaniemi. The name is a tribute to Alvar Aalto, a prominent architect known for his achievements in technology, economics, and art.

Otaniemi is also the location of the Border and Coast Guard Academy. Until 2008, the officer school of the Police College of Finland was also located there.

==Research and development==

Otaniemi is home to many of Finland&#x27;s research and development organizations: The most prominent institutions for science and engineering in Otaniemi are the Finnish Innovation Center, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, the Micronova Center of Micro and Nanotechnology, the KCL pulp and paper research center, the CSC IT Center for Scientific Computing, the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK), and the National Bureau of Measures (MIKES). Helsinki University of Technology&#x27;s 10 national centers of excellence create most of Finland&#x27;s hi-tech patents within this small area.

Otaniemi has gained international recognition in information and communication technologies thanks largely to Nokia, but it also contains a host of other cutting-edge technology clusters, including mobility-based software and web-ware, as well as nanotechnology, microelectronics and quantum technology. Major companies that have sites in Otaniemi are for instance Tieto and Pöyry.

The Finnish Customs laboratory is located in Otaniemi.

The district of Otaniemi also includes the area of Keilaniemi, which contains the head offices of Fortum, Neste and Kone. In December 2007 the fifth building of Swing life Center was built in Keilaniemi, making the construction of the centre complete. The Swing Life Center complex currently houses about thirty companies in four interconnected buildings.

== Other features ==
Otaniemi was home to the Border and Coast Guard Academy, Finland, which was discontinued in Otaniemi in 2014 when its activity was concentrated to Imatra. The officer school of the Police University College was located in Otaniemi until 2008.

A new fire station will be constructed in Otaniemi next to the planned students&#x27; house as it is not possible to reach the area from elsewhere quickly enough. The new fire station will require a change in the zoning plan and dismantling the current Neste self-service petrol station. The projected price of the building is 5.3 million euro. The city council of Espoo still needs to accept the plan.

Otaniemi has three daycares, a stadium, an indoor arena, and a small shopping mall called A Bloc. The Fat Lizard Brewing Company has had its brewery in Otaniemi since 2017.

== Transport ==

The Ring I beltway goes past Otaniemi, and the area is located at its end near the Länsiväylä highway. The most direct car connection from the Helsinki city centre to Otaniemi goes via Länsiväylä and the western end of Ring I. Additionally, the street Kuusisaarentie leads from Munkkiniemi in Helsinki to Otaniemi via a chain of islands.

Many Espoo internal bus lines have their terminus stops at Teekkarikylä in Otaniemi, and many regional bus lines also travel past the area.

Otaniemi has been connected to the Helsinki Metro since 2017. The Aalto University metro station of the Länsimetro line is located in Otaniemi to the southwest of the main building of the university.

<text>Helsinki University of Technology (TKK; ; , HUT in international usage) was a technical university in Finland. It was located in Otaniemi, Espoo in the Helsinki metropolitan area, and it was one of the three universities from which the modern day Aalto University was founded. The university was founded in 1849 by Grand Duke of Finland, Emperor Nicholas I and received university status in 1908. It moved from Helsinki to Otaniemi campus area in 1966. The merger of HUT with two other schools created the Aalto University in 2010, and HUT briefly held the name Aalto University School of Science and Technology before being split into four schools in 2011. 

Much of the university&#x27;s Otaniemi campus was designed by Alvar Aalto.

==History==
In 1849, TKK was established in Helsinki by the decree of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Grand Duke of Finland as a &quot;manufacture and handicraft school&quot;, with the name &quot;Helsingin teknillinen reaalikoulu/Helsingfors tekniska realskola&quot;, along with two other similar schools, situated in Vaasa and Turku. The school started its function in the Domus Litonii (&quot;Litonius house&quot;) building located at Aleksanterinkatu 50, which had been designed by Gustaf Paulus Leander and completed in 1847, and remains in use and in ownership by the Litonius family to this day.

In 1872, the school&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Polyteknillinen koulu/Polytekniska skolan&quot; (&quot;Polytechnical School&quot;) and in 1878, to &quot;Polyteknillinen opisto/Polytekniska institutet&quot; (&quot;Polytechnical Institute&quot;), while the two other manufacture and handiwork schools were demoted to institutions of lower level. In 1877 the school moved to larger premises to a new building near the Hietalahdentori market square. As the proportion of matriculation diploma holders in the student intake gradually increased, the school gained more social respectability. In 1908, TKK was given university status along with its present name, thus becoming the second university to be founded in Finland. In 1955, building of the new campus area started with the housing village. In 1966, TKK moved from Helsinki to the new campus in Otaniemi, Espoo.

In the past, the university was also known by the abbreviations HUT and TH, from its English language and Swedish language names, but in 2005 a decision was made to officially solely use the abbreviation TKK for branding reasons.
In 2010, TKK was merged with Helsinki School of Economics and University of Art and Design Helsinki into Aalto University. After brief existence in the new university as own institution, &quot;Aalto University School of Science and Technology&quot;, it was split into four schools, corresponding to four old faculties, School of Engineering, School of Science, School of Electrical Engineering, and Aalto University School of Chemical Technology. In 2012, the Department of Architecture of the School of Engineering, formerly of Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, was merged with Aalto University School of Art and Design into Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture.

==Research and teaching==

===Studies===
All engineering programmes offered by TKK led to the degree of &quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot; (&quot;engineer with university diploma&quot;), a five-year master&#x27;s degree. The only exceptions to this were the architecture programmes that lead to the master&#x27;s degrees of architecture and landscape architecture. From 2005, according to the Bologna process, all students might also complete an intermediate degree (&quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot;, &quot;TkK&quot;) before the DI or architect&#x27;s degree. This degree is considered a bachelor&#x27;s degree and enables enrollment in foreign universities where a bachelor&#x27;s degree is required. TKK did not offer programs terminating in a bachelor&#x27;s degree; a student might only be accepted to study for the Master&#x27;s level degree. TKK required a bachelor&#x27;s degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master&#x27;s studies were offered completely in English.

Apart from numerous programs in Finnish language, various international Master&#x27;s programs were offered exclusively for studies in English.

===Faculties and research===
The university was organized in four faculties, each consisting of departments and separate laboratories, and separate units not operating under any faculty.

Additionally, TKK participated in various joint units with other Finnish universities and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland:

*Helsinki Institute of Physics (with University of Helsinki)
*Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (with University of Helsinki)
*Micronova Center of Micro and Nanotechnology (with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland)

TKK participated in 12 Centres of Excellence (&quot;huippuyksikkö&quot;), selected by the Academy of Finland to represent the top research in the country and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy.

Researchers at TKK have achieved notability in, among other things, low temperature physics (holding the current world record for the lowest temperature achieved), the development of devices and methods for magnetoencephalography, mobile communications, wood processing, and neural networks, with professor Teuvo Kohonen initiating research in self-organizing maps. Additionally, the first commercialised total synthesis, the synthesis of camphor, was invented by Gustaf Komppa, the first professor of chemistry at TKK and the Nobel laureate (chemistry, 1945) Artturi Virtanen held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest cleanroom facility in Northern Europe and of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe.

The Nokia Research Center has operated a &quot;lablet&quot; on university premises since 2008, in order to establish joint research programs and daily interaction between Nokia and university researchers, who would share the same facilities.

===Campus===
TKK was located in Otaniemi, Espoo. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry&#x27;s joint experimental laboratory KCL, and business incubators Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated there. It is also directly adjacent to Keilaniemi, with Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as Nokia and Fortum. The area is connected by a 15-minute bus ride to the center of Helsinki.

==Culture and student life==

TKK was known for its active student community and technology students (&quot;teekkari&quot;s) are highly noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat and often brightly colored overalls to many of their public events. The community has also organised important charity events (&quot;tempaus&quot; in local language). TKK students are also famous for, and Finland&#x27;s leading practitioners of, student pranks (&quot;jäynä&quot;), similar in principle to MIT hacks. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of Paavo Nurmi onto the 300-year-old wreck of Regalskeppet &quot;Vasa&quot; just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.

===Student Union===
The Student Union of Helsinki University of Technology (&quot;TKY&quot;, , ) was the interest group for the students of the university. In 2006 it had 11,187 members, which included all the students of the university, as is stipulated by Finnish law. It was founded in 1872.

===Student Nation===
TKK was also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more &quot;nations&quot;, a Finnish type of student corporation. The only nation at TKK was Teknologföreningen (TF) and its goal was to unite Swedish-speaking students at TKK. Teknologföreningen was founded in 1872, prior to the student union. Teknologföreningen also has its own building opposite to Dipoli called &quot;Urdsgjallar&quot;, completed in 1966. The Finnish-speaking student nation &quot;Tekniikan Ylioppilaat&quot; was disbanded in 1972 and its functions given to the university student union, since a separate Finnish-speaking nation in a university with an overwhelming Finnish-speaking majority was considered unnecessary. The regional Finnish-speaking nations at the University of Helsinki also accepted TKK students as members.

===Student housing===
The housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as Teekkarikylä (technology student village), was owned mostly by the student union and partly by HOAS (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing was characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offered housing for approximately 2,600 students.

Construction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during World War II, as a result of bombings by Soviet Union itself. Later the student housing has been used for housing athletes again in a number of athletics events, sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.

The campus contains the former student union building and convention centre &quot;Dipoli&quot;, named as the second &quot;Poli&quot;, the second building of the polytechnic students. The original first building being located formerly in the Helsinki centre. Dipoli was designed by Reima and Raili Pietilä and was completed in 1966. However, in 1993 the building was transformed into a training centre of the university. The ownership of the property was later transferred from the student union to the university itself, due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.

===Associations===

In addition to the student union TKK students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. In 2007, there were some 150 associations maintained by university students. In 2006, two-thirds of the student union members were members of &quot;the guilds&quot;, which are student associations uniting students inside their department, e.g. the Guild of Electrical Engineers.

<text>Timișoara (, , ; , also or ; ; ; see other names) is the capital city of Timiș County, Banat, and the main economic, social and cultural centre in Western Romania. Located on the Bega River, Timișoara is considered the informal capital city of the historical Banat region. From 1848 to 1860 it was the capital of the Serbian Vojvodina and the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. With 250,849 inhabitants at the 2021 census, Timișoara is the country&#x27;s fifth most populous city. It is home to around 400,000 inhabitants in its metropolitan area, while the Timișoara–Arad metropolis concentrates more than 70% of the population of Timiș and Arad counties. Timișoara is a multicultural city, home to 21 ethnic groups and 18 religious denominations. Historically, the most numerous were the Swabian Germans, Jews and Hungarians, who still make up 6% of the population in Timișoara.

Conquered in 1716 by the Austrians from the Ottoman Turks, Timișoara developed in the following centuries behind the fortifications and in the urban nuclei located around them. During the second half of the 19th century, the fortress began to lose its usefulness, due to many developments in military technology. Former bastions and military spaces were demolished and replaced with new boulevards and neighbourhoods. Timișoara was the first city in the Habsburg monarchy with street lighting (1760) and the first European city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884. It opened the first public lending library in the Habsburg monarchy and built a municipal hospital 24 years ahead of Vienna. Also, in 1771 it published the first German newspaper in Southeast Europe (). In December 1989, Timișoara was the starting point of the Romanian Revolution.

Timișoara is one of the most important educational centres in Romania, with about 40,000 students enrolled in the city&#x27;s six universities. Like many other large cities in Romania, Timișoara is a medical tourism service provider, especially for dental care and cosmetic surgery. Several breakthroughs in Romanian medicine have been achieved in Timișoara, including the first in vitro fertilization, the first laser heart surgery and the first stem cell transplant. As a technology hub, the city has one of the most powerful IT sectors in Romania alongside Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and Brașov. In 2013, Timișoara had the fastest internet download speed in the world.

Nicknamed the &quot;Little Vienna&quot; or the &quot;City of Roses&quot;, Timișoara is noted for its large number of historical monuments and its 36 parks and green spaces. The spa resorts Buziaș and Băile Călacea are located at a distance of from the city, respectively, mentioned since Roman times for the properties of healing waters. Along with Oradea, Timișoara is part of the Art Nouveau European Route. It is also a member of Eurocities. Timișoara has an active cultural scene due to the city&#x27;s three state theatres, opera, philharmonic and many other cultural institutions. In 2016, Timișoara was the first Romanian Youth Capital, and in 2023 it held the title of European Capital of Culture, along with the cities of Veszprém in Hungary and Elefsina in Greece.

== Etymology ==
The Hungarian name of the city, &quot;Temesvár&quot;, was first recorded as &quot;Temeswar&quot; in 1315. It refers to a castle (&quot;vár&quot;) on the Timiș River (&quot;Temes&quot;). Timiș belongs to the family of hydronyms derived from the Indo-European radical &quot;thib&quot; &quot;swamp&quot;. The Romanian and German oikonyms (Timișoara and Temeschburg, respectively) derived from the Hungarian form. The Habsburg/Austrian authorities also used &quot;Temeschwar&quot; or &quot;Temeswar&quot;, names that have become commonplace in current usage. The name of the city comes from the river which passes the city, Timișul Mic (; ), hydronym which was in use until the 18th century when it was changed to Bega or Beghei.
== History ==

=== Early history ===
The southeastern part of the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the Mureș, the Tisza and the Danube; the region was very fertile and already offered favourable conditions for food and human livelihood in 4000 BC. Archeological remains attested the presence of a population of farmers, hunters and artisans, whose existence was favoured by mild climate, fertile soil and abundant water and forests.

The first identifiable civilisation in Banat were the Dacians who left traces of their past. Several Romanian historians have advanced the idea that the current location of Timișoara corresponds to the Dacian settlement of Zurobara. Although its location is unknown, the coordinates given by geographer Ptolemy in &quot;Geographike Hyphegesis&quot; place it in the northwest of Banat.

=== Middle Ages ===

It is assumed that in the 9th century Knyaz Glad ruled over these lands, accepting Hungarian sovereignty, though no contemporary accounts exist. Timișoara was first officially mentioned in 1212 as the Roman castrum &quot;Temesiensis&quot; or &quot;castrum regium Themes&quot;. This year is disputed by historians of the opinion that the city&#x27;s first documentary mention comes from 1266, when heir apparent Stephen V of Hungary donates part of the &quot;Tymes&quot; fortress, built by his father, Béla IV, to Count Parabuch. The city was destroyed by the Tatars in the 13th century, but the city was rebuilt and grew considerably during the reign of Charles I of Hungary, who, upon his visit there in 1307, ordered the strengthening of the fortress with stone walls and the building of a royal palace. The palace was built by Italian craftsmen and was organised around a rectangular court having a main body provided with a dungeon or a tower. He even moved the royal seat from Buda to Timișoara between 1316 and 1323. Timișoara&#x27;s importance also grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain.

By the middle of the 14th century, Timișoara was at the forefront of Western Christendom&#x27;s battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks. In 1394, the Turks led by Bayezid I passed Nagybecskerek (present-day Zrenjanin) and Timișoara on their way to Wallachia where they were defeated by Voivode Mircea the Elder in the battle of Rovine. Timișoara once again served as a concentration point for the Christian armed forces, this time for the battle of Nicopolis. After the Christians&#x27; defeat, the Ottomans devastated Banat to Timișoara, from where they were expelled by Count István Losonczy. Appointed Count of Timiș in 1440, John Hunyadi moved with his family to Timișoara, which he would turn into a permanent military camp. John Hunyadi would come to be known throughout the region for his victory in Belgrade over the Ottomans, considered at that time a defender of Christianity. An important event in the city&#x27;s history was the peasant uprising led by György Dózsa. On 10 August 1514 he tried to change the course of Bega River to be able to enter more easily into the city, but he was defeated by attacks from both inside and outside the city.

=== 1552–1716: Ottoman rule ===

The fall of Belgrade in 1521 and the defeat at Mohács in 1526 caused the division of the Hungarian Kingdom in three parts, and Banat became the object of contention between the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and Ottomans. After a failed siege in 1551, the Turks regrouped and returned with a new strategy. On 22 April 1552, a 160,000-strong army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha conquered the city and transformed it into a capital city in the region (Eyalet of Temeşvar). The local military commander, István Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate. After the death of John Zápolya, Habsburgs tried to obtain Transylvania and Banat, including Timișoara, with mixed results; Transylvania even entered into dual vassalage for a time.

Timișoara remained under the Ottoman rule for 164 years, controlled directly by the Sultan and enjoying a special status, similar to other cities in the region, such as Budapest and Belgrade. During this period, Timișoara was home to a large Islamic community and produced famous historical figures, such as Osman Ağa of Temeşvar.

Except for a period in the late 16th century, the city did not suffer sieges until the end of the 17th century. In 1594, Gregory Palotić, Ban of Lugos and Karánsebes, started an anti-Ottoman uprising in Banat, with its starting point in Nagybecskerek. Following a strong Transylvanian offensive led by György Borbély, the Christian army conquered several towns, but Timișoara remained untouched. Another attempt to retake the city took place in 1596, when an army of Sigismund Báthory began the siege of the city. After 40 days of futile efforts, the besiegers drew back.

=== 1716–1860: Habsburg rule ===

After the victory at Petrovaradin on 5 August 1716, the Austrian army led by Prince Eugene of Savoy decided to conquer Timișoara. The Ottoman military, the kuruc and the Turkish civilian population were forced to leave the city after a 48-day siege marked by repeated bombings that destroyed much of the city&#x27;s buildings. After the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), the Banat of Temeswar became the province of the Habsburg monarchy and was proclaimed &quot;possession of the Crown&quot; with a military administration which ruled Timișoara until 1751 when it was replaced by a civil one.

After the conquest of Banat, the imperial authorities in Vienna began an extensive process of colonization, inviting especially German Catholics from Württemberg, Swabia, Nassau, etc. who would become known as Banat Swabians. In Timișoara, the Swabians settled mainly in Fabric, where they strongly developed craftsmanship. The main function of Timișoara during this period was that of a military fortress. The existing fortifications could not cope with the new military techniques, so the entire fortress was rebuilt in a late, flat and inconsistent adaptation of the Vauban style. It had an area 10 times larger than the medieval Turkish fortress. Between 1728 and 1732, Bega River was regulated, creating a navigable canal.

Under the political pressure of the Hungarian Diet, the Viennese Imperial Court accepted that the three counties of Banat to be reincorporated into the Hungarian Kingdom, in 1779. In 1781 Joseph II declared Timișoara free from the county authority and, to prevent the nobles from interfering with the administration of the city, he raised it to the rank of a &quot;free royal city&quot;. This status would secure Timișoara&#x27;s internal self-government, the right to have representatives in the Diet and that of disposing its own revenues. The city was under siege in 1848 for 107 days. The Hungarians unsuccessfully tried to capture the fortress in the battle of Temesvár. It was the last major battle in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. By the March Constitution, the region was incorporated to the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, which became a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The new imperial province, the existence of which had also been consecrated by the imperial decree of 18 November 1849, was ruled both militarily and civilly. Timișoara was designated as the residence of the governor, and the city maintained its privileges as a free royal city.

=== 19th–20th centuries ===

In 1860, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, after the establishment of the dual monarchy. As part of Austria-Hungary, the city experienced a fast economic and demographic growth. Credit institutions invested large sums in the development of local industry; at the turn of the 20th century there were many enterprises here: two breweries, an iron foundry, a match factory, a brick factory, a gas factory, a chain factory, a hat factory, a chocolate factory, etc. In this period horse-drawn tram, telephone and street lighting were introduced and roads were paved.

In 1892, Emperor Franz Joseph I decided to abolish the fortress status of Timișoara. The demolition of the fortifications began in 1899. The main functions of the city thus became the economic ones, especially the commercial and banking ones.

=== After World War I ===
On 31 October 1918, local military and political elites established the Banat National Council, together with representatives of the region&#x27;s main ethnic groups: Germans, Hungarians, Serbs and Romanians. On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived Banat Republic. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Timișoara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918 and 1919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King Ferdinand I awarded Timișoara the status of a University Centre, and the interwar years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of anti-fascist and anti-revisionist demonstrations also took place during this time.

During World War II, Timișoara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.

After the war, the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timișoara underwent Sovietisation and, later, Systematisation. The city&#x27;s population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timișoara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture, etc.

In December 1989, Timișoara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the Romanian Revolution. On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timișoara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.

== Geography ==
Timișoara is located at the intersection of the 45th parallel north with the 21st meridian east. As a mathematical position, it is in the northern hemisphere, almost equally distant from the north pole and the equator, and in the eastern hemisphere, using Central European Time. The local time of the city (considered after the meridian) is 1 h 25&#x27; 8&quot; ahead of the Greenwich Mean Time, but it is 34&#x27; 52&quot; behind the official time of Romania (Eastern European Time).

Timișoara lies at an altitude of 90 metres on the southeast edge of the Banat Plain, part of the Pannonian Plain, near the divergence of the Timiș and Bega rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timișoara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time and favored a wet and insalubrious climate, which spread plague and cholera and kept the number of inhabitants relatively low, preventing civic development. With time, these rivers were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to the hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the Timiș River, but on the Bega Canal. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. The city lies only 0.5 to 5 metres above the water table, which disallows the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.

Taken as a whole, the relief of Timișoara appears as a relatively flat, monotonous surface, the smoothness of the surface interrupted only by the Bega riverbed. Researched in detail, the relief of the city and its surroundings presents a series of local peculiarities, represented mainly by deserted meanders, micro-depressions and ridges (generally made of coarse materials). These are the result of the deposits in the area of the Timiș and Bega rivers, before their drainage, regularization and damming (concretized altimetrically by modest bumps, which do not exceed anywhere, the interval of 2–3 m).

=== Seismicity ===
Timișoara is a fairly active seismic center, but of the many earthquakes observed, few have exceeded magnitude 6 on the Richter scale. There are two active seismic faults that cross the western part of the city. The earthquakes recorded in the region are normal earthquakes, of crustal type, with depths of foci between .

=== Flora and fauna ===

In the past, there were extensive oak forests between the Tisza and Timiș. Over time, they were cleared to obtain the wood needed to build the fortress and houses, as well as to gain arable land. Today, except for the areas forested with Turkey oak and Hungarian oak (Green Forest, Bistra Forest, Timișeni–Șag Forest), the territory falls within the anthropogenic forest steppe that characterizes the entire Pannonian Basin. The landscape is diversified by meadow vegetation, along the main rivers, in which softwood trees predominate: willows, poplars, alders. Within the city limits is the Green Forest (), a forest massif with an area of about , systematically arranged in squares of . The forest is man-made; first organization plans were carried out in 1860 by the Hungarian Forest Service. About southeast of Timișoara is the Bazoș Dendrological Park, a forest reserve which since 1994 has the status of protected area. The first trees of the reserve were brought in 1909 from the Harvard University nursery. Today, the reserve includes 800 different species of trees and shrubs and is part of the International Association of Botanical Gardens.

The fauna of Timișoara includes few mammals, represented only by a few insectivores and rodents. The birds, on the other hand, are numerous, some of which are of hunting importance (the pheasant). The urban wildlife, although less varied than the forest wildlife, has a higher number of species of hunting interest (rabbit, deer, quail, partridge, pheasant, hedgehog, etc.) and reptiles. In the parks of Timișoara there are hedgehogs, moles, tree frogs and a lot of birds. Regarding the piscifauna, the dominant species is the carp, along with which live breams, bleaks, roaches, zieges, pikes, natural support for sport fishing. Timișoara used to have the only zoo in western Romania, Timișoara Zoological Garden, but it was closed.

=== Hydrography ===

The main watercourse is the Bega River, the southernmost tributary of the Tisza. Springing from the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, Bega is canalized, and from Timișoara to its outflow it was arranged for navigation (). The Bega Canal was built between 1728 and 1760, but its final arrangement was made later. The Bega Canal was designed for the access of barges of 600–700 tons and an annual transport capacity of three million wagons.

From the multitude of arms that existed before the canalization of Bega, only Bega Moartă (Dead Bega; in the Fabric neighborhood) and Bega Veche (Old Bega; to the west, flowing through Săcălaz) are preserved inside the city.

In addition to permanent courses and those that dry out, often during the summer, on the territory of Timișoara there are a number of lakes: either natural, formed instead of the old meanders or subsidence areas, such as those near Kuncz, Giroc, Pădurea Verde, etc., or of anthropic origin, such as those from Fratelia, Freidorf, Ciarda Roșie, Ștrandul Tineretului, etc. Timișoara&#x27;s drinking water is provided by Lake Surduc, an anthropic lake (1976), the largest in Timiș County, located from the city.

=== Climate ===
Like parts of Romania, Timișoara exhibits a transitional humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), characteristic of the southeastern part of the Pannonian Basin, with some sub-Mediterranean influences.

The dominant air masses, during spring and summer, are the temperate ones, of oceanic origin, which bring significant precipitations. Frequently, even in winter, humid air masses arrive from the Atlantic, bringing significant rains and snows, less often cold waves. From September to February there are frequent penetrations of continental polar air masses, coming from the east. In Banat, the influence of cyclones and hot air masses from the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea is also strongly felt, which in winter generate complete thawing and in summer impose periods of stifling heat.

The average annual temperature was between 1991 and 2020. The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of . The lowest temperature recorded in Timișoara was , on 24 January 1963, while the highest temperature was , recorded in August 2017. The average number of frost days (with minimum temperatures below ) is 80, and the average number of winter days (with maximum temperatures below 0 °C) is 17. The average number of tropical days (with maximum temperatures above ) is 45.

Predominantly under the influence of the maritime air masses from the northwest, Timișoara receives a higher amount of precipitation than the cities in the Wallachian Plain. The average amount of precipitation for the year in Timișoara is , falling on 87 days. The month with the most precipitation on average is June with 80.8 mm of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is February with an average of .

== Demography ==



From a demographic point of view, Timișoara is defined, according to the Zipf&#x27;s law, as a second-tier city, along with Iași, Constanța, Cluj-Napoca and Brașov, with extensive macro-territorial functions and having the second largest functional urban area, after Bucharest, of over . In 2013, Bucharest and Timișoara were also the only metropolitan European growth areas (MEGAs) in Romania. Nationally, Timișoara has been recognized as the largest polarizing center in western Romania.

According to the 2021 census, the population of Timișoara amounted to 250,849 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2011, when 319,279 inhabitants were registered. However, these figures are questioned by local authorities and sociologists due to the defective way in which the census was conducted. According to the mayor&#x27;s office and local population records, Timișoara numbers over 309,000 inhabitants as of 2023. The population of the city represents roughly 38% of the population of Timiș County, 15% of the population of the West development region and 1.3% of the total population of Romania. As defined by Eurostat, the Timișoara functional urban area has a population of 364,325 inhabitants (as of 2018).

According to a study conducted by the World Bank, Timișoara was between 2001 and 2011 the regional city in Romania that attracted the highest number of in-migrants. Timișoara serves as an important polarizer of the labor force for other regions of the country, with a demographic surplus, especially for the counties in northern Moldavia, northwestern Transylvania and Oltenia. Timișoara manages to attract about 8,000 new inhabitants annually, most coming mainly from Timiș County, but also from smaller cities in neighboring counties – Caraș-Severin, Hunedoara and Arad. In fact, 46.2% of the current population of Timișoara is made up of people who have moved here from elsewhere. In 2017, the former mayor Nicolae Robu stated that the city of Timișoara has an additional population of over 100,000 people compared to the officially registered residents. This includes students, workers, and other categories of floaters, who are not included in the statistical reports as they no longer acquire a residence visa.

=== Ethnic minorities ===
Timișoara has stood out since ancient times as an ethnically diverse city. In 1910, the largest community was represented by Germans, followed by Hungarians, Romanians, Jews, Serbs and many other smaller communities, such as Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Romas, Bulgarians, Poles, etc. The figures and percentage ratios are much changed today, but the multiethnic aspect of the city persists. Nowadays, 85% of the inhabitants are Romanians, while the minorities are much more diverse due to the presence of Asians, Italians, Muslims, and fewer Germans and Hungarians. Yet, in Timișoara live most Germans in Romania as share in the population of a city. The decline of German and Hungarian communities is mainly due to assimilation (for instance, 64% of Hungarians in Timișoara live in mixed marriages), migration and low birth rates. Timișoara is also home to an important Serb community, which in 2011 numbered almost 5,000 people. Many of them use Serbian as a second language, preferring Romanian. Serbian is more common among older generations educated in it.

In 2018, according to official data, over 7,000 foreigners lived in Timișoara. The actual figure is higher, given that many foreigners living in Timișoara do not apply for permanent residence, while spending most of their time in the city.
=== Religion ===

Although much changed throughout its history, the religious composition of Timișoara is diverse. If in 1910 most of the inhabitants were Roman Catholics, in 2011 75% declared themselves Romanian Orthodox.

In Timișoara there are 80 churches, 12 of which were built after 1989; 41 belong to the Orthodox Church, eight to the Roman Catholic Church and three to the Greek Catholic Church. In addition, there are three synagogues in Cetate, Fabric and Iosefin neighborhoods, all three built before World War I, when Jews accounted for 10% of the city&#x27;s population; the Orthodox synagogue in Iosefin and the central Neolog synagogue still hold regular religious services.
Timișoara is the seat of the Archiepiscopate of Timișoara, the see of the Metropolis of Banat, as well as the seat of the Diocese of Timișoara, one of the six Roman Catholic dioceses in Romania.

== Politics and administration ==

The first free local elections in post-communist Timișoara took place in 1992. The winner was Viorel Oancea, of the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), which later merged with the National Liberal Party (PNL). He was the first officer who spoke to the crowd of revolutionaries gathered in Opera Square. The 1996 elections were won by Gheorghe Ciuhandu, of the Christian Democrats (PNȚ-CD). He had four terms, also winning elections in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Meanwhile, Ciuhandu took over the Christian Democratic Party and ran for president of Romania in 2004. Nicolae Robu (PNL) was elected mayor in 2012 and again in 2016. In 2020, Dominic Fritz, a native of Germany, was elected mayor on behalf of the USR with support from the FDGR. He won a new mandate in 2024 on behalf of the United Timișoara Alliance (USR–PMP–FD–UDMR).

The Local council and the city&#x27;s mayor are elected every four years by the population. Decisions are discussed and approved by the Local Council () made up of 27 elected councilors. After the 2024 local elections, the Local Council has the following composition by political parties:
Additionally, as Timișoara is the capital of Timiș County, the city hosts the Administrative Palace, the headquarters of the County Council () and the prefect, who is appointed by Romania&#x27;s central government. The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of national development plans and governing programs at the local level.

In 2003, neighborhood advisory councils were set up as a measure to improve local government consultation with citizens on local public policies. As of 2013, Timișoara had 20 neighborhood advisory councils.

Timișoara is the informal capital of the West development region, which is equivalent to NUTS-II regions in the European Union and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and coordination of regional development projects. The West development region is not an administrative entity. Timișoara is also the largest economic, social and commercial center of the DKMT Euroregion.

=== Districts ===
Traditionally, Timișoara was divided into ten constituencies () that today have no administrative function:

In addition to the above, a number of new neighborhoods have emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries:

=== Metropolitan area ===

The Timișoara metropolitan area was outlined in 2008 following the collaboration of the local authorities from Timișoara and 14 neighboring communes (Becicherecu Mic, Bucovăț, Dudeștii Noi, Dumbrăvița, Ghiroda, Giarmata, Giroc, Moșnița Nouă, Orțișoara, Pișchia, Remetea Mare, Săcălaz, Sânmihaiu Român and Șag). The Timișoara metropolitan area is part of the Federation of Metropolitan Areas and Urban Agglomerations in Romania (FZMAUR). As of 2016, the metropolitan area groups over 410,000 inhabitants on an area eight times larger than the city proper.

Several localities neighboring Timișoara have experienced a significant development in recent years. Ghiroda, Giroc, Dumbrăvița, Chișoda, Moșnița Nouă and Utvin became suburbs of Timișoara due to the development of facilities, utilities and infrastructure, territorially joining the city. In the last 20 years, Timișoara has expanded its borders by about 8%, which means about 1,000 hectares, due to the construction of new neighborhoods or residential complexes. The city limits were moved outwards in 2006 by almost . The largest expansion took place towards Șag.

=== Timișoara–Arad metropolis===
In August 2016, mayors Nicolae Robu and Gheorghe Falcă signed the deed of establishment of the Timișoara–Arad metropolis, the first of its kind in Romania, part of the integrated development strategy &quot;Timișoara Vision 2030&quot;, carried out with the support of the World Bank, ADR Vest and FZMAUR. The project has been under discussion since 2006 and involved the unification of the metropolitan areas of Timișoara and Arad. In 2018, the population of the metropolis was 805,000 and is expected to exceed one million by 2030.

== Economy ==
Timișoara is one of the most dynamic economic centers in Romania. Based on its proximity to the western border, Timișoara has managed to attract many foreign investments in recent years, forming, together with Arad, the second largest area in Romania in terms of economic mass. By the mid-2000s, the foreign investments in Timișoara amounted to €753 per capita, compared to €450 per capita at county level. Most of these investments come from the EU countries, especially from Italy, Germany and France. Similar to other growth poles in Romania, the services sector has developed significantly in recent years, accounting for half of the revenues.

After the fall of communism and the transition to a market economy, the private sector grew steadily. In the first decade of the 21st century, Timișoara has experienced an economic boom as the amount of foreign investment, especially in high-tech sectors, has risen. In an article in late 2005, French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Expansion&quot; called Timișoara Romania&#x27;s economic showcase, and referred to the increased number of foreign investments as a &quot;second revolution&quot;. In 2016, Timișoara was awarded by Forbes as the most dynamic city and the best city for business in Romania. Between 2000 and 2013, Timișoara had the highest growth rate of GDP per capita, surpassing even Bucharest. The local economic development has been reflected accordingly in the unemployment figures. For instance, in December 2019, the unemployment rate in Timișoara was among the lowest in the country, with only 0.8%.

=== Industrial sector ===
After 1989, major changes took place in the structure of industrial activities in Timișoara due to the restructuring and retrofitting processes, industrial production currently including both traditional sub-branches and new, modern and dynamic ones. Unlike cities such as Cluj-Napoca, Iași or Bucharest, the localization of industry within the city is specific to Timișoara. The main industrial groups in the city can be structured in three types: urban industrial areas, with large area and complex profile (Calea Buziașului, Freidorf, pericentral area along the railway, Calea Șagului, etc.), industrial platforms with unitary profile (UMT and Solventul) and dispersed industrial units, respectively. In recent decades, industrial areas have developed along major road or rail arteries, with a tendency to group units by industrial profiles.

There are eight industrial zones in Timișoara where factories and plants cover several sectors from electronics, chemical and automotive to food processing and textile industries.

Buziașului industrial area concentrates units for chemical industry and production of automotive and electronic components. The area has seen an important development in recent years, attracting major investments from Procter &amp; Gamble, Continental, Dräxlmaier, Elbromplast, AEM, Saguaro, etc. In 2013 Optica Business Park was inaugurated here. Developed on the old buildings of the former lens factory, Optica Business Park offices have attracted tenants such as Microsoft, Linde or ZTE. Șagului industrial area includes warehouses of construction materials (Arabesque, Arthema, Lipoplast, Mobexpert, etc.), as well as a significant number of showrooms and car dealers (Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Citroën, Opel, etc.). An important role in the development and diversification of the profile of the area is played by the Incontro Industrial Park, where construction companies are mainly located. Calea Șagului has also become an important commercial area, with hypermarkets such as Brico Dépôt, Auchan, Jysk, Metro or Leroy Merlin. Stretched on a usable area of 63 ha, Freidorf Industrial Park is an important area for attracting foreign investment, encouraging business development and creating new jobs. The automotive components industry predominates in the area (Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ContiTech, ELBA, etc.). In the UMT industrial area are located mainly chemical and automotive industry units (Continental, Linde, Hella, etc.), but also warehouses. Torontalului industrial area includes units for manufacturing industry (Flex, Coca-Cola, SCA, etc.). The Timișoara Technology and Industrial Park was arranged here, with the aim of supporting the development of SMEs in fields such as software, IT and communications or electronics and electrical engineering. Aradului industrial area is the newest industrial area, with various locations for storage and provision of services. Like Calea Șagului, the Aradului area has become an important commercial hub, retailers like Selgros, Hornbach, Altex or Auchan operating here.

The main industrial branches, which have experienced an important growth in Timișoara, are the automotive industry, the chemical and petrochemical industry, as well as the electronics industry. The automotive components industry has registered a strong development in recent years, as a consequence of the need for technological development within existing industrial units, in Timișoara concentrating renowned companies in this field (Dräxlmaier, Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ContiTech, TRW Automotive, Mahle, Hella, Dura, Valeo, Autoliv, Honeywell, etc.). In 2016, a competence center for automotive engineering – CERC – was inaugurated in the Freidorf area. This economic branch has old traditions. Between 1988 and 1991, the Romanian car model Dacia 500 Lăstun was made in the Tehnometal factories.

The electronics and electrical engineering industry is a successful branch of Timișoara&#x27;s industry, especially due to the investments of large companies with activities in high tech production (Flex, Bosch, ABB, AEM, ELBA, Ericsson, etc.), which determined a development of local companies, suppliers or subcontractors.

The chemical and petrochemical industry, traditional in Timișoara, has developed especially through the investments made by Continental, Procter &amp; Gamble and Azur.

Along with large investors from the top industries mentioned above, in Timișoara are concentrated a large number of companies, especially small and medium enterprises, in traditional fields such as textile and clothing industry, textile manufacturing and leather and footwear industry, foreign investors interested in these sectors mainly due to low production costs.

=== Office sector ===
The office sector has boomed in the last decade, the stock of class A offices available for rent reaching 290,000 m2 in 2020, almost 10% of Bucharest&#x27;s stock. The return on investment in office buildings exceeds the level in Bucharest (7%), standing at around 8.25%. The city has the lowest vacancy rate of class A office spaces, 5% in 2014.

City Business Center is the main office park in Timișoara, located in the city center. Completed in 2015, the complex is fully leased, with tenants including international companies such as Accenture, SAP, Deloitte, Wipro, IBM, Visma, Hella, etc. Named the greenest office project in Romania by BREEAM, Vox Technology Park was completed in early 2018. Bega Business Park is located near the historic center. The first two buildings were completed in 2015 and early 2018, respectively, and are fully occupied by Nokia&#x27;s campus. Under construction are ISHO Offices, part of a larger project, and United Business Center. The latter will include the tallest office building in Romania (155 m).

=== IT&amp;C sector ===
At national level, Timișoara is one of the poles of the most intense activities in the IT industry. Well-known companies such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Siemens, Nokia, Huawei, Atos, Accenture, Endava, Bitdefender or Visteon have offices in the city, supporting – through the hubs and the digital workshops created – start-ups and SMEs in the field. Before the rapid expansion of Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara concentrated the most IT professionals after Bucharest. In 2014, Timișoara had 7,000 employees in the field. In the same year, the Incuboxx cluster was inaugurated. Incuboxx is the largest IT&amp;C business incubator in Romania, which includes 54 office spaces addressed to entrepreneurs and companies with local capital in the field.

Timișoara ranks 394th in the 2019 Innovation Cities Index, an annual list of the world&#x27;s most innovation-friendly cities. Bucharest and Timișoara are the only Romanian cities on the list published by the World Economic Forum.

=== Real estate sector ===
The real estate market in Timișoara, supported by the upward economic trend, has been booming lately. In 2017, about 4,000 living spaces were delivered to the market, an increase of almost 60% compared to the previous year, most of the projects representing high-rise residential complexes, addressed to the mass and mid-market segments. In the first nine months of 2016, according to the National Agency for Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising, over 32,000 sale/purchase transactions were concluded, making Timiș County the largest real estate market in Romania after Bucharest–Ilfov. 87% of them took place in Timișoara and neighboring communes. Among the largest residential complexes in Timișoara are ISHO, Adora Forest, Vivalia Grand, XCity Towers, Vox Vertical Village, Ateneo and City of Mara.

After 1989 the rural areas within the city became &quot;hot spots&quot; for housing investors, and the emergence of the middle class after 2000 changed both the landscape and the prices of houses and land. In 2020, for example, the price of an apartment reached 1,300 euros/m2, the third-highest among Romanian big cities, after Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest. On the other hand, the phenomenon of gentrification renewed a part of the underused housing stock.

=== Commercial sector ===

Bega Shopping Center is the only shopping center in the center of Timișoara and the first in the city. Bega Shopping Center is structured on six levels and has a leasable area of 7,500 m2, of which 1,300 are allocated to a Carrefour supermarket. Bega Group, the holding company that owns Bega Shopping Center, has opened three other retail parks in Buziașului, Circumvalațiunii and Lipovei.

Iulius Mall was inaugurated in October 2005. Following an investment by Iulius Group and Atterbury Europe, Iulius Mall has been integrated into a large urban regeneration project – Iulius Town, complementing it with retail, office and entertainment functions. Iulius Town has the largest shopping area in Romania (120,000 m2), a space that brings together over 450 stores. The estimated annual traffic for Iulius Town is over 20 million visitors.

The second mall, Shopping City, opened in March 2016. The shopping center has a leasable area of 70,000 m2, covering almost 20 ha and comprising 110 stores on two levels. Within Shopping City, the largest Cinema City multiplex outside Bucharest was opened in April 2016, with 13 3D rooms, an IMAX room and a 4DX room. In the first year since its opening, Shopping City had a traffic of over nine million visitors.

The first strip mall in the city, Funshop Park, opened in 2022. Built on the former industrial platform of Azur, Funshop Park has a leasable area of 10,800 m2 and is provided with an outdoor food court area.

Along with the existing stores in the central area, new supermarkets have been opened by national and international concerns such as Selgros, Metro, Auchan, Kaufland, Carrefour, Lidl, Penny, Mega Image or Profi. On the bricolage and DIY market are present the stores of Dedeman, Hornbach, Brico Dépôt, Arabesque, Leroy Merlin, Mobexpert, Mömax, Jumbo and Decathlon, among others, part of local and international chains.

=== Tourism ===
Timișoara is the central point of tourism in the region, attracting 80% of its tourists. In the first half of 2017, Timișoara and its surroundings attracted just over 50,000 foreign tourists to the third most visited region in Romania, after Bucharest–Ilfov and Brașov.

In 2013, in Timișoara there were 107 accommodation units (comprising 49 hotels, seven hostels, 50 pensions, and an international campsite) totaling 5,547 accommodation places.

=== Pre-university education ===
Preschool education takes place in 70 kindergartens; the primary education in 47 schools; the secondary education in 36 high schools; the post-secondary education in 11 post-secondary schools; and the master workman education in six foreman schools. The school network also includes two special high schools for students with disabilities, three schools of inclusive education, five seminaries, a special school for students with amblyopia, two educational assistance centers and a Waldorf high school. The private education system includes an international school and high school with teaching according to the British curriculum, an English-language kindergarten and primary school, as well as a nursery and kindergarten with teaching according to the Finnish curriculum.

The specificity of pre-university education in Timișoara is the diversity of teaching languages. The city&#x27;s rich multiethnic tradition has been maintained by the schools with teaching in Hungarian (Béla Bartók High School), German (Nikolaus Lenau High School), English (William Shakespeare High School), French (Jean-Louis Calderon High School) and Serbian (Dositej Obradović High School).

According to a ranking made by the &quot;AdmitereLiceu.ro&quot; portal in 2020, five high schools in Timișoara are among the top 100 high schools in Romania: Grigore Moisil High School, Constantin Diaconovici Loga National College, National College of Banat, Carmen Sylva National Pedagogical College and Nikolaus Lenau High School.
=== Higher education ===
Higher education has a tradition of over 100 years, with the establishment of the Polytechnic University in 1920. From then until today, Timișoara has become the most important university and academic center in western Romania, with about 40,000 students enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate study programs in four public and two private universities. There are branches of the National Alliance of Student Organizations and AIESEC. Student organizations are very active, known for events such as StudentFest, the largest international student art and culture festival in Southeast Europe or the ten-day International Student Week.

The Polytechnic University is one of the largest and most famous technical universities in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2011 it was classified by the Ministry of Education in the category of universities of advanced research and education, the highest position that a university in Romania can reach. In the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings, the Polytechnic University is on the third place among the Romanian universities with research activity. Established by royal decree in 1944, the West University is the largest university in the city in terms of student numbers. The West University is one of the five members of the Universitaria Consortium, the group of elite Romanian universities. In 2018, the West University was present in 19 international rankings of universities, one of the top-ranked in Romania. One of the six medical universities in Romania is located in Timișoara – the Victor Babeș University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The fourth public university in Timișoara, specialized in life sciences and veterinary medicine, is the King Michael I University of Life Sciences.

The student campuses are located in Complexul Studențesc–Medicinei (25 dormitories), Lipovei–Tipografilor (six dormitories) and Blașcovici (two dormitories), offering a total of about 13,000 accommodation places. Complexul Studențesc in particular is known for its nightlife, with several pubs, bistros, nightclubs and themed bars concentrated here.

There are several public libraries, municipal or university, most importantly:
* Library of the Victor Babeș University of Medicine and Pharmacy, founded in 1946;
* Central Library of the Polytechnic University, hosted between 1947 and 2014 in the ensemble of Piarist Gymnasium;
* Eugen Todoran Central University Library, with a book fund of over one million volumes;
* Sorin Titel County Library, founded in 1904.

=== Scientific research ===

Several institutes operate within the Timișoara branch of the Romanian Academy: the National R&amp;D Institute for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter, the National R&amp;D Institute for Welding and Materials Testing, the Titu Maiorescu Institute of Banat Studies, the Coriolan Drăgulescu Institute of Chemistry and the Astronomical Observatory.

In the patrimony of the West University there are several research centers, such as: the Institute of Advanced Environmental Research, the Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen Interdisciplinary Training and Research Platform, the Creation Center of Contemporary Visual Arts, the Research Laboratory in Structural and Computational Chemistry–Physics for Nanosciences and QSAR, the Research Center in Criminal Sciences, the East European Center for Research in Economics and Business, the Center for Romance Studies, the Research Center in Computer Sciences, the Center for Social Research and Development, the Institute of Socio-Political Research, etc. Also in Timișoara there are branches of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academy of Technical Sciences, respectively.

The first computer built in Romania (1961) was put into operation within the Polytechnic Institute of Timișoara, nowadays the Polytechnic University. It was called MECIPT, an acronym for &quot;Electronic Computing Machine of the Polytechnic Institute of Timișoara&quot; (). Its design was started in 1956 by a team led by mathematician Iosif Kaufmann, electronic engineer Wilhelm Löwenfeld and student Vasile Baltac.

Out of the 1,700 members of the Romanian Academy, from 1866 until 2016, 102 members come or have worked in Banat and the surrounding areas. Among them are Traian Vuia, the inventor of the first tractor monoplane, Traian Lalescu, one of the fathers of integral equations, Dumitru Prunariu, the first Romanian to fly in space and Stefan Hell, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

In the second half of May, biannually, the Timișoara branch of the Romanian Academy organizes, collaborating and involving the local academic, cultural and scientific community, the Timișoara Academic Days.

== Healthcare ==

Due to the specialized university programs, Timișoara is a research center in the fields of medicine and public health; there are branches of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Student Society of Surgery, the headquarters of the Romanian Hemophilia Association, the Romanian Society of Medical Informatics and the Romanian Society of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology, as well as the regional training center in emergency medicine, operated by SMURD.

In Timișoara there are eight hospitals, seven publicly owned and one private:

== Infrastructure ==
Timișoara is an important regional road and railway hub, connecting the city to Bucharest and other major cities, as well as Romania to Hungary and Serbia, and further to Western Europe. It is located along the Pan-European Corridor IV linking Germany to Turkey and has access, thanks to the Bega Canal, to the Pan-European Corridor VII. Furthermore, Timișoara is crossed by two TEN-T core network corridors: Orient/East–Med and Rhine–Danube (waterway focus).

=== Road transport ===

The street plot of Timișoara is composed of 1,278 streets totaling almost . The street network is based on a radial model, consolidated by a series of five concentric rings, none of them completely built. Unlike other cities of similar size, there is no predominant corridor in terms of loading, with traffic volumes distributed fairly evenly across a series of radial and circular arteries. The shape of the road network outside the city is web-like, all the main roads in the county converging towards the capital city.

In the northern part of the city there is a bypass; its southern extension is currently under construction. The city is crossed in the northeast by the A1 motorway, a segment that continues with the M43 motorway in Hungary. The A1 is connected near Lugoj to the A6 motorway, which is under construction.

Timișoara is connected to the European and national road network by the following roads:
* European route E70 – to the border with Serbia through the Moravița customs;
* European route E671 Timișoara–Satu Mare;
* national road 6 – to the border with Hungary through Cenad customs;
* national road 59 – with branch DN59A, to the border with Serbia through Jimbolia customs;
* national road 69 Timișoara–Arad.
Locally, car transport experienced a boom after 1990, so that in 2017 the degree of motorization in Timișoara was among the highest in Romania, with one car for every 2.66 inhabitants. Timișoara has one of the most extensive infrastructures for charging electric cars and plug-in hybrids in Romania, with 16 stations located throughout the city and a hub in 700 Square.

=== Public transport ===

Timișoara&#x27;s public transport network consists of nine tram lines, eight trolleybus lines and 31 bus lines and is operated by STPT (Societatea de Transport Public Timișoara). The network covers all the important areas of the city and it also connects Timișoara with some of the communes of the metropolitan area. 45% of urban public transport is served by trams, 22% by trolleybuses, 18% by buses and the remaining 15% by water buses and alternative means of transport. In 2019, Timișoara became the second city in Romania to introduce public school transport, after Cluj-Napoca; as of 2020, it is served by 14 lines.

Timișoara has a well-developed market for taxi services. There are also several car rental companies. Alternatively, short- and long-distance carpooling platforms operate in Timișoara, such as Uber, Bolt or BlaBlaCar.

For internal coach transport there are several coach stations, most located around the Timișoara North railway station and on Stan Vidrighin Way. There are also daily coach trips to destinations in Europe, served by private passenger transport companies, such as Atlassib, Eurolines or Flixbus.

=== Rail transport ===

Timișoara has the oldest and the densest railway network in Romania, with over of lines for of territory, although some of the components are no longer operational due to low demand and lack of maintenance. Therefore, Timișoara is the most important rail hub in Timiș County and in western Romania. Most of the railway lines that intersect in Timișoara are secondary lines; the most important are line 900 from Bucharest, with international connections to Serbia and the main line Timișoara–Arad–Oradea, which ensures the connection with line 200 (Brașov–Sibiu–Arad–Curtici) and, implicitly, with Hungary.

The city has five stations (Timișoara North, Timișoara West, Timișoara South, Timișoara East and Timișoara CET) and a triage station (Ronaț Triaj). The main passenger station is Timișoara North, built in 1897 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation since 2021. The old station building, built in neoclassical style, was badly damaged by the Allied bombing of 1944, so it was rebuilt in socialist classical style. Timișoara North is one of the busiest stations in Romania, with an average of 174 passenger trains/day and a flow of 5,530 passengers/day.

Although the nature of freight traffic has changed, decreasing the requirement for maneuvering and recomposing trains, Timișoara is an important center for rail freight transport; there are several large industrial concerns that receive and ship goods by train.

=== Air transport ===

Located from Timișoara, in the northeastern part of the city, Traian Vuia International Airport is the fourth-busiest Romanian airport in terms of passenger numbers (~1.2 million in 2022) and the most important air hub in the DKMT Euroregion. In 2017, it became the first airport in Romania certified by EASA. In 2018, Traian Vuia International Airport attracted 15.1% of the total number of passengers embarked at Romanian airports, 32.8% of the total tons of goods loaded and 13.2% of the total number of flights. Traian Vuia International Airport serves as an operational base for Wizz Air. As of 2021, the airport is undergoing expansion works, by adding two terminals – internal arrivals and external departures – and creating an intermodal center for freight transport.

The city&#x27;s first airport, the Cioca Airfield, had remained in use for recreational and utility aviation.

=== Water transport ===

The Bega Canal is the first navigable canal built in Romania, connecting Timișoara with the Serbian town of Titel. Its total navigable length was , of which on the Romanian territory. In 2018, repair works were started on the navigation infrastructure of the Bega Canal, which would allow the resumption of naval traffic between Timișoara and Serbia, halted in 1967.

Since 2018, Timișoara is the first Romanian city with urban public transport by water, made with vaporetto-like boats on a single line with six stations.

=== Alternative transport ===

Timișoara has the most developed integrated cycling system in Romania. Cyclists have access to more than of bike lanes, including outside the city via the Bega Canal cycle path, which connects Romania with Serbia, providing a direct connection to the European network of cycling routes – EuroVelo. Timișoara is the first city in Romania with a public bike-sharing system, VeloTM, inaugurated in 2015. The system has 440 bicycles in the 25 stations in the city and, depending on the season, is accessed by 1,000–1,500 people daily.

In 2019 Timișoara introduced public transport with electric scooters.

== Architecture ==

Timișoara has the largest architectural ensemble of historic buildings in Romania (around 14,500), consisting of the urban patrimony of the neighborhoods of Cetate, Fabric, Iosefin and Elisabetin. Most of these buildings are part of the imperial heritage, a period of economic prosperity that left its mark on the city. The architectural diversity, represented by baroque, historicism, neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Wiener Secession, earned Timișoara the nickname &quot;Little Vienna&quot;. The oldest building in Timișoara is Huniade Castle, which today houses the Museum of Banat. Destroyed during the siege of 1849, the castle was later rebuilt, but still retains elements of the former castle built by John Hunyadi between 1443 and 1447, but also elements from the period of Charles I of Hungary.

Timișoara is a city with a polynuclear urban structure. The current urban structure, the result of historical evolution, is relatively clear: in the middle of the urban agglomeration is the historic center (Cetate neighborhood) around which the other neighborhoods revolve. Due to their independent development, they have distinct features both functionally and architecturally. The center of today&#x27;s Timișoara is the &quot;successor&quot; of the Austrian military fortress built mostly between 1732 and 1761. Today, only a few parts of the old city wall remain standing, namely the Theresia Bastion in the east and a few others which are located on the western limit of the old city wall. These were later listed as part of the architectural heritage of Timișoara.

=== Historic neighborhoods ===
==== Cetate ====

The Cetate neighborhood, the political, administrative and cultural center of Timișoara, is divided into two distinct urban areas. The first area is the &quot;inner city&quot; of the 18th and 19th centuries. The whole area has the status of heritage site. The area houses the oldest buildings of the city, dating from the 18th century. The second area was established after 1900 on the lands liberated by the demolition of the fortifications. Construction in this area followed the trend at the time, the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; style. The Secessionist school of Banat was influenced by both Austrian and Hungarian styles, resulting from the direct participation of some architects from Budapest on various representative buildings. This style underwent two different stages: the first occurred approximately between 1900 and 1908 and was similar to Art Nouveau, with floral and curvilinear decorations, while the second, which continued until World War I, saw simpler, larger buildings with geometrical designs, similar to Viennese architecture at the time. Due to the fact that secessionism existed in Timișoara only between 1900 and 1914, its influence on more modest buildings was not as strong as that of eclecticism. If eclecticism became a true art of the masses, used in all buildings, secessionism remained a style of the elites, which penetrated Banat through cult architecture.

The historic center of Timișoara has a system consisting of three urban squares, unique in Romania, each square presenting different sizes, plastic solutions and architectural styles. Union Square (), built in baroque style, is the oldest square in Timișoara. It is also called Dome Square (), because it houses the Roman Catholic Dome, built in 1774. The middle of the square is dominated by the Plague Column. On the southern side of the square is the Baroque Palace, designed after the Palais Kinsky in Vienna, which today houses the Art Museum. On the western side are the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral and the Serbian Orthodox Episcopal Palace, representative of the neo-Serbian style.

Victory Square (), also known as the Opera Square (), is the central square of Timișoara. The entire square was designed by the then chief architect László Székely, educated in Budapest, but a great admirer of Austrian architecture. The square was completely pedestrianized in the late 1980s, with the removal of tram rails. Spatially, the square stretches between the Metropolitan Cathedral and the Palace of Culture which houses the National Theater and Opera. Although built around the same time, the two belong to diametrically opposed styles. The Opera building was built in Renaissance style. Today, only its sides retain this style, the facade rebuilt after a fire in the neo-Byzantine style characteristic of Romanian interwar architecture. The Metropolitan Cathedral is the largest religious building in Timișoara and the second tallest church in Romania, after the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest. It stands out for its massiveness, having no less than 11 bell towers and architectural style, unusual for a 20th-century building, inspired by the architecture of Moldavian monasteries. The promenade side from the Opera to the cathedral is called Corso and houses several 1900s style palaces (Lloyd, Neuhaus, Merbl, Dauerbach, Hilt and Széchenyi); the opposite side, Surogat, houses two palaces (Löffler and Chamber of Commerce) and several modernist blocks of flats. In the middle of the square are the statue of the Capitoline Wolf and the fountain with fish.

To the north of Victory Square is Liberty Square (). Formerly called the Parade Square (), the square houses several buildings with military functions: the Garrison Command, former Chancellery of War, the Military Casino, etc. The Military Casino is built in baroque style with some Rococo influences. The other buildings are in the classic style, in the 1900s style – szecesszió movement and in other styles. Liberty Square is the pedestrian link between Union Square and Victory Square. In the extension of the Liberty Square there is a smaller square, St. George Square (), known in the past as Seminar Square (). Its eastern side was formed by the Jesuit Church, transformed into a mosque during the Ottoman occupation and demolished during the modernization works provided in the urbanistic plan of 1911 (in its place was built the Szana Bank). The walls of the former church were brought to the surface in 2014. The square is dominated by the equestrian statue of Saint George fighting the dragon, built in 1996. It is one of several monuments erected in the 1990s in parts of the city where people were killed during the Romanian Revolution. In this square, the first horse-drawn tram was set in motion in July 1869.

==== Fabric ====

The Fabric neighborhood has earned its name from the many manufactories, workshops and guilds established here. The neighborhood is bordered by the Neptune Baths, the Timișoara East railway station, the waterworks and the Timișoreana breweries. In the center of the neighborhood is Trajan Square (). This is a smaller replica of the Union Square; both are rectangular and flanked on the eastern side by a religious building. The oldest building in Trajan Square is the Serbian Orthodox Church, built between 1745 and 1755 in the classicist style. Most of the buildings in the square were built at the end of the 19th century and belong to different movements of the Art Nouveau style. In Romans&#x27; Square () is the Millennium Church, a historicist building with neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque elements.

==== Iosefin ====

At the beginning, the Iosefin neighborhood had a rural character, with isolated houses, similar to the Banat Swabians plain villages. The houses had only one level and, for the most part, had facades decorated with pediments. The rural character of the neighborhood is maintained until 1857, when Timișoara is connected to the railway system of Central Europe. Then, in the northern part of Iosefin, the first railway station of the city was built. Apart from the St. Mary Catholic Church, which was built between 1774 and 1775, all the buildings in Iosefin are built after 1868, most of which were built around 1900. Thus, in this area, there are numerous buildings in eclectic historicist style, specific to the second half of the 19th century, as well as several architectural ensembles in the 1900s style with its specific stylistic derivations – Art Nouveau, Jugendstil or Secession. Representative for this style are the historical monuments from urban ensembles IV and V: the Water Palace, the Délvidéki Casino, the former House of Savings, the Anchor Palace, the twin palaces of Nándor and Tamás Csermák, the Notre Dame Church, the Water Tower, etc.

16 December 1989 Boulevard forms the traditional historical border between the Iosefin and Elisabetin neighborhoods. Along it are a series of Art Nouveau palaces (Besch–Piffl, Kuncz, Menczer, etc.), as well as the 1900s-style Fire Station. The boulevard divides Alexandru Mocioni Square () into two unequal parts, the triangular one (formerly called Küttl Square and Sinaia Square) belonging to Iosefin. The square is flanked by the Orthodox Church, built in neo-Byzantine style and inspired by Hagia Sophia, in contrast to the Art Nouveau architecture of the surrounding buildings.

==== Elisabetin ====

Like the Iosefin neighborhood, Elisabetin had a rural appearance for a long time. Only after 1892, with the dismantling of the military fortress, Elisabetin experienced a strong development. Only two buildings have been preserved in Elisabetin since the 18th century: Dissel House and the Orthodox Church in the Church Square, the oldest Romanian church in Timișoara. Although it is a protected historical area, the urban ensemble I of Elisabetin is affected by the so-called urban sprawl. Many ground floor houses, typical of the historical urban morphology of the neighborhood, have been transformed into multi-storey buildings. The buildings in the urban ensemble VIII date from 1890 to 1900. Some belong to the classicist style, while others fall into the eclectic historicist style, especially the neo-baroque movement.

One of Elisabetin&#x27;s squares of historical importance is Mary Square (), dominated by the neo-Romanesque monument of St. Mary. According to tradition, György Dózsa, the leader of the peasant uprising of 1514, was martyred in this place. Other squares in Elisabetin are the Nicolae Bălcescu Square () with its 57-meter-high Catholic Church and the smaller Pleven Square (), surrounded by an ensemble of Art Nouveau residential buildings (the House with Peacocks, the Szilárd House, the House with Beautiful Gate, etc.).

=== 1919–1947: Neo-Romanian architecture ===
The neighborhoods of individual villas, the houses with several apartments and the religious and socio-cultural endowments dating from the first half of the 20th century, especially from the interwar period, predominate in the interstitial spaces between the historic neighborhoods, giving the respective areas the aspect of a garden city.

The architecture of the new buildings erected in the interwar period kept some decorative elements widespread at the beginning of the 20th century, but the neo-Romanian style, then the modernist and cubist ones, became more and more popular. More and more projects have been entrusted to Romanian architects, from Timișoara or Bucharest. Outside the former walls of the fortress and in Elisabetin, numerous villas were built in which the influence of the modern style, of the Brâncovenesc style as well as the French influences are predominant, but also public buildings, emblematic for the new architectural line. In the interwar years, important buildings of the city were built according to the plans of the Bucharest architect Duiliu Marcu: the new facade of the Theater, the main building, the student dormitory and the laboratories of the Polytechnic Institute, the Capitol cinema, etc.

The neo-Romanian style was consciously promoted by the state. Like secessionism, the neo-Romanian style remained a style of elites that did not influence in any way the architecture of the more modest buildings that were built in large numbers in the interwar period.

=== 1947–1989: Socialist classicism ===

During the communist period, like other cities in Romania, Timișoara strictly followed the Soviet style. The architects did not have creative freedom, because the ministry imposed a firm control and an austerity regime, with small budgets. The evolution of the postwar architecture of the city was strongly influenced by the activity of the architect Hans Fackelmann, who designed, among others, the West University, one of the first modern constructions in Romania and the Ion Vidu National Art College.

Despite the central policy of urban systematization, which saw entire historic neighborhoods demolished, such as the Uranus neighborhood in Bucharest, the Timișoara authorities did not demolish old buildings, but only &quot;filled in&quot;, where there were no buildings. Thus were built the two blocks that close the front of Victory Square, on its eastern side, towards the Metropolitan Cathedral. In the late 1960s, the Communist Party called for the construction of a number of commercial venues, hotels, houses of culture, stadiums and sports halls in major cities. It was the period when the Bega store, the Continental and Timișoara hotels, the Youth House, the Modex fashion house, the Olimpia hall and others were built in Timișoara.

The communist era also meant the growth of the population of Timișoara, by moving the workers brought from all over the country. Thus arose the need for new neighborhoods. Between 1974 and 1988, huge bedroom neighborhoods were built, consisting of blocks of flats with four, eight or ten floors, made of large prefabricated panels. At the end of the 1980s, over two thirds of the population of Timișoara lived in such suburbs: Circumvalațiunii, Șagului, Lipovei, etc. The blocks had the technical-municipal installations necessary for housing, but they were poorly executed in the conditions of a pronounced economic decline.

=== 1990–present: Contemporary architecture ===

The reconnection, after 1989, of the Romanian architecture to the European architectural culture proved to be very difficult. Most of the projects and constructions did not yet have enough substance or inertially continued the decorativism of the previous period. Re-established in 1990 as a department within the Faculty of Constructions, the Timișoara school of architecture brought together architects from the late 1980s who, embracing the theoretical discourse of postmodernism, perpetuated the arts and crafts philosophy of the previous generation, either by a subtle return to historical tradition (Șerban Sturdza, Mihai Botescu or Radu Radoslav), or through a critical regional approach (Vlad Gaivoronschi, Ioan Andreescu or Florin Ionașiu). Constructions such as Austria House (Mihai Botescu), BRD Tower (Radu Radoslav), City Business Center (Vlad Gaivoronschi) or Reghina Blue Hotel (Ioan Andreescu) are linked to their names.

Similar to other Romanian cities, Timișoara underwent large-scale de-/reindustrialization and tertiarization after 1989, which shaped its current urban landscape. The 2008–2009 real estate crisis led to a change in the economic behavior of both investors and home buyers. Post-crisis, a number of peripheral real estate projects have been abandoned, and investors and home buyers have shifted their interest to the available plots within the city. As a result of the economic restructuring process during the 2000s, many industrial areas or isolated factories were demolished and their place was taken by residential complexes and shopping malls.

The 2010s represented a decade in which the city acquainted a period of urban development rebirth. Projects such as Iulius Town and ISHO were put on the map under the form of edge cities indicating the growth of the urban tissue and implicitly of the facilities of the city.

== Culture ==
=== Visual arts ===
In Timișoara there are eight contemporary art galleries, five of which are publicly funded: the Pygmalion Gallery (House of Arts), the geamMAT Gallery of the Art Museum, the Helios Gallery (Fine Artists&#x27; Union), the Mansarda Gallery (Faculty of Arts and Design) and the City Hall Gallery.

=== Performing arts ===

Timișoara is the only city in Europe that has three state theaters in three different languages – the Mihai Eminescu National Theatre, the German State Theatre and the Csiky Gergely Hungarian State Theatre. The three theaters and the National Opera are housed in the Palace of Culture, built between 1871 and 1875 according to the plans of the Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, who designed, among others, the Stadttheater in Vienna, the Népszínház in Budapest and the Opera Theater in Odesa. In 2012, the National Theater built and put into operation the Set Factory, the first professional production line of stage props and theater equipment in Romania. Since 2019, the Serbian language theater has been operating within the Merlin Puppet and Youth Theater.

The Romanian National Opera as an institution in its current form has existed since 1947, when the Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot; opened its first season, on 27 April.

=== Literature ===
Literary life has been revitalized in Timișoara over the last decade: open, public readings of prose and poetry have turned into social-literary experiments and two new literary festivals have been launched – LitVest and Timișoara International Literature Festival.

The literary society &quot;Aktionsgruppe Banat&quot;, founded by German-speaking authors of the Banat Swabian minority, was active in Timișoara between 1972 and 1975. Many of its members also activated in the &quot;Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn&quot; circle, which included, among others, Herta Müller, Horst Samson and Werner Söllner. A recognized literary figure of the underground in Timișoara in the 1980s, Herta Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2009.

=== Music ===
Before having a proper musical society, in Timișoara there was the choral association &quot;Temeswarer Männergesangverein&quot;, founded in 1845. The repertoire of this choir included works of great popularity, belonging mainly to German romantic music. The Philharmonic Society was founded later, in 1871, as a men&#x27;s choral society. The inaugural concert took place on 8 December and included the ballads &quot;Die Frithjof-Saga&quot; by Max Bruch and &quot;Der Taucher&quot; by Heinrich Weidt. Over the years, guest musicians of the Philharmonic Society were invited to perform in Timișoara, among them Franz Liszt, Johann Strauss II, Joseph Haydn, Pablo de Sarasate, Henryk Wieniawski, Johannes Brahms and Béla Bartók. The current Banatul Philharmonic was founded in 1947 by royal decree. The Philharmonic has been organizing the Timișoara Muzicală International Festival since 1968, the longest-running cultural festival in Timișoara.

=== Museums ===
The Art Museum is housed in the Baroque Palace, a Late Baroque building in the Union Square. The exhibition space includes collections of contemporary, decorative and European art. Founded in 1877 and housed in the Huniade Castle, the National Museum of Banat has as fields of activity history and archeology. On the ground floor of the museum there is a reconstruction of the Parța Neolithic Sanctuary dating from the 6th millennium BC. 

The Banat Village Museum is conceived as a traditional village from Banat, a living museum and open-air folk architecture reserve located in the Green Forest; it includes rustic households belonging to various ethnic groups in Banat, buildings with social function of the traditional village (town hall, school and church), technical installations and workshops. The Corneliu Miklosi Public Transport Museum is subordinated to the local public transport company.
Various types of trams are on display, including the first horse-drawn tram and the first electric tram in the city, as well as buses, trolleybuses and vehicle maintenance equipment. There are plans to integrate the museum into a center for art, technology and experiment – MultipleXity. Founded in 1964, the Military Museum operates in the Military Casino in Liberty Square. The museum&#x27;s patrimony consists of over 2,000 exhibits: maps, documents, models of historical monuments, photographs, weapons and military uniforms. In the museum collections owned by the Metropolis of Banat, the Serbian Orthodox Episcopate and the Roman Catholic Diocese there are objects of worship, icons on wood and glass from the 16th–19th centuries, books, manuscripts and old church objects. A future museum dedicated to the Romanian Revolution will be arranged in the building of the former Military Garrison. At present, there is a Memorial of the Revolution, in the collection of which there is written, audio and video information about the events of 1989.

In addition, there are several independent museums in Timișoara, including the Museum of the Communist Consumer, arranged as a typical house of the Golden Age, the museum dedicated to the Romanian cartoonist Popa&#x27;s and the Kindlein Museum, a reenactment of Peter Kindlein&#x27;s jewelry and clock shop and workshop.

=== Festivals ===

In 2013, around 400 cultural manifestations and events (shows, concerts, exhibitions, art and literature salons, festivals, etc.) were organized in Timișoara. Some of these include the music festivals Codru, DISKOteka (largest 1980s and 1990s music festival in Europe), Flight (largest music festival in western Romania), JAZZx, Plai and Vest Fest, the film festivals Ceau, Cinema!, European Film Festival and Festival du Film Français, the theatre festivals Eurothalia, FEST-FDR and TESZT, LitVest (literature festival), the Medieval Festival, the Festival of Hearts (festival of world folklore) and Timișoara Pride Week. The latter was first organized in 2019; it has since become one of the best-attended public events among young people in Timișoara.

== Parks and green spaces ==
Timișoara is known as the &quot;city of parks&quot; for its parks and green spaces. These are mainly located around the old town, forming a green belt along the Bega Canal. At the end of 2009, the area of the city parks was 117.57 ha. In 2015, Timișoara had 16 m2 of green spaces per capita, under the EU recommendation of 26 m2.

One of the most famous parks in Timișoara is the Anton Scudier Central Park, founded in 1850. Since 2009, the park has an Alley of Personalities with 24 bronze statues of local personalities. In 2019 the park was redesigned in the style of the Schönbrunn Gardens in Vienna. Also close to the city center is the Rose Park, which at the beginning of the 20th century earned Timișoara the nickname &quot;city of roses&quot;. The park was inaugurated in 1891 on the occasion of an agro-industrial exhibition, and all the arrangements were made by landscape architect Wilhelm Mühle. The English- and French-style garden stretched over 9 ha and was visited by Emperor Franz Joseph I on 16 September 1891. The current park was arranged between 1928 and 1934, when it was the largest rosary in Southeast Europe, with 1,200 species and varieties of roses. In the park there is also the stage of the summer theater where several festivals, concerts and shows take place. Opposite the Rose Park is the Ion Creangă Children&#x27;s Park. It was inaugurated in the same year as the Rose Park. The delimitation of the two parks was made later, when the area was crossed by the current Michelangelo Street. In 2012 it was redesigned as the largest children&#x27;s playground in the city.

Queen Marie Park, formerly known as the People&#x27;s Park, is the oldest park in Timișoara, established at the initiative of the governor of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, Count Johann von Coronini-Cronberg, in 1852. The Botanical Park, improperly called by the locals the Botanical Garden, is thought of as a dendrological park and was inaugurated in 1986, after a project by the architect Silvia Grumeza. The park contains collection species grouped in eight sectors, depending on the region of origin of the plant. One of the newest parks, the Civic Park was arranged over the former military barracks, demolished between 1956 and 1959. The main attraction of the park is the floral clock, built in 1971.

== Sports ==

The amateur and performance sports activity has an old tradition in Timișoara through sports associations and clubs. The first football game in Timișoara took place on 25 June 1899. Three years later, CA Timișoara – the first football club in Romania – was founded. Traditional teams have been active between the two world wars. Ripensia Timișoara, founded in 1928 and dissolved in 1948, was the first Romanian club to turn professional. In its short history, the club has won four national titles and two national cups. Ripensia Timișoara was re-established in 2012 and currently plays in Liga 2. Chinezul Timișoara (), active between 1910 and 1946, was one of the most successful teams in the history of Romanian football, winning between 1921 and 1927 six consecutive titles of champion of Romania. Currently, in Timișoara there are four football clubs: ACS Poli Timișoara, ASU Politehnica Timișoara, CFR Timișoara and Ripensia Timișoara. SCM Timișoara, a multi-sport club, was founded in 1982 and includes sections for basketball (BC Timișoara), handball (SCM Politehnica Timișoara), rugby (Saracens Timișoara), motorcycling and tennis.

With a capacity of 32,000 seats, Dan Păltinișanu Stadium, home stadium of ACS Poli Timișoara, is the second largest stadium in Romania, after Arena Națională in Bucharest. The current stadium will be demolished in 2021; a multifunctional sports complex with a 36,000-seat arena and a 16,000-seat multipurpose hall will be built in its place. There are three other smaller stadiums: CFR&#x27;s CFR Stadium near Timișoara North railway station, ASU Politehnica&#x27;s Știința Stadium on the campus of the Polytechnic University and Ripensia&#x27;s Electrica Stadium near the Green Forest.

There are many sports centers in the city as well. Most of these facilities are sports halls and swimming pools, many of them built by the municipality in the past several years. The main indoor venue is Constantin Jude Sports Hall, formerly known as Olimpia Hall. Used as a local base for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, handball and futsal teams in the city, the hall hosted matches of EuroBasket Women 2015.

== Mass media ==
=== Print media ===

The first newspaper printed in Timișoara in 1771, edited by typographer Matthias Joseph Heimerl, was called &quot;Temeswarer Nachrichten&quot; and appeared in 13 editions. Between 1830 and 1849, &quot;Temeswarer Wochenblatt&quot; appeared, whose editor was Joseph Klapka, the founder of the first circulating library in the Habsburg monarchy (1815) and mayor of Timișoara between 1819 and 1833. Between 1872 and 1918 the Hungarian-language newspapers &quot;Délmagyarország&quot; and &quot;Temesvári hirlap&quot; appeared. The Serbian minority first appeared on the local media market in 1829 with the &quot;Banatski almanah&quot; (). The first Romanian-language newspapers published in Banat were printed in Vienna and then in Pest, as happened with &quot;Luminatorul&quot; led by Vincențiu Babeș. During the mid-19th century, there was a branch of the state printing house in Vienna, and in 1878 Prince Alexander Karađorđević, fleeing from Serbia, opened a printing house in Iosefin, which he used exclusively for political purposes. The printing activity was boosted at the end of the century, when the manual printing machines, driven by a distribution wheel, were replaced by those driven by electricity, after the establishment of the power plant. The first machine of this kind in Timișoara was a Druckmaschine belonging to the episcopal printing house in the Diocese of Cenad, which was inaugurated in 1891. The outbreak of World War I led to a stagnation of printing activity, but, after the city was taken over by the Romanian authorities, it was revived; in 1920 no less than nine printing houses were known in Timișoara.

The interwar years were marked by numerous political, humorous, medical, cultural, economic, religious, agricultural, commercial or almanac weeklies. Also in the interwar period, numerous bilingual or even trilingual publications appeared. The first publication in Romanian, German and Hungarian was the monthly &quot;Apicultorul – Bienenzüchter – Méhész&quot;. In addition to the publications in the languages spoken in Timișoara, between 1930 and 1936 the Esperanto quarterly &quot;Urmiginta Statoj de Europe&quot; appeared, edited by Josef Zauner, and in 1932 the publication &quot;Tel-Chaj&quot; (טל צ׳ג) was registered, a Jewish bimonthly in Hungarian, but no number appeared. From a catalogue prepared by Florian Moldovan and Alexander Krischan, in the documentary fund of the County Library of Timișoara were registered in the early 1970s no less than 143 newspaper and magazine titles, of which 60 were Romanian, 39 Hungarian and 40 German.

After 1945, but especially since 1948, the number of newspapers and magazines was reduced to a few, all published or under the political control of the Communist Party. There were the following papers in Timișoara between 1970 and 1977: &quot;Drapelul roșu&quot;, &quot;Neue Banater Zeitung&quot; (German language), &quot;Szabad szó&quot; (Hungarian language), &quot;Banatske novine&quot; (magazine, Serbian language) and the literary revue &quot;Orizont&quot;, all of them with an important circulation. Even if the years of 1965–1971 are better known as providing a relative political freedom, press in Romania went away with the control. Media was obliged both to put in light the socialist reality in Romania and to combat the ideological bourgeois influences and retrograde mentality. The cultural revues had to promote the &quot;involved&quot; militant socialist arts and literature and criticize the tendencies to separate the artistic creation from the socialist realities; it was the way the Romanian press became an instrument of the PCR.

Apart from the publications previously censored under communist rule, which quickly changed their orientation under new names, in the first months after the Romanian Revolution, the number of newspaper and magazine titles on the local press market increased dramatically.

Currently, in Timișoara appear:
* dailies: in Romanian: &quot;Renașterea bănățeană&quot; (successor of &quot;Drapelul roșu&quot;), &quot;Timiș Expres&quot; and &quot;Ziua de Vest&quot;; in Hungarian: &quot;Nyugati jelen&quot;;
* one biweekly: &quot;Timpolis&quot;;
* one triweekly: &quot;Timișoara&quot;;
* weeklies: in Romanian: &quot;Opinia Timișoarei&quot; and &quot;Bănățeanul&quot;; in German: &quot;Banater Zeitung&quot; (weekly supplement of &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung für Rumänien&quot;); in Hungarian: &quot;Heti új szó&quot;; in Serbian: &quot;Naša reč&quot;;
* monthly: in Romanian: &quot;Orizont&quot;, &quot;Monitorul Primăriei municipiului Timișoara&quot; and &quot;Agenda Consiliului Județean Timiș&quot;; in Hungarian: &quot;Irodalmi jelen&quot;; in Italian: &quot;Azienda Italia&quot;;
* quarterly: in Romanian: &quot;Orient latin&quot; and &quot;Anotimpuri literare&quot;; in Serbian: &quot;Književni život&quot;;
* annuals: in Romanian: &quot;Almanahul Agenda&quot;; in Hungarian: &quot;Mindenki kalendáriuma&quot;; in German: &quot;Die Stafette&quot;;
* sporadic periodicity: &quot;Helion&quot; magazine of the homonymous science fiction club.
In recent years, more and more publications have given up the printed version, continuing their activity only in the online version.

<doc id="60818" wikidata="Q747872" url="?curid=60818" title="Freidorf">
<text>Freidorf (German for &quot;free village&quot;; ) was one of the first German settlements in Temes County in the Banat, Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, it became part of Romania; since 1950 it is a district of the city of Timișoara, located on the southwest outskirts of the city. Freidorf maintains historic architecture, old Banat Swabian houses, and many green spaces.

== History ==
Traces of Eneolithic habitation have been discovered here since the second half of the 19th century. More recent research has attributed them to the Tiszapolgár and Baden cultures with Coțofeni influences.

According to Hungarian historian , there would have been another village here in the Middle Ages, first mentioned as &quot;Zabadfalua&quot; in 1369, when it was in the possession of a certain Nexa family from Délvidék and the Bésáns of Belinț.
=== German colonization ===

The current Freidorf was originally a German settlement, founded in 1723 and exempt from taxes, which gave it the name Freidorf (&quot;free village&quot; in German). The first settlers came from Alsace, from a village also called Freidorf. They built here a church (1735), a school and a windmill. Initially it was a rather small village, built on the estate of Count , commander of the Timișoara Fortress (1716–1729) after the capitulation of the Ottomans following the siege of 1716, with about 500 inhabitants and little arable land. In 1730, Wallis was transferred to Transylvania, on which occasion the tax office bought back the count&#x27;s estates and Freidorf was obliged to pay taxes.

Although the place was not attractive, being surrounded by swamps, and the living conditions were precarious, the authorities&#x27; plans for Freidorf were increasingly ambitious. Colonization continued in 1732, when silk craftsmen from Italy were brought here. A significant enlargement also took place in 1764, under the Temesvár district chief Knoll.

=== 1848 revolution ===
Freidorf also played an important role during the Hungarian Revolution (1848–1849). The city of Timișoara was besieged by Hungarian troops, but its military leadership remained loyal to the Austrian emperor. The leader of the Hungarian army, Józef Bem, set up camp in Freidorf. He settled in the parish house, while his aides stayed in other houses in the village. Among them was Hungarian national poet, Sándor Petőfi, who was promoted to major in the military camp between Timișoara and Freidorf. In 1889, a monument dedicated to Sándor Petőfi was unveiled. The park that exists today bears his name, and every year, on 15 March, hundreds of Hungarians gather to lay wreaths at the monument.
=== Demographic evolution ===
By 1741, 37 families lived in Freidorf. In 1836, the population was decimated by a cholera epidemic, and starting with 1850, Hungarian and Romanian families began to move into the village. They mainly focused on growing vegetables, raising animals and producing bricks, all production being destined for the expanding nearby city.
=== 20th century ===
The village was officially annexed to Timișoara in 1950. During the communist period, a large industrial platform was built in the area, towards Utvin, which included the Sugar Factory, the Oil Factory and Comtim, and around it several blocks for workers. Also here is the wastewater treatment plant, which was built according to the plans of architect and is still in operation today, since 1912.

==Transport==
===Rail transport===

Rail transport is over a century old in Freidorf. Timișoara–Modoș railway line was inaugurated on 31 July 1897. At that time, it was very important because it connected Timișoara and Zrenjanin, the largest city in Serbian Banat. The first station that Freidorf had (the one put into use in 1897, in the same year as the railway), and which still exists today, is located 340 m southwest of the new station and was built during the 1970s. Currently, the railway that passes through Freidorf is the Timișoara–Cruceni railway (CFR Line 926).

Over time, the station has had several names, depending on the political-historical context. Thus, at the time of the inauguration of the line, the station was called &quot;Szabadfalu&quot; (this being the official name of the locality at that time). In the interwar period, the station in Freidorf was called &quot;Sâmbăta Station&quot;, as appears in the Romanian Railways Maps of 1921 and 1938. After World War II, it was known as &quot;Freidorf&quot;; this name was later changed to the current form – &quot;Timișoara West&quot;.

===Shipping===
The first record of the Bega Canal section at Freidorf dates back to 1796. The condition of the canal is described by the pontoon corporal, Franz Ulrichsberger, in a report of 20 October 1796, written in Timișoara following an inspection carried out by order of the Banat General Military Command: &quot;From Temeswar to Freidorf you can navigate the canal with full load. From Freidorf to Deutschsanktmichael, the fully loaded vessels cannot pass, only if they will be partially unloaded, the cause of the slightly lower water level being that in several places the canal has up to 86 embankments.&quot;

Naval transport, although currently very poorly developed, is still practiced on the Bega Canal. In the past, heavy beet barges came to the canal for the Banat Sugar Factory. The peasants were also brought from the villages on the Bega by various ships to trade the fruits and vegetables in Timișoara. Currently, the works that were started at the Bega Canal, aim to reopen the navigation.

===Road transport===

The car transport is very developed, Freidorf being crossed by the county road 526 that connects the Timișoara with Utvin and Sânmihaiu Român, then continuing to the border with Serbia.

In the past, public transport was provided by tram line 3, which was dismantled in November 2009. Today, Freidorf has the E7 and E7b bus lines.

==Freidorf Industrial Park==
Freidorf Industrial Park was established in 1999 by a decision of the Local Council. Developed on a total area of 63 ha, the park has attracted over the years companies such as ContiTech, Kromberg &amp; Schubert, ELBA, Smithfield, etc.

<doc id="60825" wikidata="Q190528" url="?curid=60825" title="Endorphins">
<text>Endorphins (contracted from endogenous morphine) are peptides produced in the brain that block the perception of pain and increase feelings of wellbeing. They are produced and stored in the pituitary gland of the brain. Endorphins are endogenous painkillers often produced in the brain and adrenal medulla during physical exercise or orgasm and inhibit pain, muscle cramps, and relieve stress.

== History ==
Opioid peptides in the brain were first discovered in 1973 by investigators at the University of Aberdeen, John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz. They isolated &quot;enkephalins&quot; (from the Greek ) from pig brain, identified as Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin. This came after the discovery of a receptor that was proposed to produce the pain-relieving analgesic effects of morphine and other opioids, which led Kosterlitz and Hughes to their discovery of the endogenous opioid ligands. Research during this time was focused on the search for a painkiller that did not have the addictive character or overdose risk of morphine.

Rabi Simantov and Solomon H. Snyder isolated morphine-like peptides from calf brain. Eric J. Simon, who independently discovered opioid receptors, later termed these peptides as endorphins. This term was essentially assigned to any peptide that demonstrated morphine-like activity. In 1976, Choh Hao Li and David Chung recorded the sequences of α-, β-, and γ-endorphin isolated from camel pituitary glands for their opioid activity. Li determined that β-endorphin produced strong analgesic effects. Wilhelm Feldberg and Derek George Smyth in 1977 confirmed this, finding β-endorphin to be more potent than morphine. They also confirmed that its effects were reversed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

Studies have subsequently distinguished between enkephalins, endorphins, and endogenously produced morphine, which is not a peptide. Opioid peptides are classified based on their precursor propeptide: all endorphins are synthesized from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC), encoded by proenkephalin A, and dynorphins encoded by pre-dynorphin.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;endorphin&quot; is derived from / meaning &quot;within&quot; (endogenous, / , &quot;proceeding from within&quot;), and morphine, from Morpheus (), the god of dreams in the Greek mythology. Thus, endorphin is a contraction of &#x27;endo(genous) (mo)rphin&#x27; (morphin being the old spelling of morphine).

== Types ==

The class of endorphins consists of three endogenous opioid peptides: α-endorphin, β-endorphin, and γ-endorphin. The endorphins are all synthesized from the precursor protein, proopiomelanocortin, and all contain a Met-enkephalin motif at their N-terminus: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. α-endorphin and γ-endorphin result from proteolytic cleavage of β-endorphin between the Thr(16)-Leu(17) residues and Leu(17)-Phe(18) respectively. α-endorphin has the shortest sequence, and β-endorphin has the longest sequence.

α-endorphin and γ-endorphin are primarily found in the anterior and intermediate pituitary. While β-endorphin is studied for its opioid activity, α-endorphin and γ-endorphin both lack affinity for opiate receptors and thus do not affect the body in the same way that β-endorphin does. Some studies have characterized α-endorphin activity as similar to that of psychostimulants and γ-endorphin activity to that of neuroleptics separately.

== Synthesis ==
Endorphin precursors are primarily produced in the pituitary gland. All three types of endorphins are fragments of the precursor protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC). At the trans-Golgi network, POMC binds to a membrane-bound protein, carboxypeptidase E (CPE). CPE facilitates POMC transport into immature budding vesicles. In mammals, pro-peptide convertase 1 (PC1) cleaves POMC into adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin (β-LPH). β-LPH, a pituitary hormone with little opiate activity, is then continually fragmented into different peptides, including α-endorphin, β-endorphin, and γ-endorphin. Peptide convertase 2 (PC2) is responsible for cleaving β-LPH into β-endorphin and γ-lipotropin. Formation of α-endorphin and γ-endorphin results from proteolytic cleavage of β-endorphin.

==Regulation==
Noradrenaline has been shown to increase endorphins production within inflammatory tissues, resulting in an analgesic effect; the stimulation of sympathetic nerves by electro-acupuncture is believed to be the cause of its analgesic effects.

== Mechanism of action ==
Endorphins are released from the pituitary gland, typically in response to pain, and can act in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the PNS, β-endorphin is the primary endorphin released from the pituitary gland. Endorphins inhibit transmission of pain signals by binding μ-receptors of peripheral nerves, which block their release of neurotransmitter substance P. The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In turn, inhibition of GABA increases the production and release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward learning.

== Functions ==
Endorphins play a major role in the body&#x27;s inhibitory response to pain. Research has demonstrated that meditation by trained individuals can be used to trigger endorphin release. Laughter may also stimulate endorphin production and elevate one&#x27;s pain threshold.

Endorphin production can be triggered by vigorous aerobic exercise. The release of β-endorphin has been postulated to contribute to the phenomenon known as &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot;. However, several studies have supported the hypothesis that the runner&#x27;s high is due to the release of endocannabinoids rather than that of endorphins. Endorphins may contribute to the positive effect of exercise on anxiety and depression. The same phenomenon may also play a role in exercise addiction. Regular intense exercise may cause the brain to downregulate the production of endorphins in periods of rest to maintain homeostasis, causing a person to exercise more intensely in order to receive the same feeling.

<text>Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator (; 70/69 BC10 August 30 BC) was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and the last active Hellenistic pharaoh. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean, which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).

Born in Alexandria, Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes, who named her his heir before his death in 51 BC. Cleopatra began her reign alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII, but falling-out between them led to a civil war. Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt after losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus against his rival Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, in Caesar&#x27;s civil war. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII had him ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy XIII&#x27;s forces besieged Cleopatra and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers, and maintained a private affair with Cleopatra which produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar&#x27;s villa. After Caesar&#x27;s assassination, followed shortly afterwards by the sudden death of Ptolemy XIV (possibly murdered on Cleopatra&#x27;s order), she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.

In the Liberators&#x27; civil war of 43–42 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar&#x27;s heir Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. Antony became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various territories under Antony&#x27;s authority. Octavian portrayed this event as an act of treason, forced Antony&#x27;s allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium, Octavian&#x27;s forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony&#x27;s suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession, she killed herself by poisoning (contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp).

Cleopatra&#x27;s legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include Roman busts, paintings, and sculptures, cameo carvings and glass, Ptolemaic and Roman coinage, and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art, she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, burlesque satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.

==Etymology==
The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;glory of her father&quot;, from (, &quot;glory&quot;) and (, &quot;father&quot;). The masculine form would have been written either as () or (). Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great&#x27;s sister Cleopatra of Macedonia, as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology, Cleopatra Alcyone. Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra&#x27;s adopted title () means &quot;goddess who loves her father&quot;.

==Background==
Ptolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis, but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria, established by Alexander the Great. They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language. In contrast, Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language. Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian, the language of the &quot;Troglodytes&quot;, Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, the Syrian language (perhaps Syriac), Median, and Parthian, and she could apparently also speak Latin, although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek. Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra&#x27;s desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.

Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra. When her grandfather Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III. With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II, an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla. Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination. Ptolemy XI, and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I, willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans, giving the Romans legal grounds to take over Egypt, their client state, after the assassination of Ptolemy XI. The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX, bestowing Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes and Cyprus on another namesake son.

== Biography ==

===Early childhood===

Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, presumably Ptolemy XII&#x27;s wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), the mother of Cleopatra&#x27;s older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia. Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC. The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra&#x27;s sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra&#x27;s childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.

===Reign and exile of Ptolemy XII===


In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected. Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC. However, Ptolemy XII&#x27;s profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.

In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, Ptolemy XII&#x27;s brother, to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos. Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which, along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans, damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies. Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force, traveling first to Rhodes, then Athens, and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills, near Praeneste, Italy.

Ptolemy XII spent roughly up to a year there on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra, then about 11. Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy, an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters. When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.

The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power. Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius, the Roman governor of Syria, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000 talents for the proposed mission. Although it put him at odds with Roman law, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea, where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean, father of Herod the Great, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies. As a young cavalry officer, Mark Antony was under Gabinius&#x27;s command. He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion, and for rescuing the body of Archelaos, the husband of Berenice IV, after he was killed in battle, ensuring him a proper royal burial. Cleopatra, then 14 years of age, would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.
Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority, for which he was acquitted, but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile, from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar. Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt, but Crassus was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties. He allowed Gabinius&#x27;s largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison, the Gabiniani, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.

Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources. Despite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera, and stabilized the economy. On 31 May 52 BC, Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII, as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s debt by the time of the latter&#x27;s death, and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.

=== Reign ===

==== Accession to the throne ====

Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt. Inheriting her father&#x27;s debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas.

In 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt, most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians. The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra&#x27;s court. Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate. Bibulus, siding with Pompey in Caesar&#x27;s Civil War, failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece, which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.

By 29 August 51 BC, official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler. She had probably married him, but there is no record of this. The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II. A long-held royal Egyptian practice, it was loathed by contemporary Greeks. By the reign of Cleopatra, however, it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.

Despite Cleopatra&#x27;s rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies, notably the eunuch Potheinos, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas, a prominent military commander, and Theodotus of Chios, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.

==== Assassination of Pompey ====
In the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey&#x27;s son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius&#x27;s request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome. Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes. By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt. She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother&#x27;s forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.

In Greece, Caesar and Pompey&#x27;s forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey&#x27;s army and his forced flight to Tyre, Lebanon. Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces. Ptolemy XIII&#x27;s advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war. In a scheme devised by Theodotus, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC. Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey&#x27;s head, severed and embalmed, sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace. Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.

==== Relationship with Julius Caesar ====

Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar&#x27;s demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit. Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.

When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot, but he was arrested by Caesar, who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd. Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria, where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII—previously possessed by Pompey—naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs. Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.

Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter&#x27;s army of 20,000, including the Gabiniani, could most likely defeat Caesar&#x27;s army of 4,000 unsupported troops, Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra. After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos, Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen, but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army. Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV. The resulting siege of the palace, with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside, lasted into the following year of 47 BC.
Sometime between January and March of 47 BC, Caesar&#x27;s reinforcements arrived, including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean. Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile, where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat, but it capsized, and he drowned. Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia, by Marcus Junius Brutus, and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar&#x27;s triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar&#x27;s child since September 48 BC.

Caesar&#x27;s term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC. However, Antony, an officer of his, helped to secure Caesar&#x27;s appointment as dictator lasting for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt. Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra&#x27;s sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler, Caesar appointed the 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar. The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC.

Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments, although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event. The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of &quot;Thalamegos&quot;, the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV, which during his reign measured in length and in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and promenades along its two decks, resembling a floating villa. Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas, and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.

Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC, allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus, the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia. It is possible that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia, also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son. He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the freedman Rufio, to secure Cleopatra&#x27;s tenuous position, but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.
Caesarion, Cleopatra&#x27;s alleged child with Caesar, was born sometime in 47, possibly on 23 June 47 BC if stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara that mentions &quot;King Caesar&quot; refers to him. Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private). Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion&#x27;s parentage, naming Caesar as the father.

Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion, and were given lodging in Caesar&#x27;s villa within the Horti Caesaris. As with their father Ptolemy XII, Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of &quot;friend and ally of the Roman people&quot; (), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome. Cleopatra&#x27;s visitors at Caesar&#x27;s villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero, who found her arrogant. Sosigenes of Alexandria, one of the members of Cleopatra&#x27;s court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar, put into effect 1January 45 BC. The Temple of Venus Genetrix, established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar&#x27;s child directly with the goddess Venus, mother of the Romans. The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.

Cleopatra&#x27;s presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesar&#x27;s assassination. Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesar&#x27;s head, but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public&#x27;s mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship. Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred. Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar&#x27;s heir. However, Caesar&#x27;s will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir, and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt. 

It is suggested, based on Cicero&#x27;s letter, that Cleopatra might have been pregnant at that time with her and Caesar&#x27;s second child; if so, this potential pregnancy ended in loss of a baby. A few months later, Cleopatra allegedly had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning, elevating her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.

==== Liberators&#x27; civil war ====
Octavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar&#x27;s assassins to justice. Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar&#x27;s assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.

While Serapion, Cleopatra&#x27;s governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships, Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting. By the autumn of 42 BC, Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar&#x27;s assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece, leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.

By the end of 42 BC, Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized. In the summer of 41 BC, Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters, which she rebuffed until Antony&#x27;s envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come. The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant, but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen. Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in &quot;Thalamegos&quot;, hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship. Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria, and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister, Arsinoe IV, executed at Ephesus. Cleopatra&#x27;s former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.

==== Relationship with Mark Antony ====
Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra&#x27;s ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.

Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar&#x27;s demise. With his powers as a triumvir, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands, which were currently in Roman hands, to Cleopatra. While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatra&#x27;s control by 19 November 38 BC, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41–40 BC, during her time spent with Antony.

By the spring of 40 BC, Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus, a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire. Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. She would not see Antony again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence, and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp. By the end of 40 BC, Cleopatra had given birth to twins, a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children. Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.
Mark Antony&#x27;s Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War (41–40 BC), initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra, but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra&#x27;s meeting with Antony at Tarsos. Fulvia and Antony&#x27;s brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia (modern Perugia, Italy) and then exiled from Italy, after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC. Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony&#x27;s control of the Roman Republic&#x27;s territories east of the Ionian Sea, it also stipulated that he concede Italia, Hispania, and Gaul, and marry Octavian&#x27;s sister Octavia the Younger, a potential rival for Cleopatra.

In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea. Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty. The latter had imprisoned Herod&#x27;s brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra&#x27;s court. Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea. This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.

Relations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but also sired her two children, Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC, and moved his headquarters to Athens. However, Cleopatra&#x27;s position in Egypt was secure. Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra. Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum, where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC. With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Antony traveled to Antioch, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.

Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod&#x27;s kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign. Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s ambitious plans for the future. In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra&#x27;s domain, he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him, yet would ultimately outlast him.

In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant, including nearly all of Phoenicia (Lebanon) minus Tyre and Sidon, which remained in Roman hands. She also received Ptolemais Akko (modern Acre, Israel), a city that was established by Ptolemy II. Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids, she was granted the region of Coele-Syria along the upper Orontes River. She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod. At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I (a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, including Ailana (modern Aqaba, Jordan). To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast, as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete. Although still administered by Roman officials, these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating her coinage in 36 BC.
Antony&#x27;s enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian, who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic. Octavian, fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia, granted both her and Livia, his own wife, extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity. Some 50 years before, Cornelia Africana, daughter of Scipio Africanus, had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her. She was now followed by Octavia and Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra&#x27;s, erected by Caesar.

In 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire. She then returned to Egypt, perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy. By the summer of 36 BC, she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus, her second son with Antony.

Antony&#x27;s Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons, in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia, who defected to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men, more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus (modern Beirut, Lebanon) in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.

==== Donations of Alexandria ====

As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses. Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony&#x27;s household. Octavian&#x27;s confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.

Dellius was sent as Antony&#x27;s envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian king&#x27;s daughter to Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra. When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family. Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph, dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra, who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais. News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.
In an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion, King of Kings, while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia, Media, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphus was declared king of Syria and Cilicia. Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene. Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony. Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view.

In late 34 BC, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years. Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy, while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian. The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustan-period literature through to various media in modern times. Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homer&#x27;s Helen of Troy in destroying civilization. Pliny the Elder claims in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet. The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.

A papyrus document dated to February 33 BC, later used to wrap a mummy, contains the signature of Cleopatra, probably written by an official authorized to sign for her. It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassus, a former Roman consul and Antony&#x27;s confidant who would command his land forces at Actium. A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads &quot;make it happen&quot; or &quot;so be it&quot; (); this is likely the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.

==== Battle of Actium ====

In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Before Antony and Octavian&#x27;s joint &quot;imperium&quot; expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls. Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.

Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire. Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian&#x27;s propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian. Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch. Cleopatra refused Antony&#x27;s requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt. Cleopatra&#x27;s insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans, such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.

During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens, where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce. This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony&#x27;s will, invested with the Vestal Virgins. Although a violation of sacred and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta, and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian highlighted parts of the will, such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic. In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius. Octavian&#x27;s legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC. With Antony&#x27;s will made public, Octavian had his &quot;casus belli&quot;, and Rome declared war on Cleopatra, not Antony. The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra&#x27;s territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony&#x27;s triumviral authority had expired.

Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian, but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s navy were not all well-trained, some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force. Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium, but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly. Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece, and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium, on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.

Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings, but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod, and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign. They also lost the support of Malichus I, which would prove to have strategic consequences. Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC, while defections to Octavian&#x27;s camp continued, including Antony&#x27;s long-time companion Dellius and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia. While some in Antony&#x27;s camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland, Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation, to keep Octavian&#x27;s fleet away from Egypt.

On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium. Cleopatra, aboard her flagship, the &quot;Antonias&quot;, commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet, in what was likely a move by Antony&#x27;s officers to marginalize her during the battle. Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy, which Cleopatra, ever concerned about defending Egypt, used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.

Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible. Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship, identified by its distinctive purple sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron. Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her. The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3September, and was followed by massive defections of officers, troops, and allied kings to Octavian&#x27;s side.

===Downfall and death===


While Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt. The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory. She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion. It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.

Lucius Pinarius, Mark Antony&#x27;s appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony&#x27;s messengers could arrive at his court. Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian&#x27;s side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain. Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers. In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the &quot;Timoneion&quot;, after the philosopher Timon of Athens, who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy. Herod, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony. Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.

Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion. Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him, take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea, and then set sail to a foreign port, perhaps in India, where she could spend time recuperating. However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I, as advised by Octavian&#x27;s governor of Syria, Quintus Didius, managed to burn Cleopatra&#x27;s fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated. Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian. Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.
Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the &quot;ephebi&quot;, which, along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt. In a show of solidarity, Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus, his son with Fulvia, enter the &quot;ephebi&quot; at the same time. Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra. Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt, offered Octavian money in the future, and immediately sent him lavish gifts. Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction. Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared, but when Antony suspected foul intent, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.

After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC, stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia, where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies. Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while Cornelius Gallus, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony&#x27;s forces near Paraitonion. Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria, but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian&#x27;s tired troops outside the city&#x27;s hippodrome. However, on 1 August 30 BC, Antony&#x27;s naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by Antony&#x27;s cavalry.

Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide. In despair, Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53. According to Plutarch, he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb, telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian&#x27;s companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage. It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures. Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.
Octavian entered Alexandria, occupied the palace, and seized Cleopatra&#x27;s three youngest children. When she met with Octavian, Cleopatra told him bluntly, &quot;I will not be led in a triumph&quot; (), according to Livy, a rare recording of her exact words. Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom. When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. It is unclear if Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide on 10 August 30 BC, at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb. It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion, who also took their own lives.

Octavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb. Cleopatra&#x27;s physician, Olympos, did not explain her cause of death, although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her. Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (, ,  &#x27;spine, cheese-grater&#x27;) was used to introduce the toxin by scratching, while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (, ), and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind. Meanwhile, Horace corroborates the common belief that it was a venomous snake, but instead states that it was multiple (serpentēs, lit.&#x27;serpents&#x27;). Vergil also agrees with the take of it being multiple serpents. Both this and Horace&#x27;s account suggest that this belief stemmed from Octavian&#x27;s propaganda. No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.

Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia, Ethiopia, or India. Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC, after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Roman province of Egypt was established, marking the end of the Hellenistic period. In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus (&quot;the revered&quot;) and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.

==Cleopatra&#x27;s kingdom and role as a monarch==

Following the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom. She was the chief religious authority in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths. She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.

Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain, tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign. A study suggested that volcanic eruptions caused the unfavourable climate and that this contributed to Cleopatra&#x27;s demise, although others expressed skepticism about this hypothesis. Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality, the government attempted to impose price controls, tariffs, and state monopolies for certain goods, fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons. Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage, which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.

==Legacy==
===Children and successors===
After her suicide, Cleopatra&#x27;s three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian&#x27;s sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian. Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC. The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point. Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I&#x27;s support of Pompey.

The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, after their wedding in 25 BC, as the new rulers of Mauretania, where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital, renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell, Algeria). Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars, artists, and advisers from her mother&#x27;s royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea, now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture. She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania, in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.

Cleopatra Selene II died , and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy. However, Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD, perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor. Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, although Queen Zenobia, of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century, claimed descent from Cleopatra. A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe, an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis, explained that he &quot;overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold.&quot;

===Roman literature and historiography===

Although almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies. Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the &quot;Life of Antonius&quot; written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra&#x27;s life. Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources, such as Philotas of Amphissa, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra&#x27;s personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Plutarch&#x27;s work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports.

The Jewish Roman historian Josephus, writing in the 1st century AD, provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great. However, this work relies largely on Herod&#x27;s memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus, the tutor of Cleopatra&#x27;s children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod&#x27;s court. The &quot;Roman History&quot; published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD, while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra&#x27;s reign.
Cleopatra is barely mentioned in , the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar. The writings of Cicero, who knew her personally, provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra. The Augustan-period authors Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime, although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama. Horace also viewed Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide as a positive choice, an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.

The historians Strabo, Velleius, Valerius Maximus, Pliny the Elder, and Appian, while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch, Josephus, or Dio, provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records. Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatra&#x27;s point of view, but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works. The fragmentary &quot;Libyka&quot; commissioned by Cleopatra&#x27;s son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra&#x27;s perspective.

Cleopatra&#x27;s gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient, medieval, and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman world. For instance, the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree. Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress, she had only two known sexual partners, Caesar and Antony, the two most prominent Romans of the time period, who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty. Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.

===Cultural depictions===
====Depictions in ancient art====
=====Statues=====

Cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles. Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, as well as ancient carved cameos, such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin. Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple. It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar&#x27;s patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.

A life-sized Roman-style statue of Cleopatra was found near the , Rome, along the , and is now housed in the , part of the Vatican Museums. Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Antonius&quot;, said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus, but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2,000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.

Since the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the &quot;Esquiline Venus&quot;—discovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the of the Capitoline Museums—is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue&#x27;s , apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base. Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite). However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis, while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite. She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos. The &quot;Esquiline Venus&quot; is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD Roman copy of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.

=====Coinage portraits=====

Surviving coinage of Cleopatra&#x27;s reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC. Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins. Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency. Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband. These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple.

Her strong, almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother, softer, and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles. Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II (316–260 BC) and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti. It is likely, due to political expediency, that Antony&#x27;s visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.

The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek, but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins, in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones. These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture, and perhaps also a statement to their subjects, however ambiguous to modern scholars, about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other. Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra, in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony, made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler. Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony, such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant, which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.

Various coins, such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatra&#x27;s marriage with Antony in 37 BC, depict her wearing a royal diadem and a &#x27;melon&#x27; hairstyle. The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads. This hairstyle, with hair braided back into a bun, is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage. After her visit to Rome in 46–44 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles, but it was abandoned for a more modest, austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.

=====Greco-Roman busts and heads=====

Of the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, the sculpture known as the &quot;&quot;, located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the &quot;&quot;, located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose. Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.

Both heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy, the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra&#x27;s coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose.

A third accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell, Algeria. This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads, but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Cleopatra. A possible Parian-marble sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums. Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC, it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.

Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum, London, made of limestone, which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome. The woman in has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose), but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle. However, the British Museum head, once belonging to a full statue, could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome. Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head, along with those in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, the Capitoline Museums, and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen, while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem, most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra&#x27;s popular hairstyle.

=====Paintings=====
In the at Pompeii, Italy, a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion. The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra. This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii.

The woman in the painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra, which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid&#x27;s arm may have been torn off. The room with the painting was walled off by its owner, perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian, when public depictions of Cleopatra&#x27;s son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.

Behind her golden diadem, crowned with a red jewel, is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the &quot;melon&quot; hairstyle favored by the queen. Her ivory-white skin, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities. Roller affirms that &quot;there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.&quot;
Another painting from Pompeii, dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II, contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion, both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide. The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba, who toward the end of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa, King of Numidia. Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family, Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates, and Cleopatra&#x27;s own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.

Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made, while Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide was far more famous. An asp is absent from the painting, but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite. A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting, positioned very high above the people in it, suggests the described layout of Cleopatra&#x27;s tomb in Alexandria. A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile (possibly an elaborate tray handle), while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.

In 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa, near Tivoli, Lazio, Italy, that depicted Cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest. A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third wax and two-thirds resin. The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra&#x27;s bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits. A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period, as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers, as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns. After Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide, Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake, parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome. The portrait painting of Cleopatra&#x27;s death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa, where it was found in an Egyptian temple.
A Roman panel painting from Herculaneum, Italy, dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra. In it she wears a royal diadem, red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun, pearl-studded hairpins, and earrings with ball-shaped pendants, the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background. Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage. A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery, such as a Greek-style sphinx, and may have been created by the same artist.

=====Portland Vase=====

The Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony. In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs, Eros floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom. The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus. The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.

=====Native Egyptian art=====
The &quot;Bust of Cleopatra&quot; in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style. Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt. The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art. The Dendera Temple complex, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods. Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.

A large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring in height, now in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, is thought to represent Arsinoe II, wife of Ptolemy II, but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress, an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt. The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided, double cornucopia (&quot;dikeras&quot;), which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra. In his (2006), contends that this basalt statue, like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance. Adrian Goldsworthy writes that, despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style, Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only &quot;perhaps for certain rites&quot; and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch, which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.

====Medieval and Early Modern reception====
In modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture, a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films. This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public&#x27;s view of Cleopatra than the latter. The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, in &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages. His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining knight engaged in courtly love, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.

Chaucer highlighted Cleopatra&#x27;s relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in and , Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio. The Renaissance humanist , in his 1504 &quot;Libretto apologetico delle donne&quot;, was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio&#x27;s works. Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra, such as the 10th-century &quot;Meadows of Gold&quot; by Al-Masudi, although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide.

Cleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts, such as a depiction of her and Antony lying in a Gothic-style tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 1409. In the visual arts, the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria. Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo, as well as 15th-century woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccio&#x27;s works.

In the performing arts, the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra, inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in 1607. He was followed by William Shakespeare, whose &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, largely based on Plutarch, was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England&#x27;s own Virgin Queen. Cleopatra was also featured in operas, such as George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1724 &quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot;, which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra; Domenico Cimarosa wrote &quot;Cleopatra&quot; on a similar subject in 1789.

====Modern depictions and brand imaging====

In Victorian Britain, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, lithographs, postcards and cigarettes. Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1889) and Théophile Gautier&#x27;s &quot;One of Cleopatra&#x27;s Nights&quot; (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy. The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra, while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnand&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.

Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; was considered canonical by the Victorian era. Its popularity led to the perception that the 1885 painting by Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus, although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria. Also based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play was Samuel Barber&#x27;s opera &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1966), commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House. In his unfinished 1825 short story &quot;The Egyptian Nights&quot;, Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian Aurelius Victor, previously largely ignored, that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives. Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East, as the Qing-dynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.

Georges Méliès&#x27;s &quot;Robbing Cleopatra&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (), an 1899 French silent horror film, was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra. Hollywood films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media, which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1917), Claudette Colbert in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934), and Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963). In addition to her portrayal as a &quot;vampire&quot; queen, Bara&#x27;s Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century Orientalist painting, such as despotic behavior, mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality. Colbert&#x27;s character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s, targeting female moviegoers. In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra, women&#x27;s magazines of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup, clothes, jewelry, and hairstyles to achieve the &quot;Egyptian&quot; look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti. By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three films, two hundred plays and novels, forty-five operas, and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.

===Written works===

Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD. Ingrid D. Rowland, who highlights that the &quot;Berenice called Cleopatra&quot; cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra. Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by Galen, including remedies for hair disease, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes. Aëtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra, while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.

==Ancestry==

Cleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, their European origins tracing back to northern Greece. Through her father, she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia. While Cleopatra&#x27;s paternal line can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain. She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena, the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.

Cleopatra I Syra was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry. Her mother Laodice III was a daughter born to King Mithridates II of Pontus, a Persian of the Mithridatic dynasty, and his wife Laodice who had a mixed Greek-Persian heritage. Cleopatra I Syra&#x27;s father Antiochus III the Great was a descendant of Queen Apama, the Sogdian Iranian wife of Seleucus I Nicator. It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians. Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and &quot;would have described herself as Greek&quot;.

Stacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress. Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship), but contends that whatever Cleopatra&#x27;s ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most. Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman &quot;but as a civilized Greek&quot;.

Claims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her. Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII&#x27;s children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate. Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII&#x27;s three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife. The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra&#x27;s immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.

The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband, Ptolemy XII, but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead. The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII&#x27;s wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII&#x27;s exile in Rome).

<text>In particle physics, a lepton is an elementary particle of half-integer spin (spin ) that does not undergo strong interactions. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons or muons), including the electron, muon, and tauon, and neutral leptons, better known as neutrinos. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best known of all leptons is the electron.

There are six types of leptons, known as &quot;flavours&quot;, grouped in three &quot;generations&quot;. The first-generation leptons, also called &quot;electronic leptons&quot;, comprise the electron () and the electron neutrino (); the second are the &quot;muonic leptons&quot;, comprising the muon () and the muon neutrino (); and the third are the &quot;tauonic leptons&quot;, comprising the tau () and the tau neutrino (). Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high-energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators).

Leptons have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, spin, and mass. Unlike quarks, however, leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, but they are subject to the other three fundamental interactions: gravitation, the weak interaction, and to electromagnetism, of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.

For every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be their own antiparticle. It is not currently known whether this is the case.

The first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in the mid-19th century by several scientists and was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. The next lepton to be observed was the muon, discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936, which was classified as a meson at the time. After investigation, it was realized that the muon did not have the expected properties of a meson, but rather behaved like an electron, only with higher mass. It took until 1947 for the concept of &quot;leptons&quot; as a family of particles to be proposed. The first neutrino, the electron neutrino, was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain certain characteristics of beta decay. It was first observed in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment conducted by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. The muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 by Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger, and the tau discovered between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl and his colleagues from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The tau neutrino remained elusive until July 2000, when the DONUT collaboration from Fermilab announced its discovery.

Leptons are an important part of the Standard Model. Electrons are one of the components of atoms, alongside protons and neutrons. Exotic atoms with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, as well as lepton–antilepton particles such as positronium.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;lepton&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;leptós&quot;, &quot;fine, small, thin&quot; (neuter nominative/accusative singular form: λεπτόν &quot;leptón&quot;); the earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek , &quot;re-po-to&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script. &quot;Lepton&quot; was first used by physicist Léon Rosenfeld in 1948:
Following a suggestion of Prof. C. Møller, I adopt—as a pendant to &quot;nucleon&quot;—the denomination &quot;lepton&quot; (from λεπτός, small, thin, delicate) to denote a particle of small mass.

Rosenfeld chose the name as the common name for electrons and (then hypothesized) neutrinos. Additionally, the muon, initially classified as a meson, was reclassified as a lepton in the 1950s. The masses of those particles are small compared to nucleons—the mass of an electron () and the mass of a muon (with a value of ) are fractions of the mass of the &quot;heavy&quot; proton (), and the mass of a neutrino is nearly zero. However, the mass of the tau (discovered in the mid-1970s) () is nearly twice that of the proton and times that of the electron.

== History ==


The first lepton identified was the electron, discovered by J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists in 1897. Then in 1930, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the electron neutrino to preserve conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum in beta decay. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the initial and observed final particles. The electron neutrino was simply called the neutrino, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours (or different &quot;generations&quot;).

Nearly 40 years after the discovery of the electron, the muon was discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936. Due to its mass, it was initially categorized as a meson rather than a lepton. It later became clear that the muon was much more similar to the electron than to mesons, as muons do not undergo the strong interaction, and thus the muon was reclassified: electrons, muons, and the (electron) neutrino were grouped into a new group of particles—the leptons. In 1962, Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the muon neutrino, which earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize, although by then the different flavours of neutrino had already been theorized.

The tau was first detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his colleagues at the SLAC LBL group. Like the electron and the muon, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino. The first evidence for tau neutrinos came from the observation of &quot;missing&quot; energy and momentum in tau decay, analogous to the &quot;missing&quot; energy and momentum in beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab, making it the second-to-latest particle of the Standard Model to have been directly observed, with Higgs boson being discovered in 2012.

Although all present data is consistent with three generations of leptons, some particle physicists are searching for a fourth generation. The current lower limit on the mass of such a fourth charged lepton is , while its associated neutrino would have a mass of at least .

== Properties ==

=== Spin and chirality ===
Leptons are spin  particles. The spin-statistics theorem thus implies that they are fermions and thus that they are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle: no two leptons of the same species can be in the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.

A closely related property is chirality, which in turn is closely related to a more easily visualized property called helicity. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its momentum; particles with spin in the same direction as their momentum are called &quot;right-handed&quot; and they are otherwise called &quot;left-handed&quot;. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is the same in every reference frame, whereas for massive particles it is possible to &#x27;overtake&#x27; the particle by choosing a faster-moving reference frame; in the faster frame, the helicity is reversed. Chirality is a technical property, defined through transformation behaviour under the Poincaré group, that does not change with reference frame. It is contrived to agree with helicity for massless particles, and is still well defined for particles with mass.

In many quantum field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, left- and right-handed fermions are identical. However, the Standard Model&#x27;s weak interaction treats left-handed and right-handed fermions differently: only left-handed fermions (and right-handed anti-fermions) participate in the weak interaction. This is an example of parity violation explicitly written into the model. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital subscript (e.g. the normal electron e) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital subscript (e.g. a positron e).

Right-handed neutrinos and left-handed anti-neutrinos have no possible interaction with other particles (see &quot;Sterile neutrino&quot;) and so are not a functional part of the Standard Model, although their exclusion is not a strict requirement; they are sometimes listed in particle tables to emphasize that they would have no active role if included in the model. Even though electrically charged right-handed particles (electron, muon, or tau) do not engage in the weak interaction specifically, they can still interact electrically, and hence still participate in the combined electroweak force, although with different strengths (W).
=== Electromagnetic interaction ===

One of the most prominent properties of leptons is their electric charge, . The electric charge determines the strength of their electromagnetic interactions. It determines the strength of the electric field generated by the particle (see Coulomb&#x27;s law) and how strongly the particle reacts to an external electric or magnetic field (see Lorentz force). Each generation contains one lepton with and one lepton with zero electric charge. The lepton with electric charge is commonly simply referred to as a &quot;charged lepton&quot; while a neutral lepton is called a &quot;neutrino&quot;. For example, the first generation consists of the electron with a negative electric charge and the electrically neutral electron neutrino .

In the language of quantum field theory, the electromagnetic interaction of the charged leptons is expressed by the fact that the particles interact with the quantum of the electromagnetic field, the photon. The Feynman diagram of the electron–photon interaction is shown on the right.

Because leptons possess an intrinsic rotation in the form of their spin, charged leptons generate a magnetic field. The size of their magnetic dipole moment is given by
: formula_1
where is the mass of the lepton and is the so-called &quot; factor&quot; for the lepton. First-order quantum mechanical approximation predicts that the  factor is 2 for all leptons. However, higher-order quantum effects caused by loops in Feynman diagrams introduce corrections to this value. These corrections, referred to as the &quot;anomalous magnetic dipole moment&quot;, are very sensitive to the details of a quantum field theory model, and thus provide the opportunity for precision tests of the Standard Model. The theoretical and measured values for the &quot;electron&quot; anomalous magnetic dipole moment are within agreement within eight significant figures. The results for the &quot;muon&quot;, however, are problematic, hinting at a small, persistent discrepancy between the Standard Model and experiment.

=== Weak interaction ===

In the Standard Model, the left-handed charged lepton and the left-handed neutrino are arranged in doublet that transforms in the spinor representation () of the weak isospin SU(2) gauge symmetry. This means that these particles are eigenstates of the isospin projection with eigenvalues and respectively. In the meantime, the right-handed charged lepton transforms as a weak isospin scalar () and thus does not participate in the weak interaction, while there is no evidence that a right-handed neutrino exists at all.

The Higgs mechanism recombines the gauge fields of the weak isospin SU(2) and the weak hypercharge U(1) symmetries to three massive vector bosons (, , ) mediating the weak interaction, and one massless vector boson, the photon (γ), responsible for the electromagnetic interaction. The electric charge can be calculated from the isospin projection and weak hypercharge through the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula,

To recover the observed electric charges for all particles, the left-handed weak isospin doublet must thus have , while the right-handed isospin scalar must have . The interaction of the leptons with the massive weak interaction vector bosons is shown in the figure on the right.

=== Mass ===
In the Standard Model, each lepton starts out with no intrinsic mass. The charged leptons (i.e. the electron, muon, and tau) obtain an effective mass through interaction with the Higgs field, but the neutrinos remain massless. For technical reasons, the masslessness of the neutrinos implies that there is no mixing of the different generations of charged leptons as there is for quarks. The zero mass of neutrino is in close agreement with current direct experimental observations of the mass.

However, it is known from indirect experiments—most prominently from observed neutrino oscillations—that neutrinos have to have a nonzero mass, probably less than . This implies the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called seesaw mechanism, which would explain both why the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why we have not yet seen any right-handed neutrinos.

=== Lepton flavor quantum numbers ===

The members of each generation&#x27;s weak isospin doublet are assigned leptonic numbers that are conserved under the Standard Model. Electrons and electron neutrinos have an &quot;electronic number&quot; of , while muons and muon neutrinos have a &quot;muonic number&quot; of , while tau particles and tau neutrinos have a &quot;tauonic number&quot; of . The antileptons have their respective generation&#x27;s leptonic numbers of −1.

Conservation of the leptonic numbers means that the number of leptons of the same type remains the same, when particles interact. This implies that leptons and antileptons must be created in pairs of a single generation. For example, the following processes are allowed under conservation of leptonic numbers:
:  →   + ,
but none of these:
:  →   + ,

However, neutrino oscillations are known to violate the conservation of the individual leptonic numbers. Such a violation is considered to be smoking gun evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. A much stronger conservation law is the conservation of the total number of leptons ( ), conserved even in the case of neutrino oscillations, but even it is still violated by a tiny amount by the chiral anomaly.

== Universality ==
The coupling of leptons to all types of gauge boson are flavour-independent: The interaction between leptons and a gauge boson measures the same for each lepton. This property is called lepton universality and has been tested in measurements of the muon and tau lifetimes and of boson partial decay widths, particularly at the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) and Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) experiments.

The decay rate () of muons through the process is approximately given by an expression of the form (see muon decay for more details)
: formula_2
where is some constant, and is the Fermi coupling constant. The decay rate of tau particles through the process is given by an expression of the same form
: formula_3
where is some other constant. Muon–tauon universality implies that . On the other hand, electron–muon universality implies
: formula_4

The branching ratios for the electronic mode (17.82%) and muonic (17.39%) mode of tau decay are not equal due to the mass difference of the final state leptons.

Universality also accounts for the ratio of muon and tau lifetimes. The lifetime formula_5 of a lepton formula_6 (with formula_6 = &quot; or &quot;) is related to the decay rate by
: formula_8,
where formula_9 denotes the branching ratios and formula_10 denotes the resonance width of the process formula_11 with and replaced by two different particles from &quot; or &quot; or &quot;&quot;.

The ratio of tau and muon lifetime is thus given by
: formula_12

Using values from the 2008 &quot;Review of Particle Physics&quot; for the branching ratios of the muon and tau yields a lifetime ratio of ~ , comparable to the measured lifetime ratio of ~ . The difference is due to and not &quot;actually&quot; being constants: They depend slightly on the mass of leptons involved.

Recent tests of lepton universality in meson decays, performed by the LHCb, BaBar, and Belle experiments, have shown consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions. However the combined statistical and systematic significance is not yet high enough to claim an observation of new physics.

In July 2021 results on lepton flavour universality have been published testing W decays, previous measurements by the LEP had given a slight imbalance but the new measurement by the ATLAS collaboration have twice the precision and give a ratio of formula_13, which agrees with the standard-model prediction of unity. In 2024 a preprint by the ATLAS collaboration has published a new value of formula_14 the most precise ratio so far testing the lepton flavour universality.

<doc id="60832" wikidata="Q129234" url="?curid=60832" title="Hatshepsut">
<text>Hatshepsut ( ; BC) was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Thutmose II and the sixth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, ruling first as regent, then as queen regnant from until (Low Chronology). She was Egypt&#x27;s second confirmed woman who ruled in her own right, the first being Sobekneferu/Nefrusobek in the Twelfth Dynasty. 

Hatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and Great Royal Wife, Ahmose. Upon the death of her husband and half-brother Thutmose II, she had initially ruled as regent to her stepson, Thutmose III, who inherited the throne at the age of two. Several years into her regency, Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh and adopted the full royal titulary, making her a co-ruler alongside Thutmose III. In order to establish herself in the Egyptian patriarchy, she took on traditionally male roles and was depicted as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male garb. She emphasized both the qualities of men and women to convey the idea that she was both a mother and father to the realm. Hatshepsut&#x27;s reign was a period of great prosperity and general peace. One of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, she oversaw large-scale construction projects such as the Karnak Temple Complex, the Red Chapel, the Speos Artemidos and most famously, the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari. 

Hatshepsut probably died in Year 22 of the reign of Thutmose III. Towards the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son Amenhotep II, an attempt was made to remove her from official accounts of Egyptian historiography: her statues were destroyed, her monuments were defaced, and many of her achievements were ascribed to other pharaohs.

== Early life ==
Hatshepsut was born between 1505 and 1495 BC as eldest daughter of Thutmose I and his great royal wife, Ahmose. After her father&#x27;s death, Hatshepsut was then married to Thutmose II, her half-brother and father&#x27;s heir, when she was fourteen or fifteen years old. Thutmose II was of a similar age.

==Reign==
Upon the death of Thutmose II, the underage Thutmose III became the pharaoh of Egypt. Hatshepsut was thought of by early modern scholars to have only served as regent alongside him. However, modern scholars agree that, while she initially served as regent for young Thutmose III from his accession in , Hatshepsut eventually assumed the position of pharaoh alongside him by Year 7 of his reign, ; becoming queen regnant, Hatshepsut shared Thutmose III&#x27;s existing regnal count, effectively back-dating her accession as pharaoh to Year 1, when she had been merely regent. Although queen Sobekneferu and - possibly - Nitocris, have previously assumed the role of pharaoh, Hatshepsut was the only female ruler to do so in a time of prosperity, and she arguably had more powers than her female predecessors.

Retrospectively, Hatshepsut was described by ancient authors as having reigned for about 21–22 years, which included both her regency and her reign as queen regnant. Josephus and Julius Africanus follow the earlier testimony of Manetho (3rd century BC), mentioning a queen regnant called Amessis or Amensis, specified by Josephus as having been the sister of her predecessor. This woman was later identified by historians as Hatshepsut. In Josephus&#x27;s text, her reign is described as lasting for 21 years and 9 months, while Africanus states it as 22 years, apparently rounding up. The latest attestation of Hatshepsut in contemporary records comes from Year 20 of the regnal count of Thutmose III; she is no longer mentioned in Year 22, when he undertook his first major foreign campaign. This is compatible with the 21 years 9 months recorded by Manetho and Josephus, which would place the end of Hatshepsut&#x27;s reign in Year 22 of Thutmose III.

Dating the beginning of her reign is more difficult. Her father, Thutmose I, began his reign in either 1526 BC or 1506 BC according to the high and low estimates of her reign, although the length of the reigns of Thutmose I and Thutmose II cannot be determined with certainty. With short reigns, Hatshepsut would have ascended the throne 14 years after her father&#x27;s coronation; longer reigns would put her accession 25 years after his coronation.

The earliest attestation of Hatshepsut as pharaoh occurs in the tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer, where a collection of grave goods contained a single pottery jar or amphora from the tomb&#x27;s chamber, stamped with the date &quot;Year 7&quot;. Another jar from the same tomb, discovered &quot;in situ&quot; by a 1935–36 Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition on a hillside near Thebes, was stamped with the seal of the &quot;God&#x27;s Wife Hatshepsut&quot;, and two jars bore the seal of &quot;The Good Goddess Maatkare&quot;. The dating of the amphorae, &quot;sealed into the [tomb&#x27;s] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut&#x27;s own tomb&quot;, is undisputed, meaning that Hatshepsut was acknowledged as pharaoh of Egypt—and no longer merely regent—by Year 7 of her reign. She was certainly pharaoh by Year 9, the date of the Punt expedition, ; her last dated attestation as pharaoh is Year 20, , and she no longer appears in Year 22, .

==Major accomplishments==

===Trade routes===
Hatshepsut re-established a number of trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt.

Hatshepsut&#x27;s delegation returned from Punt bearing 31 live myrrh trees and other luxuries such as frankincense. Hatshepsut would grind the charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.

Hatshepsut had the expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahari, which is also famous for its realistic depiction of Queen Ati of the Land of Punt. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and the Sinai Peninsula shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.

===Building projects===

Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Many of these building projects were temples to build her religious base and legitimacy beyond her position as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun. At these temples, she performed religious rituals that had hitherto been reserved for kings, corroborating the evidence that Hatshepsut assumed traditionally male roles as pharaoh. She employed the great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward Senenmut. The extant artifacts of the statuary provide archaeological evidence of Hatshepsut&#x27;s portrayals of herself as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male Ancient Egyptian garb, such as a false beard and ram&#x27;s horns. These images are seen as symbolic, and not evidence of cross-dressing or androgyny.

Following the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak. She also restored the original Precinct of Mut, the great ancient goddess of Egypt, at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their own projects. The precinct awaits restoration. She had twin obelisks erected at the entrance to the temple which at the time of building were the tallest in the world. Only one remains upright, which is the second-tallest ancient obelisk still standing, the other having toppled and broken in two. The official in charge of those obelisks was the high steward Amenhotep. Another project, Karnak&#x27;s Red Chapel, or Chapelle Rouge, was built as a barque shrine.

Later, she ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction, and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it remains. Known as the Unfinished Obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.

Hatshepsut built the Temple of Pakhet at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile, was admired and called the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess, Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut&#x27;s famous denunciation of the Hyksos that James P. Allen has translated. This temple was altered later, and some of its insides were altered by Seti I of the Nineteenth Dynasty in an attempt to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.

Following the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut&#x27;s building projects was a mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahari. The identity of the architect behind the project remains unclear. It is possible that Senenmut, the Overseer of Works, or Hapuseneb, the High Priest, was responsible. It is also likely that Hatshepsut provided input to the project. Located opposite the city of Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture. The complex&#x27;s focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or &quot;the Holy of Holies&quot;.

===Official lauding===
Hyperbole is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.

Hatshepsut assumed all the regalia and symbols of the Pharaonic office in official representations: the Khat head cloth, topped with the uraeus, the traditional false beard, and shendyt kilt. Hatshepsut was ambiguous and androgynous in many of her statues and monuments. She would create a masculine version of herself to establish herself in the Egyptian patriarchy.

Osirian statues of Hatshepsut—as with other pharaohs—depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity.

To further lay her claim to the throne, priests told a story of divine birth. In this myth, Amun goes to Ahmose in the form of Thutmose I. Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. Khnum, the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and &quot;ka&quot;, or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. Heket, the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a place where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.

The Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun&#x27;s support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments:

Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father&#x27;s designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:

==Death, burial, and mummification==
Hatshepsut&#x27;s last dated attestation as pharaoh is Year 20, III Peret, Day 2, , but the reign length of 21 years and 9 months for her by Manetho in Josephus&#x27;s book &quot;Contra Apionem&quot; indicates that she ceased to reign in Year 22, . The precise date of the beginning of Thutmose III&#x27;s reign as sole ruler of Egypt—and presumably of Hatshepsut&#x27;s death—is considered to be Year 22, II Peret, Day 10, recorded on a single stela erected at Armant, corresponding to 16 January 1458 BC. This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho&#x27;s king list records since Hatshepsut&#x27;s known accession date was I Shemu, Day 4.

Hatshepsut began constructing a tomb when she was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II. Still, the scale of this was not suitable for a pharaoh, so when she ascended the throne, preparation for another burial started. For this, KV20, originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished her father&#x27;s burial and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. Therefore, it is likely that when she died (no later than the 22nd year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.

However, during Thutmose III&#x27;s reign, a new tomb (KV38), was constructed along with fresh burial equipment for Thutmose I. Thus, Thutmose I was relocated from his original tomb and reburied elsewhere. There is a possibility that at the same time, Hatshepsut&#x27;s mummy was moved into the tomb of her nurse, Sitre In, in KV60. These actions could have been motivated by Amenhotep II, Thutmose III&#x27;s son from a secondary wife, in an effort to secure his own uncertain claim to the throne.

Besides what was recovered from KV20 during Egyptologist Howard Carter&#x27;s clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness throne or bedstead, a senet game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial shabti figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at DB320, a wooden canopic box featuring an ivory knob was found, bearing the name of Hatshepsut and containing a mummified liver or spleen, along with a molar tooth. There was also a royal lady with the same name from the 21st dynasty, leading to initial speculation that the artifacts may have belonged to her instead.

===Proposed mummy===

In 1903, Howard Carter had discovered tomb KV60 in the Valley of the Kings. It contained two female mummies: one identified as Hatshepsut&#x27;s wet nurse and the other unidentified. In spring 2007, the unidentified body, called KV60A, was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and taken to Cairo&#x27;s Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut&#x27;s existing molar, found in the DB320 &quot;canopic box&quot;. Based on this, Hawass concluded that the KV60A mummy is very likely Hatshepsut.

While the mummy and the tooth could be DNA tested to see if it belonged to the same person and confirm the mummy&#x27;s identity, Hawass, the Cairo Museum and some Egyptologists have refused to do it as it would require destroying the tooth to retrieve the DNA. Her death has since been attributed to a benzopyrene carcinogenic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having bone cancer. Other members of the queen&#x27;s family are thought to have suffered from inflammatory skin diseases that tend to be genetic. Assuming that the mummy is that of Hatshepsut, it is likely that she inadvertently poisoned herself while trying to soothe her itchy, irritated skin. It also would suggest that she had arthritis and bad teeth, which may be why the tooth was removed.

However, in 2011, the tooth was identified as the molar from a lower jaw, whereas the mummy from KV60 was missing a molar from its upper jaw, thus casting doubt on the supposed identification.

=== Exclusion from the historical record ===

Toward the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son, an attempt was made to remove Hatshepsut from certain historical and pharaonic records. Her cartouches and images were chiselled off stone walls. Erasure methods ranged from full destruction of any instance of her name or image to replacement, inserting Thutmose I or II where Hatshepsut once stood. There were also instances of smoothing, patchwork jobs that covered Hatshepsut&#x27;s cartouche; examples of this can be seen on the walls of the Deir el-Bahari temple. Simpler methods also included covering, where new stone was added to fully cover reliefs or sacred stone work.

At the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut&#x27;s many statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, an attempt was made to wall up her monuments. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut&#x27;s history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III&#x27;s reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than as a manifestation of the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps to save money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III, and instead using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.

Amenhotep II, the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father&#x27;s reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut&#x27;s accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun. Some of these titles would be restored in the reign of his son Thutmose IV.

For many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. Egyptologist Donald Redford says that this was not borne out of hatred but was a political necessity to assert his own beliefs. Redford added:

=== Modern assessment ===
Hatshepsut is, according to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, &quot;the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.&quot; In some ways, Hatshepsut&#x27;s reign was seen as going against the patriarchal system of her time. She managed to rule as regent for a son who was not her own, going against the system which had previously only allowed mothers to rule on behalf of their biological sons. She used this regency to create her female kingship, constructing extensive temples to celebrate her reign, which meant that the public became used to seeing a woman in such a powerful role. This ensured that when the oracle declared her king, the Egyptian public readily accepted her status.

However, as with other female heads of state in ancient Egypt, this was only done through the use of male symbols of kingship; hence the description of Hatshepsut and others as female kings rather than queens. Hatshepsut was arguably placed in power by men to further their own wealth. She gained power when Egypt had recently amassed extensive wealth, implying that she was placed in power by Egyptian elites due to her record as successful in various domains—as High Priestess or as a placeholder serving for her father Thutmose I in Thebes while he was away on military campaigns. This record of success made such elites confident that she could handle Egyptian wealth and trade, capitalizing on Egypt&#x27;s moment of prosperity. Indeed, historian Kara Cooney describes Hatshepsut as &quot;arguably, the only woman to have ever taken power as king in ancient Egypt during a time of prosperity and expansion.&quot;

Historian Joyce Tyldesley stated that Thutmose III may have ordered public monuments to Hatshepsut and her achievements to be altered or destroyed in order to place her in a lower position of co-regent, meaning he could claim that royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt. This was supported by Thutmose III&#x27;s officials, and as Hatshepsut&#x27;s officials either died or were no longer in the public eye, there was little opposition to this. Tyldesley, along with historians Peter Dorman and Gay Robins, say that the erasure and defacement of Hatshepsut&#x27;s monuments may have been an attempt to extinguish the memory of female kingship (including its successes, as opposed to the female pharaoh Sobekneferu, who failed to rejuvenate Egypt&#x27;s fortunes and was therefore more acceptable to the conservative establishment as a tragic figure) and re-legitimise his right to rule.

The &quot;Hatshepsut Problem&quot; is a direct link to gender normatives in regards to ancient Egyptian social structures. Although she did hold Queen status, her reign, especially after, was disregarded and even erased. Her reign could be considered more successful than some pharaohs&#x27; reigns, for example with expanding borders, which can be seen as a threat to traditional gender roles. This raises questions about the conflict between power and traditional gender roles, and to what extent modernism and conservatism overlap.

The erasure of Hatshepsut&#x27;s name—by the men who succeeded her for whatever reason—almost caused her to disappear from Egypt&#x27;s archaeological and written records. When 19th-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahari temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense. Jean-François Champollion, the French decoder of hieroglyphs, said:
This problem was a major issue in late 19th-century and early 20th-century Egyptology, centering on confusion and disagreement on the order of succession of early 18th Dynasty pharaohs. The dilemma takes its name from confusion over the chronology of the rule of Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmose I, II, and III.

<doc id="60833" wikidata="Q573194" url="?curid=60833" title="German submarine U-27 (1936)">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-27&quot; was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; built for service in World War II. Her keel was laid down in November 1935 in Bremen. She was commissioned in August 1936 with &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Hans Ibbeken in command. Ibbeken was relieved on 4 October 1937, by Johannes Franz, who commanded the boat until 6 June 1939 when Hans-Georg von Friedeburg assumed command for barely one month. He was relieved on 8 July again by Johannes Franz, who commanded the boat until her loss on 20 September 1939.

&quot;U-27&quot; had a very short career, with only one war patrol and only two enemy ships sunk. Following the sinking of two British trawlers, &quot;Davara&quot; on 13 September and &quot;Rudyard Kipling&quot; on 16 September, &quot;U-27&quot; was hunted down and sunk west of Lewis, Scotland, by depth charges from the British destroyers , and . All 38 crewmen survived and were made prisoner for the remainder of the war.

==Construction and design==

===Construction===
&quot;U-27&quot; was ordered by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; on 1 April 1935 in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Her keel was laid down in the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen as yard number 908 on 11 November 1935. After about nine months of construction, she was launched on 24 June 1936 and commissioned into the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; as the second Type VIIA submarine, (after , which was commissioned a few months earlier), on 12 August under the command of &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Hans Ibbeken.

===Design===

Like all Type VIIA submarines, &quot;U-27&quot; displaced on the surface and submerged. She was in overall length and had a pressure hull. &quot;U-27&quot;″s propulsion consisted of two MAN 6-cylinder 4-stroke M 6 V 40/46 diesel engines that totaled at maximum between 470 and 485 rpm giving a maximum speed of on the surface and a range of at . The submarine was also equipped with two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 electric motors that totaled . Their maximum rpm was 322 and they could propel the submarine at when submerged, with an underwater maximum speed of . The U-boat&#x27;s test depth was , but she could go as deep as without having her hull crushed. &quot;U-27&quot;″s armament consisted of five torpedo tubes (four located in the bow and one in the stern). She could have up to 11 torpedoes on board or 22 TMA mines or 33 TMB mines. &quot;U-27&quot; was also equipped with an L/45 deck gun with 220 rounds. Her anti-aircraft defenses consisted of one  anti-aircraft gun. &quot;U-27&quot; had a crew of four officers and 40 to 56 enlisted men.

==Service history==
&quot;U-27&quot; had a very short career, conducting only one war patrol and sinking only two enemy vessels before she herself was sunk. She left Wilhelmshaven on her first war patrol on 23 August 1939. For a period of 24 days, she traveled down the coast of Germany and neutral Belgium and the Netherlands, through the English Channel and out into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland. Here, the boat sank two British trawlers, totaling 624 GRT. The first attack took place at 2:55 on 13 September, northwest of Tory Island, when the trawler &quot;Davara&quot; was shelled by &quot;U-27&quot;″s deck gun. Following the sinking of &quot;Davara&quot;, her captain and 11 other crew members were picked up by the steam merchant ship &quot;Willowpool&quot;. The second vessel to be sunk was the trawler &quot;Rudyard Kipling&quot;. The attack took place at 3:53 on 16 September, west of the west coast of neutral Ireland, with the ship being sunk by scuttling charges from &quot;U-27&quot;. Following the sinking of &quot;Rudyard Kipling&quot;, the submarine picked up the crew of the trawler who were then given food and warm clothes. Eight hours later, &quot;Rudyard Kipling&quot;″s crew were allowed to re-enter their lifeboats to row the remaining to Ireland.

===Fate===
The destroyers and (who sank six days earlier), had been part of a concerted effort to find and sink the U-Boat that had been attacking trawlers. On 20 September 1939, three torpedoes were fired at the warships, but failed to do any damage when they exploded prematurely. The British vessels replied with a series of depth charge attacks, one of which damaged the German submarine sufficiently to force it to the surface. &quot;Fortune&quot;″s ramming attack was curtailed when it became apparent that the U-Boat was surrendering. All 38 crewmen survived and were taken prisoner. &quot;U-27&quot; became the second German submarine to be sunk in World War II after was sunk on 14 September 1939.

&quot;U-27&quot;″s skipper, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Johannes Franz was able, via code, to inform &quot;Bdu&quot;, the U-boat high command, of the situation regarding the malfunctioning torpedoes from his prison camp.

<doc id="60835" wikidata="Q205474" url="?curid=60835" title="All My Children">
<text>All My Children (often shortened to AMC) is an American television soap opera that aired on ABC from January 5, 1970, to September 23, 2011, and on The Online Network (TOLN) from April 29 to September 2, 2013, via Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes.

Created by Agnes Nixon, &quot;All My Children&quot; is set in Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia, which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of Penn Valley. The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of daytime television&#x27;s most popular characters. &quot;All My Children&quot; was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1970. The series started with half-hour episodes before expanding to a full hour on April 25, 1977. The show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; premiered.

From 1970 to 1990, &quot;All My Children&quot; was recorded at ABC&#x27;s TV18 at 101 West 67th Street, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC&#x27;s Studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in Manhattan, New York City, New York. In December 2009, taping moved from Manhattan to less costly Los Angeles, California, at Stages 1 and 2 of the Andrita Studios, from 2010 to 2011. Taping then moved to the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, Connecticut. &quot;All My Children&quot; started taping in high definition on January 4, 2010, and began airing in high definition on February 3, 2010. &quot;All My Children&quot; became the third soap opera to be produced and broadcast in high definition.

At one point, the program&#x27;s popularity positioned it as the most widely recorded television show in the United States. In the mid-1970s, its audience was estimated to be 30% male, which was unusual at the time. The show ranked first in the daytime Nielsen ratings in the 1978–79 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, &quot;All My Children&quot; was the number-two daytime soap opera on the air. However, like the rest of the soap operas in the United States, &quot;All My Children&quot; experienced unprecedented declines in its ratings during the 2000s.

On April 14, 2011, ABC announced that it was canceling &quot;All My Children&quot; after a run of 41 years. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of &quot;All My Children&quot; to third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of webisodes. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. Prospect Park had suspended its plan to revive the series on November 23, 2011, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews.

On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore &quot;All My Children&quot; as a web series. The show taped its first scenes for Prospect Park TOLN on February 18, 2013, and its first episode on the network aired on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run. On November 11, 2013, several &quot;All My Children&quot; cast members announced that Prospect Park had closed production and canceled the series again. The rights to the show went back to ABC in December 2016.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Agnes Nixon, then head writer for &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, first came up with the idea for &quot;All My Children&quot; in the 1960s. When writing the story bible, she designed the show as a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love. She unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter &amp; Gamble. When Procter &amp; Gamble was unable to make room for the show in its lineup, Nixon put &quot;All My Children&quot; on hold.

Nixon became head writer for &quot;Another World&quot; in 1965, and decided to use a few ideas from her &quot;All My Children&quot; bible. In particular, she used the model of the Erica Kane character to create a brand new &quot;Another World&quot; character named Rachel Davis. Nixon said Rachel was Erica&#x27;s &quot;precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they&#x27;d be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive&quot;, Nixon said.

=== Creation ===
ABC later approached Nixon to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked Nixon for another program, and she revived her &quot;All My Children&quot; bible and the Erica Kane character.

Nixon wrote a poem to include in the photo album shown in the series&#x27; title credits: 
&quot;The great and the least, the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, in sickness and in health, in joy and sorrow, in tragedy and triumph, you are all my children.&quot;

=== 1970s ===

&quot;All My Children&quot; debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show &quot;Dream House&quot;. Rosemary Prinz was signed on to be the &quot;special guest star&quot; for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her protégé, Wisner Washam. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching &quot;Loving&quot; in 1983. 

Nixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience. She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional &quot;Pine Valley&quot; on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called Pine Valley in western New York. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and also near &quot;One Life to Live&quot;″s Llanview. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)

The show&#x27;s first action takes place around several families and characters. Phoebe Tyler (Ruth Warrick), who fashions herself as &quot;Queen of Pine Valley&quot;, was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, Mona Kane (Frances Heflin), and her spoiled daughter, Erica (Susan Lucci) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable Martin family, headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of &quot;All My Children&quot;. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates Tara Martin (Karen Lynn Gorney) and Phil Brent (Richard Hatch), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted, but instead, the son of Ruth&#x27;s sister, Amy Tyler (Rosemary Prinz) and her mother&#x27;s friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.

&quot;All My Children&quot;″s first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that. The show&#x27;s ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.

The show was unique for its use of the Vietnam War. Before &quot;All My Children&quot; debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character&#x27;s protest speech in 1972 won Mary Fickett the first Emmy Award given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show&#x27;s run, Phoebe softened.

Nurse Caroline Murray, played by Patricia Dixon, was a Vietnam veteran who overcame her chilling flashbacks to the war with the help of Dr. Frank Grant (John Danelle) in 1976. Dr. Frank Grant, first seen in Pine Valley in 1972, his wife Nancy (played by Lisa Wilkinson and first seen in 1973), and Caroline (debuting in 1976) were the first Black leading characters on &quot;All My Children&quot;.

In May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.
Making the abortion particularly controversial is Erica&#x27;s reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character&#x27;s case. The storyline has been credited for boosting the show&#x27;s ratings, as well as helping establish Erica Kane as a central character who would dominate the show for its entire run.

Phoebe&#x27;s husband Charles (Hugh Franklin) became close to Mona (Erica&#x27;s mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked paralysis. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorcée and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.

When Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (William Mooney). Margo&#x27;s facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing plastic surgery and its psychological effects.

In June 1976, character Brooke English showed up on her Aunt Phoebe&#x27;s doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over Tom Cudahy and Mark Dalton. In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced Myrtle Lum Fargate (Eileen Herlie).

By the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic Palmer Cortlandt (aka Peter Cooney) (James Mitchell), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock (Elizabeth Lawrence), and his overprotected daughter Nina (Taylor Miller), who, to Palmer&#x27;s chagrin, entrances Dr. Cliff Warner (Peter Bergman). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff&#x27;s past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt (Gillian Spencer), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone&#x27;s complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. &quot;All My Children&quot; also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle (Matthew Cowles) and Ray Gardner (Gil Rogers).

&quot;All My Children&quot; had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on kinescope in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special &quot;A Daytime To Remember&quot;, which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.

Nixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them. However, that promise was broken, because different sources point out that most of them were either lost in a warehouse fire or were erased. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.

=== 1980s ===
The early 1980s is considered a &quot;golden period&quot; for the show and the &quot;Golden Age&quot; for supercouples. Younger characters, such as Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner (Laurence Lau and Kim Delaney), Liza Colby (Marcy Walker), Liza&#x27;s best friend Amanda (Amanda Bearse), Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter (Darnell Williams and Debbi Morgan), and a now-grown-up Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight), who was now legally Ruth and Joe&#x27;s son, enter the scene.

The storyline involving Liza plotting to win Greg back after he leaves her for Jenny became a fan favorite, as was the Greg and Jenny and Jesse and Angie pairings. Jesse and Jenny&#x27;s summer in New York City became regarded as one of the greatest storylines in the history of the series. Meanwhile, the legend of &quot;Tad the Cad&quot; is born when Tad takes Liza&#x27;s virginity, then simultaneously begins having sex with her mother, socialite Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey), who eventually is sent to prison.

For older appeal, Jenny and Tad&#x27;s natural mother Opal (Dorothy Lyman) was also added to the canvas, where she opens the Glamorama salon and spa. Opal greatly showcased &quot;All My Children&quot;″s attempt at humor and satire. Also introduced in the 1980s were powerful businessman Adam Chandler and his identical twin brother Stuart (both played by David Canary), the first arrival of members of the Chandler family. Adam became cited as one of the &quot;most powerful male figures in television&quot;, which was contrasted by Stuart&#x27;s kind, generous, and honest personality.

Erica began to take on a larger-than-life role by the 1980s, writing an autobiography, &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses Erica of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, Erica goes on the run. She does all this while posing as a sister named &#x27;Christine&#x27;. 

The show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. Tricia Pursley portrayed the divorced Devon McFadden, who believes she is falling in love with her lesbian psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (portrayed by Donna Pescow). Lynn acknowledges that she is a lesbian, and Devon admits her crush, but Lynn rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.

The show tackled the issue of drug use when Mark La Mura&#x27;s character, Mark Dalton, becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a tough love policy that requires Mark&#x27;s admission of his addiction.

Controversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), who later fell in love with Stuart. Cindy was revealed to have AIDS. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison, who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, Skye Chandler. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show&#x27;s most-watched episodes.

Felicia Minei Behr was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on Ryan&#x27;s Hope, Behr was familiar with &quot;All My Children&quot;, having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie (Cady McClain). By this time, the show had also found a &quot;hit couple&quot; in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by Rosa Nevin and Maurice Benard), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.

ABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman&#x27;s departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera &quot;Generations&quot; in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman&#x27;s departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired Jill Larson. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.

=== 1990s ===
At the time of Behr&#x27;s hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. ABC chose Megan McTavish, a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly&#x27;s leukemia, Ceara Connor&#x27;s (Genie Francis&#x27;) incest, Mona&#x27;s lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included &quot;Natalie in the Well,&quot; the &quot;Who Killed Will Cortlandt?&quot; mystery, &quot;Willow Lake Acres&quot; (a humorous-but-serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica&#x27;s father, Eric Kane.

McTavish was also instrumental in a major, but still popular retroactive continuity (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was revealed as Erica&#x27;s long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father&#x27;s actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica&#x27;s approval but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being &#x27;abandoned&#x27; at birth and seeks revenge against her mother. Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. Gellar was proclaimed by some &quot;as the second coming of Erica&quot; in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993 to 1995, but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities.

The Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 1990s as well. Also, the Tad and Dixie pairing had become especially popular. Other prominent couples were Dimitri and Erica (Michael Nader), Trevor (James Kiberd) and Natalie (Kate Collins), Hayley (Kelly Ripa) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, Matt Borlenghi, Brian L. Greene), and Brooke English and Edmund Grey (Julia Barr, John Callahan).

Some of McTavish&#x27;s storytelling ultimately received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the O. J. Simpson trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and &quot;All My Children&quot; was no different. When McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.

Broderick&#x27;s tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning &quot;All My Children&quot; to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica&#x27;s drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the Betty Ford Center), and also the story of homophobia over a gay high school boy and a history teacher. However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr&#x27;s contract, and brought in Francesca James (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a voodoo arc with the popular Noah and Julia (Keith Hamilton Cobb and Sydney Penny), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the &quot;real&quot; Santa Claus, and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.

Despite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled, Bianca Montgomery&#x27;s anorexia, was created by Broderick. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish&#x27;s tales were plot-driven and made implausible alterations to the show&#x27;s history such as the resurrection of Erica&#x27;s lifetime love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998, the show again got a new executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, taking over from Francesca James.

Cady McClain, who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned, but other storylines—involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch—were all ill-received. By the start of 1999, with &quot;All My Children&quot; being voted as the &quot;Worst of 1998&quot; by &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, McTavish was once again fired. As ratings began to fall, ABC convinced Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as Michael Nader, James Kiberd, and Robin Mattson, left their roles.

=== 2000s ===
Nixon decided to write a story that would rejuvenate the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica&#x27;s daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Although initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics. Bianca emerged as a breakout character and lesbian icon. The show found additional success in the pairing of newcomers Leo and Greenlee (Josh Duhamel and Rebecca Budig).

Richard Culliton wrote several of &quot;All My Children&quot;″s early 2000s (decade) storylines. He created popular characters Frankie and Maggie Stone, and said Frankie was already intended to be killed in a murder storyline after only three months on the series. Culliton and ABC executives were surprised when viewers became attached to the romance between Bianca and Frankie, developed by Culliton with Frankie&#x27;s debut. These fans attributed Frankie&#x27;s death to the show&#x27;s fear to focus on a lesbian romance. Eventually, Culliton introduced the idea to bring back popular actress Elizabeth Hendrickson, who had portrayed Frankie, as Frankie&#x27;s twin sister Maggie. Culliton continued to write for the show until late 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After more staff turnover, McTavish again returned as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, which included the controversial rape of Bianca. Gone upon McTavish&#x27;s latest return was Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, being replaced with Julie Hanan Carruthers. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who had been gone for long. She introduced star-crossed couple JR Chandler and Babe Carey upon writing JR&#x27;s return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone&#x27;s love story, and created fellow popular couple Zach Slater and Kendall Hart. Characters Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) and Janet Dillon (Kate Collins, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.

On July 26, 2006, Tanika Ray, Rihanna, as well as other celebrities, appeared on the show. During the Rihanna appearance, a controversial storyline involving Erica&#x27;s thought-to-be-aborted son having come to Pine Valley under the name Josh Madden intensifies when Josh learns of how he truly came to exist. In August 2006, after months of speculation, it was confirmed that fan favorite Eden Riegel would be reprising her Emmy winning role as Bianca. She was a part of a controversial storyline centered on transgender character Zarf/Zoe.

The most notable return was Cady McClain&#x27;s return as show heroine Dixie Cooney Martin. The news of her return spread just two weeks before she reappeared on the series. In an unpopular and controversial move by the series, the writers chose to kill off Dixie in January 2007 only a year after her return. The character&#x27;s death was the result of the Satin Slayer storyline where she is unintentionally murdered in place of character Babe Carey.

Another prominent return to the series occurred on February 9, 2007, when Susan Pratt returned as Barbara Montgomery. Pratt made her last appearance in July of that year. That same month, McTavish was fired as head writer, reportedly due to viewer criticism about her storylines. On May 21, 2007, James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten were announced as the new head writers of &quot;All My Children&quot;. The duo wrote for &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;, and created and wrote for &quot;The City&quot;.

On December 12, 2007, ABC revealed Rebecca Budig would be returning to the series as Greenlee Smythe; the return was one of the most widely reported in daytime television history, attracting mainstream media attention such as the &quot;Associated Press&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Budig&#x27;s return was overshadowed by controversy when news of Sabine Singh&#x27;s reportedly unfair treatment as a Greenlee recast in order to bring Budig back incited viewer outrage.

On December 25, 2007, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reported the return of fan favorites Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams as Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter. Morgan returned on January 18, 2008, and Williams on January 25, 2008. In April 2008, it was announced that Laurence Lau would briefly reprise the role of Greg Nelson for Jesse and Angie&#x27;s much anticipated wedding. On May 21, 2008, Charles Pratt, Jr., former co-head writer for &quot;General Hospital&quot;, was announced as a replacement for Brown and Esensten amid record low ratings. On November 6, 2008, &quot;All My Children&quot; aired a special episode in which veterans share their stories unscripted. On November 12, 2008, the show celebrated its 10,000th show with a special appearance by Nixon and a special tribute to Myrtle Fargate (as portrayed by Eileen Herlie who had recently died). On December 19, 2008, a special episode ran for Herlie, showing clips from the past.

On February 16, 2009, &quot;All My Children&quot; made daytime history with the nuptials of Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery, the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime television. After departing the show in February 2005, Riegel continued to return to the series for limited guest appearances, but permanently left the role in 2010.

On November 20, 2009, Pratt was fired as head writer. Daytime Emmy-winning former head writer Lorraine Broderick was brought back to lead the writing team on an interim basis. Reportedly, Broderick returned at the request of show creator Agnes Nixon, but was not interested in remaining permanently as the team&#x27;s top scribe. 

=== 2010s ===
On January 5, 2010, &quot;All My Children&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary with an episode structured like a documentary and hosted by character Hayley Santos. It featured appearances by characters Palmer Cortlandt, Nina Warner, Maria Santos Grey, Brooke English, Greg Nelson, Bianca Montgomery, Mateo Santos and Lily Montgomery. It was also the final episode for characters Joe and Ruth Martin, who retired to Florida, and the final appearance for Palmer, since actor James Mitchell died shortly after the episode aired.

On January 13, 2010, ABC Daytime announced the appointment of David Kreizman and Donna Swajeski as the co-head writers of &quot;All My Children&quot;, replacing interim head writer Lorraine Broderick, who in turn replaced Charles Pratt, Jr. Brian Frons, head of ABC daytime, stated, &quot;David and Donna are the perfect team to bring new ideas to &quot;All My Children&quot; while remaining true to its core by telling stories with a focus on the integrity of the show&#x27;s history, its characters and families on the canvas.&quot; Prior to his appointment on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Kriezman was the head writer of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 2004 to the final episode on September 18, 2009, and the co-head writer of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 2009 to the final episode on September 17, 2010. Swajeski&#x27;s prior experience includes a head writing stint on &quot;Another World&quot; from 1988 to 1992.

With the death on January 22 of James Mitchell at age 89 (Palmer Cortlandt 1979–2010), the show aired a tribute episode to Palmer on Tuesday April 20, 2010. Gillian Spencer (Daisy Murdoch Cortlandt), Taylor Miller (Nina Cortlandt), and Cady McClain (Dixie Cooney Martin) returned for the episode. On February 8, Walt Willey returned as a contract cast member in the role of Jackson Montgomery, following numerous months away and dispute about his future on the show. On February 23, Julia Barr reprised the role of Brooke English; Brooke&#x27;s return was timed to the retirement of David Canary (Adam Chandler) after more than 26 years on the show. Their final episode aired April 23, 2010. On July 17, 2010, Larry Keith, who was on the show from 1970 to 2005 as Nick Davis, and who gave Erica Kane the nickname &quot;Princess&quot;, died. He was last seen on January 5, 2005, for the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary episode.

In September 2010, Daytime Emmy winner Vincent Irizzary&#x27;s character, David Hayward, was murdered. On the November 22, 2010, episode, David waltzed into the courtroom during Greenlee&#x27;s trial (for which she was just sentenced to life in prison for murdering him) at the tail end of it, confirming rumors that he was going to return all along. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; confirmed soon after that the show had planned this all along from the start. On September 16, 2010, Adam Mayfield (Scott Chandler) and Brittany Allen (Marissa Tasker) were announced to be leaving the show. ABC reports that they wanted to take both the characters in a different direction. On September 22, 2010, it was announced that Daniel Cosgrove (ex-Scott, &quot;All My Children&quot;; ex-Bill, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;; ex-Chris, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;) would return to &quot;All My Children&quot; and replace Adam Mayfield (Scott) as Scott Chandler. On October 28, 2010, it was announced that Sarah Glendening (ex-Lucy, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;) would be taking over the role of Marissa Tasker. Glendening debuted on December 27 and Cosgrove debuted on December 29.

In January 2011, Debbi Morgan said that she would take a leave of absence from the show. She said it was for personal reasons and on January 14, 2011, she released to the public that she has been diagnosed with Lyme disease. She returned during the second week of February and her first episode aired on March 8, 2011. On February 10, 2011, as part of her 25th (and farewell) season, Oprah Winfrey invited &quot;All My Children&quot;″s Susan Lucci, Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams, and Michael E. Knight, along with &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s Luke and Laura (Anthony Geary and Genie Francis) and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;″ Mrs. Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. As a surprise, Winfrey shocked Lucci and the rest of the crowd by bringing back all of Erica&#x27;s husbands. During February 2011, the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; did a crossover event. On the 16th and the 23rd, Lucci, Michael E. Knight, and Darnell Williams made guest appearances on the show. On the 24th, Wendie Malick guest-starred.

On April 2, 2011, amid rumors of &quot;All My Children&quot;″s possible cancellation, &quot;Soaps in Depth&quot; broke the news via Twitter that longtime &quot;All My Children&quot; writer Lorraine Broderick had once again been named the show&#x27;s head writer, replacing David Kreizman and Donna Swajeski.

====Cancellation====
On April 14, 2011, ABC confirmed that it would not renew both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; after 41 and 43 years respectively, starting with &quot;All My Children&quot; ending its run on September 23, 2011, and with &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ending its run on January 13, 2012. Reasons for both shows&#x27; cancellations cited &quot;extensive research into what today&#x27;s daytime viewers want and the changing viewing patterns of the audience&quot;. It would be replaced by a new lifestyle show, &quot;The Chew&quot;, while its time slot on SOAPnet would be replaced by daily reruns of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In response to the cancellation of this, vacuum cleaner manufacturer Hoover withdrew its advertising from all ABC programs in protest, going as far as running a campaign to get ABC to reverse its decision.

On April 25, Cady McClain (ex-Dixie Cooney Martin) announced that she would be returning to &quot;All My Children&quot; but could not report what her storyline would be. Other former cast members announced to be returning to the series are Ray MacDonnell (Dr. Joe Martin), Lee Meriwether (Ruth Martin), David Canary (Adam Chandler), Julia Barr (Brooke English), Thorsten Kaye (Zach Slater), Eva La Rue (Maria Santos), Jennifer Bassey (Marian Colby), Kate Collins (Janet Dillon), Esta TerBlanche (Gillian Andrassy-Lavery), Josh Duhamel (Leo du Pres), Melissa Claire Egan (Annie Lavery), Leven Rambin (Lily Montgomery), Carol Burnett (Verla Grubbs), Jason Kincaid (Sam Brady), and Sarah Michelle Gellar playing a young woman who claims to see vampires (an allusion to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer story Normal Again).

On July 7, 2011, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that ABC had sold the licensing rights of &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to a TV-focused online channel being developed by TV, film and music production company Prospect Park. ABC confirmed this via press release; as a result of Prospect Park&#x27;s acquisition of the two soaps, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would be the first soap operas to transition first-run broadcasts from traditional television to internet television. Since the deal between ABC and Prospect Park is a licensing agreement, both soaps would continue to remain the property of ABC.

On September 8, 2011, the original Ruth Martin, actress Mary Fickett, died at age 83. The episode on Wednesday, September 21, 2011, was dedicated to her. On September 23, 2011, the series finale aired on ABC with open-ended stories. The final week featured Dr. Joe and Ruth Martin relocating to Pine Valley to cover recently arrested David Hayward&#x27;s hospital duties. The return of Adam Chandler and Brooke English coincided with the revelation that David had somehow resurrected Stuart Chandler. Jackson Montgomery dissolved his relationship with Erica after she admitted that she prefers not to remarry. Unresolved is JR Chandler&#x27;s plunge into insanity as he drunkenly aims a gun at a crowd of &quot;All My Children&quot; regulars during a welcome-home party for Stuart. The screen darkened before revealing the victim, leaving the story open for an eventual continuation with Prospect Park. On April 29, 2013, the revived series moved five years into the future after the original series finale on ABC. On November 11, 2013, it was confirmed by some of its actors that the series had once again been cancelled, this time by its online revival team.

=== Prospect Park&#x27;s revival plan ===
==== Unsuccessful attempt ====
In August 2010, Prospect Park announced that it was shopping for a cable network to air &quot;All My Children&quot; in complementary to its future internet television channel. Prospect Park officially began negotiations with the actors of &quot;All My Children&quot; on September 15, 2011. On September 19, 2011, Cameron Mathison and Lindsay Hartley became the only actors that had agreed to continue the show with Prospect Park.

Prospect Park initially intended for &quot;All My Children&quot; to begin its run on the internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of &quot;All My Children&quot;. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that &quot;All My Children&quot; along with its sister soap &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company&#x27;s new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch &quot;All My Children&quot; and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park not being able to sign enough cast members from &quot;All My Children&quot;.

On November 23, 2011, Prospect Park confirmed that it had officially suspended its attempt to produce both shows. Reasons given by Prospect Park for this decision included funding problems and poor negotiations with the unions representing the cast of both soaps. WGA and AFTRA, which respectively represented the writer and the actors, both expressed disappointment over Prospect Park&#x27;s announcement.

==== 2013 revival ====
On December 17, 2012, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that revival plans for &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; had resurfaced. A few days later, it was reported that Prospect Park had secured studio place in Stamford, Connecticut, where both shows would be filmed. The show had been filmed in New York City from 1970 to 2010, and in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2011.

Within the weeks following the reports, Lindsay Hartley, Vincent Irizarry, Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams, Jordi Vilasuso, Jill Larson, Thorsten Kaye, Cady McClain, David Canary, Julia Barr, and Ray MacDonnell were reported and/or confirmed to be returning to the show&#x27;s revival, while Susan Lucci would reportedly return for one episode, Eden Riegel would return for a guest-arc, Cameron Mathison might return to the revival in the future, and Alicia Minshew would return for one episode with the possibility of returning in the future. Along with the returning stars, a number of new actors were cast, including Ryan Bittle as JR Chandler, Robert Scott Wilson as Pete Cortlandt, Eric Nelsen as an aged AJ Chandler, Denyse Tontz as an aged Miranda Montgomery, Sal Stowers as Cassandra Foster, and Jordan Lane Price as a newly created character, Celia Fitzgerald.

On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park released an official statement confirming plans to revive &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; on The Online Network, their internet production company. Prospect Park signed deals with SAG-AFTRA and DGA for the soap opera&#x27;s production.

Former &quot;All My Children&quot; writer and producer Ginger Smith returned as the new executive producer and creator Agnes Nixon served as consultant. The new episodes were 30 minutes long and aired on Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Initially, 220 episodes of the show were ordered. The production company planned to shop the reboot to cable distributors beginning September 2013. The show schedule was four days a week (Monday-Thursday) with a Friday recap show, &quot;MORE All My Children&quot;, to feature behind the scenes footage as well as interviews with the cast and to be hosted by Leslie Miller. The revival show began on April 29, 2013, and production began on February 25, 2013, in Connecticut, with &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; taping in five-week rotations for 17 weeks.

On May 17, 2013, The Online Network announced that &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would no longer air five days a week together, due to viewer ratings that reflect online viewing patterns rather than those of traditional television. Starting May 20, 2013, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Life&quot; will be presented in a new schedule, with AMC airing on Mondays and Wednesdays and OLTL airing Tuesdays and Thursdays. The recap shows &quot;MORE All My Children&quot; and &quot;MORE One Life to Life&quot; will also combine as one show airing on Fridays. The following day on May 18, 2013, both shows were noticeably missing from the FX Canada website and schedule, and although they subsequently became available on iTunes Canada, it was later revealed that FX Canada dropped &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; due to the reduction of episodes, as the carriage agreement had specifically called for the airing of four episodes per week of both shows. Due to the reduction, FX Canada stated that &quot;the agreement is no longer valid&quot;. On May 20, 2013, the first episodes of the new &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life To Live&quot; were available worldwide on The Online Network&#x27;s YouTube page, &quot;TOLNSoaps&quot;.

On May 24, 2013, in a press release Prospect Park announced through Agnes Nixon that Snyder and McPherson will be out as co-head writers of &quot;All My Children&quot; and replaced by current script writers Lisa Connor and Chip Hayes.

On June 5, 2013, due to a labor dispute with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; were forced into an early hiatus with the writers, directors and editors still working; there were talks of production being moved out of state, but those plans were later shelved.

On June 20, 2013, a deal was reached between Prospect Park and the Union, and taping will resume on August 12, 2013. On June 25, 2013, TOLN stated that there will be a scheduling switch for &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Starting July 1, 2013, all episodes of the week for both shows would be released on Mondays.

Beginning July 15, 2013, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; aired for a 10-week limited engagement on the Oprah Winfrey Network, Monday through Thursday at 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM. &quot;All My Children&quot; aired a season finale on September 2, 2013.

In November 2013, Prospect Park indicated it was suspending further production of both shows. No new episodes have been made since that time. In total, only 40 of each program were produced in the new online format.

ABC regained the rights to &quot;All My Children&quot; in December 2016 following the dismissal of a lawsuit from Prospect Park against the broadcast network.

=== Aftermath primetime spin-offs ===
On December 17, 2020, &quot;Variety&quot; reported a primetime revival of &quot;All My Children&quot; was in early development at ABC, under the executive production of Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa. Leo Richardson—who previously worked on British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;—is also attached as executive producer and writer of the project. Per the report, the primetime revival would center around a &quot;young journalist with a secret agenda comes to expose the dark and murderous history of a town named Pine Valley only to become entangled in a feud between the Kane and Santos families.&quot; In another report, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; revealed the spinoff, &quot;Pine Valley&quot; was first proposed by Andrew Stern, who pitched the project to ABC via his deal with ABC Signature in 2019; he will serve as executive producer, alongside Consuelos, Richardson, Ripa and, Nixon&#x27;s son, Robert Nixon. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; further reported plans to invite former cast from the daytime incarnation to the spinoff, as well as potential appearances from Consuelos and Ripa themselves.

On September 11th, 2024, A&amp;E Networks announced that an &quot;All My Children&quot; holiday movie was in development for the Lifetime Network.

== Cast and characters ==

== Setting ==
Since the series began in 1970, the show has been set in Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia. The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as Llanview (&quot;One Life to Live&quot;), Port Charles (&quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Port Charles&quot;, &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot;), New York City (&quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;) and Corinth (&quot;Loving&quot;).

=== Crossovers ===
In 2000, &quot;All My Children&quot; was featured in a major crossover event that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. Linda Dano brought her &quot;One Life to Live&quot; character Rae Cummings, to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother Myrtle Fargate. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing &quot;All My Children&quot; character Skye Chandler, was Rae&#x27;s daughter. Skye, who had spent time on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1999 to 2001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;, where she became a member of the Quartermaine family, and made appearances until 2012.

&quot;All My Children&quot; has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 &#x27;baby switch&#x27; storyline with &quot;One Life to Live&quot; which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, ABC did a comedic crossover with the TV Land comedy &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by Wendie Malick but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on ABC alongside Susan Lucci. In the &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.

In 2017, &quot;All My Children&quot; character Alex Marick appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, where she masqueraded as her sister Anna Devane. She made further appearances in 2019 and 2020.

&quot;All My Children&quot; also gets mentioned in the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; where the character Joey Tribbiani goes up for the part of &quot;Nick the Boxer&quot; in &quot;All My Children&quot; and convinces one of his students in his acting class to portray Nick as homosexual in an attempt to put the casting directors off. Much to Joey&#x27;s disgust, the student gets the part. In addition the manager of the Central Perk coffeehouse, Gunther, reveals that he played Bryce in &quot;All My Children&quot; until his character was killed off.

The game company TSR, Inc. published the &quot;All My Children&quot; game in 1985, based on the series. The game sold over 150,000 copies.

A DVD was released on January 24, 2004, titled &quot;Daytime&#x27;s Greatest Weddings&quot; which contained &quot;All My Children&quot; and other daytime soaps&#x27; weddings.

A line of perfume and body lotion based on the series was also produced. It has long since been discontinued, though pieces occasionally surface on personal sale sites.
