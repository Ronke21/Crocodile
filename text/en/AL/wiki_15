<text>Wall Street is a 1987 American crime drama film, directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, which stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Daryl Hannah, and Martin Sheen. The film tells the story of Bud Fox (C. Sheen), a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider.

Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the Great Depression. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modelled on British financier and corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted Richard Gere, but Gere passed on the role.

The film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Douglas&#x27; character declaring that &quot;greed, for lack of a better word, is good.&quot; It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.

Stone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot;, which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.

==Plot==
In 1985, Bud Fox is a junior stockbroker at Jackson Steinem &amp; Co. in New York City. He wants to work with his hero, Gordon Gekko, a legendary Wall Street player. After calling Gekko&#x27;s office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko&#x27;s favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his persistence, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company&#x27;s maintenance workers&#x27; union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud&#x27;s clients.

After making a considerable amount of money from the Bluestar tip, Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects by honest research and advice from respected senior broker Lou Mannheim lose money. Gekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British investor Sir Lawrence Wildman. They deduce that Wildman is making a bid for Anacott Steel. Gekko buys a large block of shares in Anacott, which Wildman is forced to buy off him at a high price, to complete the takeover.

Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko&#x27;s promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side. He also gains a girlfriend, Gekko&#x27;s art consultant and ex-mistress, Darien, an interior decorator. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commissions he is bringing in and is given an office with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for himself and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Bud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar&#x27;s assets in order to access cash in the company&#x27;s pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko&#x27;s deceit and wracked with guilt for being an accessory to Bluestar&#x27;s impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko&#x27;s plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.

Bud and the union presidents secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy the stock and a controlling interest in Bluestar, at a significant discount, on the condition that he saves the company. Bud then devises a plan to leak news of Gekko&#x27;s takeover to drive the price up. This forces Gekko to buy the stock at a higher price, as he tries to secure a controlling interest. Bud then convinces the unions to pull their support, ending any prospect of Gekko completing the takeover, and causing the price to plummet. This forces Gekko to offload his stock at a considerable loss. When Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly returns to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested by the SEC, who had been tracking Bud&#x27;s insider trading.

Later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko punches Bud several times, berating him for his role with Bluestar, and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Later, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko for the authorities, who suggest he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for providing evidence against Gekko. Later, Bud&#x27;s parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York County Courthouse, telling Bud he &quot;did the right thing&quot; by cooperating with the government and paying back his illicit earnings, and urging him to accept Wildman&#x27;s offer of a job at Bluestar once he has completed his prison sentence. After suggesting Bud &quot;create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others&quot;, Carl drops Bud off at the courthouse, where he ascends the steps, ready to face justice for his crimes.

==Production==
===Development===
After the success of &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to research and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. The director had been thinking about this kind of a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.

The filmmaker knew a New York businessman who was making millions and working long days putting together deals all over the world. This man started making mistakes that cost him everything. Stone remembers that the &quot;story frames what happens in my movie, which is basically a &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; of a boy who is seduced and corrupted by the allure of easy money. And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself&quot;. Stone asked Weiser to read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own. Stone then asked Weiser to read &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for material that they could use, but it was not the right fit either. Weiser had no prior knowledge of the financial world and immersed himself in researching the world of stock trading, junk bonds, and corporate takeovers. He and Stone spent three weeks visiting brokerage houses and interviewing investors.

===Screenplay===
Weiser wrote the first draft, initially called &quot;Greed&quot;, with Stone writing another draft. Originally, Charlie Sheen&#x27;s character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed the name to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews. Reportedly, Gordon Gekko is said to be a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone&#x27;s who was involved in a $20Â million insider trading scandal in 1985, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, corporate raider Carl Icahn, investor and art collector Asher Edelman, agent Michael Ovitz, and Stone himself. For example, Stone told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that the &quot;Greed, for lack of a better word, is good&quot; line was based on a speech by Boesky where he said, &quot;Greed is right&quot;.

According to Edward R. Pressman, producer of the film, &quot;Originally, there was no one individual who Gekko was modeled on&quot;, he adds, &quot;But Gekko was partly Milken&quot;. Also, Pressman has said that the character of Sir Larry Wildman was modeled on James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French billionaire and corporate-raider.

According to Weiser, Gekko&#x27;s style of speaking was inspired by Stone. &quot;When I was writing some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver on the phone and sometimes he talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does&quot;. Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis and Victor Hugo, and the films of Paddy Chayefsky because they were able to make a complicated subject clear to the audience. Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986. This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, which had not yet occurred.

===Casting===
Stone met with Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the director had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Matthew Modine turned down the role of Bud Fox. Stone liked the &quot;stiffness&quot; of Sheen&#x27;s acting style and used it to convey Bud&#x27;s naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, &quot;I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn&#x27;t act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone&quot;. Nevertheless, Stone found out that &quot;when he&#x27;s acting he gives it his all&quot;. Stone said that he saw &quot;that villain quality&quot; in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, &quot;I thought it was a great part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I&#x27;d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable&quot;. For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.

Stone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox&#x27;s materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah&#x27;s idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. &quot;Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work&quot;. Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah&#x27;s role with hers. Stone admits that he had &quot;some problems&quot; with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.

===Principal photography===
Stone wanted to shoot the movie in New York City and that required a budget of at least $15Â million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed &quot;Platoon&quot; felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. Parts of the film were shot in Snowbird, Utah. According to Stone, he was &quot;making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [director of photography Robert Richardson] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no let-up until you get to the fixed world of Charlie&#x27;s father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values&quot;. The director saw [Wall Street] as a battle zone and &quot;filmed it as such&quot; including shooting conversations like physical confrontations, and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors &quot;in a way that makes you feel you&#x27;re in a pool with sharks&quot;.

Jeffrey &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Beck, a star investment banker at the time with Drexel Burnham Lambert, was one of the film&#x27;s technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. Kenneth Lipper, investment banker and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser. At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;. Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders&#x27; meeting where Gekko delivers his &quot;Greed is good&quot; speech. Stone agreed with Lipper&#x27;s criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.

Stone also consulted with Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, convicted inside trader David Brown, several government prosecutors, and Wall Street investment bankers. In addition, traders were brought in to coach actors on the set on how to hold phones, write out tickets, and talk to clients. Stone asked Lipper to design a six-week course that would expose Charlie Sheen to a cross section of young Wall Street business people. The actor said, &quot;I was impressed and very, very respectful of the fact that they could maintain that kind of aggressiveness and drive&quot;.

Douglas worked with a speech instructor on breath control in order to become better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film&#x27;s dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his &quot;repressed anger&quot;, according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas&#x27; trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because &quot;you look like you haven&#x27;t acted before&quot;. This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the &quot;Greed is good&quot; speech. Stone planned to use a &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with &quot;Fortune&quot;, which upset &quot;Forbes&quot; publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days in the last few weeks in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.

==Soundtrack==
The original score composed by Stewart Copeland was released on LP record in 1988, followed by a CD version in 1993.

==Themes==
The film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Gekko advocating &quot;greed, for lack of a better word, is good&quot;. &quot;Wall Street&quot; defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.

Carl (Martin Sheen&#x27;s character) represents the working class in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko&#x27;s relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox&#x27;s leftward leanings form the basis of the film&#x27;s subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in &quot;Platoon&quot;. In &quot;Wall Street&quot; the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko&#x27;s unrestrained personal philosophy.

A significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders&#x27; meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the &quot;Greed is good&quot; speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company&#x27;s management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed was adapted from a remark by Boesky, who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges. Delivering the 1986 commencement address to the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Berkeley, Boesky said, &quot;Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.&quot;

&quot;Wall Street&quot; is not a wholesale criticism of capitalism, but of the cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s. The &quot;good&quot; characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox&#x27;s question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko&#x27;s) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Sir Laurence Wildman genuinely attempts to save Anacott Steel and ultimately saves Blue Star instead, although Gekko taunts him that he laid off thousands of workers in previous companies which he took over. Lou Mannheim, the film&#x27;s archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that &quot;good things sometimes take time&quot;, referring to IBM and Hiltonâin contrast, Gekko&#x27;s &quot;Greed is Good&quot; credo and his frequent references to Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; typify the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Wall Street&quot; was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1Â million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $43.8Â million in the United States and Canada, earning theatrical rentals of $20Â million. Internationally, it earned rentals of $21Â million for a worldwide total of $41Â million.

The film has a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The consensus reads, &quot;With &quot;Wall Street&quot;, Oliver Stone delivers a blunt but effectiveâand thoroughly well-actedâjeremiad against its era&#x27;s veneration of greed as a means to its own end.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 56 out of 100 from 16 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby, while quite critical of the film overall, praised Douglas&#x27; work as &quot;the funniest, canniest performance of his career&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and praised it for allowing &quot;all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most of the time we know what&#x27;s going on. All of the time, we know why&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: &quot;But Douglas&#x27;s portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox (&#x27;Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings&#x27;), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult&quot;. Rita Kempley wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the film &quot;is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn&#x27;t trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery&quot;. F.F. Mormani, writing for The Objective Standard, calls the film &quot;mixed&quot;, explaining that it &quot;accurately portray[s] some aspects of the financial profession and unjustly demonizing it, too. But,&quot; she concludes, &quot;it is sufficiently thought provoking and philosophical to recommend watching or rewatching.&quot;

Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor and thanked Oliver Stone for &quot;casting me in a part that almost nobody thought I could play&quot;. However, Daryl Hannah&#x27;s performance was not as well received and earned her a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress, thus making this the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. The &quot;quintessential financial high-roller&#x27;s attire&quot; of Michael Douglas in the movie, designed by Alan Flusser, was emulated in the 1980s by yuppies.

Interest in the film was renewed in 1990 when the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine asked, &quot;Is Greed Dead?&quot; after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film&#x27;s screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, &quot;The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I wanted to get into such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko&quot;. In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In 2002, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in &quot;Wall Street&quot; has changed and he replied, &quot;The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, in the same way that Gordon Gekko&#x27;s buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Layâhe&#x27;s the new Gordon Gekko&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman commented in 2009 that the film &quot;reveals something now which it couldn&#x27;t back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren&#x27;t just getting richâthey were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us.&quot;

A 20th-anniversary edition was released on September 18, 2007. New extras include an on-camera introduction by Stone, extensive deleted scenes, &quot;Greed is Good&quot; featurettes, and interviews with Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen.

In reviewing the film&#x27;s sequel 23 years later, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that though the original film was &quot;intended as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed, Stone&#x27;s 1987 original instead had the effect of turning Douglas&#x27; hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon â an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set such a terrible example.&quot;

===Accolades===

==Sequel==

In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a sequel to &quot;Wall Street&quot;, to be subtitled &quot;Money Never Sleeps&quot;, was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial world than the one he once oversaw. Charlie Sheen would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a cameo role. Daryl Hannah would not be involved in the sequel.

But by April 2009, 20th Century Fox confirmed that the sequel was already in development and announced that Oliver Stone would direct. In addition, Shia LaBeouf was cast with Josh Brolin. Javier Bardem had been considered, but Bardem dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The film was finally released on September 24, 2010, and received mixed reviews.

<text>JosÃ© Zorrilla y Moral () was a Spanish poet and dramatist, who became National Laureate.

==Biography==
Zorrilla was born in Valladolid to a magistrate in whom Ferdinand VII placed special confidence. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Real Seminario de Nobles in Madrid, wrote verses when he was twelve, became an enthusiastic admirer of Walter Scott and Chateaubriand, and took part in the school performances of plays by Lope de Vega and CalderÃ³n de la Barca.

In 1833, he was sent to study law at the university of Toledo, but after a year of idleness, he fled to Madrid, where he horrified the friends of his absolutist father by making violent speeches and by founding a newspaper that promptly was suppressed by the government. He narrowly escaped transportation to the Philippines, and spent the next few years in poverty.

The death of the satirist Mariano JosÃ© de Larra brought Zorrilla into notice. His elegiac poem, read at Larra&#x27;s funeral in February 1837, introduced him to the leading men of letters. In 1837 he published a book of verses, mostly imitations of Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo, which was so favourably received that he printed six more volumes within three years.

After collaborating with Antonio GarcÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez on the play &quot;JuÃ¡n Dondolo&quot; (1839), Zorrilla began his individual career as a dramatist with &quot;Cada cual con su razÃ³n&quot; (1840), and during the next five years he wrote 22 plays, many of them extremely successful. His &quot;Cantos del trovador&quot; (1841), a collection of national legends written in verse, made Zorilla second only to JosÃ© de Espronceda in popular esteem.

National legends also supply the themes of his dramas, which Zorilla often constructed by adapting older plays that had fallen out of fashion. For example, in &quot;El Zapatero y el Rey&quot; he recasts &quot;El montanÃ©s Juan Pascual&quot; by Juan de la Hoz y Mota; in &quot;La mejor Talon la espada&quot; he borrows from AgustÃ­n Moreto y Cavana&#x27;s &quot;Travesuras del estudiante Pa-atoja&quot;. His famous play &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; is a combination of elements from Tirso de Molina&#x27;s &quot;Burlador de Sevilla&quot; and from Alexandre Dumas, pÃ¨re&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan de Marana&quot; (which itself derives from &quot;Les Ãmes du purgatoire&quot; by Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e). However, plays like &quot;Sancho GarcÃ­a&quot;, &quot;El Rey loco&quot;, and &quot;El Alcalde Ronquillo&quot; are much more original. He considered his last play, &quot;Traidor, inconfeso y mÃ¡rtir&quot; (1845), to be his best play.

Upon the death of his mother in 1847, Zorrilla left Spain. He resided for a while at Bordeaux, and settled in Paris, where his incomplete poem &quot;Granada&quot; was published in 1852. In a fit of depression, he emigrated to America three years later, hoping, he claimed, that yellow fever or smallpox would kill him. During eleven years in Mexico he wrote very little. He returned to Spain in 1866, to find himself half-forgotten and considered old-fashioned.

Friends helped Zorilla obtain a small post, but the republican minister later abolished it. He was always poor, especially for the 12 years after 1871. The publication of his autobiography, &quot;Recuerdos del tiempo viejo&quot; in 1880, did nothing to alleviate his poverty. Though his plays were still being performed, he received no money from them.

Finally, in his old age, critics began to reappraise his work, and brought him new fame. He received a pension of 30,000 reales, a gold medal of honor from the Spanish Academy, and, in 1889, the title of National Laureate. He died in Madrid on 23 January 1893.

In his early years, Zorrilla was known as an extraordinarily fast writer. He claimed he wrote &quot;El Caballo del Rey Don Sancho&quot; in three weeks, and that he put together &quot;El PuÃ±al del Godo&quot; in two days. This may account for some of the technical faultsâredundancy and verbosityâin his works. His plays often appeal to Spanish patriotic pride, and actors and audiences have enjoyed his effective dramaturgy. &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; is his best-known work.

<text>Sarbinowo () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina DÄbno, within MyÅlibÃ³rz County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in western Poland. It lies approximately south of DÄbno, south-west of MyÅlibÃ³rz, and south of the regional capital Szczecin. The village has a population of 490.

==History==
The territory formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century. After the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, it formed part of the duchies of Silesia and Greater Poland. Either Henry the Bearded or WÅadysÅaw Odonic granted the village to the Knights Templar by 1232. The village was first mentioned in 1261 as &quot;Torbarmstorp&quot; as their possession. It was annexed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and included within the New March. By 1335 it was known as &quot;Tzorbensdorf&quot;. From 1373, it formed part of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown Lands, ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in KrakÃ³w, by which Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the territory, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order. In 1540 it fell to John, Margrave of Brandenburg-KÃ¼strin. It was the scene of the Battle of Zorndorf, in which the Prussians under Frederick the Great fought the Russians commanded by William Fermor, on August 25, 1758. The battle was one of the bloodiest battles of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Zorndorf became part of the Province of Brandenburg in 1815 and the German Empire in 1871. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II it became again part of Poland.

<doc id="58875" wikidata="Q1066106" url="?curid=58875" title="Maclura pomifera">
<text>Maclura pomifera, commonly known as the Osage orange ( ), is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, native to the south-central United States. It typically grows about tall. The distinctive fruit, a multiple fruit that resembles an immature orange, is roughly spherical, bumpy, in diameter, and turns bright yellow-green in the fall. The fruit excretes a sticky white latex when cut or damaged. Despite the name &quot;Osage orange&quot;, it is not related to the orange. It is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae. Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals. Ecologists Daniel H. Janzen and Paul S. Martin proposed in 1982 that the fruit of this species might be an example of what has come to be called an evolutionary anachronismâthat is, a fruit coevolved with a large animal seed dispersal partner that is now extinct. This hypothesis is controversial.

&quot;Maclura pomifera&quot; has many common names, including mock orange, hedge apple, hedge ball, monkey ball, pap, monkey brains and yellow-wood. The name &quot;bois d&#x27;arc&quot; (French, meaning &quot;bow-wood&quot;) has also been corrupted into bodark and bodock.

== History ==
The earliest account of the tree in the English language was given by William Dunbar, a Scottish explorer, in his narrative of a journey made in 1804 from St. Catherine&#x27;s Landing on the Mississippi River to the Ouachita River. Meriwether Lewis sent some slips and cuttings of the curiosity to President Jefferson in March 1804. According to Lewis&#x27;s letter, the samples were donated by &quot;Mr. Peter Choteau, who resided the greater portion of his time for many years with the Osage Nation&quot;. (Note: This referred to Pierre Chouteau, a fur trader from Saint Louis.) Those cuttings did not survive. In 1810, Bradbury relates that he found two &quot;Maclura pomifera&quot; trees growing in the garden of Pierre Chouteau, one of the first settlers of Saint Louis, apparently the same person.

American settlers used the Osage orange (i.e. &quot;hedge apple&quot;) as a hedge to exclude free-range livestock from vegetable gardens and corn fields. Under severe pruning, the hedge apple sprouted abundant adventitious shoots from its base; as these shoots grew, they became interwoven and formed a dense, thorny barrier hedge. The thorny Osage orange tree was widely naturalized throughout the United States until this usage was superseded by the invention of barbed wire in 1874. By providing a barrier that was &quot;horse-high, bull-strong, and pig-tight&quot;, Osage orange hedges provided the &quot;crucial stop-gap measure for westward expansion until the introduction of barbed wire a few decades later&quot;.

The trees were named (&quot;bow-wood&quot;) by early French settlers who observed the wood being used for war clubs and bow-making by Native Americans. Meriwether Lewis was told that the people of the Osage Nation, &quot;So much ... esteem the wood of this tree for the purpose of making their bows, that they travel many hundreds of miles in quest of it.&quot; The trees are also known as &quot;bodark&quot;, &quot;bodarc&quot;, or &quot;bodock&quot; trees, most likely originating as a corruption of .

The Comanche also used this wood for their bows. They liked the wood because it was strong, flexible and durable, and the bush/tree was common along river bottoms of the ComancherÃ­a. Some historians believe that the high value this wood had to Native Americans throughout North America for the making of bows, along with its small natural range, contributed to the great wealth of the Spiroan Mississippian culture that controlled all the land in which these trees grew.

=== Etymology ===
The genus &quot;Maclura&quot; is named in honor of William Maclure (1763â1840), a Scottish-born American geologist. The specific epithet &quot;pomifera&quot; means &quot;fruit-bearing&quot;. The common name &quot;Osage&quot; derives from Osage Native Americans from whom young plants were first obtained, as told in the notes of Meriwether Lewis in 1804.

== Description ==

===General habit===
Mature trees range from tall with short trunks and round-topped canopies. The roots are thick, fleshy, and covered with bright orange bark. The tree&#x27;s mature bark is dark, deeply furrowed and scaly. The plant has significant potential to invade unmanaged habitats.

The wood of &quot;M. pomifera&quot; is golden to bright yellow but fades to medium brown with ultraviolet light exposure. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and flexible, capable of receiving a fine polish and very durable in contact with the ground. It has a specific gravity of 0.7736 or .

===Leaves and branches===
Leaves are arranged alternately in a slender growing shoot long. In form they are simple, a long oval terminating in a slender point. The leaves are long and wide, and are thick, firm, dark green, shining above, and paler green below when full grown. In autumn they turn bright yellow. The leaf axils contain formidable spines which when mature are about long.

Branchlets are at first bright green and pubescent; during their first winter they become light brown tinged with orange, and later they become a paler orange brown. Branches contain a yellow pith, and are armed with stout, straight, axillary spines. During the winter, the branches bear lateral buds that are depressed-globular, partly immersed in the bark, and pale chestnut brown in color.

===Flowers and fruit===
As a dioecious plant, the inconspicuous pistillate (female) and staminate (male) flowers are found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles developed from the axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year&#x27;s growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs. The ovule is solitary.

The mature multiple fruit&#x27;s size and general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green orange (the fruit), about in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound (or multiple) fruit is a syncarp of numerous small drupes, in which the carpels (ovaries) have grown together; thus, it is classified a multiple-accessory fruit. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed and rounded; they contain a milky latex which oozes when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong. Although the flowering is dioecious, the pistillate tree when isolated will still bear large oranges, perfect to the sight but lacking the seeds. The fruit has a cucumber-like flavor.

== Distribution ==

Osage orange&#x27;s pre-Columbian range was largely restricted to a small area in what is now the United States, namely the Red River drainage of Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, as well as the Blackland Prairies and post oak savannas. A disjunct population also occurred in the Chisos Mountains of Texas. It has since become widely naturalized in the United States and Ontario, Canada. Osage orange has been planted in all the 48 contiguous states of the United States and in southeastern Canada.

The largest known Osage orange tree is located at the Patrick Henry National Memorial, in Brookneal, Virginia, and is believed to be almost 350 years old. Another historic tree is located on the grounds of Fort Harrod, a Kentucky pioneer settlement in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.

=== Ecological aspects of historical distribution ===

Because of the limited original range and lack of obvious effective means of propagation, the Osage orange has been the subject of controversial claims by some authors to be an evolutionary anachronism, whereby one or more now extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as ground sloths, mammoths, mastodons or gomphotheres, fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal. An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant&#x27;s original dispersal agent because modern horses and other livestock will sometimes eat the fruit. This hypothesis is controversial. For example, a 2015 study indicated that Osage orange seeds are not effectively spread by extant horse or elephant species, while a 2018 study concludes that squirrels are ineffective, short-distance seed dispersers. The claim has been criticised as a &quot;just-so story&quot; that lacks any empirical evidence.

The fruit is not poisonous to humans or livestock, but is not preferred by them, because it is mostly inedible due to a large size (about the diameter of a softball) and hard, dry texture. The edible seeds of the fruit are used by squirrels as food. Large animals such as livestock, which typically would consume fruits and disperse seeds, mainly ignore the fruit.

==Ecology==
The fruits are consumed by black-tailed deer in Texas, and white-tailed deer and fox squirrels in the Midwest. Crossbills are said to peck the seeds out. Loggerhead shrikes, a declining species in much of North America, use the tree for nesting and cache prey items upon its thorns.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Maclura pomifera&quot; prefers a deep and fertile soil, but is hardy over most of the contiguous United States, where it is used as a hedge. It must be regularly pruned to keep it in bounds, and the shoots of a single year will grow long, making it suitable for coppicing. A neglected hedge will become fruit-bearing. It is remarkably free from insect predators and fungal diseases. A thornless male cultivar of the species exists and is vegetatively reproduced for ornamental use. &quot;M. pomifera&quot; is cultivated in Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, former USSR, and India.

== Chemistry ==
Osajin and pomiferin are isoflavones present in the wood and fruit in an approximately 1:2 ratio by weight, and in turn comprise 4â6% of the weight of dry fruit and wood samples. Primary components of fresh fruit include pectin (46%), resin (17%), fat (5%), and sugar (before hydrolysis, 5%). The moisture content of fresh fruits is about 80%.

== Uses ==

The Osage orange is commonly used as a tree row windbreak in prairie states, which gives it one of its colloquial names, &quot;hedge apple&quot;. It was one of the primary trees used in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Great Plains Shelterbelt&quot; WPA project, which was launched in 1934 as an ambitious plan to modify weather and prevent soil erosion in the Great Plains states; by 1942 it resulted in the planting of 30,233 shelterbelts containing 220 million trees that stretched for . The sharp-thorned trees were also planted as cattle-deterring hedges before the introduction of barbed wire and afterward became an important source of fence posts. In 2001, its wood was used in the construction in Chestertown, Maryland of the schooner &quot;Sultana&quot;, a replica of .

The heavy, close-grained yellow-orange wood is dense and prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong, dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes good bows, as used by Native Americans. John Bradbury, a Scottish botanist who had traveled the interior United States extensively in the early 19th century, reported that a bow made of Osage timber could be traded for a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, which can be used as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes. At present, florists use the fruits of &quot;M. pomifera&quot; for decorative purposes.

When dried, the wood has the highest heating value of any commonly available North American wood, and burns long and hot.

Osage orange wood is more rot-resistant than most, making good fence posts. They are generally set up green because the dried wood is too hard to reliably accept the staples used to attach the fencing to the posts. Palmer and Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Fieldbook of Natural History&quot; 2nd edition rates Osage orange wood as being at least twice as hard and strong as white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;). Its dense grain structure makes for good tonal properties. Production of woodwind instruments and waterfowl game calls are common uses for the wood.

Compounds extracted from the fruit, when concentrated, may repel insects. However, the naturally occurring concentrations of these compounds in the fruit are too low to make the fruit an effective insect repellent. In 2004, the EPA insisted that a website selling &quot;M. pomifera&quot; fruits online remove any mention of their supposed repellent properties as false advertising.

===Traditional medicine===
The Comanche formerly used a decoction of the roots topically as a wash to treat sore eyes.

<text>A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweetness like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy than sugar-based sweeteners, making it a zero-calorie () or low-calorie sweetener. Artificial sweeteners may be derived through manufacturing of plant extracts or processed by chemical synthesis. Sugar substitute products are commercially available in various forms, such as small pills, powders and packets.

Common sugar substitutes include aspartame, monk fruit extract, saccharin, sucralose, stevia, acesulfame potassium (ace-K) and cyclamate. These sweeteners are a fundamental ingredient in diet drinks to sweeten them without adding calories. Additionally, sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol are derived from sugars.

No links have been found between approved artificial sweeteners and cancer in humans. Reviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a safe replacement for sugars can help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight.

== Description ==
A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweetness like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy than sugar-based sweeteners, making it a zero-calorie () or low-calorie sweetener. Sugar substitute products are commercially available in various forms, such as small pills, powders and packets.

==Types==

Artificial sweeteners may be derived through manufacturing of plant extracts or processed by chemical synthesis.

High-intensity sweetenersâone type of sugar substituteâare compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose (common table sugar). As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most intense sweet sensation.

In North America, common sugar substitutes include aspartame, monk fruit extract, saccharin, sucralose and stevia. Cyclamate is prohibited from being used as a sweetener within the United States, but is allowed in other parts of the world.

Sorbitol, xylitol and lactitol are examples of sugar alcohols (also known as polyols). These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. Sometimes the sweetness profile is fine-tuned by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners.

=== Allulose ===
Allulose is a sweetener in the sugar family, with a chemical structure similar to fructose. It is naturally found in figs, maple syrup and some fruit. While it comes from the same family as other sugars, it does not substantially metabolize as sugar in the body. The FDA recognizes that allulose does not act like sugar, and as of 2019, no longer requires it to be listed with sugars on U.S. nutrition labels. Allulose is about 70% as sweet as sugar, which is why it is sometimes combined with high-intensity sweeteners to make sugar substitutes.

===Acesulfame potassium===

Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (common sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about two-thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one-third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame&#x27;s aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other&#x27;s aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.

Unlike aspartame, acesulfame potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, allowing it to be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.

===Aspartame ===

Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed that it had a sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 180â200 times sweeter than sugar, and can be used as a tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages and chewing gum. When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.

The safety of aspartame has been studied extensively since its discovery with research that includes animal studies, clinical and epidemiological research, and postmarketing surveillance, with aspartame being a rigorously tested food ingredient. Although aspartame has been subject to claims against its safety, multiple authoritative reviews have found it to be safe for consumption at typical levels used in food manufacturing. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and Health Canada.

===Cyclamate===
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of cyclamate in 1969 after lab tests in rats involving a 10:1 mixture of cyclamate and saccharin (at levels comparable to humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day) caused bladder cancer. This information, however, is regarded as &quot;weak&quot; evidence of carcinogenic activity, and cyclamate remains in common use in many parts of the world, including Canada, the European Union and Russia.

===Mogrosides (monk fruit)===

Mogrosides, extracted from monk fruit (which is commonly also called ), are recognized as safe for human consumption and are used in commercial products worldwide. As of 2017, it is not a permitted sweetener in the European Union, although it is allowed as a flavor at concentrations where it does not function as a sweetener. In 2017, a Chinese company requested a scientific review of its mogroside product by the European Food Safety Authority. It is the basis of McNeil Nutritionals&#x27;s tabletop sweetener Nectresse in the United States and Norbu Sweetener in Australia.

===Saccharin===
Apart from sugar of lead (used as a sweetener in ancient through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), saccharin was the first artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process for the creation of saccharin from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times sweeter than sucrose and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.

Fear about saccharin increased when a 1960 study showed that high levels of saccharin may cause bladder cancer in laboratory rats. In 1977, Canada banned saccharin as a result of the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning saccharin in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a warning label and also mandated further study of saccharin safety.

Subsequently, it was discovered that saccharin causes cancer in male rats by a mechanism not found in humans. At high doses, saccharin causes a precipitate to form in rat urine. This precipitate damages the cells lining the bladder (urinary bladder urothelial cytotoxicity) and a tumor forms when the cells regenerate (regenerative hyperplasia). According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, &quot;This mechanism is not relevant to humans because of critical interspecies differences in urine composition&quot;.

In 2001, the United States repealed the warning label requirement, while the threat of an FDA ban had already been lifted in 1991. Most other countries also permit saccharin, but restrict the levels of use, while other countries have outright banned it.

The EPA has removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010 release, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.

=== Steviol glycosides (stevia) ===
Stevia is a natural non-caloric sweetener derived from the &quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; plant, and is manufactured as a sweetener. It is indigenous to South America, and has historically been used in Japanese food products, although it is now common internationally. In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on stevia because it had not been approved as a food additive, although it continued to be available as a dietary supplement. After being provided with sufficient scientific data demonstrating safety of using stevia as a manufactured sweetener, from companies such as Cargill and Coca-Cola, the FDA gave a &quot;no objection&quot; status as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in December 2008 to Cargill for its stevia product, Truvia, for use of the refined stevia extracts as a blend of rebaudioside A and erythritol. In Australia, the brand Vitarium uses Natvia, a stevia sweetener, in a range of sugar-free children&#x27;s milk mixes.

In August 2019, the FDA placed an import alert on stevia leaves and crude extractsâwhich do not have GRAS statusâand on foods or dietary supplements containing them, citing concerns about safety and potential for toxicity.

===Sucralose===

The world&#x27;s most commonly used artificial sweetener, sucralose is a chlorinated sugar that is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. It is produced from sucrose when three chlorine atoms replace three hydroxyl groups. It is used in beverages, frozen desserts, chewing gum, baked goods and other foods. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it is stable when heated and can therefore be used in baked and fried goods. Discovered in 1976, the FDA approved sucralose for use in 1998.

Most of the controversy surrounding Splenda, a sucralose sweetener, is focused not on safety but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, &quot;Splenda is made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.&quot; Sucralose is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or raffinose. With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.
The &quot;Truth About Splenda&quot; website was created in 2005 by the Sugar Association, an organization representing sugar beet and sugar cane farmers in the United States, to provide its view of sucralose. In December 2004, five separate false-advertising claims were filed by the Sugar Association against Splenda manufacturers Merisant and McNeil Nutritionals for claims made about Splenda related to the slogan, &quot;Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.&quot; French courts ordered the slogan to no longer be used in France, while in the U.S., the case came to an undisclosed settlement during the trial.

There are few safety concerns pertaining to sucralose and the way sucralose is metabolized suggests a reduced risk of toxicity. For example, sucralose is extremely insoluble in fat and, thus, does not accumulate in fatty tissues; sucralose also does not break down and will dechlorinate only under conditions that are not found during regular digestion (i.e., high heat applied to the powder form of the molecule). Only about 15% of sucralose is absorbed by the body and most of it passes out of the body unchanged.

In 2017, sucralose was the most common sugar substitute used in the manufacture of foods and beverages; it had 30% of the global market, which was projected to be valued at $2.8 billion by 2021.

===Sugar alcohol===

Sugar alcohols, or polyols, are sweetening and bulking ingredients used in the manufacturing of foods and beverages, particularly sugar-free candies, cookies and chewing gums. As a sugar substitute, they typically are less-sweet and supply fewer calories (about a half to one-third fewer calories) than sugar. They are converted to glucose slowly, and do not spike increases in blood glucose.

Sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, erythritol and lactitol are examples of sugar alcohols. These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose, but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. The sweetness profile may be altered during manufacturing by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners.

Sugar alcohols are carbohydrates with a biochemical structure partially matching the structures of sugar and alcohol, although not containing ethanol. They are not entirely metabolized by the human body. The unabsorbed sugar alcohols may cause bloating and diarrhea due to their osmotic effect, if consumed in sufficient amounts. They are found commonly in small quantities in some fruits and vegetables, and are commercially manufactured from different carbohydrates and starch.

== Production ==
The majority of sugar substitutes approved for food use are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk plant-derived sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol, xylitol and lactitol. As it is not commercially profitable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol.

==Use==

=== Reasons for use ===
Sugar substitutes are used instead of sugar for a number of reasons, including:

==== Dental care ====
Carbohydrates and sugars usually adhere to the tooth enamel, where bacteria feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. A sweetener that may benefit dental health is xylitol, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually tooth decay. A Cochrane review, however, found only low-quality evidence that xylitol in a variety of dental products actually has any benefit in preventing tooth decay in adults and children.

==== Dietary concerns ====
Sugar substitutes are a fundamental ingredient in diet drinks to sweeten them without adding calories. Additionally, sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol are derived from sugars. In the United States, six high-intensity sugar substitutes have been approved for use: aspartame, sucralose, neotame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), saccharin and advantame. Food additives must be approved by the FDA, and sweeteners must be proven as safe via submission by a manufacturer of a GRAS document. The conclusions about GRAS are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including rigorous toxicological and clinical studies. GRAS notices exist for two plant-based, high-intensity sweeteners: steviol glycosides obtained from stevia leaves (&quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot;) and extracts from &quot;Siraitia grosvenorii&quot;, also called &quot;luo han guo&quot; or monk fruit.

===== Glucose metabolism =====
*Diabetes mellitus â People with diabetes limit refined sugar intake to regulate their blood sugar levels. Many artificial sweeteners allow sweet-tasting food without increasing blood glucose. Others do release energy but are metabolized more slowly, preventing spikes in blood glucose. A concern, however, is that overconsumption of foods and beverages made more appealing with sugar substitutes may increase risk of developing diabetes. A 2014 systematic review showed that a 330ml/day (an amount little less than the standard U.S can size) consumption of artificially sweetened beverages lead to increased risks of type 2 diabetes. A 2015 meta-analysis of numerous clinical studies showed that habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice increased the risk of developing diabetes, although with inconsistent results and generally low quality of evidence. A 2016 review described the relationship between non-nutritive sweeteners as inconclusive. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared several non-nutritive sweeteners to sugar, placebo and a nutritive low-calorie sweetener (tagatose), but the results were unclear for effects on HbA1c, body weight and adverse events. The studies included were mainly of very low certainty and did not report on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality or socioeconomic effects.
*Reactive hypoglycemia â Individuals with reactive hypoglycemia will produce an excess of insulin after quickly absorbing glucose into the bloodstream. This causes their blood glucose levels to fall below the amount needed for proper body and brain function. As a result, like diabetics, they must avoid intake of high-glycemic foods like white bread, and often use artificial sweeteners for sweetness without blood glucose.

==== Cost and shelf life ====
Many sugar substitutes are cheaper than sugar in the final food formulation. Sugar substitutes are often lower in total cost because of their long shelf life and high sweetening intensity. This allows sugar substitutes to be used in products that will not perish after a short period of time.

===Acceptable daily intake levels===

In the United States, the FDA provides guidance for manufacturers and consumers about the daily limits for consuming high-intensity sweeteners, a measure called &quot;acceptable daily intake&quot; (ADI). During their premarket review for all of the high-intensity sweeteners approved as food additives, the FDA established an ADI defined as an amount in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/d), indicating that a high-intensity sweetener does not cause safety concerns if estimated daily intakes are lower than the ADI. The FDA states: &quot;An ADI is the amount of a substance that is considered safe to consume each day over the course of a person&#x27;s lifetime.&quot; For stevia (specifically, steviol glycosides), an ADI was not derived by the FDA, but by the Joint Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives, whereas an ADI has not been determined for monk fruit.

For the sweeteners approved as food additives, the ADIs in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day are:
* Acesulfame potassium, ADI 15
* Advantame, ADI 32.8
* Aspartame, ADI 50
* Neotame, ADI 0.3
* Saccharin, ADI 15
* Sucralose, ADI 5
* Stevia (pure extracted steviol glycosides), ADI 4
* Monk fruit extract, no ADI determined

=== Mouthfeel ===
If the sucrose, or other sugar, that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in soft drinks or sweet teas that are labeled as &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;light&quot; that contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different mouthfeel, or in table sugar replacements that mix maltodextrins with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.

== Sweetness intensity ==
The FDA has published estimates of sweetness intensity, called a &quot;multiplier of sweetness intensity&quot; (MSI) as compared to table sugar.

=== Plant-derived ===

The sweetness levels and energy densities are in comparison to those of sucrose.

===Artificial===


=== Sugar alcohols ===
==Research==

===Body weight===

Reviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a safe replacement for sugars may help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight. Other reviews found that the association between body weight and non-nutritive sweetener usage is inconclusive. Observational studies tend to show a relation with increased body weight, while randomized controlled trials instead show a little causal weight loss. Other reviews concluded that use of non-nutritive sweeteners instead of sugar reduces body weight.

===Obesity===
There is little evidence that artificial sweeteners directly affect the onset and mechanisms of obesity, although consuming sweetened products is associated with weight gain in children. Some preliminary studies indicate that consumption of products manufactured with artificial sweeteners is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, decreased satiety, disturbed glucose metabolism, and weight gain, mainly due to increased overall calorie intake, although the numerous factors influencing obesity remain poorly studied, as of 2021.

===Cancer===

Multiple reviews have found no link between artificial sweeteners and the risk of cancer. FDA scientists have reviewed scientific data regarding the safety of aspartame and different sweeteners in food, concluding that they are safe for the general population under common intake conditions.

===Mortality===
High consumption of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with a 12% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 23% higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a 2021 meta-analysis. A 2020 meta-analysis found a similar result, with the highest consuming group having a 13% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 25% higher risk of CVD mortality. However, both studies also found similar or greater increases in all-cause mortality when consuming the same amount of sugar-sweetened beverages.

== Non-nutritive sweeteners vs sugar ==
The World Health Organization does not recommend using non-nutritive sweeteners to control body weight, based on a 2022 review that could only find small reductions in body fat and no effect on cardiometabolic risk. It recommends fruit or non-sweetened foods instead.

<text>Stratford-upon-Avon ( ), commonly known as just Stratford, is a market town and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon district, in the county of Warwickshire, in the West Midlands region of England. It is situated on the River Avon, north-west of London, south-east of Birmingham and south-west of Warwick. The town is the southernmost point of the Arden area at the northern extremity of the Cotswolds. In the 2021 census Stratford had a population of 30,495.

Stratford was inhabited originally by Britons before Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor, John of Coutances, set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196. In that same year, Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town, giving it its status as a market town. As a result, Stratford experienced an increase in trade and commerce as well as urban expansion.

Stratford is a popular tourist destination, owing to its status as the birthplace and burial place of playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It receives approximately 2.7 million visitors a year. The Royal Shakespeare Company resides in Stratford&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Theatre.

==Etymology==
The name is a combination of the Old English &quot;strÇ£t&quot; (from Latin &quot;stratum&quot;), meaning &#x27;street&#x27;, &quot;ford&quot;, indicating a shallow part of a river or stream, allowing it to be crossed by walking or driving, and &quot;avon&quot; which is a Celtic word for river (Modern Welsh &quot;afon&quot;). The &#x27;street&#x27; was a Roman road which connected Icknield Street in Alcester to the Fosse Way. The ford, which has been used as a crossing since Roman times, later became the location of Clopton Bridge.

A survey of 1251â52 uses the name Stratford for the first time to identify Old Stratford and the newer manors. The name was used after that time to describe the area specifically surrounding the Holy Trinity Church and the street of the Old Town.

==History==
===Roman===
The Stratford area was settled during the Roman period as the area was crossed by a Roman road: archaeological remains of a small Roman town have been found, about northeast of Stratford town centre at Tiddington, now part of Stratford, which was occupied from the 1st to the 5th century AD. The remains of two further probable Roman settlements have been found within a few miles of modern-day Stratford.

=== Medieval ===
The settlement which later became known as Stratford was first inhabited by Anglo-Saxons following their 7th-century invasion of what would become known as Warwickshire, but was then part of the Kingdom of Mercia. It is likely that an Anglo-Saxon monastery existed at the site of what is now Holy Trinity Church, which was founded after the land was acquired by Egwin, the third Bishop of Worcester (693â714). The monastery was likely destroyed by Viking invaders in 1015. The land remained in the ownership of the Bishops of Worcester until the 16th century. The area around Holy Trinity Church is still known as &quot;Old Town&quot; as it was the original area of settlement around the monastery. The focus of the settlement at Stratford was later moved north, closer to the river crossing, which was better positioned for trade.

Stratford, then referred to as &quot;strete ford&quot;, remained a village until the late 12th century when it was developed into a town by lord of the manor, Bishop John of Coutances. Coutances laid out a new town plan in 1196 around north of the original settlement, based on a grid system to expand Stratford and allow people to rent property in order to trade within the town. Coutances granted his new tenants the right to rent property and transmit it at death. This was called burgage tenure. Each development plot or &quot;burgage&quot; consisted of around . A charter was granted to Stratford by King Richard I in 1196 which allowed a weekly market to be held in the town, giving it its status as a market town. These two charters, which formed the foundations of Stratford&#x27;s transformation from a village to a town, make the town of Stratford over 800 years old, the town celebrated
its 800th anniversary in 1996.
John of Coutances&#x27; plans to develop Stratford into a town meant Stratford became a place of work for tradesmen and merchants. By 1252 the town had approximately 240 burgages (town rental properties owned by a king or lord), as well as shops, stalls and other buildings. Stratford&#x27;s tradesmen established a guild known as the Guild of the Holy Cross for their business and religious requirements. The guild developed into the town&#x27;s main institution of local government, and included the most important townsmen, who elected officials to oversee local affairs. They built a Guild Chapel in the 13th century, and a Guildhall and almshouses on Church Street in around 1417. The guild established an educational institution in the late 13th century.

Many of the town&#x27;s earliest and most important buildings are located along what is known as Stratford&#x27;s Historic Spine, which was once the main route from the town centre to the parish church. The route of the Historic Spine begins at Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace in Henley Street. It continues through Henley Street to the top end of Bridge Street and into the High Street where many Elizabethan buildings are located, including Harvard House. The route carries on through Chapel Street where Nash&#x27;s House and New Place are sited. Opposite New Place was The Falcon Hotel (now Hotel Indigo), at the corner of Scholars Lane. It is a timber-framed house with nearly 100-ft frontage to the street and dating perhaps from the end of the 15th century. The Historic Spine continues along Church Street where the Guild buildings are located dating back to the 15th century, as well as 18th- and 19th-century properties. The route then finishes in the Old Town, which includes Hall&#x27;s Croft and the Holy Trinity Church.
During Stratford&#x27;s early expansion into a town, the only access across the River Avon into and out of the town was over a wooden bridge, which was first mentioned in 1235. The bridge could not be crossed at times due to the river rising and was described by antiquarian John Leland as &quot;a poor bridge of timber and no causeway to it, whereby many poor folks and other refused to come to Stratford when the Avon was up, or coming thither stood in jeopardy of life.&quot; In 1484, a new masonry arch bridge was built to replace it called Clopton Bridge, named after Hugh Clopton who paid for its construction, a wealthy local man who later became the Lord Mayor of London. The new bridge made it easier for people to trade within Stratford and for passing travellers to stay in the town.

===Tudor period===
The medieval structures of local governance underwent significant changes during the Tudor period: The Guild of the Holy Cross was abolished in 1547 under King Edward VI&#x27;s suppression of religious guilds, and the inhabitants of Stratford petitioned the Crown for a charter of incorporation as a borough, which they received in 1553. This allowed the formation a new Town Council which inherited the property and responsibilities of the abolished guild. The Charter of Incorporation refounded Stratford&#x27;s school as the King Edward VI School

The Cotswolds, located close to Stratford, was a major sheep-producing area up until the latter part of the 19th century, with Stratford one of its main centres for the processing, marketing, and distribution of sheep and wool. Consequently, Stratford became a centre for tanning during the 15thâ17th centuries. Glove making was an important industry, which was at its zenith in the 15th and 16th centuries. As was malting, the processing of grain to turn it into malt.

John Shakespeare, originally a farmer, had moved to Stratford in 1551, from the nearby village of Snitterfield and became a successful glover (glove maker) and businessman, and an official on the Town Council. He met and married Mary Arden a member of the local gentry in around 1557. Together they had eight children, including Stratford&#x27;s most famous son William Shakespeare in 1564, believed to be at the house now known as Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace.

===17th and 18th centuries===
Stratford was the centre of considerable activity and some fighting during the English Civil War. Being located at the junction of several main roads, it was strategically important for both the Royalist and Parliamentarian armies. Due to its close proximity to the Parliamentarian stronghold of Warwick, Stratford remained under Parliamentarian control for the majority of the conflict, although it was only directly occupied by troops for sporadic intervals. In February 1643, Stratford was occupied by Royalist forces under Colonel Wagstaffe.

It was recaptured by Parliamentarians under Lord Brooke on 25 February after an engagement on the nearby road to Warwick. Having secured the town, Brooke returned to Warwick. In one notable incident in February 1643, Stratford&#x27;s Market Hall, at the site of the current Town Hall, was destroyed after three barrels of gunpowder which were being stored there blew up. From March 1644, until part of the following year, Stratford appears to have been continuously occupied by Parliamentarian troops. There was one further Royalist raid in April 1645.

A number of famous people passed through Stratford during the conflict: In April 1643, Prince Rupert passed through, he was at Stratford again in July, where he met the Queen Henrietta Maria, who was travelling through the Midlands, and she was the guest of honour of Susanna Hall, William Shakespeare&#x27;s daughter, at New Place. Oliver Cromwell was at Stratford in December 1646, and again in 1651, before the Battle of Worcester.

Despite Stratford&#x27;s increase in trade, it barely grew between the middle of the 13th century and the end of the 16th century, with a survey of the town showing 217 houses belonged to the lord of the manor in 1590. Growth continued to be slow throughout the 17th century, with hearth tax returns showing that at most there were approximately 429 houses in the town by 1670. However, more substantial expansion began following several inclosure acts in the late 18th century, with the first and largest development by John Payton who developed land on the north side of the old town, creating several streets including John Street and Payton Street.

In 1769, the actor David Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee over three days which saw the construction of a large rotunda and the influx of many visitors. This contributed to the growing phenomenon of Bardolatry which made Stratford a tourist destination.

Before the dominance of road and rail, Stratford was an important gateway to the network of British canals. The River Avon was made navigable through Stratford in 1639, by the construction of locks and weirs, providing Stratford with a navigable link to the River Severn to the south-west and to near Warwick to the north-east, this allowed, in the words of Daniel Defoe &quot;a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead and in a word, all heavy goods which are carried by water almost as far as Warwick; and in return the corn, and especially the cheese, is brought back from Gloucestershire and Warwickshire to Bristol&quot;.

===19th century to present===
Between 1793 and 1816 the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was built, linking the Avon at Stratford with Birmingham. By the early 19th century, Stratford was a flourishing inland port, and an important centre of trade, with many canal and river wharves along what is now Bancroft Gardens.

The first railway in Warwickshire; the Stratford and Moreton Tramway was opened to Stratford in 1826: this was a horse-drawn wagonway, long, which was intended to carry goods between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, the rural districts of south Warwickshire and Moreton-in-Marsh. The tramway fell into disuse by the early 1900s, and the tracks were lifted in 1918. A surviving remnant of this is the Tramway Bridge over the River Avon, a brick arch bridge which now carries pedestrians.

The first steam railway to reach Stratford was a branch of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway from to the south, which opened in July 1859. This was followed by the Stratford on Avon Railway&#x27;s branch from Hatton from the north, which opened in October 1860. Both branches initially had separate termini, but they soon agreed to join the two branches and open the current railway station, which was opened in July 1861. Both branches later came under the control of the Great Western Railway. The connection of Stratford to the growing national railway network, helped enable the development of the modern tourism industry.
Stratford did not become a major centre of industry during the Industrial Revolution, but some industries did grow up locally: Edward Fordham Flower opened a large canal side brewery in Stratford in 1831. The Flower &amp; Sons Brewery, on Clopton Road survived until 1967, when the company was taken over by Whitbread. Several lime kilns were opened locally, and the manufacture of tarpaulin and oilcloth flourished. The advent of rail transport in the middle of the century caused a major decline in river and canal transport, and the River Avon navigation through Stratford was abandoned in 1875. It was restored as a navigation by volunteers almost a century later in 1974.

Victorian Stratford&#x27;s growth as a tourist destination was further enhanced by Edward Fordham Flower and his son Charles Edward Flower, owners of a local brewery business, and important figures in local affairs: Through their campaigning and fundraising efforts, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was opened on the banks of the Avon in 1879. The original theatre was destroyed by fire in 1926. Its replacement was opened in 1932, designed by Elisabeth Scott, making it the first important building by a woman architect erected in Britain.

In 1974, the old borough of Stratford was abolished and merged into the much larger Stratford-on-Avon District, The area of the borough became a successor parish with a Town Council.

==Governance==

Stratford-upon-Avon is within the Stratford-on-Avon parliamentary constituency which has been represented by Manuela Perteghella of the Liberal Democrats since 2024. Stratford was within the West Midlands Region constituency of the European Parliament which was represented by seven Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Stratford is governed by three tiers of local government:
* County-level: Warwickshire County Council is a non-metropolitan county council, responsible for education, highways and other strategic matters.
* District-level: Stratford-on-Avon District Council is responsible for housing, planning, rubbish collection and other local matters in Stratford and neighbouring towns and villages. The council is based at Elizabeth House, Church Street.
* Parish-level: Stratford-upon-Avon Town Council is a parish council, responsible for crime prevention, cemeteries, public conveniences, litter, river moorings, parks, grants via the Town Trust and the selection of the town&#x27;s mayor. The Town Council is based at the Town Hall in Sheep Street. The Stratford-upon-Avon Town Trust is based in the Civic Hall, Rother Street. The council serves the civil parish and is split into nine wards: Avenue, Bishopton, Bridgetown, Clopton, Guildhall, Hathaway, Shottery, Tiddington, and Welcombe, with two councillors representing each ward. The parish absorbed Old Stratford and Drayton in March 2015.

==Geography==

Stratford is south-east of Birmingham. It is close to the northern edge of the Cotswolds, with Chipping Campden to the south. Stratford is around to the north-east of the borders with both Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. Other than those already mentioned, significant towns and villages nearby include Alcester, Wellesbourne, Evesham, Redditch and Henley-in-Arden.

Stratford is divided by the River Avon, with the majority of the town being on the west side of the river, its riverside location means it is susceptible to flooding, including flash floods.

Stratford has several suburbs: The town&#x27;s urban area encompasses the contiguous sub-villages of Alveston, Shottery and Tiddington, which were formerly independent, but now form part of the civil parish of Stratford, other distinct suburbs of the town include Bishopton, Bridge Town, Clopton and Old Town.

===Tourism===
The regular large influx of tourists is the major source of the town&#x27;s prosperity, receiving between 2.5 million and 3 million visitors annually. Stratford is a major English tourist town due to it being the birthplace of William Shakespeare, who many consider the greatest playwright of all time. In 2010 the District Council spent Â£298,000 on tourism promotion and supports an official open-top tour bus service. In 2010 Stratford-on-Avon District Council launched a re-branded official tourism website for the Stratford area called Discover Stratford after opening a new tourist information centre on Henley Street in May 2010, which has since moved back to the original location on Bridgefoot.

===Shopping centres===

The Rosebird Centre is a much smaller shopping centre located on Shipston Road, consisting of Waitrose, a pet shop, a drive-thru Costa Coffee and a pharmacy/GP surgery. Bell Court Shopping Centre is in the centre of the town with entrances from Wood St, Ely St, High St &amp; Rother Street. it has several restaurants and shopping offers.

==Culture==
===Theatre===
The first real theatre in Stratford was a temporary wooden affair built in 1769 by the actor David Garrick for his Shakespeare Jubilee celebrations of that year to mark William Shakespeare&#x27;s birthday. The theatre, built not far from the site of the present Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was almost washed away in two days of torrential rain that resulted in terrible flooding. To celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth in 1864, brewer Charles Edward Flower instigated the building of a temporary wooden theatre, known as the Tercentenary Theatre, which was built in a part of the brewer&#x27;s large gardens on what is today the site of the new, and temporary, Courtyard Theatre. After three months the Tercentenary Theatre was dismantled, with the timber used for housebuilding purposes.

In the early 1870s, Flower gave several acres of riverside land to the local council on the understanding that a permanent theatre be built in honour of Shakespeare&#x27;s memory, and by 1879 the first Shakespeare Memorial Theatre had been completed. It proved to be a huge success, and by the early 20th century it was effectively being run by the actor/manager Frank Benson. The theatre burned down in 1926, with the then artistic director, William Bridges-Adams, moving all productions to the local cinema.

An architectural competition was arranged to elicit designs for a new theatre, with the winner, English architect Elisabeth Scott, creating the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The new theatre, adjoining what was left of the old theatre, was opened by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, in 1932. The new theatre had many illustrious artistic directors, including the actor Anthony Quayle. Sir Peter Hall was appointed artistic director (designate) in 1959, and formed the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1961.

The Royal Shakespeare Company also runs two smaller theatres, the Swan Theatre, which was created in the 1980s out of the shell of the remains of the original Memorial Theatre and is modelled on an Elizabethan theatre, quickly becoming one of the finest acting spaces in the United Kingdom, and The Other Place theatre. Along with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST), the Swan Theatre closed in 2007 for refurbishment and reopened in November 2010. The Other Place, a Black box theatre, was extended to become the temporary RSC Courtyard Theatre, opening in July 2006 and was the home of the RSC while the RST was being refurbished â its interior is similar to the interior of the refurbished RST. The Courtyard Theatre closed in 2015 and was replaced by The Other Place in March 2016, which returned as a 200-seat studio theatre within the steel extension in which the Courtyard Theatre was located.

Stratford is home to The Bear Pit Theatre which was founded in 2008 as a voluntary organisation. It has 100 seats and is part of the Little Theatre Guild. The Attic Theatre is Stratford-upon-Avon&#x27;s premiere fringe theatre. Established by husband-and-wife team John-Robert and Catherine Partridge and in 2009, who also run the award-winning Tread The Boards Theatre Company. The venue is located next door to Cox&#x27;s Yard and hosts an intimate 90-seat auditorium in the Grade 2 listed Attic space.

The Waterside Theatre, which is not part of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre complex, re-opened in December 2004, then closed in September 2008. During this span, the theatre housed the Shakespearience visitor attraction. This has now been turned into the Clore Learning Centre, the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s education and events venue. In 1988, Stratford-upon-Avon was the venue for the disastrous provincial try-out of the ill-fated musical &quot;Carrie&quot;, based on the Stephen King novel.

Kempe Studio of The Rudolf Kempe Society, whose patron is Dame Judi Dench, is based in a house at 58 Waterside called The Muses and hosts musical events and masterclass lessons. No. 1 Shakespeare Street holds regular evenings of live music.

=== Museums and Shakespeare&#x27;s houses ===
Tudor World is a museum which explores the time when Shakespeare lived. It is based in a Grade II* listed town centre Tudor building and is the only museum in the country dedicated to Tudor times. Every week there is a walk around the town with Shakespeare. The Mechanical Art and Design museum, but better known as MAD museum, is a museum in Henley Street of &quot;brilliant-but-bonkers machines&quot; made by Kinetic artists. Items on show include mechanised flipbooks and a musical typewriter.

There are five houses relating to William Shakespeare&#x27;s life which are owned and cared for by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. These include Hall&#x27;s Croft, the one-time home of Shakespeare&#x27;s daughter, Susanna, and her husband Dr. John Hall and Nash&#x27;s House, which stands alongside the site of New Place which was owned by Shakespeare himself, wherein he died. In Shottery is Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Cottage, the home of Shakespeare&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family prior to her marriage. Mary Arden&#x27;s House (Palmer&#x27;s Farm), the family home of his mother, is in Wilmcote.

Elsewhere in the district are farms and buildings at Snitterfield, that belonged to the family of Shakespeare&#x27;s father. King Edward VI School, located on the corner of Church Street and Chapel Lane, is a grammar school thought to have been attended by Shakespeare. In 2016, the school room where Shakespeare is believed to have studied opened to visitors.

== Streets ==
===Church Street===

Church Street, an extension of Chapel St and the High St, has the old frontage of King Edward VI School, the school thought to have been attended by Shakespeare.

===Henley Street===
Henley Street, one of the town&#x27;s oldest streets, underwent substantial architectural change between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. John Shakespeare&#x27;s large half-timbered dwelling, purchased by him in 1556, was in 1564 the birthplace of his son William. According to a descriptive placard provided for tourists there:
The property remained in the ownership of William Shakespeare&#x27;s direct descendants until 1670, when his granddaughter, Elizabeth Barnard, died. As she had no children, Elizabeth left the estate to her relative Thomas Hart, Shakespeare&#x27;s great-nephew. The main house became a tenanted inn called the &quot;Maidenhead&quot; (later the &quot;Swan and Maidenhead&quot;) following the death of John Shakespeare in 1601. Members of the Hart family continued living in the small adjoining cottage throughout the century.

At the end of the 19th century, Edward Gibbs renovated the building to more closely represent the original Tudor farmhouse. Adjacent to Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace stands the Shakespeare Centre, completed in 1964 and not far from the Carnegie Library, opened in 1905. The large half-timbered building, which now comprises numbers 19, 20 and 21, was formerly the &quot;White Lion Inn&quot;. It is first mentioned in 1603. and was adjoined on the east by a smaller inn called the &quot;Swan&quot;.

In 1745 the latter was purchased by John Payton, who acquired the &quot;Lion&quot; five years later and rebuilt the whole premises on a greatly enlarged scale. The work was completed by James Collins of Birmingham, builder, in 1753. Payton &quot;brought the house into great vogue&quot; though Byng in 1792 complained that &quot;at the noted White Lion, I met with nothing but incivility&quot; (cited from &quot;Torrington Diaries&quot; (ed. Andrews), iii, 152).

Payton was succeeded as innkeeper by his son John, and its reputation as one of the best inns on the Holyhead Road must have contributed not a little to the prosperity of the town. David Garrick stayed at the &quot;White Lion Inn&quot; during the Shakespeare Jubilee of 1769. and George IV, as Prince Regent, visited it when he came to Stratford in 1806. Its great days came to an end after John Payton the younger sold it to Thomas Arkell in 1823. The building is now home to the Enchanted Manor Museum at the Creaky Cauldron and Magic Alley; the Box Brownie CafÃ©; Doug Brown&#x27;s Really Good Gift Company; and the Not Just Shakespeare Tourist Information Centre. Henley Street is now a major tourist and shopping precinct with many &quot;al fresco&quot; cafÃ©s and street entertainers.

===Scholars Lane===

Scholars Lane, opposite King Edward VI School, was included in the 1196 grid plan. Its original name, first recorded in about 1330, was Tinkers Lane, or the street where tinkers would gather on market days to mend pots and pans.

===Sheep Street===
Sheep Street runs from Ely Street eastwards to the Waterside. It was a residential quarter in the 16th century, some of the buildings were rebuilt following the fire of 1595, although many, such as Number 40, date from 1480. Formerly a two-story building that was extended in the early twentieth century has a lower story of substantial close-set studding: the upper is of more widely spaced thin vertical timbers. As the name suggests Sheep Street, which leads down from the Town Hall to Waterside and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was from early times and until the late 19th century, the area where sheep, brought from the neighbouring Cotswold Hills to be bought and sold. Today it is the restaurant centre of the town.

The Shrieves House is one of the oldest still lived in houses in the town and William Shakespeare is said to have based his character of Sir John Falstaff on one of the residents, his godson&#x27;s uncle. Oliver Cromwell is thought to have stayed here in 1651. He wrote a letter from the town to Lord Wharton on 27 August 1651, before the Battle of Worcester. Behind The Shrieves House is a museum called &quot;Tudor World&quot; with recreations of 16th-century life in theatrical settings. Just off Sheep Street is Shrieves Walk, a very quaint walkway with several small independent stores. A Wetherspoons is also on Sheep Street.

===Waterside and Southern Lane===
This area of Stratford, which runs from the foot of Bridge Street to Holy Trinity Church and leads directly off Sheep Street and Chapel Lane, runs alongside the River Avon and offers access to the Waterside Theatre and all areas of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The Bancroft Gardens and river area is a very popular place for people watching, enjoying picnics and river activities. Bancroft Gardens also features the Gower Monument, a bronze statue of William Shakespeare flanked by four of his most popular character. In the summer the River Avon is busy with rowing boats, motor boats and river cruises. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal is busy with colourful narrowboats passing through or mooring up in the canal basin. There are often jugglers, fire-eaters and magicians entertaining the public on the lawns.

On the edge of the gardens is a water fountain, known as the Swan Fountain. It was unveiled in 1996 by Queen Elizabeth II to recognise that Stratford has been a market town since 1196. It is from here the Stratford Town Walk meet every day (even Christmas Day), to offer a guided walking tour of the town. The tour passes the Shakespeare houses, Royal Shakespeare Theatre&#x27;s, 15th-century timber-framed buildings, William Shakespeare&#x27;s school and visits Holy Trinity Church where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried. Waterside is also the location of The Dirty Duck pub which is frequented by actors from the nearby RSC theatres, theatre critics and theatregoers.

==Other attractions==

Harvard House is located at 26 High Street. Other attractions include the Stratford Butterfly Farm, which is on the eastern side of the river Avon and the Bancroft Gardens and Stratford Armouries located three miles () from the centre of Stratford on Gospel Oak Lane. Each year on 12 October, unless this is a Sunday, in which case 11 October, Stratford hosts one of the largest mop fairs in the country. Ten days later, the smaller Runaway fair is held.

The Guild Chapel, at the intersection of Church Street and Chapel Lane, had a long association with William Shakespeare&#x27;s family. The chapel offers a view of fine paintings from the early 1500s which had been covered up during the Reformation to save them from destruction. Centuries later, they were uncovered and are now visible.

==Transport==
===Road===
Stratford is from the United Kingdom&#x27;s second largest city, Birmingham, and is easily accessible from junction 15 of the M40 motorway. The A46 road links Stratford with the M40, Warwick and Coventry to the north-east, and Evesham and Ashchurch to the south-west, where it joins the M5 motorway.

===Buses===
Bus services are provided predominantly by Stagecoach in Warwickshire (formerly Midland Red South) and Diamond West Midlands. Routes connect the town with local destinations including Banbury, Coventry, Evesham, Leamington and Redditch.

===Railway===

Stratford now has two railway stations: is the main town centre station and lies on the town&#x27;s north-western outskirts, with park and ride facilities.

Both stations are served by the following train operating companies:
* West Midlands Trains provides services to , Birmingham (Snow Hill and Moor Street), and .
* Chiltern Railways operates a route to and ; some direct trains travel daily to/from London Marylebone.

Stratford station is now the southern terminus of two branch lines from Birmingham and ; up to 1976, the line formerly continued south of the town to join the Cotswold Line at , until this link was closed and dismantled. 
There has been a campaign in recent years to restore the Honeybourne link, which would entail rebuilding of track.

Stratford-upon-Avon&#x27;s railway service has been criticised by the Royal Shakespeare Company and others for its limited direct services to London, which consists of a handful of daily direct trains, with connections available from Leamington Spa. In 2018, the RSC described the services to the station as &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; for an international tourist destination.

Until 1952, the town was also served by Stratford Old Town railway station of the former Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway.

===Water===

Several companies offer sightseeing cruises along the river Avon and the canal, some using old river barges that have been converted for this use. The town is the terminus of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal where it meets the river Avon.

The manually-powered Stratford-upon-Avon chain ferry was opened in 1937 and links Waterside, roughly halfway between the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and Holy Trinity Church, with the water meadows on the opposite side of the river. It was the last of its kind to be built in Britain.

===Cycling===
The town has numerous cycle paths, such as the Stratford greenway, a traffic free cycle path, which used to be part of the rail network until the early 1960s; it is now part of the Sustrans National Cycle Network (routes National Cycle Route 5 and National Cycle Route 41). Starting from town, it heads along the river Avon and racecourse towards Welford-on-Avon and Long Marston with a cycle hire and cafÃ© available at the start of the Greenway at Seven Meadows Road.

===Air===
Birmingham Airport is to the north-west, with scheduled flights to many national and international destinations.

==Education==

Stratford is also home to several institutions set up for the study of Shakespeare, including the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which holds books and documents related to the playwright, and the Shakespeare Institute. William Shakespeare is believed to have studied at King Edward VI School. Previously an all-boys school, from September 2013 up to 25% of the year 12 intake can be girls. It is one of the few remaining grammar schools in England, selecting its pupils exclusively using the 11-plus examination. There is also an all-girls grammar school, Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls, colloquially known as &#x27;Shottery School&#x27; after its location in the village of Shottery, a short distance from the town centre.

Finally, there is a non-selective secondary school, Stratford-upon-Avon School, formerly known as the Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern School, which was demolished to make way for the new high school. There are no independent secondary schools in the town, but there are many primary schools, including St. Gregory&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Stratford-upon-Avon Primary School (often known locally as &quot;Broad Street&quot; due to its location), Bishopton Primary School, Willows Church of England Primary School and Thomas Jolyffe Primary School both state and independent, as well as Stratford-upon-Avon College.

<text>Cedrus, with the common English name cedar, is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae (subfamily Abietoideae). They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, occurring at altitudes of in the Himalayas and in the Mediterranean.

==Description==
&quot;Cedrus&quot; trees can grow up to 30â40Â m (occasionally 60Â m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches. The shoots are dimorphic and are made up of long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves. The leaves are evergreen and needle-like, 8â60Â mm long, arranged in an open spiral phyllotaxis on long shoots, and in dense spiral clusters of 15â45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation. The seed cones are barrel-shaped, 6â12Â cm long and 3â8Â cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in &quot;Abies&quot;, disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. The seeds are 10â15Â mm long, with a 20â30Â mm wing; as in &quot;Abies&quot;, the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation. Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing at the same time a year later. The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3â8Â cm long, produced in late summer, and shed pollen in autumn.

==Classification==
Cedars share a very similar cone structure with the firs (&quot;Abies&quot;) and were traditionally thought to be most closely related to them, but molecular evidence supports a basal position in the family.

===Taxonomy===

The five taxa of &quot;Cedrus&quot; are assigned according to taxonomic opinion to between one and four species: The oldest known fossil of &quot;Cedrus&quot; is &quot;Cedrus penzhinaensis&quot; known from fossil wood found in Early Cretaceous (Albian) sediments of Kamchatka, Russia.

==Ecology==
Cedars are adapted to mountainous climates; in the Mediterranean, they receive winter precipitation, mainly as snow, and summer drought, while in the western Himalaya, they receive primarily summer monsoon rainfall and occasional winter snowfall. While no members of &quot;Cedrus&quot; are native to the Americas, members of &quot;Juniperus&quot; and Cupressaceae are native and are called by the common name of &quot;cedar&quot;.

Cedars are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including pine processionary and turnip moth (recorded on deodar cedar).

==Use==

Cedars are very popular ornamental trees, and are often cultivated in temperate climates where winter temperatures do not fall below circa â25Â Â°C. The Turkish cedar is slightly hardier, to â30Â Â°C or just below. Extensive mortality of planted specimens can occur in severe winters when temperatures fall lower. Locales with successful longaeval cultivation include the Mediterranean region, Western Europe north to the British Isles, southern Australia and New Zealand, and southern and western North America.

Cedar wood and cedarwood oil are natural repellents to moths, hence cedar is a popular lining for cedar chests and closets in which woolens are stored. This specific use of cedar is mentioned in &quot;The Iliad&quot;, Book 24, referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam went to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. The ancients made cedarwood oil from Lebanon cedar, a true cedar of the genus &quot;Cedrus&quot;, However, the species used for modern cedar chests and closets in North America is &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;, and cedarwood oil is now typically derived from various junipers and cypresses (of the family &quot;Cupressaceae&quot;). Cedar is also commonly used to make shoe trees because it can absorb moisture and deodorize.

Many species of cedar are suitable for training as bonsai. They work well for many styles, including formal and informal upright, slanting, and cascading.

==Nomenclature==
Some authorities consider &quot;Cedrus&quot; the only &quot;true cedars&quot; and discourage use of the name for other genera without an additional qualifier, such as &quot;white-cedar&quot;. Nevertheless, the name &quot;cedar&quot; has been applied (since about 1700) to other trees, such as the North American &quot;Thuja plicata&quot;, commonly called &quot;western red cedar&quot;, and &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;, commonly called &quot;red cedar&quot; or &quot;eastern red cedar&quot;. In some cases, the botanical name alludes to this usage, such as the genus &quot;Calocedrus&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful cedar&quot; (also known as &quot;incense cedar&quot;). Several species of genera &quot;Calocedrus&quot;, &quot;Thuja&quot;, and &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; in the Pacific Northwest having similarly aromatic wood are referred to as &quot;false cedars&quot; . In Australia &quot;Toona ciliata&quot; has long been known as red cedar, in furniture and as the tree, even though it belongs to the Meliaceae or Mahogany family.

===Etymology===
Both the Latin word &quot;cedrus&quot; and the generic name &quot;cedrus&quot; are derived from Greek ÎºÎ­Î´ÏÎ¿Ï &quot;kÃ©dros&quot;. Ancient Greek and Latin used the same word, &quot;kÃ©dros&quot; and &quot;cedrus&quot;, respectively, for different species of plants now classified in the genera &quot;Cedrus&quot; and &quot;Juniperus&quot; (juniper). Species of both genera are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word &quot;kÃ©dros&quot; does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the Middle East, it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus &quot;Cedrus&quot; because of the similarity of their aromatic woods. The name was similarly applied to citron and the word citrus is derived from the same root. However, as a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its biblical sense of &quot;Cedrus&quot; by the time of its first recorded usage in ADÂ 1000.

<text>Year 260 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asina and Duilius (or, less frequently, year 494 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 260 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Sicily ====
* The Roman advance continues westward from Agrigentum with their forces relieving the besieged cities of Segesta and Macella. These cities have sided with the Roman cause, and have come under Carthaginian attack for doing so.
* Hannibal Gisco returns to fight in Sicily as the admiral in charge of the Carthaginian fleet in the Strait of Messina. With the Romans about to launch their first ever navy, Carthage is determined that this innovation be thwarted. Gisco defeats part of the Roman fleet and captures the Roman consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina in an encounter near Lipari; the consul&#x27;s nickname Asina (which means &quot;donkey&quot;) is earned in this encounter. However, this Carthaginian victory is of limited practical value as the bulk of the Roman fleet continues to manoeuvre in the surrounding waters.
* Confident in Carthage&#x27;s superiority at sea, Hannibal Gisco deploys his ships for the Battle of Mylae in the traditional long line arrangement. Although inexperienced in sea battles, the Romans, led by consul Gaius Duilius Nepos, heavily defeat the Carthaginian fleet, mainly due to the innovative use of land tactics in naval warfare (including the use of the grappling irons and the corvus boarding bridge).
* Having lost the confidence of his peers, Hannibal Gisco is subsequently executed for incompetence shortly afterwards, together with other defeated Punic generals.
* In the north of Sicily, the Romans, with their northern sea flank secured by their naval victory in the Battle of Mylae, advance toward Thermae. They are defeated there by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar.

==== Egypt ====
* Callimachus of Cyrene, learned poet and grammarian, becomes chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria.

==== China ====
* Battle of Changping between the state of Qin and state of Zhao:
:* Frustrated with the stalemate and encouraged by Qin spies, King Xiaocheng of Zhao replaces general Lian Po with the less cautious Zhao Kuo. Hearing of this, King Zhaoxiang of Qin secretly sends the famous general Bai Qi to take control of the Qin army.
:* The Qin army under Bai Qi destroys the army of Zhao, establishing Qin&#x27;s military superiority over all other Chinese states during the Warring States period. The battle takes place near modern-day Gaoping in Shanxi and hundreds of thousands of soldiers from Zhao are executed after the battle.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Zheng, who will later become king of the State of Qin, and then later the First Emperor of China (d. 210 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Hannibal Gisco, Carthaginian military commander in charge of both land armies and naval fleets (b. c. 300 BC)
* Orontes III, king of Armenia and Sophene (modern-day Turkey)
* Timocharis of Alexandria, Greek astronomer and philosopher
* Zhao Kuo, Chinese general of the State of Zhao

<text>Business administration is the administration of a commercial enterprise. It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising the business operations of an organization.

== Overview ==
The administration of a business includes the performance or management of business operations and decision-making, as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities towards common goals. In general, &quot;administration&quot; refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services.

Administration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks, usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet an organization&#x27;s goals. Henri Fayol (1841â1925) described these &quot;functions&quot; of the administrator as &quot;the five elements of administration&quot;. According to Fayol, the five functions of management are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Without proper business management, a firm cannot utilize its resources properly so, it is the most important term in running a business firm.
=== Key skills for Business Management ===
Strategic thinking, leadership, problem-solving, communication, and the ability to work effectively with a diverse range of people and organizations are among the key skills and competencies required of effective managers. Managers must also be able to balance the needs and interests of various stakeholders, such as employees, customers, shareholders, and the larger community. Management is a critical aspect of any successful organization, and it requires a wide range of skills, knowledge, and expertise. Whether managing a small team or a large corporation, effective management is essential to achieving success and driving growth. Another critical aspect is effectively managing and motivating employees. Managers must be able to foster a positive and productive work environment, as well as recognize and reward employees who contribute to the overall success of the organization. This can include providing opportunities for professional development and growth, as well as establishing clear communication channels and ensuring that everyone understands their role and responsibilities.

== Academic degrees ==

=== Bachelor of Business Administration ===
The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA, B.B.A., BSBA, B.S.B.A., BS, B.S., or B.Sc.), Bachelor of Science in Business, Business Administration, Business Management (BS), or Bachelor of Commerce (Bcom. or BComm) is a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce and business administration. The duration of the degree is four years in the United States and three years in Europe. The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing for specialization in a particular area. The degree also develops the student&#x27;s practical, managerial and communication skills, and business decision-making capability to succeed in the competitive world. Many programs incorporate training and practical experience, in the form of case projects, presentations, internships, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from industry.

=== Master of Business Administration ===
The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) is a master&#x27;s degree in business administration with a significant focus on management. The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early-20th century, when the nation industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses.

=== Master of Management ===
The Master of Management (MiM) or Master of Science in Management (MSM) is a postgraduate degree with a focus in business management.

In terms of content, it is similar to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree as it contains identical management courses but is open to prospective postgraduate candidates at any level in their career unlike MBA programs that have longer course credit requirements and only accept mid-career professionals.

=== Doctor of Business Administration ===
The Doctor of Business Administration (DBA or DrBA) is a research doctorate awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of business administration. The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration and is equivalent to the Ph.D. in Business Administration.

=== PhD in Management ===
The PhD in Management is the highest academic degree awarded in the study of business management. The degree is intended for those seeking academic research- and teaching-careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.

=== Doctor of Management ===
A newer form of a management doctorate is the Doctor of Management (D.M., D.Mgt., DBA, or DMan). It is a doctoral degree conferred upon an individual who is trained through advanced study and research in the applied science and professional practice of management. This doctorate has elements of both research and practice relative to social and managerial concerns within society and organizations.

<text>An Inspector Calls is a modern morality play and drawing room play written by English dramatist J. B. Priestley, first performed in the Soviet Union in 1945 and at the New Theatre in London the following year. It is one of Priestley&#x27;s best-known works for the stage and is considered to be one of the classics of mid-20th century English theatre. The play&#x27;s success and reputation were boosted by a successful revival by English director Stephen Daldry for the National Theatre in 1992 and a tour of the UK in 2011â2012.

The play is a three-act drama which takes place on a single night on 5 April 1912. The play focuses on the prosperous upper-middle-class Birling family, who live in a comfortable home in the fictional town of Brumley, &quot;an industrial city in the north Midlands.&quot; The family is visited by a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who questions the family about the suicide of a working-class woman in her mid-twenties. Long considered part of the repertory of classic drawing-room theatre, the play has also been hailed as a scathing criticism of the hypocrisies of Victorian and Edwardian English society and as an expression of Priestley&#x27;s socialist political principles. The play is notable amongst students as many British schools study it as a prescribed text for the GCSE English Literature course.

==Synopsis==
The play is set in 1912, at the Birlings&#x27; large home in the industrial town of Brumley. Arthur Birling, a wealthy factory owner, magistrate and local politician, celebrates his daughter Sheila&#x27;s engagement to Gerald Croft, son of a rival magnate. Also present are Birling&#x27;s wife Sybil and their son Eric (whose drinking problem the family discreetly ignores). After dinner, Sheila and Sybil leave the dining room to go into the drawing room, while Birling lectures the young men on the importance of self-reliance and looking after one&#x27;s own, and talks of the bright future that awaits them (which, he believes, will include a knighthood for himself on the next honours list).

The evening is interrupted when the maid Edna announces the arrival of a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who explains that earlier that day he had seen the dead body of a young woman named Eva Smith, who had died by drinking disinfectant. He has been given the &quot;duty&quot; of investigating her death and the Birlings&#x27; involvement in it. He has seen her diary, which mentions members of the Birling family. 

Goole produces a photograph of Smith and shows it to Birling, who acknowledges that she worked in one of his factories. He admits to having dismissed her for leading strike action, with most of the female workers demanding equal pay to males. Despite admitting that he left Smith without a job, Birling denies any responsibility for her death.

Sheila (having been sent by her mother to bring Birling, Eric and Gerald to the drawing room) is shown a photograph of Smith. She explains that once, when she was out shopping with her mother, Sheila saw a dress she liked and tried it on, even though her mother and an assistant thought it was not right for her. Smith, now employed at this shop, also helped with the trying-on. Sheila realised that the dress did not suit her; Smith held the dress against herself, and Sheila could see that it looked much better on her. Seeing Smith smiling at the other assistant, Sheila took umbrage and angrily ordered the manager of the department store to fire her. Sheila&#x27;s real motivation, which she ashamedly confesses, was the jealousy that she felt towards Smith, perceiving her as prettier than herself. Eric leaves the dining room.

Sybil enters the dining room. The Inspector mentions that Smith subsequently used the name Daisy Renton. Gerald is noticeably startled and admits to having met a woman of that name in the Palace Bar, where Smith had resorted to prostitution to sustain herself. Seeing that Smith was hungry and struggling to cope financially, and was out of place there, Gerald gave her money and arranged for her to move temporarily into a vacant flat belonging to one of his friends. Gerald reveals that he began a relationship with Smith over the summer, but parted with her after a few months. Sheila, disheartened, returns her engagement ring to Gerald, who leaves the house, saying he will return.

The Inspector turns his attention to Sybil, a patron of a charity that helps women in difficult situations, which Smith (by then pregnant and destitute) had turned to for help, using the name &quot;Mrs. Birling&quot;. Sybil, seeing this as a deliberate mockery of herself, convinced the committee to deny her a grant. She argued that Smith had been irresponsible and suggested that she find the father and get him to face his responsibilities; Smith said that she had refused to accept any more money from the father once she knew it had been stolen. Despite vigorous cross-examination from the Inspector, Sybil denies any wrongdoing. Goole plays his final card, forcing Sybil to lay the blame on the &quot;drunken young man&quot; who had got Smith pregnant. It slowly dawns on the rest of the family, except Sybil, that Eric is the young man in question, and &quot;Mrs. Birling&quot; was the first name that had come to Smith&#x27;s mind because he had fathered her child.

Eric enters, and after brief questioning from Goole, breaks down and admits responsibility for the pregnancy: he had forced himself on Smith after a drinking spree at the Palace Bar. After finding out that Smith was pregnant, Eric stole Â£50 (Â£4,800 in 2024) from his father&#x27;s business to support her and their child, but she refused the stolen money and cut contact with Eric. Birling and Sybil are outraged by Eric&#x27;s behaviour, and the evening dissolves into angry recriminations. The Inspector reminds the family that actions have consequences and that all people are intertwined in one society, stating: &quot;if men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish.&quot; He leaves.

Birling&#x27;s greatest worry is the scandal that will arise from Eric&#x27;s theft of his firm&#x27;s money, which will come out at the inquest. The family begins to question if &quot;Goole&quot; was a real police inspector. Gerald returns and reveals that he had met a police sergeant he knew, who did not know of any police inspector named Goole. To confirm this, Birling makes a phone call to his friend, the chief constable, who confirms that there is no Inspector Goole on the force. Gerald points out that they could not be sure that Goole had shown the same photograph to the different members of the family; there could have been several young women, and they did not know that any of them had died. Gerald phones the infirmary, and they confirm that no one has died there that day, and they have not had a suicide in months. The family concludes that the Inspector was a fraud and that they have been the victims of a hoax. 

Gerald and the elder Birlings celebrate in relief, but Eric and Sheila continue to rue their own and the others&#x27; actions. The phone rings: it is the police, who tell Birling that a young woman has just died on her way to the infirmary in a suspected suicide, and that a policeman is on his way to question the family. The Inspector&#x27;s identity is left unexplained, but it is clear that the family&#x27;s confessions over the course of the evening have all been true, and that public disgrace will soon befall them.

== Characters ==
===Eva Smith/Daisy Renton===
The deceased young woman who represents the working class in a capitalist society. She is described as young and pretty, with dark eyes. Her parents were dead, and she had no one to turn to when she was unable to support herself through honest employment.

=== Inspector Goole ===
Apparently a police inspector, sent to investigate a suicide. He seems to be familiar with every detail of the case already, interrogating the family solely to expose their guilt rather than to discover unknown information. Many critics and audiences have interpreted Goole&#x27;s role as that of an &quot;avenging angel&quot; because of his supernatural omniscience and his final warning, and because of his name, which is a homophone of the word &quot;&quot;. It is suggested in the final scene that a real investigation will follow Goole&#x27;s, and his purpose has been to warn the family in advance and encourage them to accept responsibility for their wrongdoing. The inspector is the drive for Priestley&#x27;s socialist views within the play.

===Arthur Birling ===
Arthur Birling is &quot;a heavy-looking, rather man in his middle fifties&quot;. He represents the ruling capitalist class, repeatedly describing himself with pride as a &quot;hard-headed businessman&quot;, and is arguably the main subject of Priestley&#x27;s social critique. Dominant, arrogant, self-centred, and morally blind, he shows his stubbornness by refusing to take any responsibility for Eva&#x27;s death. He remains unaffected by the suicide, and his concerns appear to be the avoidance of public scandal, the recovery of the money Eric stole from the company, and the resumption of Sheila and Gerald&#x27;s engagement, which promises to effect a CroftâBirling merger (which looks likely to bring about a monopoly). Arthur Birling is used by Priestley as a dramatic vehicle to criticise capitalism, the arrogance of the wealthy middle class, and the ignorance of the older generation.

=== Sybil Birling ===
Sybil Birling, &quot;a rather cold woman&quot; of about fifty, is Arthur&#x27;s wife, from a higher social class than his. As the leader of a charitable organisation, she assumes a social and moral superiority over Inspector Goole, whose questioning style she frequently describes as &quot;impertinent&quot; and &quot;offensive&quot;. Like her husband, she refuses to accept responsibility for the death of Eva Smith and is more concerned with maintaining the family&#x27;s reputation, even going so far as to lie and deny that she recognises Smith&#x27;s picture. She derides women like Eva as immoral, dishonest, and greedy.

=== Sheila Birling ===
Sheila Birling is the daughter of Arthur and Sybil Birling, and the older sister of Eric. Sheila begins as a naive and self-centred young woman, but becomes the most sympathetic member of the group over the course of the play, revealing insecurity about her appearance, showing remorse for her part in Eva&#x27;s downfall, and encouraging her family to do the same. By the play&#x27;s end her social conscience has been awakened and she has a new awareness of her responsibilities to others. She represents the younger generation&#x27;s break from the selfish behaviour and capitalist views of its elders. Sheila shows her naivety and lack of maturity in the way she reacts to her father. She is quick to apologise, it is clear that she is keen to behave well. She also refers to her father as &#x27;Daddy&#x27;, a childish term. As the play progresses, Sheila&#x27;s character develops and she begins to stand up for herself.

=== Eric Birling ===
Eric Birling is the son of Arthur and Sybil Birling and the younger brother of Sheila. Eric is presented as a &quot;&quot; character with a drinking habit, who forced himself on Eva and made her pregnant. He is distanced from the rest of the family and feels he cannot talk to them about his problems. With his sister, he repents of, and accepts responsibility for, the way he treated Eva.

=== Gerald Croft ===
The son of Sir George and Lady Croft of Crofts Limited, a friendly competitor of Birling and Company, and the fiancÃ© of Sheila. The revelation of Gerald&#x27;s affair with Eva puts an end to the engagement, though Sheila commends him for his truthfulness and for his initial compassion towards Smith.

=== Edna ===
Edna is the Birlings&#x27; maid.

Role
Edna is the maid for the Birling family. 
She introduces the Inspector into the dining room in Act 1. 
She changes the lighting in the room when the Inspector arrives. 

Significance
Edna&#x27;s role in the play highlights the mistreatment of the working class. 
Her line &quot;an inspector&#x27;s called&quot; is close to the title of the play. 
Edna&#x27;s actions give a voice to the working class. 
Edna&#x27;s actions also provide insight into the life of Eva Smith, who comes from a similar background.

==Reception and interpretation==
Highly successful after its first and subsequent London productions, the play is now considered one of Priestley&#x27;s greatest works, and it has been the subject of a variety of critical interpretations.

After the new wave of social realist theatre in the 1950s and 1960s, the play fell out of fashion and was dismissed as an example of outdated bourgeois &quot;drawing room&quot; dramas, but it became a staple of regional repertory theatre. Following several successful revivals (including Stephen Daldry&#x27;s 1992 production for the National Theatre), the play was &quot;rediscovered&quot; and hailed as a damning social criticism of capitalism and middle-class hypocrisy in the manner of the social realist dramas of Shaw and Ibsen. It has been read as a parable about the destruction of Victorian social values and the disintegration of pre-World War I English society, and Goole&#x27;s final speech has been interpreted variously as a quasi-Christian vision of hell and judgement and as a socialist manifesto.

The struggle between the embattled patriarch Arthur Birling and Inspector Goole has been interpreted by many critics as a symbolic confrontation between capitalism and socialism, and it arguably demonstrates Priestley&#x27;s socialist political criticism of the perceived selfishness and moral hypocrisy of middle-class capitalist society in 1950s Britain. While no one member of the Birling family is solely responsible for Eva&#x27;s death, together they function as a hermetic class system that exploits neglected, vulnerable women, with each example of exploitation leading collectively to Eva&#x27;s social exclusion, despair and suicide. The play also arguably acts as a critique of Victorian-era notions of middle-class philanthropy towards the poor, which is based on the presumption of the charity-givers&#x27; social superiority and on a severe moral judgement of the &quot;deserving poor&quot;. The romantic idea of gentlemanly chivalry towards &quot;fallen women&quot; is also debunked as being based on male lust and sexual exploitation of the weak by the powerful. In Goole&#x27;s final speech, Eva Smith is called a representation of millions of vulnerable working-class people, and the speech can be read as a call to action to English society to take more responsibility for working-class people, prefiguring the development of the post-World War II welfare state.

==Productions==
&quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; was first performed in 1945 in two Russian theatres (Moscow&#x27;s Kamerny Theatre and Leningrad&#x27;s Comedy Theatre), as a suitable British venue could not be found. Priestley had written the play in a single week and all Britain&#x27;s theatres had already been booked for the season. The play had its first British production in 1946 at the New Theatre in London with Ralph Richardson as Inspector Goole, Harry Andrews as Gerald Croft, Margaret Leighton as Sheila Birling, Julien Mitchell as Arthur Birling, Marian Spencer as Sybil Birling and Alec Guinness as Eric Birling.

The first Broadway production opened at the Booth Theatre on 21 October 1947 and ran for 95 performances until 10 January 1948. The production was staged by Cedric Hardwicke and produced by Courtney Burr and Lassor H. Grosberg. The cast included Melville Cooper as Arthur Birling, John Buckmaster as Gerald Croft, Rene Ray as Sheila Birling, Doris Lloyd as Sybil Birling, Patricia Marmont as Edna, John Merivale as Eric Birling and Thomas Mitchell as Inspector Goole.

The play was produced and performed at the Ferdowsi Theatre in Iran in the late 1940s, based on the translation by Bozorg Alavi. It was staged in the first season of the Edinburgh Gateway Company in 1953.

In 1986 Richard Wilson directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, with Geraldine Alexander as Sheila Birling, Hugh Grant as Eric Birling and Graeme Garden as Inspector Goole.

Tom Baker played Inspector Goole in a 1987 production directed by Peter Dews and designed by Daphne Dare that opened at Theatr Clwyd on 14 April then transferred to London&#x27;s Westminster Theatre on 13 May 1987. The cast included Pauline Jameson as Sybil Birling, Peter Baldwin as Arthur Birling, Charlotte Attenborough as Sheila Birling, Simon Shepherd as Gerald Croft and Adam Godley as Eric Birling.

A revival of the play by British director Stephen Daldry (produced by PW Productions) opened at the National Theatre&#x27;s Lyttelton Theatre in September 1992. Daldry&#x27;s concept was to reference two eras: the 1945 post-war era, when the play was written, and the ostensible historical setting for the work in pre-war 1912; this emphasised the way the character Goole was observing, and deploring, the Birling family&#x27;s behaviour from Priestley&#x27;s own cultural viewpoint. It won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play, and was widely praised for making the work involving and politically relevant for a modern audience. The production is often credited with single-handedly rediscovering Priestley&#x27;s works and &quot;rescuing&quot; him from the reputation of being obsolete and class-bound, although the production had some detractors, including Sheridan Morley, who regarded it as a gimmicky travesty of the author&#x27;s patent intentions. The success of the production since 1992 has led to a critical reappraisal of Priestley as a politically engaged playwright who offered a sustained critique of the hypocrisy of English society. A Broadway transfer of the production starring Philip Bosco opened at the Royale Theatre (now the Bernard Jacobs Theatre) on 27 April 1994 and played 454 performances. 

 The Stephen Daldry production went on a tour of the UK in 2011 and continued to tour into 2020, with Tom Mannion and Liam Brennan among the actors playing Inspector Goole. The production returned to the Playhouse in London&#x27;s West End in November 2016, with Liam Brennan in the name part. Brennan once again starred as Inspector Goole in a 2022 tour of the UK billed as the production&#x27;s Thirtieth Anniversary Tour.

Another production opened on 25 October 1995 at the Garrick Theatre and ran for six years until its transfer to the Playhouse Theatre in 2001. In 2009 it reopened at the Novello Theatre for a year-long run, followed by another transfer to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in December 2009, running for only four months.

<doc id="58890" wikidata="Q145205" url="?curid=58890" title="Resin">
<text>A resin is a solid or highly viscous liquid that can be converted into a polymer. Resins may be biological or synthetic in origin, but are typically harvested from plants. Resins are mixtures of organic compounds, predominantly terpenes. Well-known resins include amber, hashish, frankincense, myrrh and the animal-derived resin, shellac. Resins are commonly used in varnishes, adhesives, food additives, incenses and perfumes.

Resins protect plants from insects and pathogens, and are secreted in response to injury. Resins confound a wide range of herbivores, insects, and pathogens, while the volatile phenolic compounds may attract benefactors such as predators of insects that attack the plant.

== Composition ==
Most plant resins are composed of terpenes. Specific components are alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, delta-3 carene, and sabinene, the monocyclic terpenes limonene and terpinolene, and smaller amounts of the tricyclic sesquiterpenes, longifolene, caryophyllene, and delta-cadinene. Some resins also contain a high proportion of resin acids. Rosins on the other hand are less volatile and consist of diterpenes among other compounds.

=== Examples ===
Examples of plant resins include amber, Balm of Gilead, balsam, Canada balsam, copal from trees of &quot;Protium copal&quot; and &quot;Hymenaea courbaril&quot;, dammar gum from trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae, dragon&#x27;s blood from the dragon trees (&quot;Dracaena&quot; species), elemi, frankincense from &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;, galbanum from &quot;Ferula gummosa&quot;, gum guaiacum from the lignum vitae trees of the genus &quot;Guaiacum&quot;, kauri gum from trees of &quot;Agathis australis&quot;, hashish (Cannabis resin) from &quot;Cannabis indica&quot;, labdanum from mediterranean species of &quot;Cistus&quot;, mastic (plant resin) from the mastic tree &quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot;, myrrh from shrubs of &quot;Commiphora&quot;, sandarac resin from &quot;Tetraclinis articulata&quot;, the national tree of Malta, styrax (a Benzoin resin from various &quot;Styrax&quot; species) and spinifex resin from Australian grasses.

Amber is fossil resin (also called resinite) from coniferous and other tree species. Copal, kauri gum, dammar and other resins may also be found as subfossil deposits. Subfossil copal can be distinguished from genuine fossil amber because it becomes tacky when a drop of a solvent such as acetone or chloroform is placed on it.
African copal and the kauri gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition.

=== Rosin ===

Rosin is a solidified resin from which the volatile terpenes have been removed by distillation. Typical rosin is a transparent or translucent mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown colour, non-odorous or having only a slight turpentine odour and taste. Rosin is insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether, and hot fatty oils. Rosin softens and melts when heated and burns with a bright but smoky flame.

Rosin consists of a complex mixture of different substances including organic acids named the resin acids. Related to the terpenes, resin acid is oxidized terpenes. Resin acids dissolve in alkalis to form resin soaps, from which the resin acids are regenerated upon treatment with acids. Examples of resin acids are abietic acid (sylvic acid), C20H30O2, plicatic acid contained in cedar, and pimaric acid, C20H30O2, a constituent of galipot resin. Abietic acid can also be extracted from rosin by means of hot alcohol. 

Rosin is obtained from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers. Plant resins are generally produced as stem secretions, but in some Central and South American species of &quot;Dalechampia&quot; and &quot;Clusia&quot; they are produced as pollination rewards, and used by some stingless bee species in nest construction. Propolis, consisting largely of resins collected from plants such as poplars and conifers, is used by honey bees to seal small gaps in their hives, while larger gaps are filled with beeswax.

===Petroleum- and insect-derived resins===
Shellac is an example of an insect-derived resin.

Asphaltite and Utah resin are petroleum bitumens.

==History and etymology==

Human use of plant resins has a very long history that was documented in ancient Greece by Theophrastus, in ancient Rome by Pliny the Elder, and especially in the resins known as frankincense and myrrh, prized in ancient Egypt. These were highly prized substances, and required as incense in some religious rites.

The word &quot;resin&quot; comes from French &quot;resine&quot;, from Latin &quot;resina&quot; &quot;resin&quot;, which either derives from or is a cognate of the Greek &quot;rhÄtÃ­nÄ&quot; &quot;resin of the pine&quot;, of unknown earlier origin, though probably non-Indo-European.

The word &quot;resin&quot; has been applied in the modern world to nearly any component of a liquid that will set into a hard lacquer or enamel-like finish. An example is nail polish. Certain &quot;casting resins&quot; and synthetic resins (such as epoxy resin) have also been given the name &quot;resin&quot;.

Some naturally-derived resins, when soft, are known as &#x27;oleoresins&#x27;, and when containing benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called balsams. Oleoresins are naturally-occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., balsams of Peru and tolu, elemi, styrax, and certain turpentines.

===Non-resinous exudates===
Other liquid compounds found inside plants or exuded by plants, such as sap, latex, or mucilage, are sometimes confused with resin but are not the same. Saps, in particular, serve a nutritive function that resins do not.

==Uses==
===Plant resins===
Plant resins are valued for the production of varnishes, adhesives, and food glazing agents. They are also prized as raw materials for the synthesis of other organic compounds and provide constituents of incense and perfume. The oldest known use of plant resin comes from the late Middle Stone Age in Southern Africa where it was used as an adhesive for hafting stone tools.


The hard transparent resins, such as the copals, dammars, mastic, and sandarac, are principally used for varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and scammony) are more used for therapeutic purposes, food and incense. The resin of the Aleppo Pine is used to flavour retsina, a Greek resinated wine.

===Animal resins===
While animal resins are not as common as either plant or synthetic resins some animal resins like lac (obtained from &quot;Kerria lacca&quot;) are used for applications like sealing wax in India, and lacquerware in Sri Lanka.

===Synthetic resins===

Many materials are produced via the conversion of synthetic resins to solids. Important examples are bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, which is a resin converted to epoxy glue upon the addition of a hardener. Silicones are often prepared from silicone resins via room temperature vulcanization. Alkyd resins are used in paints and varnishes and harden or cure by exposure to oxygen in the air.

<text>Johannesburg ( , , ; Zulu and Xhosa: eGoli ) (colloquially known as Jozi, Joburg, Jo&#x27;burg or &quot;The City of Gold&quot;) is the most populous city in South Africa with 4,803,262 people in the City of Johannesburg alone.

It is a conurbation engulfing many formerly separate cities and towns and is classified as a megacity. It is one of the 100 largest urban areas in the world. It is the provincial capital of Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa. Johannesburg is the seat of the Constitutional Court, the highest court in South Africa. Many major South African companies and banks have their head offices in Johannesburg. The city is located within the mineral-rich Witwatersrand hills, the epicentre of the international-scale mineral and gold trade.

Johannesburg was established in 1886, following the discovery of gold, on what had been a farm. Due to the extremely large gold deposits found along the Witwatersrand, within ten years, the population had grown to over 100,000 inhabitants. A separate city from the late 1970s until 1994, Soweto is now part of the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area. An acronym for &quot;South-Western Townships&quot;, Soweto was organised initially as a collection of nondescript settlements on the outskirts of the city, populated mostly by African labourers working in the gold mining industry.

Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been explicitly separated as a residential area for blacks onlyâno whites allowedâwho were not permitted to live in other &quot;white-designated&quot; areas of Johannesburg. Another region, Lenasia, is predominantly populated by English-speaking Indo-South Africans (people of Indian and South Asian descent). These areas were, in previous decades, designated as non-white areas, in accordance with apartheid policies of the time.

Johannesburg was one of the host cities of the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup including the final.

The metropolis is an alpha global city, as listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. In 2019, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 5,635,127, making it the most populous city in South Africa. In the same year, the population of metro Johannesburg&#x27;s urban agglomeration was put at 8 million. Land area of the municipal city () is large in comparison with those of other major cities, resulting in a moderate population density of .

== Etymology ==
Controversy surrounds the origin of the name. There were quite a number of people with the name &quot;Johannes&quot; who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the Volksraad and was the Republic&#x27;s chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as Paul Kruger), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883 to 1900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.

Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him, and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated Rissik Street Post Office is located. The City Hall is also located on Rissik Street.

==History==

The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by San hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago. Stone-walled ruins of SothoâTswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated.

By the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various SothoâTswana communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from the Bechuanaland Protectorate (what is now Botswana) in the west, to present day Lesotho in the south, to the present day Pedi areas of the Limpopo Province. More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of SothoâTswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal province in which Johannesburg is situated.

Many SothoâTswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from Zululand during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the mfecane or difaqane wars), and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the Ndebele (often referred to as the Matabele, the name given them by the local SothoâTswana), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern-day Rustenburg.

=== Gold rush and naming of the city ===


The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by Jan Gerritse Bantjes, son of Jan Bantjes. This triggered the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johan and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Within ten years, the city of Johannesburg included 100,000 people.

In September 1884, the Struben brothers discovered the Confidence Reef on the farm Wilgespruit near present-day Roodepoort, which further boosted excitement over gold prospects. The first gold to be crushed on the Witwatersrand was the gold-bearing rock from the Bantjes mine crushed using the Struben brothers stamp machine. News of the discovery soon reached Kimberley and directors Cecil Rhodes and Sir Joseph Robinson rode up to investigate the rumours for themselves. They were guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights.

In 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for Â£3,000. Incidentally, Bantjes had from 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discoveryâthe early ancestors of all mankind. Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886. He did not remain in the area.

On 3 October 1886 the name Johannesburg was first used. Surveyor Jos de Villiers surveyed Johannesburg&#x27;s first neighborhood, Randjeslaagte, between 19 October and 3 November that year.

Gold was earlier discovered some to the east of present-day Johannesburg in Barberton. Gold prospectors soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the Witwatersrand offered by Bantjes. The original miners&#x27; camp, under the informal leadership of Col Ignatius Ferreira, was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because water was available there, and because of the site&#x27;s proximity to the diggings. Following the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira&#x27;s Township, today the suburb of Ferreirasdorp. The first settlement at Ferreira&#x27;s Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887. The government took over the camp, surveyed it and named it Ferreira&#x27;s Township. By 1896, Johannesburg was established as a city of over 100,000 inhabitants, one of the fastest growing cities ever.

Mines near Johannesburg are among the deepest in the world, with some as deep as .

=== Rapid growth, Jameson Raid and the Second Boer War ===
Like many late 19th-century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen were recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and the &quot;AmaWasha&quot;, Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the Boerâdominated Transvaal government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the Jameson Raid that ended in fiasco at Doornkop in January 1896. The Second Boer War (1899â1902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp.

Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrustâtoday&#x27;s Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturenaâthe next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.

During the Boer war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg&#x27;s Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as &quot;Asian&quot;, but as &quot;Coloured&quot;. The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were whites.

=== Post-Union history ===

In 1917, Johannesburg became the headquarters of the Anglo-American Corporation founded by Ernest Oppenheimer which ultimately became one of the world&#x27;s largest corporations, dominating both gold-mining and diamond-mining in South Africa. Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hillbrow went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as Soweto. New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the Carlton Centre and the Southern Life Centre) filled the skyline of the central business district.

The system of apartheid, a comprehensive system of racial separation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. For its growth, the economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of skilled white workers imported from Europe and semi- and un-skilled black workers imported from other parts of Southern Africa. Though they worked together they were forced by the government to live separately. Work was considered to be an exception to apartheid in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa&#x27;s economic capital.
In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for black families (prior to this unskilled workers were asked to work on &quot;single status&quot; in male-only hostels at the mines and had to commute to see their families in whatever province they originated) outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg. Soweto, a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of unemployed rural blacks came to Johannesburg for employment and an income to send back to their villages. It was estimated that in 1989, the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.

In March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against apartheid in response to the Sharpeville massacre. On 11 July 1963, the South African Police raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia where nine members of the banned African National Congress (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage. Their arrest led to the famous Rivonia Trial. The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, one coloured, two whites and five blacks, one of whom was the future president Nelson Mandela. At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to apartheid and failed, leaving him with no other choice. The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to &quot;apartheid&quot;.
On 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against apartheid began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area. About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the Soweto uprising of 1976. Between 1984 and 1986, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against apartheid, and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-apartheid demonstrators.

The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres. Sandton City was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and Eastgate in 1979.

During the 1990s, the city faced rapid growth of crime throughout large parts of the city. Some areas of skyscrapers were abandoned, many residents left their homes, and businesses moved out. Some historical buildings in central areas were destroyed by fires that spread relentlessly.

===Twenty-first century===
Like many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg. One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the CBD. Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels. Maboneng calls itself &quot;a place of inspirationâa creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents. A beacon of strength in Africa&#x27;s most economically prosperous city&quot;.

After being destroyed in 2008 to make way for a motor showroom by Imperial Holdings, the iconic Rand Steam Laundries are now being redeveloped as an exact replica, by the order of the Johannesburg Heritage Council. Apart from one filtration shed, there is nothing left on the site after being destroyed. The site will consist of a precinct.

On 12 May 2008, a series of riots started in the township of Alexandra, in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, killing two people and injuring 40 others. These riots sparked the xenophobic attacks of 2008. The 2019 Johannesburg riots were similar in nature and origin to the 2008 xenophobic riots.

A completely refurbished Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup final.

From 22 to 24 August 2023, Johannesburg hosted 15th BRICS summit.

On 31 August 2023, at least 76 people died when a building caught fire in Johannesburg. The building had been taken over by a gang who were illegally renting it out.

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===
Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the Highveld, at an elevation of . The former Central Business District is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the Witwatersrand (English: White Water&#x27;s Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the Jukskei River while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the Klip River. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.

Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa&#x27;s mightiest rivers, the Limpopo and the Orange. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with &quot;fontein&quot;, meaning &quot;spring&quot; in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streamsâgiving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, &quot;the ridge of white waters&quot;. Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.

The site was not chosen for its streams, however. The main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet&#x27;s gold.

=== Parks and gardens ===
Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo. City Parks is also responsible for planting the city&#x27;s many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the &#x27;greenest&#x27; cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city with the number growing every yearâ1.2Â million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8Â million in private gardens. City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg&#x27;s urban planning. Johannesburg Botanical Garden, located in the suburb of Emmarentia, is a popular recreational park.

Johannesburg and environs also offer various options to visitors wishing to view wildlife, in addition to the Johannesburg Zoo, one of the largest in South Africa. The Lion Park nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the Krugersdorp Nature Reserve, a 1500 ha game reserve, is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre in the Magaliesberg runs a successful breeding program for cheetah, wild dog and other endangered species. The Rhino &amp; Lion Nature Reserve, situated in the &quot;Cradle of Humankind&quot; on 1200 ha of &quot;the typical highveld of Gauteng&quot; also runs a breeding programme for endangered species including Bengal tigers, Siberian tigers and the extremely rare white lion. To the south, from the city centre, is the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve home to large mammals and hiking trails. Separating Lenasia and the Soweto suburbs is the Olifantsvlei Nature Reserve protected area.

=== Climate ===

Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a subtropical highland climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;Cwb&quot;). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights. Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city&#x27;s high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of , dropping to an average maximum of around in June. The UV index for Johannesburg in summers is extreme, often reaching 14â16 due to the high elevation and its location in the subtropics.

Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the 21st century, there was light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to in the southern suburbs), 7 August 2012, and 10 July 2023.

Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is , which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. The lowest nighttime minimum temperature ever recorded in Johannesburg is , on 13 June 1979. The lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded is , on 19 June 1964.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 South African National Census, the population of Johannesburg is 4,434,827 people, making it the most populous city in South Africa (it has been the most populous city in South Africa since at least the 1950s). From the 2001 census, the people live in 1,006,930 formal households, of which 86% have a flush or chemical toilet, and 91% have refuse removed by the municipality at least once a week. 81% of households have access to running water, and 80% use electricity as the main source of energy. 29% of Johannesburg residents stay in informal dwellings. 66% of households are headed by one person.

Johannesburg&#x27;s urban agglomeration spreads well beyond the administrative boundary of the municipality. The population of the whole area has been estimated to be variously at 7,860,781 in 2011 by &quot;citypopulation.de&quot;. Johannesburg&#x27;s suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. Greater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than . Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.

Within the Metropolitan Municipality, the old centre, established in 1886 and given city status in 1928, has been listed in recent censuses as a &quot;main place&quot;. , this main place had a population of 957,441 and an area of 334.81Â km2. Some authors consider the metropolitan area to include most of Gauteng province. The UN&#x27;s Population Division in 2016 estimated the metropolitan area population to be 9,616,000.

Blacks account for 73% of the population, followed by whites at 18%, coloureds at 6% and Asians at 4%. 42% of the population is under the age of 24, while 6% of the population is over 60 years of age. 37% of city residents are unemployed. 91% of the unemployed are Black African. Women comprise 43% of the working population. 19% of economically active adults work in wholesale and retail sectors, 18% in financial, real estate and business services, 17% in the community, social and personal services and 12% are in manufacturing. Only 0.7% work in mining.

=== Religion ===

53% belong to mainstream Christian churches, 24% are not affiliated with any organised religion, 14% are members of African Independent Churches, 3% are Muslim, 1% are Jewish and 1% are Hindu. There are Muslim mosques, Hindu temples, a Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.

====Christianity====
Places of worship in Johannesburg are predominantly Christian churches: Serbian Orthodox Church, Zion Christian Church, Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, Assemblies of God, Baptist Union of Southern Africa (Baptist World Alliance), Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), Methodist Church of Southern Africa (World Methodist Council), Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg (Catholic Church) and the Johannesburg South Africa Temple (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).

====Judaism====
Most of Johannesburg&#x27;s estimated 50,000 Jews live in the North Eastern suburbs; Glenhazel, Raedene Estate, Kew, Norwood, Highlands North, Sandringham, Savoy Estate, Waverley, Orchards, Oaklands and Fairmount. There are many Orthodox synagogues in the city including; Great Park Synagogue, Oxford Shul and Doornfontein Synagogue. There is a smaller number of synagogues serving the city&#x27;s Reform Jews, including Temple Israel and Beit Emanuel.

=== Languages ===
32% of Johannesburg residents speak Nguni languages at home, 24% speak Sotho languages, 18% speak English, 7% speak Afrikaans and 6% speak Tshivenda.


=== Education ===

Johannesburg has a well-developed higher education system of both private and public universities. Johannesburg is served by the public universities University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Johannesburg.

University of Johannesburg was formed on 1 January 2005, when three separate universities and campusesâRand Afrikaans University, Technikon Witwatersrand, and the Johannesburg campuses of Vista Universityâwere merged. The new university offers education primarily in English and Afrikaans, although courses may be taken in any of South Africa&#x27;s official languages.

The University of the Witwatersrand is one of the leading universities in Africa, and is famous as a centre of resistance to apartheid. It is attached to one of the world&#x27;s largest hospitals, the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, located in Soweto.

The University of Pretoria&#x27;s business school the Gordon Institute of Business Science is located in Illovo, Johannesburg.

Many private colleges are also situated in Johannesburg, such as Damelin, CTI, Lyceum College and the South African campus of Monash University (six of the other campuses are in Australia, while the eighth is in Malaysia), as well as the Midrand Graduate Institute which is located in Midrand.

Johannesburg also has one of several film schools in the country, one of which has won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Student Film in 2006. The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance, or AFDA for short, is situated in Auckland Park.

Johannesburg also has three teacher-training colleges and a technical college. There are numerous kindergartens, primary schools and high schools in the region.

== Economy ==

Johannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa&#x27;s gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng&#x27;s economic activity. In a 2008 survey conducted by Mastercard, Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa).

Mining was the foundation of the Witwatersrand&#x27;s economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city&#x27;s economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the city limits, most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city&#x27;s manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. Johannesburg has Africa&#x27;s largest stock exchange, the JSE although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.

The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of Lesotho, the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.

The container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest &quot;dry port&quot; in the world, with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of Durban and Cape Town arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government.

=== Retail ===

Johannesburg&#x27;s largest shopping centres, measured by gross leasable area (GLA, the uniform measure of centre size as determined by the International Council of Shopping Centers) are Sandton City, Eastgate, Mall of Africa, Westgate and Cresta. Melrose Arch is one of its most prestigious. Other centres include Hyde Park Corner, Rosebank, Southgate, The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk&#x27;Izizwe Shopping Resort, in Midrand, but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of Mall of Africa. &quot;Zonk&#x27;Izizwe&quot; means &quot;All Nations&quot; in Zulu language, indicating that the centre will cater to the city&#x27;s diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened. Cradlestone Mall is a new mall named for its location which is close to the Cradle of Humankind, a World Heritage Site.

== Law and government ==
=== Government ===

Upon the creation of the Metropolitan Municipality in 2000 the city was subdivided into eleven regions, simply named Region 1 to Region 11. These were reorganised in 2006 into the current seven regions named alphabetically Region A to Region G, as shown on the nearby map.

 the seven regions are:
*&quot;Region A&quot;: Diepsloot, Kya Sand;
*&quot;Region B&quot;: Randburg, Rosebank, Emmarentia, Greenside, Melville, Northcliff, Rosebank, Parktown, Parktown North;
*&quot;Region C&quot;: Roodepoort, Constantia Kloof, Northgate;
*&quot;Region D&quot;: Doornkop, Soweto, Dobsonville, Protea Glen;
*&quot;Region E&quot;: Alexandra, Wynberg, Sandton;
*&quot;Region F&quot;: Inner City;
*&quot;Region G&quot;: Orange Farm, Ennerdale, Lenasia.

In the 2016 municipal elections, the ruling party, the ANC, lost their majority in Johannesburg for the first time since taking power in 1994, claiming only 44.12% of the vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance both agreed to vote for the DA mayoral candidate, Herman Mashaba, who was sworn into power as the first Democratic Alliance mayor of Johannesburg on 22 August 2016. The ANC returned to the city&#x27;s executive on 4 December 2019 following the election of its regional chair, Geoff Makhubo, to the mayoralty. Makhubo died on 9 July 2021 and Eunice Mgcina was appointed acting mayor. A new mayor, Jolidee Matongo, was elected unopposed on 10 August 2021. Matongo died in a car accident in September 2021 and Mpho Moerane was elected to succeed him.

=== Crime ===
After the Group Areas Act was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by urban blight. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like Soweto and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and wartorn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by landlords, especially in high-density areas, such as Hillbrow. Many corporations and institutions, including the stock exchange, moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like Sandton.

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include closed-circuit television on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech CCTV surveillance. The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds.

Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow. Between 2001 and 2006, R9-billion (US$1.2Â billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-billion (US$1.5Â billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, local government enlisted the help of Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament were played in the city.

Murders in the Johannesburg municipality amounted to 1,697 in 2007 according to the South African Medical Research Council, a rate of 43 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2016 that number had sharply declined to 29.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, placing the murder rate at more than half of that of Cape Town and even below the national average.

==Culture==
Johannesburg is a cultural hub in South Africa and has a wide variety of cultural venues, making it a prominent area for many creative and cultural industries.

Johannesburg is home to the National School of Arts, The University of Witwatersrand&#x27;s School of the Arts and the South African Ballet Theatre, as well as the Johannesburg Art Gallery and other prominent cultural landmarks, such as the Mary Fitzgerald Square and numerous other museums, theatres, galleries and libraries.

The Johannesburg City Library is located in the Central Business District of Johannesburg.

=== Museums and galleries ===
Specialist museums cover subjects such as Africana, costume, design, fossils, geology, military history, medical, pharmacy, photography and transportation networks such as railways. Gold Reef City, a living museum, was originally part of the Crown Mines Complex, where gold was mined to a depth of . The Market Theatre stages plays, comedy shows, and musical performances.

The following is a list of some of the museums and galleries that can be found in Johannesburg.
*AECI Dynamite Factory Museum
::The AECI Dynamite Factory Museum, housed in the 1895 residence of a mining official, records the history of explosives, with particular emphasis on their use in the mining industry.
*Adler Museum of Medicine

:: The Zoology Museum is the only natural history museum in Johannesburg which is unusual because all the other major cities in South Africa have large public natural history museums. It has retained a unique character as the display specimens are exhibited in finely crafted teak cabinets which allow the viewer to engage directly with scores of objects at close range.

=== Entertainment and performing arts ===
Johannesburg hosts many of South Africa&#x27;s premier music events, such as RAMFest&#x27;s Johannesburg leg, In The City and many international tours from bands and artists around the world. Several critically acclaimed musical acts come from Johannesburg, such as Kongos, Johnny Clegg, Trevor Rabin, Zebra &amp; Giraffe, Man As Machine, The Parlotones, and ShortStraw.

The Joburg Theatre complex hosts drama, opera and ballet.

The Market Theatre Foundation houses the historic Market Theatre in Newtown with various sized stages holding performances from theatre to music and dance. The foundation also oversees the Market Theatre Laboratory and The Market Photo Workshop â run training programmes for young creatives and presenting work to the public.

=== Public art ===
Public art ranges from sculptures to murals to pieces by artists like William Kentridge and Gerhard Marx&#x27;s Fire Walker. Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in Hillbrow and the city centre.

As part of the Johannesburg Development Agency&#x27;s (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city. The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art.

=== Architecture and urbanism ===

Johannesburg is home to some of Africa&#x27;s tallest structures, such as the Sentech Tower, Hillbrow Tower, the Carlton Centre and Ponte City Apartments. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as IBM, Absa, BHP, Willis Group, First National Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank. Many of the city&#x27;s older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is Hillbrow, the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is Braamfontein, a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being Victorian Colonial, Edwardian Baroque, Art Deco and Modernism.

The city is often described as Africa&#x27;s economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city. Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD. Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.

Due to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the multiple nuclei model in human geography terms. It is the hub of South Africa&#x27;s commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. Randburg and Sandton form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of . It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the Carlton Centre, Marble Towers, Trust Bank Building, Ponte City Apartments, Southern Life Centre and 11 Diagonal Street.

Johannesburg&#x27;s city centre retains its elements of a rectangular grid pattern that was first officially recorded in 1886. Streets are narrow and filled with high rises built in the mid- to late 1900s. Old Victorianâera buildings first built in the late 1800s have been torn down long ago. The 1900s brought along with it the introduction of many different architectural styles and structures. The Johannesburg Art Gallery and Supreme Court Building being two examples. These were important Beaux-Arts structures, with the style put in place by (at the time) colonial parent, the British Empire. South Africa didn&#x27;t borrow architectural techniques exclusively from Britain, however. They were also inspired by American models and styles, having built several structures like the ESKOM Building and the Corner House to emulate the prowess of New York City, located in the United States.
=== Sports ===
Johannesburg&#x27;s most popular sports by participation are association football, cricket, rugby union, and running. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs.

The city has several football clubs in the Premiership and the National First Division. In the Premiership, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include Kaizer Chiefs (nicknamed &quot;Amakhosi&quot;) and Orlando Pirates (nicknamed the &quot;Buccaneers&quot;). They are based at the city&#x27;s FNB and Orlando stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at Soccer City the venue of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. First Division teams are Jomo Cosmos and FC AK. Katlehong City and Alexandra United, play at Alexandra and Reiger Park stadium respectively.

Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the Highveld Lions represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West at the Wanderers Stadium which was the venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final in which Australia successfully defended their title against India. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever ODI match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs. They take part in the first class SuperSport Series, the one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Ram Slam T20 Challenge. Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, in which India beat Pakistan in the final.

The Lions, formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, North West and Mpumalanga in the United Rugby Championship competition, which includes teams from South Africa, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The Golden Lions compete in the Currie Cup, which they have won on ten occasions. They are housed at Ellis Park Stadium, which also hosted the IRB 1995 Rugby World Cup Final, in which the South African Springboks defeated the New Zealand All Blacks.

The city&#x27;s Ticketpro Dome and the Ellis Park Arena hosted two of the three NBA Africa Games.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city&#x27;s residents are dependent on the city&#x27;s informal minibus taxis.

==== Roads ====

Johannesburg shares a network of metropolitan routes with Krugersdorp and Ekurhuleni. The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa&#x27;s most famous &quot;beltways&quot; or ring roads/orbitals is the Johannesburg Ring Road. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an loop around it: the N3 Eastern Bypass, the N1 Western Bypass and the N12 Southern Bypass. The N3 was built exclusively with asphalt, while the N12 and N1 sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, &quot;The Concrete Highway&quot;. In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly&#x27;s Interchange (renamed George Bizos Interchange in 2021), built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the R24 Airport Freeway intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere. It is claimed that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.

Johannesburg has a lot of freeways connected to it. The N1 connects northwards to Pretoria and Polokwane and southwards to Bloemfontein and Cape Town. The N3 connects south-east to Durban. The N12 connects westwards to Potchefstroom and Kimberley and eastwards to eMalahleni. The N14 passes at the north-western corner of the Johannesburg Municipality, connecting Pretoria with Krugersdorp. The N17 connects eastwards to Ermelo and Eswatini. The R21 connects the East Rand and O. R. Tambo International Airport with Pretoria. The R24 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the airport. The R59 connects southwards to Vereeniging and Sasolburg. The M1 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the northern suburbs and the southern suburbs. The M2 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the Germiston CBD to the east. The M1 and M2 freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.

Johannesburg also has a lot of non-freeway routes that connect to other towns and cities. The R24 connects the Johannesburg city centre with Roodepoort, Krugersdorp and Rustenburg to the west. The R25 connects Johannesburg&#x27;s northern suburbs with Modderfontein and Kempton Park to the north-east. The R29 connects the city centre with Germiston, Boksburg and Benoni to the east. The R41 connects the city centre with Roodepoort and Randfontein to the west. The R55 connects Sandton with Pretoria West to the north. The R82 connects Johannesburg South with Vereeniging to the south. The R101 connects Sandton with Midrand, Centurion and Pretoria to the north. The R511 connects Sandton with Diepsloot and Hartbeespoort to the north. The R512 connects Randburg with Lanseria International Airport and Hartbeespoort to the north.

==== Bus and taxi transit ====

Johannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by MetroBus, a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by Volvo, Scania AB and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus&#x27; fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city&#x27;s main bus terminus is situated in Gandhi Square, where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.

In 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system, the Rea Vaya bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system. Upon entering the station or bus, the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount. The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the Rea Vaya bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.

Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, metered taxis and minibus taxis. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.

The minibus &quot;taxis&quot; are the &quot;de facto&quot; standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s, the minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by turf wars.

==== Airports ====

Johannesburg is served principally by O. R. Tambo International Airport (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. Lanseria Airport, located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of Sandton, is used for commercial flights to Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Botswana, and Sun City. Other airports include Rand Airport and Grand Central Airport. Rand Airport, located in Germiston, is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of South African Airways&#x27; first Boeing 747â200 ZS-SAN and also 747SP ZS-SPC and now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.

==== Rail ====

The Metrorail Gauteng commuter rail system connects central Johannesburg to Soweto, Pretoria, and most of the satellite towns along the Witwatersrand. The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg&#x27;s infancy and covers only the older areas in the city&#x27;s south. The northern areas, including the business districts of Sandton, Midrand, Randburg, and Rosebank, are served by the rapid rail link Gautrain.
A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government&#x27;s Blue IQ Project, Gautrain has made provision for a rapid rail link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the OR Tambo International Airport. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the northâsouth line include Johannesburg&#x27;s Park Station (underground), Rosebank (underground), Sandton (underground), Marlboro (above-ground and raised), Midrand, Pretoria Station and Hatfield. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via Rhodesfield (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, and is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.

The eastâwest line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, while the northâsouth line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.

The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the N1 freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day. An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.

In 2010, a high-speed rail link was proposed between Johannesburg and Durban. In 2020 the government announced plans for high-speed rail from Johannesburg to Soweto.

==== Freight ====
City Deep Terminal is the name of Africa&#x27;s largest dry port and was officially opened by the South African Railways Services (SARS) in 1977. The container terminal is connected to the Port of Durban, Port of Ngqurha, Port of Cape Town, as well as Southern Africa by road and rail. At least forty percent of container export/imports run on the Natal Corridor (Natcor) which is directly linked by rail to City Deep.

=== Telecommunication ===
Johannesburg has 4 major cellular telecommunications operators: Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile. Vodacom&#x27;s global headquarters is located in Midrand. It was formed in 1994, just after the South African elections of 1994.

=== Media ===

Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as 94.7 Highveld Stereo, Radiokansel / Radio Pulpit, Kaya FM, Radio 2000, YFM, Metro FM, 5FM, Jacaranda FM, SAfm, Phalaphala FM, Radio 702 and UJFM.

Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster South African Broadcasting Corporation and pay-broadcast network Multichoice which distributes M-Net and DStv a digital satellite service, while eTV also has a presence in the city. The city has two television towers, the Hillbrow Tower and the Sentech Tower.

<doc id="58894" wikidata="Q242736" url="?curid=58894" title="Phosphorylation">
<text>In biochemistry, phosphorylation is the attachment of a phosphate group to a molecule or an ion. This process and its inverse, dephosphorylation, are common in biology. Protein phosphorylation often activates (or deactivates) many enzymes.

== During respiration ==
Phosphorylation is essential to the processes of both anaerobic and aerobic respiration, which involve the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the &quot;high-energy&quot; exchange medium in the cell. During aerobic respiration, ATP is synthesized in the mitochondrion by addition of a third phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in a process referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is also synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis. ATP is synthesized at the expense of solar energy by photophosphorylation in the chloroplasts of plant cells.

== Phosphorylation of glucose ==

=== Glucose metabolism ===
Phosphorylation of sugars is often the first stage in their catabolism. Phosphorylation allows cells to accumulate sugars because the phosphate group prevents the molecules from diffusing back across their transporter. Phosphorylation of glucose is a key reaction in sugar metabolism. The chemical equation for the conversion of D-glucose to D-glucose-6-phosphate in the first step of glycolysis is given by:

:D-glucose + ATP â D-glucose 6-phosphate + ADP

:ÎGÂ° = â16.7 kJ/mol (Â° indicates measurement at standard condition)

==== Glycolysis ====
Glycolysis is an essential process of glucose degrading into two molecules of pyruvate, through various steps, with the help of different enzymes. It occurs in ten steps and proves that phosphorylation is a much required and necessary step to attain the end products. Phosphorylation initiates the reaction in step 1 of the preparatory step (first half of glycolysis), and initiates step 6 of payoff phase (second phase of glycolysis).

Glucose, by nature, is a small molecule with the ability to diffuse in and out of the cell. By phosphorylating glucose (adding a phosphoryl group in order to create a negatively charged phosphate group), glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which is trapped within the cell as the cell membrane is negatively charged. This reaction occurs due to the enzyme hexokinase, an enzyme that helps phosphorylate many six-membered ring structures. Phosphorylation takes place in step 3, where fructose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase.

While phosphorylation is performed by ATPs during preparatory steps, phosphorylation during payoff phase is maintained by inorganic phosphate. Each molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is phosphorylated to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The cascade effect of phosphorylation eventually causes instability and allows enzymes to open the carbon bonds in glucose.

Phosphorylation functions is an extremely vital component of glycolysis, as it helps in transport, control, and efficiency.

=== Glycogen synthesis ===
Glycogen is a long-term store of glucose produced by the cells of the liver. In the liver, the synthesis of glycogen is directly correlated with blood glucose concentration. High blood glucose concentration causes an increase in intracellular levels of glucose 6-phosphate in the liver, skeletal muscle, and fat (adipose) tissue. Glucose 6-phosphate has role in regulating glycogen synthase.

High blood glucose releases insulin, stimulating the translocation of specific glucose transporters to the cell membrane; glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate during transport across the membrane by ATP-D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase and non-specific hexokinase (ATP-D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase). Liver cells are freely permeable to glucose, and the initial rate of phosphorylation of glucose is the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism by the liver.

The liver&#x27;s crucial role in controlling blood sugar concentrations by breaking down glucose into carbon dioxide and glycogen is characterized by the negative Gibbs free energy (ÎG) value, which indicates that this is a point of regulation with. The hexokinase enzyme has a low Michaelis constant (K), indicating a high affinity for glucose, so this initial phosphorylation can proceed even when glucose levels at nanoscopic scale within the blood.

The phosphorylation of glucose can be enhanced by the binding of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), and lessened by the binding fructose 1-phosphate (F1P). Fructose consumed in the diet is converted to F1P in the liver. This negates the action of F6P on glucokinase, which ultimately favors the forward reaction. The capacity of liver cells to phosphorylate fructose exceeds capacity to metabolize fructose-1-phosphate. Consuming excess fructose ultimately results in an imbalance in liver metabolism, which indirectly exhausts the liver cell&#x27;s supply of ATP.

Allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an effector, stimulates glycogen synthase, and glucose-6-phosphate may inhibit the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase.

=== Other processes ===
Phosphorylation of glucose is imperative in processes within the body. For example, phosphorylating glucose is necessary for insulin-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway activity within the heart. This further suggests a link between intermediary metabolism and cardiac growth.

==Protein phosphorylation==
Protein phosphorylation is the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes. Phosphorylation can occur on serine, threonine and tyrosine side chains (in other words, on their residues) through phosphoester bond formation, on histidine, lysine and arginine through phosphoramidate bonds, and on aspartic acid and glutamic acid through mixed anhydride linkages. Recent evidence confirms widespread histidine phosphorylation at both the 1 and 3 N-atoms of the imidazole ring. Recent work demonstrates widespread human protein phosphorylation on multiple non-canonical amino acids, including motifs containing phosphorylated histidine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, arginine and lysine in HeLa cell extracts. However, due to the chemical lability of these phosphorylated residues, and in marked contrast to Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation, the analysis of phosphorylated histidine (and other non-canonical amino acids) using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation.

The prominent role of protein phosphorylation in biochemistry is illustrated by the huge body of studies published on the subject (as of March 2015, the MEDLINE database returns over 240,000 articles, mostly on &quot;protein&quot; phosphorylation).

<doc id="58895" wikidata="Q727781" url="?curid=58895" title="Music of Latin America">
<text>The music of Latin America refers to music originating from Latin America, namely the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the Americas south of the United States. Latin American music also incorporate the indigenous music of Latin America. Due to its highly syncretic nature, Latin American music encompasses a wide variety of styles, including influential genres such as cumbia, bachata, bossa nova, merengue, rumba, salsa, samba, son, candombe and tango. During the 20th century, many styles were influenced by the music of the United States giving rise to genres such as Latin pop, rock, jazz, hip hop, and reggaeton.

Geographically, it usually refers to the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of Latin America, but sometimes includes Francophone countries and territories of the Caribbean and South America as well. It also encompasses Latin American styles that have originated in the United States such as, salsa, New Mexico music, Tejano, various forms of country-Western, as well as Chicano rock, Nuyorican rap, and Chicano rap. The origins of Latin American music can be traced back to the Spanish and Portuguese conquest of the Americas in the 16th century, when the European settlers brought their music from overseas. Latin American music is performed in Spanish and Portuguese.

== Popular music styles by country and territory ==

===Argentina===

It is unclear on the birthplace of tango, though musicologists collectively agree that it most likely originated in Germany in 1860 as a form of religious music in organless churches. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges believes the genre to have originated in brothels in the country, though editors of &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; (2000), called Borges&#x27; statement &quot;a little presumptive&quot;. They pinpoint the early developments of tango to the porteÃ±o people in Buenos Aires, most likely at bars. Tango became an urban music scene, which was a result of a melting pot of European immigrants, criollos, blacks, and native populations. Tango is influenced by Andalusian flamenco, Spanish contradanse, southern Italian melodies, Cuban habanera, African candombe and percussion. German polkas, Polish mazurkas, and Argentine Guanchos milonga. In its early history, tango music was associated with brawls at brothels and knife-wielding womanizing men. By 1914, men outnumbered women in Argentina by 100,000, leading to an increased rate of prostitution and the brothel lifestyle that came with it. Men would often dance at cafes and bars and try to outdo one another with improvised dance steps in an attempt to attract a woman.

Their dances were characterized by &quot;showy yet threatening, predatory quality, often revolving around a possessive relationship between two men and one woman&quot;. In its original form, tango music included the violin, guitar, and flute. By the end of the 19th century, the bandoneon was introduced. One of the instrument&#x27;s early pioneers, Eduardo Arolas, was called the &quot;Tiger of the Bandoneon&quot;. Arolas believed the instrument was made to play in tango. Vicente Greco is credited with standardizing tango with his group, Orquesta Tipica Criolla, by using two violins and two bandoneons. The instrumentation of tango remained largely unchanged until the 1940s. Tango music began playing in populated areas such as fairgrounds and streets in Buenos Aires. It contained lyrics that were &quot;sometimes obscene and deeply fatalistic&quot;. Similar to families in the United States during the rise of rock and roll, families in the area tried to shield their children from tango. Upper-classmen began taking an interest in tango, writer Ricardo Guiraldes performed tango during a tour of Europe in 1910 and has been credited with introducing tango in Europe. Guiraldes&#x27; introduction made tango the first Latin dance to gain popularity in Europe. Actor Rudolph Valentino performed the tango in his film &quot;The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse&quot; (1926), with Hollywood taking advantage of &quot;[Valentino&#x27;s] charisma, the magnetism of tango, and the attraction they both had on a huge public&quot;.

Other styles of music in Argentina include the Chacarera, Milonga, Zamba and ChamamÃ©. Modern rhythms include Cuarteto (music from the Cordoba Province) and Electrotango. Argentine rock (known locally as &quot;rock nacional&quot;) was most popular during the 1980s, and remains Argentina&#x27;s most popular music. &quot;Rock en espaÃ±ol&quot; was first popular in Argentina, then swept through other Hispanic American countries and Spain. The movement was known as the &quot;Argentine Wave&quot;.

===Bolivia===
Bolivian music is perhaps the most strongly linked to its native population among the national styles of South America. After the nationalistic period of the 1950s Aymara and Quechuan culture became more widely accepted, and their folk music evolved into a more pop-like sound. Los Kjarkas played a pivotal role in this fusion. Other forms of native music (such as huayÃ±os and caporales) are also widely played. Cumbia is another popular genre. There are also lesser-known regional forms, such as the music from Santa Cruz and Tarija (where styles such as Cueca and Chacarera are popular).

===Brazil===

Brazil is a large, diverse country with a long history of popular-musical development, ranging from the early-20th-century innovation of samba to the modern &quot;MÃºsica popular brasileira&quot;. Bossa nova is internationally well-known, and ForrÃ³ (pronounced ) is also widely known and popular in Brazil. Lambada is influenced by rhythms like cumbia and merengue. Funk carioca (also known as Brazilian funk) is also a highly popular style, including tamborzÃ£o rhythms.

===Chile===
Many musical genres are native to Chile; one of the most popular was the Chilean Romantic Cumbia, exemplified by artists such as Americo and Leo Rey. The Nueva CanciÃ³n originated in the 1960s and 1970s and spread in popularity until the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;Ã©tat, when most musicians were arrested, killed or exiled.

In Central Chile, several styles can be found: the Cueca (the national dance), the &quot;Tonada&quot;, the &quot;Refalosa&quot;, the &quot;Sajuriana&quot;, the Zapateado, the &quot;Cuando&quot; and the Vals. In the Norte Grande region traditional music resembles the music of southern PerÃº and western Bolivia, and is known as Andean music. This music, which reflects the spirit of the indigenous people of the Altiplano, was an inspiration for the Nueva canciÃ³n. 
The ChiloÃ© Archipelago has unique folk-music styles, due to its isolation from the culture centres of Santiago.

Music from Chilean Polynesia, Rapa Nui music, is derived from Polynesian culture rather than colonial society or European influences.

=== Costa Rica ===
The music of Costa Rica is represented by musical expressions as parrandera, the Tambito, waltz, bolero, gang, calypso, chiquichiqui, mento the run and callera. They emerged from the migration processes and historical exchanges between indigenous, European and African. Typical instruments are the quijongo, marimba, ocarinas, low drawer, the Sabak, reed flutes, accordion, mandolin and guitar.

===Cuba===

Cuba has produced many musical genres, and a number of musicians in a variety of styles. Blended styles range from the danzÃ³n to the rumba.

===Colombia===
Colombian music can be divided into four musical zones: the Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, the Andean region and Los Llanos.
The Atlantic music features rhythms such as the cumbia, porros and mapalÃ©. Music from the Pacific coast such features rhythms such as the &quot;currulao&quot; âwhich is tinged with Spanish influenceâ and the Jota chocoana (along with many more afro-drum predominating music forms)âtinged with African and Aboriginal influence. Colombian Andean has been strongly influenced by Spanish rhythms and instruments, and differs noticeably from the indigenous music of Peru or Bolivia. Typical forms include the &quot;bambuco&quot;, &quot;pasillo guabina&quot; and &quot;torbellino&quot;, played with pianos and string instruments such as the &quot;tiple guitarra&quot;. The music of Los Llanos, &quot;mÃºsica llanera&quot;, is usually accompanied by a harp, a &quot;cuatro&quot; (a type of four-string guitar) and maracas. It has much in common with the music of the Venezuelan Llanos.

Apart from these traditional forms, two newer musical styles have conquered large parts of the country: &quot;la salsa&quot;, which has spread throughout the Pacific coast and the &quot;vallenato&quot;, which originated in La Guajira and CÃ©sar (on the northern Caribbean coast). The latter is based on European accordion music. Merengue music is heard as well. More recently, musical styles such as reggaeton and bachata have also become popular.

===Dominican Republic===

Merengue tÃ­pico and Orchestra merengue have been popular in the Dominican Republic for many decades, and is widely regarded as the national music. Bachata is more recent arrival, arriving in the first half of the 20th century, taking influences from the &quot;bolero&quot; and derived from the country&#x27;s rural guitar music. Bachata has evolved and risen in popularity over the last 40 years in the Dominican Republic and other areas (such as Puerto Rico) with the help of artists such as Antony Santos, Luis Segura, Luis Vargas, Teodoro Reyes, Yoskar Sarante, Alex Bueno, and Aventura. Bachata, merengue and salsa are now equally popular among Spanish-speaking Caribbean people. When the Spanish &quot;conquistadors&quot; sailed across the Atlantic they brought with them a type of music known as &quot;hesparo&quot;, which contributed to the development of Dominican music. A romantic style is also popular in the Dominican Republic from vocalists such as Angela Carrasco, Anthony Rios, Maridalia Hernandez and Olga Lara. Reggaeton is currently one of the most popular genres coming out of the Dominican Republic. It has been recently popularized in night clubs with these high beats. This was made by the help of Dominican artist El Alfa. El Alfa has made &quot;dembow&quot; one of the most popular types of reggaeton. He has been able to produce highly played songs that are played in multiple countries.

===Ecuador===
Traditional Ecuadorian music can be classified as mestizo, Indian and Afro-Ecuadorian music. Mestizo music evolved from the interrelation between Spanish and Indian music. It has rhythms such as &quot;pasacalles&quot;, &quot;pasillos&quot;, &quot;albazos&quot; and &quot;sanjuanitos&quot;, and is usually played by stringed instruments. There are also regional variations: coastal styles, such as &quot;vals&quot; (similar to Vals Peruano (Waltz)) and &quot;montubio&quot; music (from the coastal hill country).

Indian music in Ecuador is determined in varying degrees by the influence of &quot;quichua&quot; culture. Within it are &quot;sanjuanitos&quot; (different from the &quot;mestizo sanjuanito&quot;), &quot;capishkas&quot;, &quot;danzantes&quot; and &quot;yaravis&quot;. Non-&quot;quichua&quot; indigenous music ranges from the TsÃ¡chila music of Santo Domingo (influenced by the neighboring Afro-marimba) to the Amazonian music of groups such as the Shuar.

Black Ecuadorian music can be classified into two main forms. The first type is black music from the coastal Esmeraldas province, and is characterized by the marimba. The second variety is black music from the Chota Valley in the northern Sierra (primarily known as Bomba del Chota), characterized by a more-pronounced mestizo and Indian influence than &quot;marimba esmeraldeÃ±a&quot;. Most of these musical styles are also played by wind ensembles of varying sizes at popular festivals around the country. Like other Latin American countries, Ecuadorian music includes local exponents of international styles: from opera, salsa and rock to cumbia, thrash metal and jazz.

===El Salvador===
Salvadoran music may be compared with the Colombian style of music known as &quot;cumbia&quot;.
Popular styles in modern El Salvador (in addition to &quot;cumbia&quot;) are salsa, Bachata and Reggaeton. &quot;Political chaos tore the country apart in the early 20th century, and music was often suppressed, especially those with strong native influences. In the 1940s, for example, it was decreed that a dance called &quot;Xuc&quot; was to be the &quot;national dance&quot; which was created and led by Paquito Palaviccini&#x27;s and his &quot;Orquestra Internacional Polio&quot;&quot;. In recent years reggaeton and hip hop have gained popularity, led by groups such as Pescozada and Mecate. Salvadorian music has a musical style influenced by Mayan music (played on the El Salvador-Guatemala border, in Chalatenango). Another popular style of music not native to El Salvador is known as Punta, a Belizean, Guatemalan and Honduran style.

Some of the leading classical composers from El Salvador include Alex PanamÃ¡, Carlos ColÃ³n-Quintana, and German CÃ¡ceres.

===Guatemala===
Guatemala has a very extensive musical history, from Mayan music to modern-day acts such as Ricardo Arjona. They have a diverse range of music.

===Honduras===

The music of Honduras varies from Punta and Paranda (the local genre of the Garifunas) to Caribbean music such as salsa, merengue, reggae and reggaeton (all widely heard, especially in the north). Mexican ranchera music has a large following in the rural interior of the country. The country&#x27;s ancient capital of Comayagua is an important center for modern Honduran music, and is home to the College for Fine Arts. T

===Mexico===
 
Mexico is perhaps one of the most musically diverse countries in the world. Each of its 31 states, its capital city and each of Mexico City&#x27;s boroughs claim unique styles of music. The most representative genre is mariachi music or traditional regional music corridos. Although commonly misportrayed as buskers, mariachis musicians play extremely technical, structured music or blends such as jarabe. Most mariachi music is sung in verses of prose poetry. Ranchera, Mexico&#x27;s country music, differs from mariachi in that it is less technical and its lyrics are not sung in prose. Other regional music includes: &quot;son jarocho&quot;, &quot;son huasteco&quot;, &quot;cumbia sonidera&quot;, Mexican pop, &quot;rock en espaÃ±ol&quot;, Mexican rock and &quot;canto nuevo&quot;. There is also music based on sounds made by dancing (such as the &quot;zapateada&quot;).

Northeastern Mexico is home to another popular style called &quot;norteÃ±a&quot;, which assimilates Mexican &quot;ranchera&quot; with Colombian &quot;cumbia&quot; and is typically played with Bavarian accordions and Bohemian polka influence. One of the most popular music styles in all Mexico are &quot;corridos&quot;. This is regional mexican music and recently been popularized by famous artist such as Peso Pluma and Grupo Frontera. These folk tales consist of money and love. Poetry backed up instrumentals of the guitar and trumpet. It has grown to be very popular in the United States. Variations of &quot;norteÃ±a&quot; include &quot;duranguense&quot;, &quot;tambora sinaloense&quot;, &quot;corridos&quot; and nortec (norteÃ±o-techno). The eastern part of the country makes heavy use of the harp, typical of the &quot;son arocho&quot; style. The music in southern Mexico is particularly represented by its use of the marimba, which has its origins in the Soconusco region between Mexico and Guatemala.

The north-central states have recently spawned a Tecktonik-style music, combining electro and other dance genres with more traditional music. Salsa (music) has also played an important role in Mexican music shown by Sonora Santanera. Currently, Reggaeton is very popular in modern Mexico.

===Nicaragua===

The most popular style of music in Nicaragua is &quot;palo de Mayo&quot;, which is both a type of dance music and a festival where the dance (and music) originated. Other popular music includes marimba, folklore, &quot;son nica&quot;, folk music, &quot;merengue&quot;, &quot;bachata&quot; and salsa.

===Panama===
The music of Panama is the result of the mestizaje, It has occurred during the last five hundred years between the Iberian traditions, especially those of Andalusia, American Indians and those of West Africa. Mestizaje that has been enriched by cultural exchange caused by several waves of migrations originating in Europe, in various parts of the Caribbean (mostly Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica and Saint Lucia) in Asia and several points in South and North America. These migrations were due to the Spanish colonization of America, which was forced to use the Royal Route of Panama as an inter-oceanic trade route, which included the slave trade (an institution abolished in Panama in 1851); To the traffic, product of the exploitation of the silver mines in the Viceroyalty of Peru during centuries XVI and XVII; To the legendary riches of the Fair of Portobelo, between centuries XVII and XVIII; To the construction of the TransÃ­smico Railroad, begun in 1850, and the Interoceanic Canal, initiated by France in 1879, concluded by the United States in 1914 and expanded by Panama from 2007.

With this rich cultural heritage, Panama has contributed significantly to the development of Cumbia, Decima, Panamanian saloma, Pasillo, Panamanian bunde, bullerengue, Punto Music, Tamborito, Mejorana, Panamanian Murga, Tamborera (Examples: Guarare and Tambor de la Alegria), bolero, jazz, Salsa, reggae and calypso, through composers like Nicolas Aceves NÃºÃ±ez (hall, cumbia, tamborito, Pasillo), Luis Russell (jazz), Ricardo FÃ¡brega (bolero and Tamborera), JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez VÃ©lez (cumbia and bolero), Arturo &quot;Chino&quot; Hassan (bolero), Nando Boom (reggae), Lord Cobra (calypso), RubÃ©n Blades (salsa), Danilo PÃ©rez (jazz), Vicente GÃ³mez GudiÃ±o (Pasillo), CÃ©sar Alcedo, among many others.

===Paraguay===

Paraguayan music depends largely upon two instruments: the guitar and the harp, which were brought by the conquistadors and found their own voices in the country. Polka Paraguaya, which adopted its name from the European dance, is the most popular type of music and has different versions (including the &quot;galopa&quot;, the &quot;kryeâÃ¿&quot; and the &quot;canciÃ³n Paraguaya&quot;, or &quot;Paraguayan song&quot;). The first two are faster and more upbeat than a standard polka; the third is a bit slower and slightly melancholy. Other popular styles include the &quot;purahÃ©i jaheâo&quot; and the &quot;compuesto&quot; (which tell sad, epic or love stories). The polka is usually based on poetic lyrics, but there are some emblematic pieces of Paraguayan music (such as &quot;PÃ¡jaro Campana&quot;, or &quot;Songbird&quot;, by FÃ©lix PÃ©rez Cardozo).

Guarania is the second-best-known Paraguayan musical style, and was created by musician JosÃ© AsunciÃ³n Flores in 1925.

===Peru===
Peruvian music is made up of indigenous, Spanish and West African influences. Coastal Afro-Peruvian music is characterized by the use of the &quot;cajÃ³n peruano&quot;. Amerindian music varies according to region and ethnicity. The best-known Amerindian style is the &quot;huayno&quot; (also popular in Bolivia), played on instruments such as the charango and guitar. Mestizo music is varied and includes popular &quot;valses&quot; and &quot;marinera&quot; from the northern coast.

===Puerto Rico===
The history of music on the island of Puerto Rico begins with its original inhabitants, the TaÃ­nos. The TaÃ­no Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art. The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics. A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another. When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in mÃºsica jÃ­bara this is a special type of seis called a &quot;controversia&quot;. Of all Puerto Rico&#x27;s musical exports, the best-known is reggaeton. &quot;Bomba&quot; and &quot;plena&quot; have long been popular, while reggaetÃ³n is a relatively recent invention. 
It is a form of urban contemporary music, often combining other Latin musical styles, Caribbean and West Indies music, (such as reggae, &quot;soca&quot;, Spanish reggae, salsa, merengue and &quot;bachata&quot;. It originates from Panamanian Reggae en EspaÃ±ol and Jamaican dancehall, however received its rise to popularity through Puerto Rico.&quot;Tropikeo&quot; is the fusion of R&amp;B, Rap, Hip Hop, Funk and Techno Music within a Tropical musical frame of salsa, in which the conga drums and/or timbales drums are the main source of rhythm of the tune, in conjunction with a heavy salsa &quot;montuno&quot; of the piano. The lyrics of the song can be rapped or sung, or used combining both styles, as well as danced in both styles. &quot;Aguinaldo&quot; from Puerto Rico is similar to Christmas carols, except that they are usually sung in a parranda, which is rather like a lively parade that moves from house to house in a neighborhood, looking for holiday food and drink. The melodies were subsequently used for the improvisational dÃ©cima and seis. There are aguinaldos that are usually sung in churches or religious services, while there are aguinaldos that are more popular and are sung in the parrandas. Danza is a very sophisticated form of music that can be extremely varied in its expression; they can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the bombardino and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm. Plena is a narrative song from the coastal regions of Puerto Rico, especially around Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its origins have been various claimed as far back as 1875 and as late as 1920. As rural farmers moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico and other cities, they brought plena with them and eventually added horns and improvised call and response vocals. Lyrics generally deal with stories or current events, though some are light-hearted or humorous.

===Uruguay===
Uruguayan music has similar roots to that of Argentina. Uruguayan tango and &quot;milonga&quot; are both popular styles, and folk music from along the River Plate is indistinguishable from its Argentine counterpart. Uruguay rock and &quot;cancion popular&quot; (Uruguayan versions of rock and pop music) are popular local forms. &quot;Candombe&quot;, a style of drumming descended from African slaves in the area, is quintessentially Uruguayan (although it is played to a lesser extent in Argentina). It is most popular in Montevideo, but may also be heard in a number of other cities. 21st. Century Uruguayan music is also heard internationally as part of the language of Uruguayan composers such as three-time Grammy nominated Miguel del Aguila

=== Venezuela ===
&quot;The Joropo&quot; is Venezuelan popular music originating in the &quot;llanos&quot; plains, although a more upbeat and festive &quot;gaita&quot; version is heard western Venezuela (particularly in Zulia State). There are also African-influenced styles which emphasize drumming including multiple rhythms, such as sangueo, fulia, parranda, tamborera and calypso from the Guayana region (influenced by neighboring English-speaking countries). The Aguinaldo, conforms the national representation of the Venezuelan Christmas. In the east, the malagueÃ±a, punto and galerÃ³n accompanies the velorios de cruz de mayo, (religious tradition, that is celebrated on 3 May in honor to the Christian cross). In the Venezuelan Andes, the Venezuelan bambuco is a local variation of the bambuco. Other forms include the polo and the Venezuelan waltz. El merengue venezolano es una mÃºsica bailable del siglo XX de Venezuela, con un caracterÃ­stico ritmo atractivo. Es un gÃ©nero completamente diferente del merengue de la RepÃºblica Dominicana en cuanto a su ritmo, instrumentos, cultura e historia.

Venezuelan Merengue is also known by two other names: merengue caraqueÃ±o, relating its origin to the capital Caracas, and merengue rucaneao, in which reference to RÃºcano, a mixture for a popular jelly dessert, is used as a simile for the sensual pelvic movements of its dance. Merengue came into vogue in Venezuela during the period from the 1920s to the 1940s. At first, merengue music was associated with the mabiles, popular drinking and dancing spots in Caracas, and with the capital&#x27;s carnival celebrations in street parades and plazas. Later in the 1940s, it was absorbed into the dance halls of the upper classes, and also formed part of the repertoire of smaller groups such as the Cantores del TrÃ³pico, led by guitarist Antonio Lauro (who composed &#x27;Merengue para guitarra&#x27;) and composers such as Eduardo Serrano. The hybrid traditional ensembles of then and now that dedicate their program to folkloric program to arrangements of Venezuelan folk music - ensembles such as estudiantinas, Venezuelan Merengue. Nowadays it is always discussed whether merengue is written in 2/4, 6/8 or 5/8.

==Popular styles==
===Nueva canciÃ³n===
===Salsa===

Based on Cuban music in rhythm, tempo, bass line, riffs and instrumentation, Salsa represents an amalgamation of musical styles including rock, jazz, and other Latin American musical traditions. Modern salsa (as it became known worldwide) was forged in the pan-Latin melting pot of New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Latin trap===

Latin trap has become famous around 2015. It has influences of American trap and reggaeton music.

===ReggaetÃ³n===

Reggaeton (also known as reggaetÃ³n and reguetÃ³n[1]) is a musical genre which originated in Puerto Rico during the 1990s as a result of the mixing Spanish Reggae and Spanish Hip-hop, which both stemmed from different countries. Spanish Reggae was a product of musical movements in Jamaica and Panama, while Spanish Hip-Hop was created by the influence of Hip-Hop in the U.S. at the time. Reggaeton was developed in areas of Public housing in Puerto Rico, known as &quot;caserios,&quot; which were filled with urban poverty and criminal activity such as drug violence. Popular Reggaeton artists, such as Daddy Yankee, grew up in these &quot;caserios,&quot; where their lyrics reflected life in the public housing developments and, in addition, experiences of racial exclusion in the country. These lyrics included themes surrounding sex and life in the streets, influenced by the environment in which it was developed.

Reggaeton is commonly created over a &quot;boom-ch-boom-chick&quot; beat known as &quot;dembow.&quot; This beat originates from Jamaican dancehall and reggae music and was first used for a song titled &quot;Dembow&quot; by Jamaican musician Shabba Ranks. This beat was produced by Bobby &quot;Digital&quot; Dixon and has been used in the genre since the early 1990s. Since then, songs of the genre, in addition to Reggae and Hip-Hop, have incorporated beats from other latin genres such as Salsa, Bachata, Cumbia, and Merengue.

=== Latin ballad ===

The Latin (or romantic) ballad is a Latin musical genre which originated in the 1960s. This ballad is very popular in Hispanic America and Spain, and is characterized by a sensitive rhythm. A descendant of the &quot;bolero&quot;, it has several variants (such as salsa and &quot;cumbia&quot;). Since the mid-20th century a number of artists have popularized the genre, such as Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Enrique Iglesias, Alejandra Ãvalos, Cristian Castro, Franco de Vita and JosÃ© JosÃ©.

<doc id="58899" wikidata="Q1142861" url="?curid=58899" title="Direct sum of modules">
<text>In abstract algebra, the direct sum is a construction which combines several modules into a new, larger module. The direct sum of modules is the smallest module which contains the given modules as submodules with no &quot;unnecessary&quot; constraints, making it an example of a coproduct. Contrast with the direct product, which is the dual notion.

The most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over the ring Z of integers). The construction may also be extended to cover Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.

See the article decomposition of a module for a way to write a module as a direct sum of submodules.

== Construction for vector spaces and abelian groups ==

We give the construction first in these two cases, under the assumption that we have only two objects. Then we generalize to an arbitrary family of arbitrary modules. The key elements of the general construction are more clearly identified by considering these two cases in depth.

=== Construction for two vector spaces ===

Suppose &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are vector spaces over the field &quot;K&quot;. The Cartesian product &quot;V&quot; Ã &quot;W&quot; can be given the structure of a vector space over &quot;K&quot; by defining the operations componentwise:

* (&quot;v&quot;1, &quot;w&quot;1) + (&quot;v&quot;2, &quot;w&quot;2) = (&quot;v&quot;1 + &quot;v&quot;2, &quot;w&quot;1 + &quot;w&quot;2)
* &quot;Î±&quot; (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) = (&quot;Î±&quot; &quot;v&quot;, &quot;Î±&quot; &quot;w&quot;)

for &quot;v&quot;, &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2 â &quot;V&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;w&quot;1, &quot;w&quot;2 â &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Î±&quot; â &quot;K&quot;.

The resulting vector space is called the &quot;direct sum&quot; of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; and is usually denoted by a plus symbol inside a circle:
formula_1

It is customary to write the elements of an ordered sum not as ordered pairs (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;), but as a sum &quot;v&quot; + &quot;w&quot;.

The subspace &quot;V&quot; Ã {0} of &quot;V&quot; â &quot;W&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;V&quot; and is often identified with &quot;V&quot;; similarly for {0} Ã &quot;W&quot; and &quot;W&quot;. (See &quot;internal direct sum&quot; below.) With this identification, every element of &quot;V&quot; â &quot;W&quot; can be written in one and only one way as the sum of an element of &quot;V&quot; and an element of &quot;W&quot;. The dimension of &quot;V&quot; â &quot;W&quot; is equal to the sum of the dimensions of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;. One elementary use is the reconstruction of a finite vector space from any subspace &quot;W&quot; and its orthogonal complement: 
formula_2

This construction readily generalizes to any finite number of vector spaces.

=== Construction for two abelian groups ===

For abelian groups &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; which are written additively, the direct product of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is also called a direct sum . Thus the Cartesian product &quot;G&quot; Ã &quot;H&quot; is equipped with the structure of an abelian group by defining the operations componentwise:
: (&quot;g&quot;1, &quot;h&quot;1) + (&quot;g&quot;2, &quot;h&quot;2) = (&quot;g&quot;1 + &quot;g&quot;2, &quot;h&quot;1 + &quot;h&quot;2)

for &quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2 in &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;h&quot;1, &quot;h&quot;2 in &quot;H&quot;.

Integral multiples are similarly defined componentwise by
: &quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) = (&quot;ng&quot;, &quot;nh&quot;)

for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; an integer. This parallels the extension of the scalar product of vector spaces to the direct sum above.

The resulting abelian group is called the &quot;direct sum&quot; of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; and is usually denoted by a plus symbol inside a circle:
formula_3

It is customary to write the elements of an ordered sum not as ordered pairs (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), but as a sum &quot;g&quot; + &quot;h&quot;.

The subgroup &quot;G&quot; Ã {0} of &quot;G&quot; â &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; and is often identified with &quot;G&quot;; similarly for {0} Ã &quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. (See &quot;internal direct sum&quot; below.) With this identification, it is true that every element of &quot;G&quot; â &quot;H&quot; can be written in one and only one way as the sum of an element of &quot;G&quot; and an element of &quot;H&quot;. The rank of &quot;G&quot; â &quot;H&quot; is equal to the sum of the ranks of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.

This construction readily generalises to any finite number of abelian groups.

== Construction for an arbitrary family of modules ==

One should notice a clear similarity between the definitions of the direct sum of two vector spaces and of two abelian groups. In fact, each is a special case of the construction of the direct sum of two modules. Additionally, by modifying the definition one can accommodate the direct sum of an infinite family of modules. The precise definition is as follows .

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, and {&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;Â :Â &quot;i&quot;Â âÂ &quot;I&quot;} a family of left &quot;R&quot;-modules indexed by the set &quot;I&quot;. The &quot;direct sum&quot; of {&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;} is then defined to be the set of all sequences formula_4 where formula_5 and formula_6 for cofinitely many indices &quot;i&quot;. (The direct product is analogous but the indices do not need to cofinitely vanish.)

It can also be defined as functions Î± from &quot;I&quot; to the disjoint union of the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; such that Î±(&quot;i&quot;)Â âÂ &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; â &quot;I&quot; and Î±(&quot;i&quot;) = 0 for cofinitely many indices &quot;i&quot;. These functions can equivalently be regarded as finitely supported sections of the fiber bundle over the index set &quot;I&quot;, with the fiber over formula_7 being formula_8.

This set inherits the module structure via component-wise addition and scalar multiplication. Explicitly, two such sequences (or functions) Î± and Î² can be added by writing formula_9 for all &quot;i&quot; (note that this is again zero for all but finitely many indices), and such a function can be multiplied with an element &quot;r&quot; from &quot;R&quot; by defining formula_10 for all &quot;i&quot;. In this way, the direct sum becomes a left &quot;R&quot;-module, and it is denoted
formula_11

It is customary to write the sequence formula_4 as a sum formula_13. Sometimes a primed summation formula_14 is used to indicate that cofinitely many of the terms are zero.

== Properties ==

* The direct sum is a submodule of the direct product of the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; . The direct product is the set of all functions &quot;Î±&quot; from &quot;I&quot; to the disjoint union of the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; with &quot;Î±&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)â&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;, but not necessarily vanishing for all but finitely many &quot;i&quot;. If the index set &quot;I&quot; is finite, then the direct sum and the direct product are equal.
* Each of the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; may be identified with the submodule of the direct sum consisting of those functions which vanish on all indices different from &quot;i&quot;. With these identifications, every element &quot;x&quot; of the direct sum can be written in one and only one way as a sum of finitely many elements from the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* If the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; are actually vector spaces, then the dimension of the direct sum is equal to the sum of the dimensions of the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The same is true for the rank of abelian groups and the length of modules.
* Every vector space over the field &quot;K&quot; is isomorphic to a direct sum of sufficiently many copies of &quot;K&quot;, so in a sense only these direct sums have to be considered. This is not true for modules over arbitrary rings.
* The tensor product distributes over direct sums in the following sense: if &quot;N&quot; is some right &quot;R&quot;-module, then the direct sum of the tensor products of &quot;N&quot; with &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; (which are abelian groups) is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product of &quot;N&quot; with the direct sum of the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* Direct sums are commutative and associative (up to isomorphism), meaning that it doesn&#x27;t matter in which order one forms the direct sum.
* The abelian group of &quot;R&quot;-linear homomorphisms from the direct sum to some left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;L&quot; is naturally isomorphic to the direct product of the abelian groups of &quot;R&quot;-linear homomorphisms from &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;L&quot;: formula_15 Indeed, there is clearly a homomorphism &quot;Ï&quot; from the left hand side to the right hand side, where &quot;Ï&quot;(&quot;Î¸&quot;)(&quot;i&quot;) is the &quot;R&quot;-linear homomorphism sending &quot;x&quot;â&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;Î¸&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (using the natural inclusion of &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; into the direct sum). The inverse of the homomorphism &quot;Ï&quot; is defined by formula_16 for any &quot;Î±&quot; in the direct sum of the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The key point is that the definition of &quot;Ï&quot;â1 makes sense because &quot;Î±&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) is zero for all but finitely many &quot;i&quot;, and so the sum is finite.In particular, the dual vector space of a direct sum of vector spaces is isomorphic to the direct product of the duals of those spaces.
*The &quot;finite&quot; direct sum of modules is a biproduct: If formula_17 are the canonical projection mappings and formula_18 are the inclusion mappings, then formula_19 equals the identity morphism of &quot;A&quot;1 â â¯ â &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and formula_20 is the identity morphism of &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot; in the case &quot;l&quot; = &quot;k&quot;, and is the zero map otherwise.

== Internal direct sum ==
Suppose &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a submodule of &quot;M&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. If every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; can be written in exactly one way as a sum of finitely many elements of the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;, then we say that &quot;M&quot; is the internal direct sum of the submodules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; . In this case, &quot;M&quot; is naturally isomorphic to the (external) direct sum of the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; as defined above .

A submodule &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is a direct summand of &quot;M&quot; if there exists some other submodule &quot;Nâ²&quot; of &quot;M&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; is the &quot;internal&quot; direct sum of &quot;N&quot; and &quot;Nâ²&quot;. In this case, &quot;N&quot; and &quot;Nâ²&quot; are called complementary submodules.

== Universal property ==
In the language of category theory, the direct sum is a coproduct and hence a colimit in the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules, which means that it is characterized by the following universal property. For every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, consider the &quot;natural embedding&quot;

:formula_21

which sends the elements of &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; to those functions which are zero for all arguments but &quot;i&quot;. Now let &quot;M&quot; be an arbitrary &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; â &quot;M&quot; be arbitrary &quot;R&quot;-linear maps for every &quot;i&quot;, then there exists precisely one &quot;R&quot;-linear map

:formula_22

such that &quot;f&quot; o &quot;ji&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;.

== Grothendieck group ==
The direct sum gives a collection of objects the structure of a commutative monoid, in that the addition of objects is defined, but not subtraction. In fact, subtraction can be defined, and every commutative monoid can be extended to an abelian group. This extension is known as the Grothendieck group. The extension is done by defining equivalence classes of pairs of objects, which allows certain pairs to be treated as inverses. The construction, detailed in the article on the Grothendieck group, is &quot;universal&quot;, in that it has the universal property of being unique, and homomorphic to any other embedding of a commutative monoid in an abelian group.

== Direct sum of modules with additional structure ==

If the modules we are considering carry some additional structure (for example, a norm or an inner product), then the direct sum of the modules can often be made to carry this additional structure, as well. In this case, we obtain the coproduct in the appropriate category of all objects carrying the additional structure. Two prominent examples occur for Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.

In some classical texts, the phrase &quot;direct sum of algebras over a field&quot; is also introduced for denoting the algebraic structure that is presently more commonly called a direct product of algebras; that is, the Cartesian product of the underlying sets with the componentwise operations. This construction, however, does not provide a coproduct in the category of algebras, but a direct product (&quot;see note below&quot; and the remark on direct sums of rings).

===Direct sum of algebras===

A direct sum of algebras formula_23 and formula_24 is the direct sum as vector spaces, with product 
:formula_25
Consider these classical examples:
:formula_26 is ring isomorphic to split-complex numbers, also used in interval analysis.
:formula_27 is the algebra of tessarines introduced by James Cockle in 1848.
:formula_28 called the split-biquaternions, was introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in 1873.
Joseph Wedderburn exploited the concept of a direct sum of algebras in his classification of hypercomplex numbers. See his &quot;Lectures on Matrices&quot; (1934), page 151.
Wedderburn makes clear the distinction between a direct sum and a direct product of algebras: For the direct sum the field of scalars acts jointly on both parts: formula_29 while for the direct product a scalar factor may be collected alternately with the parts, but not both:
formula_30
Ian R. Porteous uses the three direct sums above, denoting them formula_31 as rings of scalars in his analysis of &quot;Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups&quot; (1995).

The construction described above, as well as Wedderburn&#x27;s use of the terms and follow a different convention than the one in category theory. In categorical terms, Wedderburn&#x27;s is a categorical product, whilst Wedderburn&#x27;s is a coproduct (or categorical sum), which (for commutative algebras) actually corresponds to the tensor product of algebras.

=== Direct sum of Banach spaces ===
The direct sum of two Banach spaces formula_23 and formula_24 is the direct sum of formula_23 and formula_24 considered as vector spaces, with the norm formula_36 for all formula_37 and formula_38

Generally, if formula_39 is a collection of Banach spaces, where formula_40 traverses the index set formula_41 then the direct sum formula_42 is a module consisting of all functions formula_43 defined over formula_44 such that formula_45 for all formula_7 and
formula_47

The norm is given by the sum above. The direct sum with this norm is again a Banach space.

For example, if we take the index set formula_48 and formula_49 then the direct sum formula_50 is the space formula_51 which consists of all the sequences formula_52 of reals with finite norm formula_53

A closed subspace formula_54 of a Banach space formula_23 is complemented if there is another closed subspace formula_56 of formula_23 such that formula_23 is equal to the internal direct sum formula_59 Note that not every closed subspace is complemented; e.g. formula_60 is not complemented in formula_61

===Direct sum of modules with bilinear forms===

Let formula_62 be a family indexed by formula_44 of modules equipped with bilinear forms. The orthogonal direct sum is the module direct sum with bilinear form formula_56 defined by
formula_65
in which the summation makes sense even for infinite index sets formula_44 because only finitely many of the terms are non-zero.

=== Direct sum of Hilbert spaces===
If finitely many Hilbert spaces formula_67 are given, one can construct their orthogonal direct sum as above (since they are vector spaces), defining the inner product as:
formula_68

The resulting direct sum is a Hilbert space which contains the given Hilbert spaces as mutually orthogonal subspaces.

If infinitely many Hilbert spaces formula_69 for formula_7 are given, we can carry out the same construction; notice that when defining the inner product, only finitely many summands will be non-zero. However, the result will only be an inner product space and it will not necessarily be complete. We then define the direct sum of the Hilbert spaces formula_69 to be the completion of this inner product space. 

Alternatively and equivalently, one can define the direct sum of the Hilbert spaces formula_69 as the space of all functions Î± with domain formula_41 such that formula_74 is an element of formula_69 for every formula_7 and:
formula_77

The inner product of two such function Î± and Î² is then defined as:
formula_78

This space is complete and we get a Hilbert space.

For example, if we take the index set formula_48 and formula_49 then the direct sum formula_81 is the space formula_82 which consists of all the sequences formula_52 of reals with finite norm formula_84 Comparing this with the example for Banach spaces, we see that the Banach space direct sum and the Hilbert space direct sum are not necessarily the same. But if there are only finitely many summands, then the Banach space direct sum is isomorphic to the Hilbert space direct sum, although the norm will be different.

Every Hilbert space is isomorphic to a direct sum of sufficiently many copies of the base field, which is either formula_85 This is equivalent to the assertion that every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis. More generally, every closed subspace of a Hilbert space is complemented because it admits an orthogonal complement. Conversely, the LindenstraussâTzafriri theorem asserts that if every closed subspace of a Banach space is complemented, then the Banach space is isomorphic (topologically) to a Hilbert space.

<text>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or unmanned aircraft system (UAS), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft with no human pilot, crew, or passengers onboard. UAVs were originally developed through the twentieth century for military missions too &quot;dull, dirty or dangerous&quot; for humans, and by the twenty-first, they had become essential assets to most militaries. As control technologies improved and costs fell, their use expanded to many non-military applications. These include aerial photography, area coverage, precision agriculture, forest fire monitoring, river monitoring, environmental monitoring, weather observation, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, smuggling, product deliveries, entertainment, and drone racing.

==Terminology==
Many terms are used for aircraft which fly without any persons onboard.

The term drone has been used from the early days of aviation, some being applied to remotely flown target aircraft used for practice firing of a battleship&#x27;s guns, such as the 1920s Fairey Queen and 1930s de Havilland Queen Bee. Later examples included the Airspeed Queen Wasp and Miles Queen Martinet, before ultimate replacement by the GAF Jindivik. The term remains in common use. In addition to the software, autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them to carry out their missions without human intervention, such as cloud computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and thermal sensors. For recreational uses, an aerial photography drone is an aircraft that has first-person video, autonomous capabilities, or both.

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is defined as a &quot;powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload&quot;. UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases. Missiles with warheads are generally not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a munition, but certain types of propeller-based missile are often called &quot;kamikaze drones&quot; by the public and media. Also, the relation of UAVs to remote controlled model aircraft is unclear in some jurisdictions. The US FAA now defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of weight. A similar term is remotely piloted aerial vehicle (RPAV).

UAVs or RPAVs can also be seen as a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which also includes a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the aircraft. 
The term UAS was adopted by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005â2030. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the British Civil Aviation Authority adopted this term, also used in the European Union&#x27;s Single European Sky (SES) Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020. This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. Similar terms are unmanned aircraft vehicle system (UAVS) and remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Many similar terms are in use. Under new regulations which came into effect 1 June 2019, the term RPAS has been adopted by the Canadian Government to mean &quot;a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its control station, the command and control links and any other system elements required during flight operation&quot;.

==Classification types==
UAVs may be classified like any other aircraft, according to design configuration such as weight or engine type, maximum flight altitude, degree of operational autonomy, operational role, etc. According to the United States Department of Defense, UAVs are classified into five categories below:

Other classifications of UAVs include:

===Range and endurance===
There are usually five categories when UAVs are classified by range and endurance:
===Size===
There are usually four categories when UAVs are classified by size, with at least one of the dimensions (length or wingspan) meet the following respective limits:
===Weight===
Based on their weight, drones can be classified into five categories:
===Degree of autonomy===
Drones can also be classified based on the degree of autonomy in their flight operations. ICAO classifies unmanned aircraft as either remotely piloted aircraft or fully autonomous. Some UAVs offer intermediate degrees of autonomy. For example, a vehicle may be remotely piloted in most contexts but have an autonomous return-to-base operation. Some aircraft types may optionally fly manned or as UAVs, which may include manned aircraft transformed into manned or Optionally Piloted UAVs (OPVs). The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention.

===Altitude===
Based on the altitude, the following UAV classifications have been used at industry events such as ParcAberporth Unmanned Systems forum:
* Hand-held altitude, about 2Â km range
* Close altitude, up to 10Â km range
* NATO type altitude, up to 50Â km range
* Tactical altitude, about 160Â km range
* MALE (medium altitude, long endurance) up to and range over 200Â km
* HALE (high altitude, long endurance) over and indefinite range
* Hypersonic high-speed, supersonic (Mach 1â5) or hypersonic (Mach 5+) or suborbital altitude, range over 200Â km
* Orbital low Earth orbit (Mach 25+)
* CIS Lunar Earth-Moon transfer
* Computer Assisted Carrier Guidance System (CACGS) for UAVs

===Composite criteria===
An example of classification based on the composite criteria is U.S. Military&#x27;s unmanned aerial systems (UAS) classification of UAVs based on weight, maximum altitude and speed of the UAV component.

=== Power sources ===
UAVs can be classified based on their power or energy source, which significantly impacts their flight duration, range, and environmental impact. The main categories include:

* Battery-powered (electric): These UAVs use rechargeable batteries, offering quiet operation and lower maintenance but potentially limited flight times. The reduced noise levels make them suitable for urban environments and sensitive operations.
* Fuel-powered (internal combustion): Utilizing traditional fuels like gasoline or diesel, these UAVs often have longer flight times but may be noisier and require more maintenance. They are typically used for applications requiring extended endurance or heavy payload capacity.
* Hybrid: Combining electric and fuel power sources, hybrid UAVs aim to balance the benefits of both systems for improved performance and efficiency. This configuration could allow for versatility in mission profiles and adaptability to different operational requirements.
* Solar-powered: Equipped with solar panels, these UAVs can potentially achieve extended flight times by harnessing solar energy, especially at high altitudes. Solar-powered UAVs may be particularly suited for long-endurance missions and environmental monitoring applications.
* Nuclear-powered: While nuclear power has been explored for larger aircraft, its application in UAVs remains largely theoretical due to safety concerns and regulatory challenges. Research in this area is ongoing but faces significant hurdles before practical implementation.
* Hydrogen fuel cell: An emerging technology, hydrogen fuel cells offer the potential for longer flight times with zero emissions, though the technology is still developing for widespread UAV use. The high energy density of hydrogen makes it a promising option for future UAV propulsion systems.

==History==



===Early drones===
The earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for warfighting occurred in July 1849, with a balloon carrier (the precursor to the aircraft carrier) in the first offensive use of air power in naval aviation. Austrian forces besieging Venice attempted to launch some 200 incendiary balloons at the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from the Austrian ship . At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship &quot;Vulcano&quot;.

The Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a radio-based control-system called the &quot;Telekino&quot; at the Paris Academy of Science in 1903, as a way of testing airships without risking human life.

Significant development of drones started in the 1900s, and originally focused on providing practice targets for training military personnel. The earliest attempt at a powered UAV was A. M. Low&#x27;s &quot;Aerial Target&quot; in 1916. Low confirmed that Geoffrey de Havilland&#x27;s monoplane was the one that flew under control on 21 March 1917 using his radio system. Following this successful demonstration in the spring of 1917 Low was transferred to develop aircraft controlled fast motor launches D.C.B.s with the Royal Navy in 1918 intended to attack shipping and port installations and he also assisted Wing Commander Brock in preparations for the Zeebrugge Raid. Other British unmanned developments followed, leading to the fleet of over 400 de Havilland 82 Queen Bee aerial targets that went into service in 1935.

Nikola Tesla described a fleet of uncrewed aerial combat vehicles in 1915. These developments also inspired the construction of the Kettering Bug by Charles Kettering from Dayton, Ohio and the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane â initially meant as an uncrewed plane that would carry an explosive payload to a predetermined target. Development continued during World War I, when the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company invented a pilotless aerial torpedo that would explode at a preset time.

The film star and model-airplane enthusiast Reginald Denny developed the first scaled remote piloted vehicle in 1935.

Soviet researchers experimented with controlling Tupolev TB-1 bombers remotely in the late 1930s.

===World War II===
In 1940, Denny started the Radioplane Company and more models emerged during World War II used both to train antiaircraft gunners and to fly attack-missions. Nazi Germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war, like the Argus As 292 and the V-1 flying bomb with a jet engine. Fascist Italy developed a specialised drone version of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 flown by remote control, although the Armistice with Italy was enacted prior to any operational deployment.

===Postwar period===
After World War II development continued in vehicles such as the American JB-4 (using television/radio-command guidance), the Australian GAF Jindivik and Teledyne Ryan Firebee I of 1951, while companies like Beechcraft offered their Model 1001 for the U.S. Navy in 1955. Nevertheless, they were little more than remote-controlled airplanes until the Vietnam War. In 1959, the U.S. Air Force, concerned about losing pilots over hostile territory, began planning for the use of uncrewed aircraft. Planning intensified after the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 in 1960. Within days, a highly classified UAV program started under the code name of &quot;Red Wagon&quot;. The August 1964 clash in the Tonkin Gulf between naval units of the U.S. and the North Vietnamese Navy initiated America&#x27;s highly classified UAVs (Ryan Model 147, Ryan AQM-91 Firefly, Lockheed D-21) into their first combat missions of the Vietnam War. When the Chinese government showed photographs of downed U.S. UAVs via &quot;Wide World Photos&quot;, the official U.S. response was &quot;no comment&quot;.

During the War of Attrition (1967â1970) in the Middle East, Israeli intelligence tested the first tactical UAVs installed with reconnaissance cameras, which successfully returned photos from across the Suez Canal. This was the first time that tactical UAVs that could be launched and landed on any short runway (unlike the heavier jet-based UAVs) were developed and tested in battle.

In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used UAVs as decoys to spur opposing forces into wasting expensive anti-aircraft missiles. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, a few key people from the team that developed this early UAV joined a small startup company that aimed to develop UAVs into a commercial product, eventually purchased by Tadiran and leading to the development of the first Israeli UAV.

In 1973, the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been using UAVs in Southeast Asia (Vietnam). Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were missing or captured. The USAF 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew about 3,435 UAV missions during the war at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF General George S. Brown, Commander, Air Force Systems Command, in 1972, &quot;The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don&#x27;t want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit.&quot; Later that year, General John C. Meyer, Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command, stated, &quot;we let the drone do the high-risk flyingÂ ... the loss rate is high, but we are willing to risk more of themÂ ...they save lives!&quot;

During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile-batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets. As a result, Israel developed the IAI Scout as the first UAV with real-time surveillance. The images and radar decoys provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed. In Israel in 1987, UAVs were first used as proof-of-concept of super-agility, post-stall controlled flight in combat-flight simulations that involved tailless, stealth-technology-based, three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight-control, and jet-steering.

===Modern UAVs===

With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. The U.S. funded the Counterterrorism Center (CTC) within the CIA, which sought to fight terrorism with the aid of modernized drone technology. In the 1990s, the U.S. DoD gave a contract to AAI Corporation along with Israeli company Malat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed jointly. Many of these UAVs saw service in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs demonstrated the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting-machines, deployable without risk to aircrews. Initial generations primarily involved surveillance aircraft, but some carried armaments, such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, that launched AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles.

CAPECON, a European Union project to develop UAVs, ran from 1 May 2002 to 31 December 2005.

, the United States Air Force (USAF) employed 7,494 UAVs almost one in three USAF aircraft. The Central Intelligence Agency also operated UAVs. By 2013 at least 50 countries used UAVs. China, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Turkey, and others designed and built their own varieties. The use of drones has continued to increase. Due to their wide proliferation, no comprehensive list of UAV systems exists.

The development of smart technologies and improved electrical-power systems led to a parallel increase in the use of drones for consumer and general aviation activities. , quadcopter drones exemplify the widespread popularity of hobby radio-controlled aircraft and toys, but the use of UAVs in commercial and general aviation is limited by a lack of autonomy and by new regulatory environments which require line-of-sight contact with the pilot.

In 2020, a Kargu 2 drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya, according to a report from the UN Security Council&#x27;s Panel of Experts on Libya, published in March 2021. This may have been the first time an autonomous killer-robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings.

Superior drone technology, specifically the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, played a role in Azerbaijan&#x27;s successes in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war against Armenia.

UAVs are also used in NASA missions. The &quot;Ingenuity&quot; helicopter is an autonomous UAV that operated on Mars from 2021 to 2024. the Dragonfly spacecraft is being developed, and is aiming to reach and examine Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Its primary goal is to roam around the surface, expanding the amount of area to be researched previously seen by landers. As a UAV, Dragonfly allows examination of potentially diverse types of soil. The drone is set to launch in 2027, and is estimated to take seven more years to reach the Saturnian system.

Miniaturization is also supporting the development of small UAVs which can be used as individual system or in a fleet offering the possibility to survey large areas, in a relatively small amount of time.

According to data from GlobalData, the global military uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) market, which forms a significant part of the UAV industry, is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% over the next decade. This represents a near doubling in market size, from $12.5 billion in 2024 to an estimated $20 billion by 2034.

==Design==
Crewed and uncrewed aircraft of the same type generally have recognizably similar physical components. The main exceptions are the cockpit and environmental control system or life support systems. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result, can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.

Small civilian UAVs have no life-critical systems, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the quadcopter design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.

Control systems for UAVs are often different from crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. Autopilot software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.

===Aircraft configuration===
UAVs can be designed in different configurations than manned aircraft both because there is no need for a cockpit and its windows, and there is no need to optimize for human comfort, although some UAVs are adapted from piloted examples, or are designed for optionally piloted modes. Air safety is also less of a critical requirement for unmanned aircraft, allowing the designer greater freedom to experiment. Instead, UAVs are typically designed around their onboard payloads and their ground equipment. These factors have led to a great variety of airframe and motor configurations in UAVs.

For conventional flight the flying wing and blended wing body offer light weight combined with low drag and stealth, and are popular configurations for many use cases. Larger types which carry a variable payload are more likely to feature a distinct fuselage with a tail for stability, control and trim, although the wing configurations in use vary widely.

For uses that require vertical flight or hovering, the tailless quadcopter requires a relatively simple control system and is common for smaller UAVs. Multirotor designs with 6 or more rotors is more common with larger UAVs, where redundancy is prioritized.

===Propulsion===

Traditional internal combustion and jet engines remain in use for drones requiring long range. However, for shorter-range missions electric power has almost entirely taken over. The distance record for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill &quot;in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel&quot; holds this record.

Besides the traditional piston engine, the Wankel rotary engine is used by some drones. This type offers high power output for lower weight, with quieter and more vibration-free running. Claims have also been made for improved reliability and greater range.

Small drones mostly use lithium-polymer batteries (Li-Po), while some larger vehicles have adopted the hydrogen fuel cell. The energy density of modern Li-Po batteries is far less than gasoline or hydrogen. However electric motors are cheaper, lighter and quieter. Complex multi-engine, multi-propeller installations are under development with the goal of improving aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency. For such complex power installations, battery elimination circuitry (BEC) may be used to centralize power distribution and minimize heating, under the control of a microcontroller unit (MCU).

=== Ornithopters â wing propulsion ===
Flapping-wing ornithopters, imitating birds or insects, have been flown as microUAVs. Their inherent stealth recommends them for spy missions.

Sub-1g microUAVs inspired by flies, albeit using a power tether, have been able to &quot;land&quot; on vertical surfaces. Other projects mimic the flight of beetles and other insects.

==Computer control systems==

UAV computing capability followed the advances of computing technology, beginning with analog controls and evolving into microcontrollers, then system-on-a-chip (SOC) and single-board computers (SBC).

Modern system hardware for UAV control is often called the flight controller (FC), flight controller board (FCB) or autopilot. Common UAV-systems control hardware typically incorporate a primary microprocessor, a secondary or failsafe processor, and sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and barometers into a single module.

In 2024 EASA agreed on the first certification basis for a UAV flight controller in compliance with the ETSO-C198 for Embention&#x27;s autopilot. The certification of the UAV flight control systems aims to facilitate the integration of UAVs within the airspace and the operation of drones in critical areas.

===Architecture===
====Sensors====
Position and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state. Exteroceptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements, while exproprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states.

Non-cooperative sensors are able to detect targets autonomously so they are used for separation assurance and collision avoidance.

Degrees of freedom (DOF) refers to both the amount and quality of onboard sensors: 6 DOF implies 3-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers (a typical inertial measurement unit IMU), 9 DOF refers to an IMU plus a compass, 10 DOF adds a barometer and 11 DOF usually adds a GPS receiver.

In addition to the navigation sensors, the UAV (or UAS) can be also equipped with monitoring devices such as: RGB, multispectral, hyper-spectral cameras or LiDAR, which may allow providing specific measurements or observations.

====Actuators====
UAV actuators include digital electronic speed controllers (which control the RPM of the motors) linked to motors/engines and propellers, servomotors (for planes and helicopters mostly), weapons, payload actuators, LEDs and speakers.

====Software====
Modern UAVs run a software stack that ranges from low-level firmware that directly controls actuators, to high level flight planning. At the lowest level, firmware directly controls reading from sensors such as an IMU and commanding actuators such as motors. Control software (often referred to as an autopilot) is responsible for computing actuator speeds given desired vehicle velocity. Due to its direct interaction with hardware, this software is time-critical and may run on microcontrollers. This software may also handle radio communications, in the case of UAVs that are not autonomous. One popular example is the PX4 autopilot.

At the next level, autonomy algorithms compute the desired velocity given higher level goals. For example, trajectory optimization may be used to calculate a flight trajectory given a desired goal location. This software is not necessarily time-critical, and can often run on a single board computer running an operating system such as Linux with relaxed time constraints.

====Loop principles====

UAVs employ open-loop, closed-loop or hybrid control architectures.

* Open loop This type provides a positive control signal (faster, slower, left, right, up, down) without incorporating feedback from sensor data.
* Closed loop This type incorporates sensor feedback to adjust behavior (reduce speed to reflect tailwind, move to altitude 300 feet). The PID controller is common. Sometimes, feedforward is employed, transferring the need to close the loop further.

====Communications====
UAVs use a radio for control and exchange of video and other data. Early UAVs had only narrowband uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&amp;C) and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator.

In most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having separate links for C&amp;C, telemetry and video traffic, a broadband link is used to carry all types of data. These broadband links can leverage quality of service techniques and carry TCP/IP traffic that can be routed over the internet.

The radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:

* Ground control â a human operating a radio transmitter/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the original meaning of a military ground control station (GCS). 
* Remote network system, such as satellite duplex data links for some military powers. Downstream digital video over mobile networks has also entered consumer markets, while direct UAV control uplink over the cellular mesh and LTE have been demonstrated and are in trials.
* Another aircraft, serving as a relay or mobile control station military manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T).

Modern networking standards have explicitly considered drones and therefore include optimizations. The 5G standard has mandated reduced user plane latency to 1ms while using ultra-reliable and low-latency communications.

UAV-to-UAV coordination supported by Remote ID communication technology. Remote ID messages (containing the UAV coordinates) are broadcast and can be used for collision-free navigation.

=== Autonomy ===
The level of autonomy in UAVs varies widely. UAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations, such as:

* Self-level: attitude stabilization on the pitch and roll axes.
* Altitude hold: The aircraft maintains its altitude using barometric pressure and/or GPS data. 
* Hover/position hold: Keep level pitch and roll, stable yaw heading and altitude while maintaining position using GNSS or inertial sensors.
* Headless mode: Pitch control relative to the position of the pilot rather than relative to the vehicle&#x27;s axes. 
* Care-free: automatic roll and yaw control while moving horizontally
* Takeoff and landing (using a variety of aircraft or ground-based sensors and systems; see also &quot;autoland&quot;)
* Failsafe: automatic landing or return-to-home upon loss of control signal
* Return-to-home: Fly back to the point of takeoff (often gaining altitude first to avoid possible intervening obstructions such as trees or buildings).
* Follow-me: Maintain relative position to a moving pilot or other object using GNSS, image recognition or homing beacon.
* GPS waypoint navigation: Using GNSS to navigate to an intermediate location on a travel path.
* Orbit around an object: Similar to Follow-me but continuously circle a target.
* Pre-programmed aerobatics (such as rolls and loops)
* Pre-programmed delivery (delivery drones)

One approach to quantifying autonomous capabilities is based on OODA terminology, as suggested by a 2002 US Air Force Research Laboratory report, and used in the table on the right.
Full autonomy is available for specific tasks, such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching.

Other functions available or under development include; collective flight, real-time collision avoidance, wall following, corridor centring, simultaneous localization and mapping and swarming, cognitive radio, and machine learning. In this context, computer vision can play an important role for automatically ensuring flight safety.

== Performance considerations ==

===Flight envelope===
UAVs can be programmed to perform aggressive maneuvers or landing/perching on inclined surfaces, and then to climb toward better communication spots. Some UAVs can control flight with varying flight modelisation, such as VTOL designs.

UAVs can also implement perching on a flat vertical surface.

===Endurance===
UAV endurance is not constrained by the physiological capabilities of a human pilot.

Because of their small size, low weight, low vibration and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines are used in many large UAVs. Their engine rotors cannot seize; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched fuel mixture for cooling at high power. These attributes reduce fuel usage, increasing range or payload.

Proper drone cooling is essential for long-term drone endurance. Overheating and subsequent engine failure is the most common cause of drone failure.

Hydrogen fuel cells, using hydrogen power, may be able to extend the endurance of small UAVs, up to several hours.

Micro air vehicles endurance is so far best achieved with flapping-wing UAVs, followed by planes and multirotors standing last, due to lower Reynolds number.

Solar-electric UAVs, a concept originally championed by the AstroFlight Sunrise in 1974, have achieved flight times of several weeks.

Solar-powered atmospheric satellites (&quot;atmosats&quot;) designed for operating at altitudes exceeding 20Â km (12 miles, or 60,000 feet) for as long as five years could potentially perform duties more economically and with more versatility than low Earth orbit satellites. Likely applications include weather drones for weather monitoring, disaster recovery, Earth imaging and communications.

Electric UAVs powered by microwave power transmission or laser power beaming are other potential endurance solutions.

Another application for a high endurance UAV would be to &quot;stare&quot; at a battlefield for a long interval (ARGUS-IS, Gorgon Stare, Integrated Sensor Is Structure) to record events that could then be played backwards to track battlefield activities.

The delicacy of the British PHASA-35 military drone (at a late stage of development) is such that traversing the first turbulent twelve miles of atmosphere is a hazardous endeavor. It has, however, remained on station at 65,000 feet for 24 hours. Airbus&#x27; Zephyr in 2023 has attained 70,000 feet and flown for 64 days; 200 days aimed at. This is sufficiently close enough to near-space for them to be regarded in &quot;pseudo-satellites&quot; as regards to their operational capabilities.

===Reliability===
Reliability improvements target all aspects of UAV systems, using resilience engineering and fault tolerance techniques.

Individual reliability covers robustness of flight controllers, to ensure safety without excessive redundancy to minimize cost and weight. Besides, dynamic assessment of flight envelope allows damage-resilient UAVs, using non-linear analysis with ad hoc designed loops or neural networks. UAV software liability is bending toward the design and certifications of crewed avionics software.

Swarm resilience involves maintaining operational capabilities and reconfiguring tasks given unit failures.

==Applications==
In recent years, autonomous drones have begun to transform various application areas as they can fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) while maximizing production, reducing costs and risks, ensuring site safety, security and regulatory compliance, and protecting the human workforce in times of a pandemic. They can also be used for consumer-related missions like package delivery, as demonstrated by Amazon Prime Air, and critical deliveries of health supplies.

There are numerous civilian, commercial, military, and aerospace applications for UAVs. These include:

;General: Recreation, disaster relief, archeology, conservation of biodiversity and habitat, law enforcement, crime, and terrorism. 
;Commercial: Aerial surveillance, filmmaking, journalism, scientific research, surveying, cargo transport, mining, manufacturing, forestry, solar farming, thermal energy, ports and agriculture.

=== Warfare ===

As of 2020, seventeen countries have armed UAVs, and more than 100 countries use UAVs in a military capacity. The first five countries producing domestic UAV designs are the United States, China, Israel, Iran and Turkey. Top military UAV manufactures are including General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Baykar, TAI, IAIO, CASC and CAIG. China has established and expanded its presence in military UAV market since 2010. In the early 2020s, Turkey also established and expanded its presence in the military UAV market.

In the early 2010s, Israeli companies mainly focused on small surveillance UAV systems, and by the number of drones, Israel exported 60.7% (2014) of UAVs on the market while the United States exported 23.9% (2014). Between 2010 and 2014, there were 439 drones exchanged compared to 322 in the five years previous to that, among these only small fraction of overall trade â just 11 (2.5%) of the 439 are armed drones. The US alone operated over 9,000 military UAVs in 2014; among them more than 7000 are RQ-11 Raven miniature UAVs. Since 2010, Chinese drone companies have begun to export large quantities of drones to the global military market. Of the 18 countries that are known to have received military drones between 2010 and 2019, the top 12 all purchased their drones from China. The shift accelerated in the 2020s due to China&#x27;s advancement in drone technologies and manufacturing, compounded by market demand from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza conflict.

For intelligence and reconnaissance missions, the inherent stealth of micro UAV flapping-wing ornithopters, imitating birds or insects, offers potential for covert surveillance and makes them difficult targets to bring down.

Unmanned surveillance and reconnaissance aerial vehicle are used for reconnaissance, attack, demining, and target practice.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine a dramatic increase in UAV development took place with Ukraine creating the Brave1 platform to promote rapid development of innovative systems.

=== Civil applications ===

The civilian (commercial and general) drone market is dominated by Chinese companies. Chinese manufacturer DJI alone had 74% of the civil market share in 2018, with no other company accounting for more than 5%. The companies continue to hold over 70% of global market share by 2023, despite under increasing scrutinies and sanctions from the United States. The US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones in 2020, while the Justice Department prohibited the use of federal funds for the purchase of DJI and other foreign-made UAVs. 
DJI is followed by American company 3D Robotics, Chinese company Yuneec, Autel Robotics, and French company Parrot.

As of May 2021, 873,576 UAVs had been registered with the US FAA, of which 42% were categorized as commercial and 58% as recreational. 2018 NPD point to consumers increasingly purchasing drones with more advanced features with 33 percent growth in both the $500+ and $1000+ market segments.

The civil UAV market is relatively new compared to the military one. Companies are emerging in both developed and developing nations at the same time. Many early-stage startups have received support and funding from investors, as is the case in the United States, and from government agencies, as is the case in India. Some universities offer research and training programs or degrees. Private entities also provide online and in-person training programs for both recreational and commercial UAV use.

Consumer drones are widely used by police and military organizations worldwide because of the cost-effective nature of consumer products. Since 2018, the Israeli military have used DJI UAVs for light reconnaissance missions. DJI drones have been used by Chinese police in Xinjiang since 2017 and American police departments nationwide since 2018. Both Ukraine and Russia used commercial DJI drones extensively during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These civilian DJI drones were sourced by governments, hobbyists, international donations to Ukraine and Russia to support each side on the battlefield, and were often flown by drone hobbyists recruited by the armed forces. The prevalence of DJI drones was attributable to their market dominance, affordability, high performance, and reliability.

==== Entertainment ====

Drones are also used in nighttime displays for artistic and advertising purposes with the main benefits are that they are safer, quieter and better for the environment than fireworks. They can replace or be an adjunct for fireworks displays to reduce the financial burden of festivals. In addition they can complement fireworks due to the ability for drones to carry them, creating new forms of artwork in the process.

Drones can also be used for racing, either with or without VR functionality.

==== Aerial photography ====

Drones are ideally suited to capturing aerial shots in photography and cinematography, and are widely used for this purpose. Small drones avoid the need for precise coordination between pilot and cameraman, with the same person taking on both roles. Big drones with professional cine cameras usually have a drone pilot and a camera operator who controls camera angle and lens. For example, the AERIGON cinema drone, used in film production, is operated by two people. Drones provide access to dangerous, remote or otherwise inaccessible sites.

==== Environmental monitoring ====

UASs or UAVs offer the great advantage for environmental monitoring to generate a new generation of survey at very-high or ultra-high resolution both in space and time. This gives the opportunity to bridge the existing gap between satellite data and field monitoring. This has stimulated a huge number of activities in order to enhance the description of natural and agricultural ecosystems. Most common applications are:

*Topographic surveys for the production of orthomosaics, digital surface models and 3D models;
*Monitoring of natural ecosystems for biodiversity monitoring, habitat mapping, detection of invasive alien species and study of ecosystem degradation due to invasive species or disturbances;
*Precision agriculture which exploits all available technologies including UAV in order to produce more with less (e.g., optimisation of fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation);
*River monitoring several methods have been developed to perform flow monitoring using image velocimetry methods which allow to properly describe the 2D flow velocity fields.
*Structural integrity of any type of structure whether it be a dam, railway or other dangerous, inaccessible or massive locations for building monitoring.
*Mineral detection for acid mine drainage using UAVs and hyperspectral cameras can produce detailed maps of proxy minerals (e.g. goethite, jarosite) for certain pH-values in natural, mining and post-mining environments, such as remediated sites.

These activities can be completed with different measurements, such as photogrammetry, thermography, multispectral images, 3D field scanning, and normalized difference vegetation index maps.

==== Geological hazards ====
UAVs have become a widely used tool for studying geohazards such as landslides. Various sensors, including radar, optical, and thermal, can be mounted on UAVs to monitor different properties. UAVs enable the capture of images of various landslide features, such as transverse, radial, and longitudinal cracks, ridges, scarps, and surfaces of rupture, even in inaccessible areas of the sliding mass. Moreover, processing the optical images captured by UAVs also allows for the creation of point clouds and 3D models, from which these properties can be derived. Comparing point clouds obtained at different times allows for the detection of changes caused by landslide deformation.

==== Mineral exploration ====
UAVs may help in the discovery of new or reevaluation of known mineral deposits to meet the demand for raw materials such as critical raw metals (e.g. cobalt, nickel), rare earths and battery minerals. By employing a suite of sensors (e.g. spectral imaging, Lidar, magnetics, gamma-ray spectroscopy), and similar to those used in environmental monitoring, UAV-based data can produce maps of geological surface and subsurface features, contributing to more efficient and targeted mineral exploration.

==== Agriculture, forestry and environmental studies====
As global demand for food production grows exponentially, resources are depleted, farmland is reduced, and agricultural labor is increasingly in short supply, there is an urgent need for more convenient and smarter agricultural solutions than traditional methods, and the agricultural drone and robotics industry is expected to make progress. Agricultural drones have been used to help build sustainable agriculture all over the world leading to a new generation of agriculture. In this context, there is a proliferation of innovations in both tools and methodologies which allow precise description of vegetation state and also may help to precisely distribute nutrients, pesticides or seeds over a field.

The use of UAVs is also being investigated to help detect and fight wildfires, whether through observation or launching pyrotechnic devices to start backfires.

UAVs are also now widely used to survey wildlife such as nesting seabirds, seals and even wombat burrows.

==== Law enforcement ====

Police can use drones for applications such as search and rescue and traffic monitoring.

==== Humanitarian aid ====

Drones are increasingly finding their application in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, where they are used for a wide range of applications such as delivering food, medicine and essential items to remote areas or image mapping before and following disasters.

== Safety and security ==


===Threats===
==== Nuisance ====
UAVs can threaten airspace security in numerous ways, including unintentional collisions or other interference with other aircraft, deliberate attacks or by distracting pilots or flight controllers. The first incident of a drone-airplane collision occurred in mid-October 2017 in Quebec City, Canada. The first recorded instance of a drone collision with a hot air balloon occurred on 10 August 2018 in Driggs, Idaho, United States; although there was no significant damage to the balloon nor any injuries to its 3 occupants, the balloon pilot reported the incident to the National Transportation Safety Board, stating that &quot;I hope this incident helps create a conversation of respect for nature, the airspace, and rules and regulations&quot;. Unauthorized UAV flights into or near major airports have prompted extended shutdowns of commercial flights.

Drones caused significant disruption at Gatwick Airport during December 2018, needing the deployment of the British Army.

In the United States, flying close to a wildfire is punishable by a maximum $25,000 fine. Nonetheless, in 2014 and 2015, firefighting air support in California was hindered on several occasions, including at the Lake Fire and the North Fire. In response, California legislators introduced a bill that would allow firefighters to disable UAVs which invaded restricted airspace. The FAA later required registration of most UAVs.

==== Security vulnerabilities ====
By 2017, drones were being used to drop contraband into prisons.

The interest in UAVs cybersecurity has been raised greatly after the Predator UAV video stream hijacking incident in 2009, where Islamic militants used cheap, off-the-shelf equipment to stream video feeds from a UAV. Another risk is the possibility of hijacking or jamming a UAV in flight. Several security researchers have made public some vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs, in some cases even providing full source code or tools to reproduce their attacks. At a workshop on UAVs and privacy in October 2016, researchers from the Federal Trade Commission showed they were able to hack into three different consumer quadcopters and noted that UAV manufacturers can make their UAVs more secure by the basic security measures of encrypting the Wi-Fi signal and adding password protection.

==== Aggression ====
Many UAVs have been loaded with dangerous payloads, and/or crashed into targets. Payloads have included or could include explosives, chemical, radiological or biological hazards. UAVs with generally non-lethal payloads could possibly be hacked and put to malicious purposes. Counter-UAV systems (C-UAS), from detection to electronic warfare to UAVs designed to destroy other UAVs, are in development and being deployed by states to counter this threat.

Such developments have occurred despite the difficulties. As J. Rogers stated in a 2017 interview to A&amp;T, &quot;There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor&quot;.

===Countermeasures===
==== Counter unmanned air system ====


The malicious use of UAVs has led to the development of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies. Automatic tracking and detection of UAVs from commercial cameras have become accurate thanks to the development of deep learning based machine learning algorithms. It is also possible to automatically identify UAVs across different cameras with different viewpoints and hardware specification with re-identification methods. Commercial systems such as the Aaronia AARTOS have been installed on major international airports. Once a UAV is detected, it can be countered with kinetic force (missiles, projectiles or another UAV) or by non-kinetic force (laser, microwaves, communications jamming). Anti-aircraft missile systems such as the Iron Dome are also being enhanced with C-UAS technologies. Utilising a smart UAV swarm to counter one or more hostile UAVs is also proposed.

=== Regulation ===

Regulatory bodies around the world are developing unmanned aircraft system traffic management solutions to better integrate UAVs into airspace.

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming increasingly regulated by the civil aviation authorities of individual countries. Regulatory regimes can differ significantly according to drone size and use. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) began exploring the use of drone technology as far back as 2005, which resulted in a 2011 report. France was among the first countries to set a national framework based on this report and larger aviation bodies such as the FAA and the EASA quickly followed suit. In 2021, the FAA published a rule requiring all commercially used UAVs and all UAVs regardless of intent weighing 250 g or more to participate in Remote ID, which makes drone locations, controller locations, and other information public from takeoff to shutdown; this rule has since been challenged in the pending federal lawsuit &quot;RaceDayQuads v. FAA&quot;.

==== EU Drone Certification - Class Identification Label ====
The implementation of the Class Identification Label serves a crucial purpose in the regulation and operation of drones. The label is a verification mechanism designed to confirm that drones within a specific class meet the rigorous standards set by administrations for design and manufacturing. These standards are necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of drones in various industries and applications.

By providing this assurance to customers, the Class Identification Label helps to increase confidence in drone technology and encourages wider adoption across industries. This, in turn, contributes to the growth and development of the drone industry and supports the integration of drones into society.

====Export controls====
The export of UAVs or technology capable of carrying a 500Â kg payload at least 300Â km is restricted in many countries by the Missile Technology Control Regime.

<text>Ender&#x27;s Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Set at an unspecified date in Earth&#x27;s future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with an insectoid alien species they dub &quot;the buggers&quot;. In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, Earth&#x27;s international military force recruits young children, including the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, to be trained as elite officers. The children learn military strategy and leadership by playing increasingly difficult war games, including some in zero gravity, where Ender&#x27;s tactical genius is revealed.

The book originated as a short story of the same name, published in the August 1977 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;. The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card wrote additional books in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series. Card released an updated version of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; in 1991, changing some political facts to account for the then-recent dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The novel has been translated into 34 languages. In the movie adaptation and novels after the original sequels, &quot;buggers&quot; are referred to as &quot;Formics&quot;.

Reception of the book has been largely positive. It has become suggested reading for military organizations such as the United States Marine Corps. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was recognized as &quot;best novel&quot; by the 1985 Nebula Award and the 1986 Hugo Award in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four sequelsâ&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; (1986), &quot;Xenocide&quot; (1991), &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; (1996)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; (2008)&quot;â&quot;follow Ender&#x27;s subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella &quot;A War of Gifts&quot; (2007) and novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1999), plus other novels in the &quot;Shadow&quot; saga, take place during the same time period as the original.

A film adaptation of the same name, written for the screen and directed by Gavin Hood, and starring Asa Butterfield as Ender, was released in October 2013. Card co-produced the film. The novel has also been adapted into two comic book series.

== Synopsis ==

War breaks out between humans and an insect-like alien race referred to as &quot;buggers&quot;. The humans are able to repel the First and Second Invasions by narrow margins. Earth&#x27;s space military force is the International Fleet (I.F.), which trains gifted children to become commanders at their orbiting Battle School.

Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin is born a &quot;Third&quot;: a rare exception to Earth&#x27;s two-child policy, allowed by the government due to the promise and high intellect displayed by his two older siblings. The eldest, Peter, is a sociopath who bullies Ender. His sister, Valentine, is deeply empathic. The I.F. removed Ender&#x27;s monitoring device when he was six years old, seemingly ending his chances of Battle School. He is taunted and pushed around by his classmates, lead by Stilson. Ender viciously retaliates against Stilson. Ender is disturbed that he, through his actions, is becoming more like his brother Peter. Unbeknownst to Ender, Stilson later dies from his wounds. Colonel Hyrum Graff visits Ender after hearing about the fight. Ender attests that by showing superiority now, he has prevented future struggle. Graff offers him a place in the Battle School.

Once at Battle School, Graff and the other leaders covertly work to keep Ender isolated. Ender finds solace in playing a simulated adventure game that involves being killed by and eventually killing a giant. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the competition with novel tactics. To further wear Ender down, he is promoted to command a new army composed of new recruits, then pitted against multiple armies at once, but Ender&#x27;s success continues. Ender&#x27;s jealous ex-commander, Bonzo Madrid, draws him into a fight outside the simulation, and once again seeking to preemptively stop future conflicts, Ender uses excessive force, and Bonzo dies from his injuries without Ender being notified.

Meanwhile on Earth, Peter Wiggin uses a global communication system to post political essays under the pseudonym &quot;Locke&quot;, hoping to establish himself as a respected orator and then as a powerful politician. Valentine, despite not trusting Peter, agrees to publish alongside him as &quot;Demosthenes&quot;. Their essays are soon taken seriously by the government and the people.

Ender, now ten years old, is promoted to Command School. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to Mazer Rackham, a hero from the First and Second Invasions who saw key patterns in the bugger behavior. Ender participates in space combat simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the fighting becomes harder, he is joined by some of his friends from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Ender grows depressed by the battles, his isolation, and the way Mazer treats him.

For his final test, under observation by I.F.&#x27;s commanders, Ender finds his fleet far outnumbered by bugger ships surrounding their homeworld. He sacrifices his entire fleet to fire a Molecular Disruption Device at the planet. The Device destroys the planet and paralyzes the surrounding bugger fleet. The commanders cheer and celebrate. Mazer informs Ender that the &quot;simulations&quot; were real battles, directing human spacecraft against bugger fleets via an ansible and that Ender has won the war. Ender realizes that he has committed genocide and become just like Peter, additionally learning about the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo.

Ender and Valentine join a group of space colonists. On their new planet, Ender becomes the colony&#x27;s governor. He discovers a structure that matches the simulation of the giant game from Battle School and inside finds the dormant egg of a queen. The bugger queen telepathically communicates to Ender that before the First Invasion, they had assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late. Instead, she had reached out to Ender to draw him here and requested that he take the egg to a new planet for the buggers to colonize.

Ender takes the egg and, with information from the queen, writes &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; under the alias &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;. Peter, now the leader of Earth and 77 with heart failure, recognizes Ender as the author of &quot;The Hive Queen&quot;. He asks Ender to write a book about him, which Ender titles &quot;The Hegemon&quot;. The combined works create a new type of funeral, in which the Speaker for the Dead tells the whole and unapologetic story of the deceased, adopted by many on Earth and its colonies. Ender and Valentine leave the colony and travel to other worlds, looking for a safe place to establish the unborn Hive Queen.

== Creation and inspiration ==
The original &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; is a short story published in 1977 that conveys Ender&#x27;s experiences in Battle and Command School, training, and application of his talents.

At the age of 16, Card conceived of the &#x27;Battle Room&#x27; for zero gravity war game training, considering the common failure of WWII trainee pilots to think in three dimensions, and stories from his older brother about various good and bad aspects of his military training experiences. In a commentary track for the 20th anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author&#x27;s Definitive Edition, Card stated that &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was written to establish the character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, the outline for which he had written before novelizing &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. Additionally, in the post-script of the 20th anniversary audiobook edition, Card mentions that he named Ender so that he could have a name that sounded like &quot;endgame&quot; from chess. In his 1991 introduction to the novel, Card discussed the influence of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Foundation series on the novelette and novel. Historian Bruce Catton&#x27;s work on the American Civil War also influenced Card.

&quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was the first science-fiction novel published entirely online, when it appeared on Delphi a year before print publication.

== Critical response ==
&quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; won the Nebula Award for best novel in 1985, and the Hugo Award for best novel in 1986, considered the two most prestigious awards in science fiction. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was also nominated for a Locus Award in 1986. In 1999, it placed No.Â 59 on the reader&#x27;s list of Modern Library 100 Best Novels. It was also honored with a spot on American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Books for Teens&quot;. In 2008, the novel, along with &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, won the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which honors an author and specific works by that author for lifetime contribution to young adult literature. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was included in Damien Broderick&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels 1985â2010&quot;. It ranked number nine on Locus&#x27;s top SF novels published before 1990.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Gerald Jonas asserts that the novel&#x27;s plot summary resembles a &quot;grade Z, made-for-television, science-fiction rip-off movie&quot;, but says that Card develops the elements well despite this &quot;unpromising material&quot;. Jonas further praises the development of the character Ender Wiggin: &quot;Alternately likable and insufferable, he is a convincing little Napoleon in short pants.&quot;

The novel has received criticism for its portrayal of violence and its justification. Elaine Radford&#x27;s review, &quot;Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman&quot;, posits that Ender Wiggin is an intentional reference by Card to Adolf Hitler and criticizes the violence in the novel, particularly at the hands of the protagonist. Card responded to Radford&#x27;s criticisms in &quot;Fantasy Review&quot;, the same publication. Radford&#x27;s criticisms are echoed in John Kessel&#x27;s essay &quot;Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender&#x27;s Game, Intention, and Morality&quot;, wherein Kessel states: &quot;Ender gets to strike out at his enemies and still remain morally clean. &quot;Nothing&quot; is his fault.&quot; Noah Berlatsky makes similar claims in his analysis of the relationship between colonization and science fiction, where he describes &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; as in part a justification of &quot;Western expansion and genocide&quot;. However, more recently, science fiction scholar Mike Ryder has refuted the claims of Kessel and Radford, arguing that Ender is exploited by powers beyond his control.

The U.S. Marine Corps Professional Reading List makes the novel recommended reading at several lower ranks, and again at Officer Candidate/Midshipman.
The book was placed on the reading list by Captain John F. Schmitt, author of FMFM-1 (Fleet Marine Force Manual, on maneuver doctrine) for &quot;provid[ing] useful allegories to explain why militaries do what they do in a particularly effective shorthand way&quot;.
In introducing the novel for use in leadership training, Marine Corps University&#x27;s Lejeune program opines that it offers &quot;lessons in training methodology, leadership, and ethics as well. . . . &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; has been a stalwart item on the Marine Corps Reading List since its inception&quot;. It is also used as an early fictional example of game-based learning.

== Accolades ==

The weeks ending June 9, August 11, September 1, September 8, October 27, November 3, November 10, and November 24, 2013, the novel was No.Â 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Best Sellers List of Paperback Mass-Market Fiction.

== Revisions ==
In 1991, Card made several minor changes to reflect the political climates of the time, including the decline of the Soviet Union. In the afterword of &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; (2008), Card stated that many of the details in chapter 15 of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; were modified for use in the subsequent novels and short stories. In order to more closely match the other material, Card has rewritten chapter 15 and plans to offer a revised edition of the book.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===

After several years of speculation on the possibility, Summit Entertainment financed and coordinated the development of a film in 2011, serving as its distributor. Gavin Hood directed the film, which lasts 1 hour and 54 minutes. Filming began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 27, 2012, and was released on November 1, 2013 (USA). A movie preview trailer was released in May 2013 and a second trailer was released later that year.

Card has called &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; &quot;unfilmable&quot;, &quot;because everything takes place in Ender&#x27;s head&quot;, and refused to sign a film deal unless he could ensure that the film was &quot;true to the story&quot;. Of the film that he eventually agreed to, Card said it was &quot;the best that good people could do with a story they really cared about and believed in&quot;, and while warning fans not to expect a completely faithful adaptation, called the film &quot;damn good&quot;.

The movie starred Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin and Harrison Ford as Colonel Hyrum Graff. It grossed $125 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics.

=== Video game ===
In 2008, it was announced an Ender&#x27;s Game video game was in the works. It was to be known as &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game: Battle Room&quot; and was a planned digitally distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Shadow Complex&quot;. Chair had sold the licensing of &quot;Empire&quot; to Card, which became a bestselling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe and that it would have focused on the Battle Room.

In December 2010, it was announced that the video game development had stopped and the project put on indefinite hold.

Orson Scott Card and Amaze Entertainment also came to an agreement regarding a video game adaption of the novel but nothing ever materialized.

=== Comics ===

Marvel Comics and Orson Scott Card announced on April 19, 2008, that they would be publishing a limited series adaptation of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; as the first in a comic series that would adapt all of Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; novels. Card was quoted as saying that it is the first step in moving the story to a visual medium. The first five-issue series, titled &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game: Battle School&quot;, was written by Christopher Yost, while the second five-issue series, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow: Battle School&quot;, was written by Mike Carey.

=== Audioplay ===
&quot;Ender&#x27;s Game Alive: The Full Cast Audioplay&quot;, is a 2013 audio drama written by Orson Scott Card, based on the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; novel. At over seven hours in length, this retelling of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; hints at storylines from &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pest&quot;, &quot;The Polish Boy&quot;, &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot;, &quot;Shadows in Flight&quot;, &quot;Earth Unaware&quot;, and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, and gives new insight into the beginnings of Ender&#x27;s philotic connection with the Hive Queen. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game Alive&quot; is directed by Gabrielle de Cuir, produced by Stefan Rudnicki at Skyboat Media, published by Audible.com, and performed by a cast of over 30 voice actors playing over 100 roles.

Audible also commissioned a German-language adaptation of the same script. Titled &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game/Das grosse Spiel - Das ungekÃ¼rzte HÃ¶rspiel&quot; (&quot;The unabridged audio drama&quot;), this adaptation was produced by &quot;Lauscherlounge&quot;, directed by Balthasar von Weymarn and performed by a cast of 100 different voice actors including children.

<text>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (RRHOF), also simply referred to as the Rock Hall, is a museum and hall of fame located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States, on the shore of Lake Erie. The museum documents the history of rock music and the artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures and personnel who have influenced its development.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Ahmet Ertegun, founder and chairman of Atlantic Records. After a long search for the right city, Cleveland was chosen in 1986 as the Hall of Fame&#x27;s permanent home. Architect I. M. Pei designed the new museum, and it was dedicated on September 1, 1995.

== Foundation ==
The RRHOF Foundation was established in 1983 by Ahmet Ertegun, who assembled a team that included publisher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine Jann S. Wenner; record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods; and attorneys Allen Grubman and Suzan Evans. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of rock pioneer Bill Haley and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.

Cleveland lobbied for the museum, with civic leaders in Cleveland pledging $65 million in public money to fund the construction, and citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term &quot;rock and roll&quot; and heavily promoted the new genre, and that Cleveland was the location of Freed&#x27;s Moondog Coronation Ball, which is often credited as the first major rock and roll concert. Freed was also a member of the hall of fame&#x27;s inaugural class of inductees in 1986. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush, among many others.

During early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation&#x27;s board considered a site along the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium. At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. Pei initially planned the tower to be high, but was forced to reduce it to due to the structure&#x27;s proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building&#x27;s base is approximately .

== Building ==
The groundbreaking ceremony for the building took place on June 7, 1993, with Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, and Billy Joel in attendance.

The museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night, an all-star concert was held at Cleveland Stadium and featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.

In addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie. The exhibit space and inaugural exhibits were designed by Bruce Burdick&#x27;s San Francisco design firm The Burdick Group.

Since 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 28 times (1986â92, 1994â96, 1998â2008, 2010â11, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2023); three times in Los Angeles (1993, 2013 and 2022); and six times in the hall of fame&#x27;s home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2021). As of 2018, the induction ceremonies alternate each year between New York and Cleveland.

The 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicâprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland; the State of Ohio; the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations, and individuals. Collectively, these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies at Public Hall.

Millions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions, and tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in the events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.

In 2020, the Rock Hall announced plans to renovate and expand its footprint by a third. The architecture firm PAU, founded by Vishaan Chakrabarti, will lead the project.

===Layout===

The building contains seven levels. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum&#x27;s main gallery, which includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm &amp; blues and folk, country, and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London, Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, hip hop music, Cleveland&#x27;s rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes a theatre that features films on various subjects such as American Bandstand.

The first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafÃ©, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called &quot;Backstage Stories&quot;. The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips, and the evolution of audio technology.

Visitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes &quot;The Power of Rock Experience&quot;, which includes one of Jonathan Demme&#x27;s final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall&#x27;s induction ceremonies. Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.

Finally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, the Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Women Who Rock&quot;, and the Rolling Stones.

===Architecture===

Designed by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass &quot;tent&quot; that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.

The building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a cafÃ©.

&quot;In designing this building,&quot; Pei said, &quot;it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.&quot;

=== New York City Annex ===

In 2006, the RRHOF partnered with three entertainment production companies to create a branch museum in New York City. On November 18, 2008, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC opened in Manhattan&#x27;s SoHo district. Located at 76 Mercer Street just west of Broadway, the Annex occupied an underground space of . The branch museum operated in much the same way as its Cleveland parent, featuring archetypal display pieces like Prince&#x27;s coat from &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, David Byrne&#x27;s &quot;big suit&quot; from &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, and Elvis Presley&#x27;s motorcycle jacket and Bible. But from its start, the Annex also had a distinct New York area focus that made plenty of space for big items like the phone booth from CBGB, layered thick with band stickers over the decades; Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s own 1957 Chevrolet; a special gallery reserved for the city&#x27;s musicians; and an intricate scale model of Manhattan highlighting sites of rock history.

Jann Wenner served as chairman of the board of the Annex. At its opening night gala, he inadvertently created a controversy after he told a reporter, &quot;One of the small sad things is we didn&#x27;t do it in New York in the first place.&quot; He later expressed regret for his remark, which he said had been misconstrued and clarified that &quot;I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.&quot;

The Annex closed on January 3, 2010, its quick demise reportedly due to the global financial crisis of 2007â2008 and a subsequent downturn in the city&#x27;s tourism. The museum&#x27;s final major exhibition was about John Lennon and his years in New York City.

==Exhibits and features==
Since 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.

The museum&#x27;s first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called &quot;I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965â1969&quot; and included memorabilia from numerous artists including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as items related to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and 1969&#x27;s Woodstock.

That exhibit was followed by &quot;Elvis Is in the Building&quot;, which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first exhibit devoted to a single artist: Elvis Presley, the &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot; and the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute that spanned Elvis&#x27; life and legendary career. Next, the museum curated &quot;Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story&quot;, which was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by &quot;Rock Style&quot;, an exhibit that focused on both rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, Ray Charles to David Bowie, and Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, &quot;Rock Style&quot; traveled to other museums in the U.S.

Other temporary exhibits have included &quot;Lennon: His Life and Work&quot;, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003, followed by &quot;In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2&quot; and &quot;Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection&quot;. A major exhibition titled &quot;Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics&quot; was on display during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

Other large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (&quot;Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash&quot;), the Doors (&quot;Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors&quot;), the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (&quot;Tommy: The Amazing Journey&quot;), and Bruce Springsteen (&quot;From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen&quot;). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (&quot;Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power&quot;). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. A major temporary exhibit in 2017 told the story and impact of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock&#x27;s 40th and 50th anniversaries, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Motown&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, John Mellencamp, and Geddy Lee&#x27;s basses.

The museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Linda McCartney, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford, and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.
Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month by hosting concerts, film screenings, and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.

Another program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum&#x27;s Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl &quot;DMC&quot; McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Martha Reeves, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, Dennis Edwards of the Temptations, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.

A similar program is the Legends Series, whose only real difference from the Hall of Fame Series program is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year, the museum celebrates one of the Hall&#x27;s inductees with a week-long series of programs that includes interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artistsâfrom Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.

The American Music Masters series began in 1996 with &quot;Hard Travelin&#x27;: The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger&quot;. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008), Janis Joplin (2009), Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011), Chuck Berry (2012), The Everly Brothers (2014), and Johnny Cash (2017). In 2019, the concert series&#x27;s format was retooled, and the event was renamed the Rock Hall Honors, in which the honored performer is joined in concert by guests of their choice. The first Rock Hall Honors concert, featuring Mavis Staples, was performed in Cleveland in September 2019.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame won the 2020 Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for Cultural Institution in the category Web.

=== List of &quot;The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; ===

Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with &quot;the museum&#x27;s curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts&quot;, created an unordered list of &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995. It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; (in particular Roy Acuff&#x27;s 1936 version), written and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as &quot;The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s &quot;Crazy&quot; and My Chemical Romance&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot;, which were both released in 2006. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.

===25th anniversary concert===

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009, at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours, with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.

==Inductees==

Artists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years.

Generally, the number of inductees each year ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are usually presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee&#x27;s music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances by both the inductees and the presenters. , there were 338 inductees.

The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences; John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award; and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.

===Performers===
A nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the &quot;Performers&quot; category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly 500 experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists&#x27; contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. Block approval voting is used, with those nominees who receive the most votes being inducted, subject to a minimum of 50% approval. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.

In 2012, six additional groupsâthe Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Cricketsâwere inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. &quot;There was a lot of discussion about this,&quot; said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. &quot;There had always been conversations about why the groups weren&#x27;t included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question â it was so long ago ... We decided we&#x27;d sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.&quot;

===Early Influences===
Early Influences includes artists from earlier erasâprimarily country, folk, jazz, and bluesâwhose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny &amp; The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musician Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson&#x27;s career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the &quot;rock era&quot;.

===Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement===
Formerly the &quot;Non-Performers&quot; award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters, and music journalists. Following the death of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.

===Award for Musical Excellence===
Formerly the &quot;Sidemen&quot; award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the &quot;Award for Musical Excellence&quot; in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, &quot;This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.&quot;

==Library and archives==

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s Library and Archives is the world&#x27;s most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The library and archives are located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland&#x27;s Campus District.

The library and archives&#x27; mission is to collect, preserve, and provide access to these materials. The library and archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library to read books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians, and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.

The library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals, and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings; and research databases.

The archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.

==Criticism and controversy==
One of the most common criticisms of the hall of fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a small number of individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founders Jann Wenner and Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than public opinion as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that &quot;at one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren&#x27;t enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a &#x27;name&#x27; artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in &#x27;70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren&#x27;t in today.&quot; Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often regarded as the godmother of rock and roll, but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the hall of fame as the &quot;Hall of Lame&quot; despite the band being inducted a few years prior to the remark.

There was also criticism of the opacity in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:

With fame and money at stake, it&#x27;s no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders, and committee members say they want to keep it that way

The chairman of the nominating committee, Jon Landau, confirmed: &quot;We&#x27;ve done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.&quot;

According to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures have also been ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all. The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres. According to author Brett Milano in 2007, &quot;entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, &#x27;60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music&quot;. At the time of Milano&#x27;s comment, Pink Floyd were the only progressive rock band in the hall, although bands such as Genesis, Rush, Yes, and the Moody Blues have since been inducted. In 2022, Steven Hyden, a music critic for &quot;Uproxx&quot; and a hall voter, wrote that he believed the hall had been ignoring alternative rock and indie rock artists. Hyden said that none of the 13 influential American bands from the 1980s profiled in Michael Azerrad&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; had been inducted, and wrote &quot;How in the hell can you tell the story of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll without including a single one of them?&quot; 

Some critics have pointed out a bias in favor of American and British acts, while Canadian rock bands, such as the Guess Who, are often ignored, with Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Rush, and the Band being the only Canadian acts in the hall. Mexican journalist Miguel GÃ¡lvez noted that no artist that performed exclusively in Spanish had ever been inducted into the hall, and advocated for the induction of artists from Latin America, including the Argentine rock band Soda Stereo.

Another criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In one fifteen-year span, ninety-seven artists were inducted, averaging between six and seven inductees per year. A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted, although the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped. The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (twelve in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.

Members of the British punk rock band the Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum &quot;a piss stain&quot; and &quot;urine in wine&quot;. In 2018, when British rock band Dire Straits were inducted, bandleader Mark Knopfler did not attend the ceremony and offered no official explanation, leaving bassist John Illsley to say: &quot;He just didn&#x27;t feel like coming, it&#x27;s as simple as that. It just didn&#x27;t appeal to him, and I appealed to him on several occasions.&quot; In response to Oasis&#x27; nomination for the Class of 2024, Liam Gallagher disparaged the hall on X, declaring that &quot;there&#x27;s something very fishy about those awards&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s all a load of bollox &quot;, and referring to its members as &quot;bumbaclarts&quot;. When Oasis was nominated for the second year in a row in 2025, Gallagher stated that the Hall of Fame is for &quot;wankers&quot;.
In BBC Radio 6 Music&#x27;s Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, &quot;Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth&#x27;s part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.&quot; In 2014, the percentage of female inductees was 8.5%. Courtney Love made similar criticisms of the hall in 2023, highlighting the length of time it had taken to induct artists such as Kate Bush, Nina Simone, Carole King, Linda Ronstadt, and &quot;most egregiously&quot;, Tina Turner as a solo artist, as well as the failure to induct Chaka Khan despite seven nominations. Following Donna Summer&#x27;s death in 2012, Elton John had criticized the hall for failing to induct her during her lifetime, calling it &quot;a total disgrace, especially when I see the second-rate talent that has been inducted.&quot;

Steve Miller, a 2016 inductee, directed a litany of complaints at the hall, both during his induction speech and especially in interviews after it. His criticisms included that there is a general lack of female inductees, there is not enough support by the hall for music education, and inductees are treated poorly at the award ceremony. At the same ceremony, Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen commented on the hall&#x27;s ticket policy for inductees and their families as unnecessarily expensive, a sentiment echoed by Miller.

In 2018, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden called the hall &quot;an utter and complete load of bollocks ... run by a bunch of sanctimonious bloody Americans who wouldn&#x27;t know rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll if it hit them in the face&quot;. Dickinson has also expressed an overall distaste for the hall&#x27;s entity, arguing that &quot;if you put [music] in a museum, then it&#x27;s dead&quot;. Iron Maiden had been eligible for induction since 2004. Hard rock and heavy metal website &quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot; observed how it had taken 15 years for Kiss to be inducted (eligible since 1999; inducted in 2014) and 23 years for Deep Purple (eligible since 1993; inducted in 2016). Regarding his band&#x27;s non-induction into the hall, Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill stated in a 2019 interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t think they like heavy metal music in general.&quot;

Fans of the Dave Matthews Band criticized the 2020 inductions because the band was not part of the class, despite them topping the fan vote. The band was inducted in 2024.

===The Dave Clark Five===
On March 14, 2007, two days after that year&#x27;s induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article that claimed the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say that Jann Wenner availed himself of a technicality on the day votes were due in. In reality, the Dave Clark Five received six more votes than Grandmaster Flash, but Wenner thought &quot;we couldn&#x27;t go another year without a rap act&quot;.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation responded: &quot;There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.&quot; The Dave Clark Five were subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.

===The Monkees===
In a Facebook post, Monkees member Michael Nesmith stated that he did not know if the Monkees belonged in the Hall of Fame because he could see the impact of the Monkees only from the inside and went on to say: &quot;I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner&#x27;s pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.&quot;

Some magazines and news outletsâsuch as &quot;Time&quot;, NPR radio, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, Yahoo! Music, and MSNBCâhave argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===Dolly Parton===
Country singer-songwriter Dolly Parton was announced as a nominee for the 2022 hall of fame ballot in February 2022. Parton requested to be removed from the ballot in March 2022, after the ballots had been sent to voters. In a statement, Parton wrote: &quot;Even though I am extremely flattered and grateful to be nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, I don&#x27;t feel that I have earned that right. I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out.&quot; The hall replied days later that she would remain on the ballot, in part because the ballots for the 2022 class had already been sent to voters. 

Although Parton had asked to be removed from the ballot because she did not think of herself as a rock artist, the hall responded that &quot;From its inception, rock and roll has had deep roots in rhythm &amp; blues and country music. It is not defined by any one genre, rather a sound that moves youth culture. Dolly Parton&#x27;s music impacted a generation of young fans and influenced countless artists that followed. Her nomination to be considered for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame followed the same process as all other artists who have been considered.&quot; In April 2022, Parton told &quot;Morning Edition&quot; that she would accept her induction if she were selected. Parton was announced as a 2022 inductee on May 4.

<doc id="58903" wikidata="Q214469" url="?curid=58903" title="Cloud forest">
<text>A cloud forest, also called a water forest, primas forest, or tropical montane cloud forest, is a generally tropical or subtropical, evergreen, montane, moist forest characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover, usually at the canopy level, formally described in the &quot;International Cloud Atlas&quot; (2017) as silvagenitus. Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests. Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.

Cloud forests are among the most biodiversity-rich ecosystems in the world, with a large number of species directly or indirectly depending on them.

Other moss forests include black spruce/feathermoss climax forest, with a moderately dense canopy and a forest floor of feathermosses, including &quot;Hylocomium splendens&quot;, &quot;Pleurozium schreberi&quot;, and &quot;Ptilium crista-castrensis&quot;. These weft-form mosses grow in boreal moss forests.

== Climate ==

The presence of cloud forests is dependent on local climate (which is affected by the distance to the sea), the exposition and the latitude (typically from 25Â°N to 25Â°S), and the elevation (which varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level). Typically, there is a relatively small band of elevation in which the atmospheric environment is suitable for cloud forest development. This is characterized by persistent fog at the vegetation level, resulting in the reduction of direct sunlight and thus of evapotranspiration. Within cloud forests, much of the moisture available to plants arrives in the form of fog drip, where fog condenses on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below.

Annual rainfall can range from 500 to 10,000Â mm/year and mean temperature between 8 and 20 Â°C (46.4 and 68Â Â°F).

While cloud forest today is the most widely used term, in some regions, these ecosystems or special types of cloud forests are called mossy forest, elfin forest, montane thicket, and dwarf cloud forest.

The definition of cloud forest can be ambiguous, with many countries not using the term (preferring such terms as Afromontane forest and upper montane rain forest, montane laurel forest, or more localised terms such as the Bolivian &quot;yungas&quot;, and the &quot;laurisilva&quot; of the Atlantic Islands), and occasionally subtropical and even temperate forests in which similar meteorological conditions occur are considered to be cloud forests.

== Characteristics ==
In comparison with lower-altitude tropical moist forests, cloud forests show a reduced tree stature combined with increased stem density and generally, a lower diversity of woody plants. Trees in these regions are generally shorter and more heavily stemmed than in lower-altitude forests in the same regions, often with gnarled trunks and branches, forming dense, compact crowns. Their leaves become smaller, thicker and harder with increasing altitude. The high moisture promotes the development of a high biomass and biodiversity of epiphyte, particularly bryophytes, lichens, ferns (including filmy ferns), bromeliads and orchids. The number of endemic plants can be very high.

An important feature of cloud forests is the tree crowns that intercept the wind-driven cloud moisture, part of which drips to the ground. This fog drip occurs when water droplets from the fog adhere to the needles or leaves of trees or other objects, coalesce into larger drops and then drop to the ground. It can be an important contribution to the hydrologic cycle.

Cloud forests are often peatlands, showcasing many classic peatland attributes. Due to the high water content of the soil, the reduced solar radiation and the low rates of decomposition and mineralization, the soil acidity is very high, with more humus and peat often forming the upper soil layer.

StadtmÃ¼ller (1987) distinguishes two general types of tropical montane cloud forests:
* Areas with a high annual precipitation due to a frequent cloud cover in combination with heavy and sometimes persistent orographic rainfall; such forests have a perceptible canopy strata, a high number of epiphytes, and a thick peat layer which has a high storage capacity for water and controls the runoff;
* In drier areas with mainly seasonal rainfall, cloud stripping can amount to a large proportion of the moisture available to plants.

==Distribution of tropical montane cloud forests==

Only 1% of the global woodland consists of cloud forests. They were estimated to be 11% of all tropical forests in the 1970s. A total of around 736 cloud forest sites have been identified in 59 countries by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, with 327 of them legally protected areas as of 2002. Important areas of cloud forest are in Central and South America (mainly Costa Rica, Venezuela, Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia), East and Central Africa, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, and in the Caribbean.

The 1997 version of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre&#x27;s database of cloud forests found a total of 605 tropical montane cloud forest sites in 41 countries. 280 sites, or 46% of the total, were located in Latin America, known in biogeography as the Neotropical realm. Twelve countries had tropical montane cloud forest sites, with the majority in Venezuela (64 sites), Mexico (64), Ecuador (35) and Colombia (28). Southeast Asia and Australasia had 228 sites in 14 countries â 66 in Indonesia, 54 in Malaysia, 33 in Sri Lanka, 32 in the Philippines, and 28 in Papua New Guinea. 97 sites were recorded in 21 African countries, mostly scattered on isolated mountains. Of the 605 sites, 264 were in protected areas.

== Conservation status ==
Cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection. 

== Temperate cloud forests ==
Although far from being universally accepted as true cloud forests, several forests in temperate regions have strong similarities with tropical cloud forests. The term is further confused by occasional reference to cloud forests in tropical countries as &quot;temperate&quot; due to the cooler climate associated with these misty forests.

=== Distribution of temperate cloud forests ===
*Argentina â Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca and TucumÃ¡n (Southern Andean Yungas)
*Australia â Lamington National Park, Springbrook National Park, Mount Bartle Frere and Mount Bellenden Ker (Queensland) and Mount Gower (Lord Howe Island)

*People&#x27;s Republic of China â Yunnan Plateau, mountains of southern and eastern China
*Costa Rica â Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. 10,500 Hectares of Cloud Forest. There are 2500 plant species (most species of orchids in a single place on earth), 100 species of mammals, 400 species of birds, 120 species of reptiles, and thousands of insects. 
*Ethiopia â Harenna Forest, Bale Mountains National Park and Kafa Biosphere Reserve in South West Ethiopia Peoples&#x27; Region
*Fiji Islands - Tropical Montane cloud forests of Taveuni [Ash, J., 1987. Stunted cloud-forest in Taveuni, Fiji.], Gau Island [Keppel, G. and Thomas, N.T., 2009. Composition and structure of the cloud forest on Mt Delaco, Gau, Fiji. The South Pacific Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences, 27(1), pp.28-34.]

*Peru â Bosques Nublados de Udima Wildlife Refuge (Cloud Forests of Udima) 
*Portugal â Azores and Madeira (often refers to the wetter, higher altitude expanse of &quot;laurisilva&quot;)
*Spain â Canary Islands (&quot;laurisilva&quot;) and very locally in Los Llanos del Juncal (Alcornocales Natural Park) in the Province of CÃ¡diz.
*Sri Lanka - Upper slopes of the Knuckles Mountain Range, Matale.
*Taiwan â Yuanyang Lake Nature Reserve, Chatianshan Nature Reserve, and Fuxing District in Taoyuan
*United States â Pacific Northwest and in the Southern Appalachians.

== Importance ==

* Watershed function: Because of the cloud-stripping strategy, the effective rainfall can be doubled in dry seasons and increase the wet season rainfall by about 10%. Experiments of Costin and Wimbush (1961) showed that the tree canopies of non-cloud forests intercept and evaporate 20 percent more of the precipitation than cloud forests, which means a loss to the land component of the hydrological cycle.
* Vegetation: Tropical montane cloud forests are not as species-rich as tropical lowland forests, but they provide the habitats for many species found nowhere else. For example, the Cerro de la Neblina, a cloud-covered mountain in the south of Venezuela, accommodates many shrubs, orchids, and insectivorous plants which are restricted to this mountain only.
* Fauna: The endemism in animals is also very high. In Peru, more than one-third of the 270 endemic birds, mammals, and frogs are found in cloud forests. One of the best-known cloud forest mammals is the spectacled bear (&quot;Tremarctos ornatus&quot;). Many of those endemic animals have important functions, such as seed dispersal and forest dynamics in these ecosystems.

== Current situation ==

In 1970, the original extent of cloud forests on the Earth was around 50 million hectares. Population growth, poverty and uncontrolled land use have contributed to the loss of cloud forests. The 1990 Global Forest Survey found that 1.1% of tropical mountain and highland forests were lost each year, which was higher than in any other tropical forests. In Colombia, one of the countries with the largest area of cloud forests, only 10â20% of the initial cloud forest cover remains. Significant areas have been converted to plantations, or for use in agriculture and pasture. Significant crops in montane forest zones include tea and coffee, and the logging of unique species causes changes to the forest structure.

In 2004, an estimated one-third of all cloud forests on the planet were protected at that time.

== Impact of climate change ==
Because of their delicate dependency on local climates, cloud forests will be strongly affected by global climate change. Results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70 years. A number of climate models suggest low-altitude cloudiness will be reduced, which means the optimum climate for many cloud forest habitats will increase in altitude. Linked to the reduction of cloud moisture immersion and increasing temperature, the hydrological cycle will change, so the system will dry out. This would lead to the wilting and the death of epiphytes, which rely on high humidity. Frogs and lizards are expected to suffer from increased drought. Calculations suggest the loss of cloud forest in Mexico would lead to extinction of up to 37 vertebrates specific to that region. In addition, climate changes can result in a higher number of hurricanes, which may increase damage to tropical montane cloud forests. All in all, the results of climate change will be a loss in biodiversity, altitude shifts in species ranges and community reshuffling, and, in some areas, complete loss of cloud forests.

== In botanical gardens ==
Cloud-forest conditions are hard and expensive to replicate in a glasshouse because it is necessary to maintain very high humidity. Day temperatures have to be between 70-75F while night temperatures have to be maintained between 55-60F. In most cases, sophisticated refrigeration equipment has to be used to provide night temperatures below 60F. Such displays are usually quite small, but there are some notable exceptions. In the United States, the Atlanta Botanical Garden has a large tropical cloud forest greenhouse with a large collection of cloud forest epiphytes from around the world. It implements a refrigeration system to decrease the temperature at night. For many years, the Singapore Botanic Gardens had a so-called coolhouse. The Gardens by the Bay features a coolhouse that is simply named &quot;Cloud Forest&quot;. The latter features a -high artificial mountain clad in epiphytes such as orchids, ferns, clubmosses, bromeliads and others. Due to a relatively mild climate and summer fog, the San Francisco Botanical Garden has three outdoor cloud forest collections, including a 2-acre Mesoamerican Cloud Forest established in 1985. The Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens contains a &quot;Panama Cloud Forest&quot; garden in House 11.

<doc id="58904" wikidata="Q721221" url="?curid=58904" title="Serpent symbolism">
<text>The serpent, or snake, is one of the oldest and most widespread mythological symbols. The word is derived from Latin &quot;serpens&quot;, a crawling animal or snake. Snakes have been associated with some of the oldest rituals known to humankind and represent dual expression of good and evil.

In some cultures, snakes were fertility symbols. For example, the Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew the fertility of Nature. During the dance, live snakes were handled, and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. &quot;The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops.&quot; To the Hopi, snakes symbolized the umbilical cord, joining all humans to Mother Earth. The Great Goddess often had snakes as her familiarsâsometimes twining around her sacred staff, as in ancient Creteâand they were worshiped as guardians of her mysteries of birth and regeneration.

==Evolutionary origins==
The anthropologist Lynne Isbell has argued that, as primates, the serpent as a symbol of death is built into our unconscious minds because of our evolutionary history. Isbell argues that for millions of years snakes were the only significant predators of primates, and that this explains why fear of snakes is one of the most common phobias worldwide and why the symbol of the serpent is so prevalent in world mythology; the serpent is an innate image of danger and death.

Furthermore, the psychoanalyst Joseph Lewis Henderson and the ethnologist Maude Oakes have argued that the serpent is a symbol of initiation and rebirth precisely because it is a symbol of death.

Using phylogenetical and statistical methods on related motifs from folklore and myth, French comparativist Julien d&#x27;Huy managed to reconstruct a possible archaic narrative about the serpent. In this Paleolithic &quot;ophidian&quot; myth, snakes are connected to rains and storms, and even to water sources. In regards to the latter, it blocks rivers and other water sources in exchange for human sacrifices and/or material good offerings.

==Values==

===Fertility and rebirth===
Historically, serpents and snakes represent fertility or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing. The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life.

In some Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire. According to some interpretations of the Midrash, the serpent represents sexual passion. In Hinduism, Kundalini is a dormant energy lying like a coiled serpent.

===Guardianship===

Serpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may be grounded in the observation that when threatened, some snakes (such as rattlesnakes or cobras) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm&#x27;s way.

At Angkor in Cambodia, numerous stone sculptures present hooded multi-headed nÄgas as guardians of temples or other premises. A favorite motif of Angkorean sculptors from approximately the 12th centuryÂ CE onward was that of the Buddha, sitting in the position of meditation, his weight supported by the coils of a multi-headed nÄga that also uses its flared hood to shield him from above. This motif recalls the story of the Buddha and the serpent king Mucalinda: as the Buddha sat beneath a tree engrossed in meditation, Mucalinda came up from the roots of the tree to shield the Buddha from a tempest that was just beginning to arise.

The Gadsden flag of the American Revolution depicts a rattlesnake coiled up and poised to strike. Below the image of the snake is the legend, &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me.&quot; The snake symbolized the dangerousness of colonists willing to fight for their rights and homeland, and was also symbolic of their separation from Europe, as it was an animal unique to America. The motif is repeated in the First Navy Jack of the US Navy.

===Venom and medicine===
Serpents are connected with venom and medicine. The snake&#x27;s venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi that have the power to either heal or provide expanded consciousness (and even the elixir of life and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge and entheogenic association, the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (close to the) divine. Its divine aspect combined with its habitat in the earth between the roots of plants made it an animal with chthonic properties connected to the afterlife and immortality. The deified Greek physician Asclepius, as god of medicine and healing, carried a staff with one serpent wrapped around it, which has become the symbol of modern medicine. Moses also had a replica of a serpent on a pole, the Nehushtan, mentioned in Numbers 21:8.

==Associated animals==
===Chthonic serpents and sacred trees===

In many myths, the chthonic serpent (sometimes a pair) lives in or is coiled around a Tree of Life situated in a divine garden. In the Genesis story of the Torah and biblical Old Testament, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is situated in the Garden of Eden together with the tree of life and the serpent. In Greek mythology, Ladon coiled around the tree in the garden of the Hesperides protecting the golden apples.
Similarly NÃ­Ã°hÃ¶ggr (Nidhogg Nagar), the dragon of Norse mythology, eats from the roots of the Yggdrasil, the World Tree.

Under yet another tree (the Bodhi Tree of Enlightenment), the Buddha sat in ecstatic meditation. When a storm arose, the mighty serpent king Mucalinda rose up from his place beneath the earth and enveloped the Buddha in seven coils for seven days, so as not to break his ecstatic state.

The Vision Serpent was a symbol of rebirth in Maya mythology, with origins going back to earlier Maya conceptions, lying at the center of the world as the Mayans conceived it. &quot;It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power.&quot;

Sometimes the Tree of Life is represented (in a combination with similar concepts such as the World Tree and Axis mundi or &quot;World Axis&quot;) by a staff such as those used by shamans. Examples of such staffs featuring coiled snakes in mythology are the caduceus of Hermes, the Rod of Asclepius, the Staff of Moses, and the papyrus reeds and deity poles entwined by a single serpent Wadjet, dating to earlier than 3000Â BCE. The oldest known representation of &quot;two&quot; snakes entwined around a rod is that of the Sumerian fertility god Ningizzida, who was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head, eventually becoming a god of healing and magic. It is the companion of Dumuzi (Tammuz), with whom it stood at the gate of heaven. In the Louvre, there is a famous green steatite vase carved for King Gudea of Lagash (dated variously 2200â2025Â BCE) with an inscription dedicated to Ningizzida. Ningizzida was the ancestor of Gilgamesh, who, according to the epic, dived to the bottom of the waters to retrieve the plant of life. But while he rested from his labor, a serpent came and ate the plant. The snake became immortal, and Gilgamesh was destined to die.
Ningizzida has been popularized in the 20th century by Raku Kei (Reiki, a.k.a. &quot;The Way of the Fire Dragon&quot;), where &quot;Nin Giz Zida&quot; is believed to be a fire serpent of Tibetan rather than Sumerian origin. &quot;Nin Giz Zida&quot; is another name for the ancient Hindu concept Kundalini, a Sanskrit word meaning either &quot;coiled up&quot; or &quot;coiling like a snake&quot;. &quot;Kundalini&quot; refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation leading to altered states of consciousness. There are a number of other translations of the term, usually emphasizing a more serpentine nature to the wordâe.g. &quot;serpent power&quot;. It has been suggested by Joseph Campbell that the symbol of snakes coiled around a staff is an ancient representation of Kundalini physiology. The staff represents the spinal column, with the snake(s) being energy channels. In the case of two coiled snakes, they usually cross each other seven times, a possible reference to the seven energy centers called chakras.

In Ancient Egypt, where the earliest written cultural records exist, the serpent appears from the beginning to the end of their mythology. Ra and Atum (&quot;he who completes or perfects&quot;) became the same god, &quot;Atum&quot;, the &quot;counter-Ra&quot;, associated with earth animals, including the serpent: Nehebkau (&quot;he who harnesses the souls&quot;) was the two-headed serpent deity who guarded the entrance to the underworld. He is often seen as the son of the snake goddess Renenutet. She often was confused with (and later was absorbed by) their primal snake goddess Wadjet, the Egyptian cobra, who from the earliest of records was the patron and protector of the country, all other deities, and the pharaohs. Hers is the first known oracle. She was depicted as the crown of Egypt, entwined around the staff of papyrus and the pole that indicated the status of all other deities, as well as having the all-seeing eye of wisdom and vengeance. She never lost her position in the Egyptian pantheon.

The image of the serpent as the embodiment of the wisdom transmitted by &quot;Sophia&quot; was an emblem used by gnosticism, especially those sects that the more orthodox characterized as &quot;Ophites&quot; (&quot;Serpent People&quot;). The chthonic serpent was one of the earth-animals associated with the cult of Mithras. The basilisk, the venomous &quot;king of serpents&quot; with the glance that kills, was hatched by a serpent, Pliny the Elder and others thought, from the egg of a cock.

Outside Eurasia, in Yoruba mythology, Oshunmare was another mythic regenerating serpent.

The Rainbow Serpent (also known as the Rainbow Snake) is a major mythological being for Aboriginal people across Australia, although the creation myths associated with it are best known from northern Australia. In Fiji, Ratumaibulu was a serpent god who ruled the underworld and made fruit trees bloom. In the Northern Flinders Ranges reigns the Arkaroo, a serpent who drank Lake Frome empty, refuges into the mountains, carving valleys and waterholes, earthquakes through snoring.

===Cosmic serpents===

The serpent, when forming a ring with its tail in its mouth, is a clear and widespread symbol of the &quot;All-in-All&quot;, the totality of existence, infinity and the cyclic nature of the cosmos. The most well known version of this is the Aegypto-Greek ourobouros. It is believed to have been inspired by the Milky Way, as some ancient texts refer to a serpent of light residing in the heavens. The Ancient Egyptians associated it with Wadjet, one of their oldest deities, as well as another aspect, Hathor. In Norse mythology the World Serpent (or Midgard serpent) known as JÃ¶rmungandr encircled the world in the ocean&#x27;s abyss biting its own tail.
In Hindu mythology Lord Vishnu is said to sleep while floating on the cosmic waters on the serpent Shesha. In the Puranas Shesha holds all the planets of the universe on his hoods and constantly sings the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Ananta-Shesha,&quot; which means &quot;Endless Shesha&quot;. In the Samudra manthan chapter of the Puranas, Shesha loosens Mount Mandara for it to be used as a churning rod by the Asuras and Devas to churn the ocean of milk in the heavens in order to make Soma (or Amrita), the divine elixir of immortality. As a churning rope another giant serpent called Vasuki is used.

In pre-Columbian Central America Quetzalcoatl was sometimes depicted as biting its own tail. The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess Coatlicue (&quot;the one with the skirt of serpents&quot;), also known as Cihuacoatl (&quot;The Lady of the serpent&quot;). Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s father was Mixcoatl (&quot;Cloud Serpent&quot;). He was identified with the Milky Way, the stars, and the heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.

The demigod Aidophedo of the West African Ashanti people is also a serpent biting its own tail. In Dahomey mythology of Benin in West Africa, the serpent that supports everything on its many coils was named Dan. In the Vodou of Benin and Haiti, Ayida-Weddo (a.k.a. Aida-Wedo, Aido Quedo, &quot;Rainbow-Serpent&quot;) is a spirit of fertility, rainbows and snakes, and a companion or wife to Dan, the father of all spirits. As Vodou was exported to Haiti through the slave trade, Dan became Danballah, Damballah or Damballah-Wedo. Because of his association with snakes, he is sometimes disguised as Moses, who carried a snake on his staff. He is also thought by many to be the same entity of Saint Patrick, known as a snake banisher.

The serpent Hydra is a star constellation representing either the serpent thrown angrily into the sky by Apollo or the Lernaean Hydra as defeated by Heracles for one of his Twelve Labors. The constellation Serpens represents a snake being tamed by Ophiuchus the snake-handler, another constellation. The most probable interpretation is that Ophiuchus represents the healer Asclepius.

===Dragons===
Occasionally, serpents and dragons are used interchangeably, having similar symbolic functions. The venom of the serpent is thought to have a fiery quality similar to a fire-breathing dragon. The Greek Ladon and the Norse NÃ­Ã°hÃ¶ggr (Nidhogg Nagar) are sometimes described as serpents and sometimes as dragons. In Germanic mythology, &quot;serpent&quot; (Old English: &quot;wyrm&quot;, Old High German: &quot;wurm&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;ormr&quot;) is used interchangeably with the Greek borrowing &quot;dragon&quot; (OE: &quot;draca&quot;, OHG: &quot;trahho&quot;, ON: &quot;dreki&quot;). In China and especially in Indochina, the Indian serpent nÄga was equated with the &quot;lÃ³ng&quot; or Chinese dragon. The Aztec and Toltec serpent god Quetzalcoatl also has dragon-like wings, like its equivalent in K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya mythology Q&#x27;uq&#x27;umatz (&quot;feathered serpent&quot;), which had previously existed since Classic Maya times as the deity named Kukulkan.

== Mythology and religion ==
===African mythology===
In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey, but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshipers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the &quot;danh-gbi&quot; kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. &quot;Danh-gbi&quot; has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils.

The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred.

In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the amaZulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.

===Ancient Near East===
In ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of IÅ¡taran, was represented as a serpent on &quot;kudurrus&quot;, or boundary stones. Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth centuryÂ BCE. The horned viper (&quot;Cerastes cerastes&quot;) appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity. A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian period until the Hellenistic period (323Â BCEâ31Â BCE). This creature, known in Akkadian as the &quot;muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u&quot;, meaning &quot;furious serpent&quot;, was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem. It seems to have originally been the attendant of the underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu&#x27;s son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.

Snake cults were well established in Canaanite religion in the Bronze Age, for archaeologists have uncovered serpent cult objects in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at Megiddo, one at Gezer, one in the &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; of the Area H temple at Hazor, and two at Shechem.

In the surrounding region, serpent cult objects figured in other cultures. A late Bronze Age Hittite shrine in northern Syria contained a bronze statue of a god holding a serpent in one hand and a staff in the other. In 6th-century Babylon, a pair of bronze serpents flanked each of the four doorways of the temple of Esagila. At the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s festival, the priest was to commission from a woodworker, a metalworker and a goldsmith two images, one of which &quot;shall hold in its left hand a snake of cedar, raising its right [hand] to the god Nabu&quot;. At the tell of Tepe Gawra, at least seventeen Early Bronze Age Assyrian bronze serpents were recovered.

====Bronze and Iron Age United Arab Emirates====

Significant finds of pottery, bronze-ware and even gold depictions of snakes have been made throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Bronze Age and Iron Age metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid has yielded probably the richest trove of such objects, although finds have been made bearing snake symbols in Bronze Age sites at Rumailah, Bithnah and Masafi. Most of the depictions of snakes are similar, with a consistent dotted decoration applied to them.

Although the widespread depiction of snakes in sites across the UAE is thought by archaeologists to have a religious purpose, this remains conjecture.

====Abrahamic Religions====

=====Jewish beliefs=====
In the Hebrew Bible the serpent in the Garden of Eden lured Eve with the promise of being like God, tempting her that despite God&#x27;s warning, death would not be the result, that God was withholding knowledge from her.

The staff of Moses transformed into a snake and then back into a staff (Exodus 4:2â4). The Book of Numbers 21:6â9 provides an origin for an archaic copper serpent, &quot;Nehushtan&quot;, by associating it with Moses. This copper snake according to the Biblical text is put on a pole and used for healing. Book of Numbers 21:9 &quot;And Moses made a snake of copper, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a snake had bitten any man, when he beheld the snake of brass, he lived.&quot;

When the reformer King Hezekiah came to the throne of Judah in the late 8th centuryÂ BCE, &quot;He removed the high places, broke the sacred pillars, smashed the idols, and broke into pieces the copper snake that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. ()

=====Christian beliefs=====

In the Gospel of John 3:14â15, Jesus makes direct comparison between the raising up of the Son of Man and the act of Moses in raising up the serpent as a sign, using it as a symbol associated with salvation: &quot;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life&quot;.

Christian Tradition also identifies Satan as a talking serpent in the Old Testament&#x27;s Garden of Eden who had tempted Eve with a fruit from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve, as well as her consort Adam, were then punished by YHWH for their disobedience to commandments outlined prior to this; had lifespan decreased, for women to suffer in birthing, as well as other torments.

=====Islamic beliefs=====

The serpent is a recurrent motif in Islamic thought, appearing in both sacred texts representing evil and works of art. The creature is often seen as a symbol of evil and punishment. The serpent is a complex figure in Islamic thought, appearing as both a symbol of evil and a figure of wisdom. Djinn, which are likewise figures of great potential mixed with danger, are also believed to appear in the form of snakes on occasion. 
The Arabian Flying Snakes, also known as Arabhar, are a part of Arabian folklore and are said to live near the Arabian Sea. These snakes are believed to have the ability to fly, and their name &quot;Arabhar&quot; means &quot;Arab snake.&quot;

The Islamic serpent generally follows in the tradition of earlier Abrahamic myths as a symbol for the seductive draw of wisdom. This symbolism is reflected in various stories and parables, such as the tale of the snake-catcher and the serpent from Rumi, which uses the serpent as a symbol for the sensual soul within human beings. Another story from Arabian mythology features the giant serpent Falak, which is said to live below the fish known as Bahamut and is mentioned in the One Thousand and One Nights as a dangerous monster. It is said that Falak only fears God&#x27;s greater power, which prevents it from consuming all of creation.

===Ancient Iran===

Serpents are sacred and powerful in the thought of prehistoric cultures of Iran, having been portrayed as patrons of fertility, water and wealth in the ancient objects of Iran. They seem to have been worshipped along with the fertility goddesses from the fourth to first millennia BC, when their presence as mighty patrons and source of life and of immortality is seen in the art of Tall-i Bakun, Chogha Mish, Tepe Sialk, Jiroft culture, Shahr-e Sukhteh, Shahdad, Elamite art, Luristan art, etc.

However, it seems that the symbolic concept of the serpent was corrupted in the cultures of the Iranian plateau over time by Western influence. In Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire, as he lured Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge in the Garden of Eden. As a result of such influence, Aryan religions call the serpents diabolic; Azhi Dahake in the Avesta is a scary serpent, and Zahhak in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is an infernal creature with two snakes on his shoulders. This replacement might be due to communication between the inhabitants of Iran and believers in Abrahamic religions, and beyond that the conversion of matriarchy into patriarchy as the social structure of Iranian plateau cultures.

===Chinese mythology===

In Chinese creationism mythology, NÃ¼wa is the mother goddess who created humans from clay. She is depicted as a half snake being.

===Greek mythology===

The Minoan Snake Goddess brandished a serpent in either hand, perhaps evoking her role as source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (&quot;Potnia Theron&quot;), with a leopard under each arm.

Serpents figured prominently in archaic Greek myths. According to some sources, Ophion (&quot;serpent&quot;, a.k.a. Ophioneus), ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Cronus and Rhea. The oracles of the Ancient Greeks were said to have been the continuation of the tradition begun with the worship of the Egyptian cobra goddess Wadjet.

Typhon, the enemy of the Olympian gods, is described as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.

Python was the earth-dragon of Delphi. She always was represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Python was the chthonic enemy of Apollo, who slew her and remade her former home his own oracle, the most famous in Classical Greece.
The Gorgons - Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa - were three monstrous sisters with sharp fangs and living, venomous snakes for hair, and whose origins predate the written myths of Greece and who were the protectors of the most ancient ritual secrets. The Gorgons wore a belt of two intertwined serpents in the same configuration of the caduceus. The Gorgon was placed at the center, highest point of one of the pediments on the Temple of Artemis at Corfu.

Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Coronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back to life with healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius&#x27;s care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius&#x27; death at the hands of Zeus illustrates man&#x27;s inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from the left side of the Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy &quot;Ion&quot; that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa&#x27;s serpents.

Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great and a princess of the primitive land of Epirus, had the reputation of a snake-handler, and it was in serpent form that Zeus was said to have fathered Alexander upon her. AeÃ«tes, the king of Colchis and father of the sorceress Medea, possessed the Golden Fleece. He guarded it with a massive serpent that never slept. Medea, who had fallen in love with Jason of the Argonauts, enchanted it to sleep so Jason could seize the Fleece. (See Lamia).

When not driven by horses, the chariot of the Greek sun god is described as being pulled by fiery draconic beings. The most notable instance of this is observed in the episode in which Medea is given her grandfather&#x27;s chariot, which is pulled by serpents through the sky.

In artwork snakes are occasionally associated with Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft.

===Hindu mythology===

&quot;Naga&quot; (Sanskrit: à¤¨à¤¾à¤) is the Sanskrit/PÄli word for a deity or class of entity or being, taking the form of a very large snake, found in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The &quot;naga&quot; primarily represents rebirth, death and mortality, due to its casting of its skin and being symbolically &quot;reborn&quot;.

Hindus associate the &quot;naga&quot; with the deities Shiva and Vishnu. Shesha is one of the two mounts of Vishnu, upon which the deity rests. Vasuki is a serpent coiled around the neck of Shiva. The snake represents freedom in Hindu mythology because they cannot be tamed. In Buddhism, the serpent Mucalinda is associated as the protector of Buddha. In Jainism, serpent is associated with the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha.

====Nagas of Indochina====
Serpents, or &quot;nÄgas&quot;, play a particularly important role in Khmer mythology. An origin myth explains the emergence of the name &quot;Cambodia&quot; as resulting from conquest of a naga princess by a Kambuja lord named Kaundinya: the descendants of their union are the Khmer people. George CÅdÃ¨s suggests the Cambodian myth is a basis for the Thai legend of &quot;Phra Daeng Nang Ai&quot;, in which a woman who has lived many previous lives in the region is reincarnated as a daughter of Phraya Khom (Thai for Cambodian) and causes the death of her companion in former lives who has been reincarnated as a prince of the Nagas. This leads to war between the &quot;spirits of the air&quot; and the Nagas: Nagas amok are rivers in spate, and the entire region is flooded. The Myth of the Toad King tells how introduction of Buddhist teachings led to war with the sky deity Phaya Thaen, and ended in a truce with nagas posted as guardians of entrances to temples.

===Native American mythology===
Some Native American tribes give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the Hopi of Arizona the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshiped in the Natchez Temple of the Sun, and the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl was a feathered serpent-god. In many Meso-American cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of Peru are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days, and in Chile the Mapuche made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.

A Horned Serpent is a popular image in Northern American natives&#x27; mythology.

In one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills one of the gods&#x27; cousins, so the god kills the serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the mountains and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The Mound Builders associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though we are unable to unravel the particular associations.

===Nordic mythology===

JÃ¶rmungandr, alternately referred to as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, is a sea serpent of Norse mythology, the middle child of Loki and the giantess AngrboÃ°a. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Odin took Loki&#x27;s three children, FenrisÃºlfr, Hel and JÃ¶rmungandr. He tossed JÃ¶rmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew so big that he was able to surround the Earth and grasp his own tail, and as a result he earned the alternate name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. JÃ¶rmungandr&#x27;s arch enemy is the god Thor.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Odin tells of eight serpents gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil: NidhÃ¶ggr, Gravvitnir, Moin, Goin, GrÃ¡bakr, GrafvÃ¶lluÃ°r, Svafnir and Ofnir.

==Folklore==
In folk and fairy tale traditions all over the world, the serpent and the snake appear as characters in several fairy tales, either a main character in animal fables and magic tales (&quot;MÃ¤rchen&quot;), or as the donor who grants the protagonist a special ability or impart him with some secret knowledge.

According to the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, the serpent can appear in this capacity in the following tale types:

* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 155, &quot;The Ungrateful Animal (Serpent) Returned to Captivity&quot;: a farmer rescues an animal (snake) from a trap (pit). Now free, the animal wants to eat (bite) its saviour, who tries to delay this fate. He consults with other creatures and finally to a trickster animal (fox or jackal). The trickster animal feigns innocence and wants to understand the origin of the problem, so the ungrateful animal goes back to the pit to demonstrate. The farmer leaves the animal trapped again. Example: &quot;The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal&quot;, Indian fable.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 411, &quot;The King and the Lamia (The Snake-Wife)&quot;: a man takes to wife a woman of mysterious background. A holy person (hermit, cleric, monk) sees through the deception and reveals the woman&#x27;s true nature as a serpent. This type would include &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot; (Chinese legend); &quot;MÃ©lusine&quot;, a French medieval legend.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 425, &quot;The Search for the Lost Husband&quot;, and subtypes: a maiden is betrothed to an animal bridegroom (a snake, dragon or serpent, in several variants), who comes at night to the bridal bed in human form. The maiden breaks a taboo and her enchanted husband disappears. She is forced to seek him. Example: &quot;The Green Serpent&quot;, French literary fairy tale; &quot;The Snake Prince&quot;, Indian fairy tale; &quot;The Enchanted Snake&quot;, Italian literary fairy tale; &quot;The Serpent Prince&quot;, Hungarian folktale.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 425M, &quot;The Snake as Bridegroom&quot;: a girl goes bathing and leaves her clothing by the shore. When she returns, a snake (grass snake) hides her clothing and will only return them if the girl agrees to marry it. She promises to marry the snake. Some time later, the grass snake comes to take its bride and bring her to its underwater (or underground) palace. This tale type seems to be restricted to the Baltic geographical area. Example: &quot;Egle the Queen of Serpents&quot;, a Lithuanian fairy tale.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 433B, &quot;King Lindworm&quot;: a childless queen gives birth to a boy in snake form. Years later, he wishes to marry, but either devours his brides on their wedding night or cannot find a woman brave enough to accept his serpentine form. The snake prince is disenchanted by a maiden who wears layers of clothing in their nuptial night to mirror his layers of snakeskin. Example: &quot;King Lindworm&quot;, a Danish fairy tale; &quot;The Dragon-Prince and the Stepmother&quot;, Turkish fairy tale.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 485, &quot;Borma Jarizhka&quot; or &quot;The City of Babylon&quot;: a tsar sends a brave knight to the city of Babylon to retrieve three symbols of royal power (a robe, a crown, a scepter). The city is surrounded by snakes and ruled by a princess with snake-like attributes.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 560, &quot;The Magic Ring&quot;: a poor man either buys or rescues four types of animals, a cat, a dog, a mouse and a snake. This snake is the son of the king of serpents. It takes the boy to its father&#x27;s court to reward him a wish-granting object (usually a magic stone or ring). Example: &quot;The Enchanted Watch&quot;, French fairy tale.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 612, &quot;The Three Snake-Leaves&quot;: a man kills a snake. Its mate brings three magical leaves to resurrect it. This inspires the man to find a similar herb to use on his deceased bride/wife.
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 672, &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Crown&quot;: a snake takes off its crown to bathe in the lake. The crown is stolen by a human, who discovers the crown can grant special abilities (most often, the knowledge of animal languages).
* Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index tale type ATU 673, &quot;The White Serpent&#x27;s Flesh&quot;: the main character learns the language of animals by eating the flesh of a white serpent. Example: &quot;The White Snake&quot;, German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm.

==Flags and heraldry==

Serpents or snakes appear on the flags or coats of arms of several entities.


===American Revolution===
In 1754 and again during the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin published the Join, or Die. cartoon in &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; to give a message of colonial unity. The cartoon shows a snake in eight pieces, each representing one or more of the Thirteen Colonies. It was based on a superstition that if a snake was cut in pieces and the pieces were put together before sunset, the snake would return to life.

Following the publication of &quot;Join, or Die&quot;, the rattlesnake became a symbol of the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin and other colonists considered the rattlesnake to represent independence and vigilance. Several flags of the American Revolution depict rattlesnakes. Two of the more notable flags with the rattlesnake imagery are the Gadsden flag and the First Navy Jack. The United States War Office, and its successor organizations the Department of War and Department of the Army, contain a rattlesnake in their emblems. 

==Modern symbolism==

===Modern medicine===
Snakes entwined the staffs both of Hermes (the caduceus) and of Asclepius, where a single snake entwined the rough staff. On Hermes&#x27; caduceus, the snakes were not merely duplicated for symmetry, they were paired opposites. (This motif is congruent with the phurba.) The wings at the head of the staff identified it as belonging to the winged messenger Hermes, the Roman Mercury, who was the god of magic, diplomacy and rhetoric, of inventions and discoveries, and the protector both of merchants and that allied occupation, to the mythographers&#x27; view, of thieves. It is however Hermes&#x27; role as psychopomp, the escort of newly deceased souls to the afterlife, that explains the origin of the snakes in the caduceus, since this was also the role of the Sumerian entwined serpent god Ningizzida, with whom Hermes has sometimes been equated.

In Late Antiquity, as the arcane study of alchemy developed, Mercury was understood to be the protector of those arts too and of arcane or occult &quot;Hermetic&quot; information in general. Chemistry and medicines linked the rod of Hermes with the staff of the healer Asclepius, which was wound with a serpent; it was conflated with Mercury&#x27;s rod, and the modern medical symbolâwhich should simply be the rod of Asclepiusâoften became Mercury&#x27;s wand of commerce. Another version is used in alchemy where the snake is crucified, known as Nicolas Flamel&#x27;s caduceus. Art historian Walter J. Friedlander, in &quot;The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine&quot; (1992), collected hundreds of examples of the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius and found that professional associations were just somewhat more likely to use the staff of Asclepius, while commercial organizations in the medical field were more likely to use the caduceus.

===Modern political propaganda===
Following the Christian context as a symbol for evil, serpents are sometimes featured in political propaganda. They were used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda. Snakes were also used to represent the evil side of drugs in such films as &quot;Narcotic&quot; and &quot;Narcotics: Pit of Despair&quot;. The Gadsden flag of the American Revolution continues to be used in modern political propaganda to connote libertarianism and anti-government sentiments.

===Automobiles===
The automobile brands AC Cobra, Ford Mustang Shelby, Zarooq Motors, Dodge Viper, and Alpha Romeo all feature snakes on their logos.

<doc id="58906" wikidata="Q9647" url="?curid=58906" title="Gland">
<text>A gland is a cell or an organ in an animal&#x27;s body that produces and secretes different substances that the organism needs, either into the bloodstream or into a body cavity or outer surface. A gland may also function to remove unwanted substances such as urine from the body.

There are two types of gland, each with a different method of secretion. Endocrine glands are ductless and secrete their products, hormones, directly into interstitial spaces to be taken up into the bloodstream. Exocrine glands secrete their products through a duct into a body cavity or outer surface.

Glands are mostly composed of epithelial tissue, and typically have a supporting framework of connective tissue, and a capsule.

==Structure==
===Development===
Every gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface. This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.

As growth proceeds, the column of cells may split or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another. One exception to this rule is the liver; this occurs when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.

Glands are classified according to their shape.
* If the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland.
* In the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumens variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar or saccular glands.

==Types of glands==
Glands are divided based on their function into two groups:

===Endocrine glands===

Endocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the bloodstream. The glands secrete their products through basal lamina into the bloodstream. Basal lamina typically can be seen as a layer around the glands to which more than a million tiny blood vessels are attached. These glands often secrete hormones which play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.

===Exocrine glands=== 

Exocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer or inner surface of the body, such as the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:
* Merocrine glands â cells secrete their substances by exocytosis. (e.g. mucous and serous glands; also called &quot;eccrine&quot;, e.g. major sweat glands of humans, goblet cells, salivary gland, tear gland and intestinal glands)
* Apocrine glands â a portion of the secreting cell&#x27;s body is lost during secretion. The term &quot;Apocrine gland&quot; is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands, however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion. (e.g. mammary gland, sweat gland of arm pit, pubic region, skin around anus, lips and nipples)
* Holocrine glands â the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances. (e.g. sebaceous glands: meibomian and zeis glands)

Exocrine glands can further be categorized by their product:
* Serous glands secrete a watery, often protein-rich, fluid-like product, e.g. sweat glands.
* Mucous glands secrete a viscous product, rich in carbohydrates (such as glycoproteins), e.g. goblet cells.
* Sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian glands.

==Clinical significance==
Adenosis is any disease of a gland. The diseased gland has abnormal formation or development of glandular tissue which is sometimes tumorous.

<doc id="58907" wikidata="Q512191" url="?curid=58907" title="Melodica">
<text>The melodica is a handheld free-reed instrument similar to a pump organ or harmonica. It features a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into a hole in the side of the instrument. The keyboard usually covers two or three octaves. Melodicas are small, lightweight, and portable, and many are designed for children to play. They are popular in music education programs, especially in Asia. The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the late 1950s, though similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century.

== Description ==
The mouthpiece can be a short rigid or semi-flexible plastic piece or a long flexible plastic tube (designed to allow the player to either hold the keyboard so the keys can be seen or lay the keyboard horizontally on a flat surface for two-handed playing). A foot pump can also be used as an alternative to breathing into the instrument. Melodica keyboards typically ascend from a low F note. Keyboards often have 32 or 37 keys, though instruments may have as few as 13 or as many as 45 keys. Larger models include the Hammond Pro 44 or the Ballone Burini Eolina P45, with 44 and 45 keys respectively.

As a free reed instrument, the melodica produces sound by pushing air past individual reeds corresponding to each playable note. When a key is pressed, it opens a valve blocking its corresponding reed, allowing air to pass through it. The sound of each vibrating reed reverberates in the shell of the instrument, which may be made of plastic, timber or metal. Players can control the instrument&#x27;s volume with air pressure. Unlike most wind instruments, the melodica can play multiple notes simultaneously, limited only by the amount of air available. An external microphone can be used to amplify the instrument or record its sound. Hammond&#x27;s Pro-44 melodion and Pro 24-B bass melodion each have built-in dynamic microphones which can be connected to a PA system or recording device via a single TRS 1/4&quot; jack output. As early as 1968, Hohner sold a &quot;Professional&quot; model of its Melodica with a built-in pickup.

Melodicas range in price from under US$20 for a simple, plastic instrument to several thousand dollars for a rare, custom-made or antique model.

==Use==

The melodica was first used as a serious musical instrument in the 1960s by composers such as Steve Reich, in his piece titled &quot;Melodica&quot; (1966). Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal developed a technique consisting of singing while playing the melodica, resulting in a wide tonal and harmonic palette. Jamaican dub and reggae musician Augustus Pablo popularized it in the 1970s, and his son Addis Pablo takes after him in the same genres. The American musician Jon Batiste was often seen playing a melodica on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. Funk keyboardist Bernie Worrell played melodica on multiple recordings in Bootsy Collins&#x27;s discography. The instrument is also associated with the Inti Raymi festival in Otavalo, Ecuador.

== Types ==
Melodicas are classified primarily by the range of the instrument. Melodicas with different ranges have slightly different shapes.
* Soprano and alto melodicas are higher-pitched and thinner sounding than tenors. Some are designed to be played with both hands at once: the left hand plays the black keys, and the right hand plays the white keys. Others are played like the tenor melodica.
* Tenor melodicas are a lower-pitched type of melodica. The left hand holds a handle on the bottom, and the right hand plays the keyboard. Tenor melodicas can be played with two hands by inserting a tube into the mouthpiece hole and placing the melodica on a flat surface.
* Bass melodicas include the Hohner Melodica-Basso (discontinued), the Suzuki B-24 Bass Melodion and the Hammond Bass Melodion BB-24.
* The Accordina aka &#x27;Chromatic Button Melodica&#x27;, generally made of metal, uses the same mechanism and reeds as a traditional melodica. The keyboard is replaced with a button arrangement similar to a chromatic button accordion&#x27;s keyboard.

==Alternative names==
The melodica is known by various names, often at the whim of the manufacturer. &quot;Melodion&quot; (Suzuki), &quot;Triola&quot; (Seydel), &quot;Melodika&quot; (Apollo), &quot;Melodia&quot; (Diana), &quot;Pianica&quot; (Yamaha), &quot;Melodihorn&quot; (Samick), &quot;Melodyhorn&quot; (Angel), &quot;Diamonica&quot; (Bontempi), &quot;Pianetta&quot; (Guerrini), &quot;face piano&quot;, and &quot;Clavietta&quot; (Borel/Beuscher) are just some of the variants. When a recording technician unfamiliar with the melodica called it a &quot;hooter&quot;, the band the Hooters took that as their name.

<text>A concertina is a free-reed musical instrument, like the various accordions and the harmonica. It consists of expanding and contracting bellows, with buttons (or keys) usually on both ends, unlike accordion buttons, which are on the front.

The concertina was developed independently in both England and Germany. The English version was invented in 1829 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, while Carl Friedrich Uhlig introduced the German version five years later, in 1834. Various forms of concertina are used for classical music, for the traditional music of Ireland, England, and South Africa, and for tango and polka music. 

The concertina has historically been a favorite instrument among people who travel often (due to its small and compact size), leading it to be a common instrument among soldiers, sailors, and cowboys. One was even brought aboard Robert Peary&#x27;s 1891 expedition of the Greenland Arctic. Despite the pop-culture association of the concertina with the Golden Age of Piracy, the concertina was invented nearly 100 years after the heyday of piracy in North America.

== Systems ==
Concertinas are members of a family of hand-held bellows-driven free reed instruments constructed according to various &quot;systems&quot; which differ in terms of keyboard layout and whether individual buttons (keys) produce the same () or different () notes with changes in the direction of air pressure.

Because the concertina was developed nearly contemporaneously in England and Germany, systems can be broadly divided into English, Anglo-German, and German types. To a player proficient in one of these systems, a concertina of a different system will be quite unfamiliar.


=== English and Duet concertinas ===

The &quot;English concertina&quot; and the &quot;Duet concertina&quot; bear similarities in history and construction. Both systems generally play a chromatic scale and are unisonoric, with each key producing the same note whether the bellows are being pushed or pulled. Both of these English instruments are smaller than German concertinas, and are usually hexagonal in shape, though occasionally featuring 8, 10, or 12 sides. The English system alternates the notes of the scale between two hands, enabling rapid melodies. The duet system features the lower notes on the left, and higher notes on the right, facilitating the playing of interlaced harmonies and melodies.

The English concertina is credited to Sir Charles Wheatstone, who first patented such a design in 1829 in Great Britain. Wheatstone was also the first to patent a duet concertina, in 1844.

=== German concertinas ===
German concertinas, developed in Germany for its local market and diaspora, are usually larger than English concertinas, and are generally bisonoric, using a different style of &quot;long plate&quot; reeds, and are often square, as opposed to hexagonal. German concertinas also sometimes have more than one reed per note, which produces a vibrato effect if their tuning differs slightly .

==== Chemnitzer concertina ====
Various German concertina systems share common construction features and core keyboard layout. In the United States, particularly in the Midwest where there are many German and Central European descendants, the term &quot;concertina&quot; often refers to the Chemnitzer concertina, which is bisonoric and closely related to the bandoneon, but features a different keyboard layout and decorative style, including a few mechanical innovations pioneered by German-American instrument builder and inventor Otto Schlicht. A related variant is the Carlsfelder concertina from C. F. Zimmerman, created in 1849 and shown at the 1851 London Industrial Exposition. The Chemnitzer concertina is popular among polka musicians in the American Midwest, most famously played by Li&#x27;l Wally.

==== Bandoneon ====

The bandoneon (also rendered bandoneÃ³n, bandonion) is a German concertina system with an original bisonoric layout devised by Heinrich Band. Although intended as a substitute for the organ in small churches and chapels, it was soon secularized and is now associated with tango music due to the instrument&#x27;s popularity in Argentina since the late 19th century when tango developed from various dance styles in Argentina and Uruguay. Though the typical bandoneon is bisonoric, the 1920s saw the development of unisonoric variants such as the Ernst Kusserow and Charles Peguri systems, both introduced around 1925. Bandoneons typically have more than one reed per button, dry-tuned with the reeds an octave apart. &quot;Dry&quot; means that vibrato is absent because the tuning is accurate. The instrument is considered an essential part of the Argentine tango orchestra.

=== Anglo concertina ===
The &quot;Anglo&quot; or &quot;Anglo-German&quot; concertina is, historically, a hybrid between the English and German concertinas. The button layouts are generally the same as the original 20-button German concertinas designed by Uhlig in 1834, and in a bisonoric system. Within a few years of its invention, the &quot;German concertina&quot; was a popular import in England, Ireland, and North America, due to its ease of use and relatively low price. English manufacturers responded to this popularity by offering their own versions using traditional English methods: concertina reeds instead of long-plate reeds, independent pivots for each button, and hexagon-shaped ends, resulting in the modern Anglo concertina.

=== Franglo ===
The &quot;Franglo&quot; system concertina was developed by the luthiers C &amp; R Dipper, in cooperation with Emmanuel Pariselle, known for his expertise as a professional player of the two-and-a-half row diatonic melodeon. The system has the construction and reed-work of a concertina with the buttons at the sides, but the layout of the buttons is that of a melodeon. The name &quot;Franglo&quot; blends the words French and Anglo.

== History ==


=== 19th century ===
In the mid-1830s concertinas were manufactured and sold in Germany and England, in two types specific to the country. Both systems continued to evolve into the current forms as the popularity of the instrument increased. The difference in prices and the common uses of the English and German systems led to something of a class distinction between the two. German or Anglo-German concertinas were regarded as a lower-class instrument while the English concertina had an air of bourgeois respectability. English concertinas were most popular as parlor instruments for classical music, while German concertinas were more associated with the popular dance music at that time.

In the 1850s, the Anglo-German concertina&#x27;s ability to play both melody and accompaniment led English manufacturers to start developing the various duet systems. The popular Maccann system was developed towards the end of the century; meanwhile, German manufacturers were producing concertinas with more than 20 keys for local sale. Three keyboard systems for German concertinas eventually became popular: Uhlig&#x27;s Chemnitzer system, Carl Zimmerman&#x27;s Carlsfeld system, and the Bandoneon&#x27;s Reinische system. Various German manufacturers tried to develop a single unified keyboard system for all German concertinas, but this was only partially accomplished by the end of the 19th century, when the Chemnitzer and Carlsfelder systems merged into the unified concertina system, and a unified bandoneon system was created. Despite the new standards, the older systems remained popular into the 20th century.

The concertina was popular throughout the 19th century. The Salvation Army in England, America, Australia, and New Zealand commonly used concertinas in their bands, and other concertina bands and musicians performed in all parts of the English-speaking world. German emigrants brought their Chemnitzers and bandoneons with them to the United States and Argentina where they became regionally popular.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, the concertina&#x27;s popularity rapidly declined as demand for the accordion increased, along with mass production of other instruments such as the piano which are more suited to chromatic forms of music like blues and jazz. By the middle of the century, few concertina makers remained, and most of those used accordion reeds and inexpensive, unreliable keyboard mechanisms. Yet, the various forms of concertina survived in some areas: Anglo concertinas in Irish traditional music, the English and the Anglo in English Morris dancing, the Anglo in Africa, among Afrikaners (see Boer music) and Zulus (who call it a &quot;squashbox&quot;), the Chemnitzer in the United States as a polka instrument, and the bandoneon in Argentina as a prominent part of the tango tradition. Between World War I and World War II, there were many concertina and bandoneon bands in Germany, but with the rise of the Nazi regime these musical clubs disappeared.

=== Folk revival and present ===
The folk revival movements of the 1960s led to a modest resurgence in the popularity of the concertina, particularly the Anglo. More recently, concertina popularity again seems on the rise, particularly the Anglo in the traditional music of Ireland and England. Renewed interest in tango since the 1980s has also seen interest in the bandoneon increase. American country/folk musician Willi Carlisle has been introducing the concertina (along with the button accordion) into American country music, reflecting a general resurgence of accordions in American music as well.

Traditional music playing continues in many parts of the UK in the 21st century, often using English and Anglo-system concertinas. Concertinas are mass-produced in Italy and China, and are produced by individual workshops in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Modern-made instruments are in a spectrum of quality and traditionalism, with the most expensive instruments using traditional concertina-type reeds, while mid-level and inexpensive instruments take advantage of the lower price of mass-produced accordion reeds.

<doc id="58911" wikidata="Q79793" url="?curid=58911" title="Measles">
<text>Measles (probably from Middle Dutch or Middle High German &quot;masel(e)&quot; (&quot;blemish, blood blister&quot;)) is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable infectious disease caused by measles virus. Other names include &quot;morbilli&quot;, &quot;rubeola&quot;, &quot;red measles&quot;, and &quot;English measles&quot;. Both rubella, also known as &quot;German measles&quot;, and roseola are different diseases caused by unrelated viruses.

Symptoms usually develop 10â12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7â10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik&#x27;s spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Common complications include diarrhea (in 8% of cases), middle ear infection (7%), and pneumonia (6%). These occur in part due to measles-induced immunosuppression. Less commonly seizures, blindness, or inflammation of the brain may occur.

Measles is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It may also be spread through direct contact with mouth or nasal secretions. It is extremely contagious: nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will be infected. Furthermore, measles&#x27;s reproductive number estimates vary beyond the frequently cited range of 12 to 18, with a 2017 review giving a range of 3.7 to 203.3. People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash. While often regarded as a childhood illness, it can affect people of any age. Most people do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the measles virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts. Measles is not known to occur in other animals.

Once a person has become infected, no specific treatment is available, although supportive care may improve outcomes. Such care may include oral rehydration solution (slightly sweet and salty fluids), healthy food, and medications to control the fever. Antibiotics should be prescribed if secondary bacterial infections such as ear infections or pneumonia occur. Vitamin A supplementation is also recommended for children. Among cases reported in the U.S. between 1985 and 1992, death occurred in 0.2% of cases, but may be up to 10% in people with malnutrition. Most of those who die from the infection are less than five years old.

The measles vaccine is effective at preventing the disease, is exceptionally safe, and is often delivered in combination with other vaccines. Due to the ease with which measles is transmitted from person to person in a community, more than 95% of the community must be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity. Vaccination resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths from measles between 2000 and 2017, with about 85% of children worldwide having received their first dose as of 2017.
Measles affects about 20 million people a year, primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia. It is one of the leading vaccine-preventable disease causes of death. In 1980, 2.6 million people died from measles, and in 1990, 545,000 died due to the disease; by 2014, global vaccination programs had reduced the number of deaths from measles to 73,000. Despite these trends, rates of disease and deaths increased from 2017 to 2019 due to a decrease in immunization.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms typically begin 10â14 days after exposure. The classic symptoms include a four-day fever (the four Ds) and the three Csâcough, coryza (head cold, fever, sneezing), and conjunctivitis (red eyes)âalong with a maculopapular rash. Fever is common and typically lasts for about one week; the fever seen with measles is often as high as .

Koplik&#x27;s spots seen inside the mouth are diagnostic for measles, but are temporary and therefore rarely seen. Koplik spots are small white spots that are commonly seen on the inside of the cheeks opposite the molars. They appear as &quot;grains of salt on a reddish background.&quot; Recognizing these spots before a person reaches their maximum infectiousness can help reduce the spread of the disease.

The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized red maculopapular rash that begins several days after the fever starts. It starts on the back of the ears and, after a few hours, spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body. The measles rash appears two to four days after the initial symptoms and lasts for up to eight days. The rash is said to &quot;stain&quot;, changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing. Overall, measles usually resolves after about three weeks.

People who have been vaccinated against measles but have incomplete protective immunity may experience a form of modified measles. Modified measles is characterized by a prolonged incubation period, milder, and less characteristic symptoms (sparse and discrete rash of short duration).


===Complications===
Complications of measles are relatively common, ranging from mild ones such as diarrhea to serious ones such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) (either direct viral laryngotracheobronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), otitis media, acute brain inflammation, corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring), and in about 1 in 600 unvaccinated infants under 15 months while more rarely in older children and adults, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is progressive and eventually lethal. 

In addition, measles can suppress the immune system for weeks to months, and this can contribute to bacterial superinfections such as otitis media and bacterial pneumonia. Two months after recovery there is a 11â73% decrease in the number of antibodies against other bacteria and viruses.

The death rate in the 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia. People who are at high risk for complications are infants and children aged less than 5 years; adults aged over 20 years; pregnant women; people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia, HIV infection or innate immunodeficiency; and those who are malnourished or have vitamin A deficiency. Complications are usually more severe in adults. Between 1987 and 2000, the case fatality rate across the United States was three deaths per 1,000 cases attributable to measles, or 0.3%. In underdeveloped nations with high rates of malnutrition and poor healthcare, fatality rates have been as high as 28%. In immunocompromised persons (e.g., people with AIDS) the fatality rate is approximately 30%.

Even in previously healthy children, measles can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization. One out of every 1,000 measles cases progresses to acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage. One to three out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurological complications.

==Cause==

Measles is caused by the measles virus, a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus &quot;Morbillivirus&quot; within the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;.

The virus is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions. Measles is the most contagious virus known. It remains infective for up to two hours in that airspace or nearby surfaces. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of non-immune people who have close contact with them (e.g., household members) will also become infected. Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus, and no other animal reservoirs are known to exist, although mountain gorillas are believed to be susceptible to the disease.
Risk factors for measles virus infection include immunodeficiency caused by HIV/AIDS, immunosuppression following receipt of an organ or a stem cell transplant, alkylating agents, or corticosteroid therapy, regardless of immunization status; travel to areas where measles commonly occurs or contact with travelers from such an area; and the loss of passive, inherited antibodies before the age of routine immunization.

==Pathophysiology==

Once the measles virus gets onto the mucosa, it infects the epithelial cells in the trachea or bronchi. Measles virus uses a protein on its surface called hemagglutinin (H protein), to bind to a target receptor on the host cell, which could be CD46, which is expressed on all nucleated human cells, CD150, &quot;aka&quot; signaling lymphocyte activation molecule or SLAM, which is found on immune cells like B or T cells, and antigen-presenting cells, or nectin-4, a cellular adhesion molecule. Once bound, the fusion, or F protein helps the virus fuse with the membrane and ultimately get inside the cell.

As the virus is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, it includes the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is used to transcribe its genome into a positive-sense mRNA strand.

After entering a cell, it is ready to be translated into viral proteins, wrapped in the cell&#x27;s lipid envelope, and sent out of the cell as a newly made virus. Within days, the measles virus spreads through local tissue and is picked up by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages, and carried from that local tissue in the lungs to the local lymph nodes. From there it continues to spread, eventually getting into the blood and spreading to more lung tissue, as well as other organs like the intestines and the brain. Functional impairment of the infected dendritic cells by the measles virus is thought to contribute to measles-induced immunosuppression.

==Diagnosis==
Typically, clinical diagnosis begins with the onset of fever and malaise about 10 days after exposure to the measles virus, followed by the emergence of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis that worsen in severity over 4 days of appearing. Observation of Koplik&#x27;s spots is also diagnostic. Other possible condition that can result in these symptoms include parvovirus, dengue fever, Kawasaki disease, and scarlet fever. Laboratory confirmation is, however, strongly recommended.

===Laboratory testing===
Laboratory diagnosis of measles can be done with confirmation of positive measles IgM antibodies or detection of measles virus RNA from throat, nasal or urine specimen by using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. This method is particularly useful to confirm cases when the IgM antibodies results are inconclusive. For people unable to have their blood drawn, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific IgA testing. Salivary tests used to diagnose measles involve collecting a saliva sample and testing for the presence of measles antibodies. This method is not ideal, as saliva contains many other fluids and proteins which may make it difficult to collect samples and detect measles antibodies. Saliva also contains 800 times fewer antibodies than blood samples do, which makes salivary testing additionally difficult. Positive contact with other people known to have measles adds evidence to the diagnosis.

==Prevention==
Mothers who are immune to measles pass antibodies to their children while they are still in the womb, especially if the mother acquired immunity through infection rather than vaccination. Such antibodies will usually give newborn infants some immunity against measles, but these antibodies are gradually lost over the course of the first nine months of life. Infants under one year of age whose maternal anti-measles antibodies have disappeared become susceptible to infection with the measles virus.

In developed countries, it is recommended that children be immunized against measles at 12 months, generally as part of a three-part MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). The vaccine is generally not given before this age because such infants respond inadequately to the vaccine due to an immature immune system. A second dose of the vaccine is usually given to children between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Measles vaccines have been given to over a billion people. Vaccination rates have been high enough to make measles relatively uncommon. Adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, with fever and pain at the injection site being the most common. Life-threatening adverse reactions occur in less than one per million vaccinations (&lt;0.0001%).

In developing countries where measles is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends two doses of vaccine be given, at six and nine months of age. The vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not. The vaccine is less effective in HIV-infected infants than in the general population, but early treatment with antiretroviral drugs can increase its effectiveness. Measles vaccination programs are often used to deliver other child health interventions as well, such as bed nets to protect against malaria, antiparasite medicine and vitamin A supplements, and so contribute to the reduction of child deaths from other causes.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all adult international travelers who do not have positive evidence of previous measles immunity receive two doses of MMR vaccine before traveling, although birth before 1957 is presumptive evidence of immunity. Those born in the United States before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with measles virus and generally need not be considered susceptible.

There have been false claims of an association between the measles vaccine and autism; this incorrect concern has reduced the rate of vaccination and increased the number of cases of measles where immunization rates became too low to maintain herd immunity. Additionally, there have been false claims that measles infection protects against cancer.

Administration of the MMR vaccine may prevent measles after exposure to the virus (post-exposure prophylaxis). Post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines are specific to jurisdiction and population. Passive immunization against measles by an intramuscular injection of antibodies could be effective up to the seventh day after exposure. Compared to no treatment, the risk of measles infection is reduced by 83%, and the risk of death by measles is reduced by 76%. However, the effectiveness of passive immunization in comparison to active measles vaccine is not clear.

The MMR vaccine is 95% effective for preventing measles after one dose if the vaccine is given to a child who is 12 months or older; if a second dose of the MMR vaccine is given, it will provide immunity in 99% of children.

There is no evidence that the measles vaccine virus can be transmitted to other persons.

==Treatment==
There is no specific antiviral treatment if measles develops. Instead the medications are generally aimed at treating superinfections, maintaining good hydration with adequate fluids, and pain relief. Some groups, like young children and the severely malnourished, are also given vitamin A, which acts as an immunomodulator that boosts the antibody responses to measles and decreases the risk of serious complications.

===Medications===
Treatment is supportive, with ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting medication to dilate the airways for cough. As for aspirin, some research has suggested a correlation between children who take aspirin and the development of Reye syndrome.

The use of vitamin A during treatment is recommended to decrease the risk of blindness; however, it does not prevent or cure the disease. A systematic review of trials into its use found no reduction in overall mortality, but two doses (200,000 IU) of vitamin A was shown to reduce mortality for measles in children younger than two years of age. It is unclear if zinc supplementation in children with measles affects outcomes as it has not been sufficiently studied. There are no adequate studies on whether Chinese medicinal herbs are effective.

==Prognosis==
Most people survive measles, though in some cases, complications may occur. About 1 in 4 individuals will be hospitalized and 1â2 in 1,000 will die. Complications are more likely in children under age 5 and adults over age 20. Pneumonia is the most common fatal complication of measles infection and accounts for 56â86% of measles-related deaths.

Possible consequences of measles virus infection include laryngotracheobronchitis, sensorineural hearing loss, andâin about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 300,000 casesâpanencephalitis, which is usually fatal. Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. It typically occurs two days to one week after the measles rash breaks out and begins with very high fever, severe headache, convulsions and altered mentation. A person with measles encephalitis may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.

For people having had measles, it is rare to ever have a symptomatic reinfection.

The measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system, which can cause deaths from other diseases. Suppression of the immune system by measles lasts about two years and has been epidemiologically implicated in up to 90% of childhood deaths in third world countries, and historically may have caused rather more deaths in the United States, the UK and Denmark than were directly caused by measles. Although the measles vaccine contains an attenuated strain, it does not deplete immune memory.

==Epidemiology==

Measles is extremely infectious and its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities that generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized in measles by Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the critical community size (CCS). Analysis of outbreaks in island communities suggested that the CCS for measles is around 250,000. Due to the ease with which measles is transmitted from person to person in a community, more than 95% of the community must be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity.

In 2011, the WHO estimated that 158,000 deaths were caused by measles. This is down from 630,000 deaths in 1990. As of 2018, measles remains a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in the world. In developed countries the mortality rate is lower, for example in England and Wales from 2007 to 2017 death occurred between two and three cases out of 10,000. In children one to three cases out of every 1,000 die in the United States (0.1â0.2%). In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate healthcare, mortality can be as high as 10%. In cases with complications, the rate may rise to 20â30%. In 2012, the number of deaths due to measles was 78% lower than in 2000 due to increased rates of immunization among UN member states.

Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the Measles Initiative: the American Red Cross, the United States CDC, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005. Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region. There were 142,300 measles related deaths globally in 2018, of which most cases were reported from African and eastern Mediterranean regions. These estimates were slightly higher than that of 2017, when 124,000 deaths were reported due to measles infection globally.

In 2000, the WHO established the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) to provide laboratory surveillance for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome. Data from 2016 to 2018 show that the most frequently detected measles virus genotypes are decreasing, suggesting that increasing global population immunity has decreased the number of chains of transmission.

Cases reported in the first three months of 2019, were 300% higher than in the first three months of 2018, with outbreaks in every region of the world, even in countries with high overall vaccination coverage where it spread among clusters of unvaccinated people. The numbers of reported cases as of mid-November is over 413,000 globally, with an additional 250,000 cases in DRC (as reported through their national system), similar to the increasing trends of infection reported in the earlier months of 2019, compared to 2018. In 2019, the total number of cases worldwide climbed to 869,770. The number of cases reported for 2020 is lower compare to 2019. According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered vaccination campaigns in at least 68 countries, including in countries that were experiencing outbreaks, which caused increased risk of additional cases.

In 2022, there were an estimated 136,000 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under vaccinated children under the age of 5 years.

In February 2024, the World Health Organization said more than half of the world was at risk of a measles outbreak due to Covid-19 pandemic-related disruptions in that month. All the world regions have reported such outbreaks with the exception of the Americas, though these could still be expected to become hotspots in the future. Death rates during the outbreaks tend to be higher among poorer countries but middle income nations are also heavily impacted, according to the WHO.

In November 2024, the WHO and CDC reported that measles cases increased by 20% last year, primarily due to insufficient vaccine coverage in the worldâs poorest and conflict-affected regions. Nearly half of the major outbreaks occurred in Africa, where deaths rose by 37%, the agencies noted. In 2023, approximately 10.3 million cases of the highly contagious disease were reported, up from 8.65 million the previous year. 

===Europe===

In England and Wales, though deaths from measles were uncommon, they averaged about 500 per year in the 1940s. Deaths diminished with the improvement of medical care in the 1950s but the incidence of the disease did not retreat until vaccination was introduced in the late 1960s. Wider coverage was achieved in the 1980s with the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR vaccine.

In 2013â14, there were almost 10,000 cases in 30 European countries. Most cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals and over 90% of cases occurred in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, and United Kingdom. Between October 2014 and March 2015, a measles outbreak in the German capital of Berlin resulted in at least 782 cases. In 2017, numbers continued to increase in Europe to 21,315 cases, with 35 deaths. In preliminary figures for 2018, reported cases in the region increased 3-fold to 82,596 in 47 countries, with 72 deaths; Ukraine had the most cases (53,218), with the highest incidence rates being in Ukraine (1209 cases per million), Serbia (579), Georgia (564) and Albania (500). The previous year (2017) saw an estimated measles vaccine coverage of 95% for the first dose and 90% for the second dose in the region, the latter figure being the highest-ever estimated second-dose coverage.

In 2019, the United Kingdom, Albania, the Czech Republic, and Greece lost their measles-free status due to ongoing and prolonged spread of the disease in these countries. In the first 6 months of 2019, 90,000 cases occurred in Europe.

===Americas===
As a result of widespread vaccination, the disease was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016. However, there were cases again in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 in this region.

====United States====
In the United States, measles affected approximately 3,000 people per million in the 1960s before the vaccine was available. With consistent widespread childhood vaccination, this figure fell to 13 cases per million by the 1980s, and to about 1 case per million by 2000.

In 1991, an outbreak of measles in Philadelphia was centered at the Faith Tabernacle Congregation, a faith healing church that actively discouraged parishioners from vaccinating their children. Over 1400 people were infected with measles and nine children died.

Before immunization in the United States, between three and four million cases occurred each year. The United States was declared free of circulating measles in 2000, with 911 cases from 2001 to 2011. In 2014 the CDC said endemic measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome had not returned to the United States. Occasional measles outbreaks persist, however, because of cases imported from abroad, of which more than half are the result of unvaccinated U.S. residents who are infected abroad and infect others upon return to the United States. The CDC continues to recommend measles vaccination throughout the population to prevent outbreaks like these.

In 2014, an outbreak was initiated in Ohio when two unvaccinated Amish men harboring asymptomatic measles returned to the United States from missionary work in the Philippines. Their return to a community with low vaccination rates led to an outbreak that rose to include a total of 383 cases across nine counties. Of the 383 cases, 340 (89%) occurred in unvaccinated individuals.

From 4 January, to 2 April 2015, there were 159 cases of measles reported to the CDC. Of those 159 cases, 111 (70%) were determined to have come from an earlier exposure in late December 2014. This outbreak was believed to have originated from the Disneyland theme park in California. The Disneyland outbreak was held responsible for the infection of 147 people in seven U.S. states as well as Mexico and Canada, the majority of which were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Of the cases 48% were unvaccinated and 38% were unsure of their vaccination status. The initial exposure to the virus was never identified.

In 2015, a U.S. woman in Washington state died of pneumonia, as a result of measles. She was the first fatality in the U.S. from measles since 2003. The woman had been vaccinated for measles and was taking immunosuppressive drugs for another condition. The drugs suppressed the woman&#x27;s immunity to measles, and the woman became infected with measles; she did not develop a rash, but contracted pneumonia, which caused her death.

In June 2017, the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory confirmed a case of measles in Franklin County. This instance marks the first case of measles in 20 years for the state of Maine. In 2018, one case occurred in Portland, Oregon, with 500 people exposed; 40 of them lacked immunity to the virus and were being monitored by county health officials as of 2 July 2018. There were 273 cases of measles reported throughout the United States in 2018, including an outbreak in Brooklyn with more than 200 reported cases from October 2018 to February 2019. The outbreak was tied with population density of the Orthodox Jewish community, with the initial exposure from an unvaccinated child that caught measles while visiting Israel.

A resurgence of measles occurred during 2019, which has been generally tied to parents choosing not to have their children vaccinated as most of the reported cases have occurred in people 19 years old or younger. Cases were first reported in Washington state in January, with an outbreak of at least 58 confirmed cases most within Clark County, which has a higher rate of vaccination exemptions compared to the rest of the state; nearly one in four kindergartners in Clark did not receive vaccinations, according to state data. This led Washington state governor Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency, and the state&#x27;s congress to introduce legislation to disallow vaccination exemption for personal or philosophical reasons. In April 2019, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency because of &quot;a huge spike&quot; in cases of measles where there were 285 cases centred on the Orthodox Jewish areas of Brooklyn in 2018, while there were only two cases in 2017. There were 168 more in neighboring Rockland County. Other outbreaks have included Santa Cruz County and Butte County in California, and the states of New Jersey and Michigan. , there have been 695 cases of measles reported in 22 states. This is the highest number of measles cases since it was declared eliminated in 2000. From 1 January, to 31 December 2019, 1,282 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 31 states. This is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1992. Of the 1,282 cases, 128 of the people who got measles were hospitalized, and 61 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

Following the end of the 2019 outbreak, reported cases have fallen to pre-outbreak levels: 13 cases in 2020, 49 cases in 2021, and 121 cases in 2022.

On February 26, 2025, the first measles death since 2015 was reported to be an unvaccinated school-aged child in West Texas. The confirmed number of measles cases in this West Texas outbreak has totaled 124, according to the Texas Department of Health Services. Most are in children ages 5-17.

====Brazil====
The spread of measles had been interrupted in Brazil in 2016, with the last-known case twelve months earlier. This last case was in the state of CearÃ¡.

Brazil won a measles elimination certificate by the Pan American Health Organization in 2016, but the Ministry of Health has proclaimed that the country has struggled to keep this certificate, since two outbreaks had already been identified in 2018, one in the state of Amazonas and another one in Roraima, in addition to cases in other states (Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, ParÃ¡, SÃ£o Paulo and RondÃ´nia), totaling 1,053 confirmed cases until 1 August 2018. In these outbreaks, and in most other cases, the contagion was related to the importation of the virus, especially from Venezuela. This was confirmed by the genotype of the virus (D8) that was identified, which is the same that circulates in Venezuela.

===Southeast Asia===
In the Vietnamese measles epidemic in spring of 2014, an estimated 8,500 measles cases were reported as of 19 April, with 114 fatalities; as of 30 May, 21,639 suspected measles cases had been reported, with 142 measles-related fatalities. In the Naga Self-Administered Zone in a remote northern region of Myanmar, at least 40 children died during a measles outbreak in August 2016 that was probably caused by lack of vaccination in an area of poor health infrastructure. Following the 2019 Philippines measles outbreak, 23,563 measles cases have been reported in the country with 338 fatalities. A measles outbreak also happened among the Malaysian Orang Asli sub-group of Batek people in the state of Kelantan from May 2019, causing the deaths of 15 from the tribe. In 2024, a measles outbreak was declared in the Bangsamoro region in the Philippines with at least 592 cases and 3 deaths.

===South Pacific===
A measles outbreak in New Zealand has 2193 confirmed cases and two deaths. A measles outbreak in Tonga has 612 cases of measles.

==== Samoa ====
A measles outbreak in Samoa in late 2019 has over 5,700 cases of measles and 83 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,000. Over three percent of the population were infected, and a state of emergency was declared from 17 November to 7 December. A vaccination campaign brought the measles vaccination rate from 31 to 34% in 2018 to an estimated 94% of the eligible population in December 2019.

===Africa===

The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar have reported the highest numbers of cases in 2019. However, cases have decreased in Madagascar as a result of nationwide emergency measles vaccine campaigns. As of August 2019 outbreaks were occurring in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, South Sudan and Sudan.

==== Madagascar ====
An outbreak of measles in 2018 has resulted in well beyond 115,000 cases and over 1,200 deaths.

==== Democratic Republic of Congo ====
An outbreak of measles with nearly 5,000 deaths and 250,000 infections occurred in 2019, after the disease spread to all the provinces in the country. Most deaths were among children under five years of age. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported this as the world&#x27;s largest and fastest-moving epidemic.

==History==

Measles is of zoonotic origin, having evolved from rinderpest, which infects cattle. A precursor of the measles began causing infections in humans as early as the 4th century BC or as late as after 500 AD. The Antonine Plague of 165â180 AD has been speculated to have been measles, but the actual cause of this plague is unknown and smallpox is a more likely cause. The first systematic description of measles, and its distinction from smallpox and chickenpox, is credited to the Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (860â932), who published &quot;The Book of Smallpox and Measles&quot;. At the time of Razi&#x27;s book, it was believed that outbreaks were still limited and that the virus was not fully adapted to humans. Sometime between 1100 and 1200 AD, the measles virus fully diverged from rinderpest, becoming a distinct virus that infects humans. This agrees with the observation that measles requires a susceptible population of over 500,000 to sustain an epidemic, a situation that occurred in historic times following the growth of medieval European cities.
Measles is an endemic disease, meaning it has been continually present in a community and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of those indigenous people who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of Honduras, and it has ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.

Between roughly 1855 and 2005, measles is estimated to have killed about 200 million people worldwide.

The 1846 measles outbreak in the Faroe Islands was unusual for being well studied. Measles had not been seen on the islands for 60 years, so almost no residents had any acquired immunity. Three-quarters of the residents got sick, and more than 100 (1â2%) died from it before the epidemic burned itself out. Peter Ludvig Panum observed the outbreak and determined that measles was spread through direct contact of contagious people with people who had never had measles.

Measles killed 20 percent of Hawaii&#x27;s population in the 1850s. In 1875, measles killed over 40,000 Fijians, approximately one-third of the population. In the 19th century, the disease killed more than half of the Great Andamanese population. Seven to eight million children are thought to have died from measles each year before the vaccine was introduced.

In 1914, a statistician for the Prudential Insurance Company estimated from a survey of 22 countries that 1% of all deaths in the temperate zone were caused by measles. He observed also that 1â6% of cases of measles ended fatally, the difference depending on age (0â3 being the worst), social conditions (e.g. overcrowded tenements) and pre-existing health conditions.

In 1954, the virus causing the disease was isolated from a 13-year-old boy from the United States, David Edmonston, and adapted and propagated on chick embryo tissue culture. The World Health Organization recognizes eight clades, named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Twenty-three strains of the measles virus have been identified and designated within these clades. While at Merck, Maurice Hilleman developed the first successful vaccine. Licensed vaccines to prevent the disease became available in 1963. An improved measles vaccine became available in 1968. Measles as an endemic disease was eliminated from the United States in 2000, but continues to be reintroduced by international travelers. In 2019 there were at least 1,241 cases of measles in the United States distributed across 31 states, with over three quarters in New York.

==Society and culture==
German anti-vaccination campaigner and HIV/AIDS denialist Stefan Lanka posed a challenge on his website in 2011, offering a sum of â¬100,000 for anyone who could scientifically prove that measles is caused by a virus and determine the diameter of the virus. He posited that the illness is psychosomatic and that the measles virus does not exist. When provided with overwhelming scientific evidence from various medical studies by German physician David Bardens, Lanka did not accept the findings, forcing Bardens to appeal in court. The initial legal case ended with the ruling that Lanka was to pay the prize. However, on appeal, Lanka was ultimately not required to pay the award because the submitted evidence did not meet his exact requirements. The case received wide international coverage that prompted many to comment on it, including neurologist, well-known skeptic and science-based medicine advocate Steven Novella, who called Lanka &quot;a crank&quot;.

As outbreaks easily occur in under-vaccinated populations, the disease is seen as a test of sufficient vaccination within a population. Measles outbreaks have been on the rise in the United States, especially in communities with lower rates of vaccination. A different vaccine distribution within a single territory by age or social class may define different general perceptions of vaccination efficacy. It is often introduced to a region by travelers from other countries and it typically spreads to those who have not received the measles vaccination.

The &quot;primary host&quot; is the host in which the parasite spends its adult life; the other is the &quot;secondary host&quot;. Both hosts are required for the parasite to complete its life cycle. This can be contrasted with an autoecious parasite which can complete its life cycle on a single host species. Many rust fungi have heteroecious life cycles:

In parasitology, [[heteroxeny]], or heteroxenous development, is a synonymous term that characterizes a parasite whose development involves several hosts.

== Fungal examples ==
* &quot;Gymnosporangium&quot; (Cedar-apple rust): the juniper is the primary (telial) host and the apple, pear or hawthorn is the secondary (aecial) host.
* &quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot; (White pine blister rust): the primary host are white pines, and currants the secondary.
* &quot;Hemileia vastatrix&quot; (Coffee rust): the primary host is coffee plant, and the alternate host is unknown.
* &quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; (Stem rust): the primary hosts include Kentucky bluegrass, barley, and wheat; barberry is the alternate host.
* &quot;Puccinia coronata&quot; var. &quot;avenae&quot; (Crown rust of oats): Oats are the primary host; &quot;Rhamnus&quot; spp. (Buckthorns) are the alternate hosts.
* &quot;Phakopsora meibomiae&quot; and &quot;P. pachyrhizi&quot; (Soybean Rust): the primary host is soybean and various legumes. The alternate host is unknown.
* &quot;Puccinia porri&quot; (Leek rust): autoecious

==History==
The phenomenon of heteroecy was first discovered by A.S. Ãrsted in 1863.

<text>The Oscar class, Soviet designations Project 949 &quot;Granit andProject 949A &quot;Antey (NATO reporting names Oscar I and Oscar II respectively), are a series of nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines designed in the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. First built in the 1970s, six remain in service with the Russian Navy. Two other vessels were slated to be modernized since at least 2017 as Project 949AM, to extend their service life and increase combat capabilities but it is unclear whether work continues as of 2023.

The Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service until some ballistic missile submarines were converted to carry cruise missiles in 2007. They are the fourth largest class of submarines in displacement and length. Only the Soviet , Russian and American &quot;Ohio&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines are larger.

==History==
The first submarine of Project 949 was laid down in the mid-1970s and was commissioned in 1980. In 1982 an updated and larger version (Project 949A) replaced the earlier version. In total fourteen submarines were constructed. The Oscar class was designed to attack NATO carrier battle groups using long-range P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 &quot;Shipwreck&quot;) anti-ship missiles and targeting data provided by the satellite system (via the submarine&#x27;s &quot;Punch Bowl&quot; antenna). In the financial problems that followed the fall of the Soviet Union the Oscar class was prioritized by the Russian Navy, and when many older submarine classes were retired the Oscar class remained active in both the Northern and Pacific Fleets.

===Modernization===
The Rubin Design Bureau started working on Project 949A modernization in 2011, with Zvezdochka and Zvezda shipyards to carry out modernization of the vessels. In September 2015, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced during his visit to Zvezda shipyard, that at least three Oscar-class submarines will undergo repair and modernization to extend their service life by 20 years. The upgraded submarines will be known as &quot;Project 949AM&quot;, according to the Russian officials. Modernization cost was estimated at RUB12 billion (US$182 million) per submarine.

In September 2016, it was reported submarines K-132 &quot;Irkutsk&quot; and K-442 &quot;Chelyabinsk&quot; are currently being modernized to 949AM. According to the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Yury Borisov, Russia&#x27;s Pacific Fleet may get four modernized Oscar II-class submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles by 2021.

==Versions==

===Project 949 &quot;Granit&quot; (Oscar I)===

Two Project 949 &quot;Granit&quot; submarines were built at Severodvinsk between 1975 and 1982 and assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. &quot;K-525&quot; was laid down in 1975 and &quot;K-206&quot; was laid down in 1979. After the construction of the first two submarines, production continued with the improved project 949A &quot;Antey&quot;. Both submarines of the Project 949 were decommissioned in 1996 and scrapped in 2004.

===Project 949A &quot;Antei&quot; (Oscar II)===

Eleven Project 949A &quot;Antey&quot; submarines were completed at Severodvinsk, of which five were assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. At one stage it had been planned to develop a new fourth-generation follow-on to the Project 949A, but this plan was later dropped. The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about longer than its predecessor (approximately rather than ), providing space and buoyancy for improved electronics and quieter propulsion.

Some sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to early but inferior to the &quot;Akula II&quot; class as well as subsequent (4th generation) designs. It also has a larger fin, and its propellers have seven blades instead of four.

Like all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of double hull construction. Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a bridge open to the elements on top of the sail but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station. A distinguishing mark is a slight bulge at the top of the fin. A large door on either side of the fin reaches this bulge. These are wider at the top than on the bottom, and are hinged on the bottom. The Federation of American Scientists reports that this submarine carries an emergency crew escape capsule; it is possible that these doors cover it. The VSK escape capsule can accommodate 110 people.

===Project 949AM===
Modernization of Project 949A submarines, first announced by the Russian Defence Ministry in 2011. As part of the modernization, submarines will have their 24 P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles replaced with up to 72 newer 3M-54 Kalibr or P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles. The upgrade requires no design changes to the hull as the new missiles will fit into the existing launchers outside the pressure hull. The modernized boats will also get upgraded Omnibus-M combat information and Simfoniya-3.2 navigation systems, as well as new fire-control system, communications, sonar, radar, and electronic intercept equipment. The modernization aims to bring the submarines up to the same technological level as Russia&#x27;s next-generation Yasen-class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines.

=== Belgorod, Project 09852 ===
In December 2012, construction began on a special purpose research and rescue submarine, designated Project 09852, and based on the incomplete Project 949A (Oscar II class) submarine &quot;Belgorod&quot;. The submarine is reportedly designed to carry both manned (e.g. Project 18511 midget submarine) as well as unmanned (e.g. Klavesin-1R) underwater vessels. However, while carrying smaller unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) would be possible as-is on an Oscar-class hull, the accommodation of a midget submarine such as Project 18511 &quot;Paltus&quot; or the even larger Project 10831 &quot;Losharik&quot;, would probably require a major hull extension in order to accommodate a docking compartment. For example, the length of the submarine BS-64 &quot;Podmoskovye&quot; was increased by even though the SLBM missile compartment was completely removed.

&quot;Belgorod&quot; will be reportedly used as a carrier of the rumored Poseidon (NATO reporting name Kanyon) nuclear-powered, thermonuclear armed unmanned underwater device capable to carry a 100 Mt thermonuclear warhead, with at least four such devices being carried horizontally in place of the 24 P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 &quot;Shipwreck&quot;) launchers for a total yield of 600 megatonnes of TNT.

It is estimated that &quot;Belgorod&quot; will be long which would make it the longest submarine in the world.

On 23 April 2019, &quot;Belgorod&quot; was floated out of a slipway during a ceremony at the Sevmash shipyard, watched by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin via a TV-link. Further work was to be completed afloat and the submarine was scheduled to start its factory and state trials in 2020 after which it was to be delivered to the Russian Navy. However, this schedule was delayed with sea trials then projected to begin in May 2021. After some delays, sea trials were reported to have started on June 25, 2021. The submarine was delivered to the Russian Navy on 8 July 2022.

<doc id="58916" wikidata="Q27759" url="?curid=58916" title="Battle of CrÃ©cy">
<text>The Battle of CrÃ©cy took place on 26 August 1346 in northern France between a French army commanded by King PhilipVI and an English army led by King Edward III. The French attacked the English while they were traversing northern France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French.

The English army had landed in the Cotentin Peninsula on 12 July. It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within of Paris, sacking many towns on the way. The English then marched north, hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from Flanders. Hearing that the Flemish had turned back, and having temporarily outdistanced the pursuing French, Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near CrÃ©cy-en-Ponthieu. Late on 26 August the French army, which greatly outnumbered the English, attacked.

During a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary crossbowmen was routed by Welsh and English longbowmen. The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted knights. These were disordered by their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English archers, which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English men-at-arms, who had dismounted for the battle, they had lost much of their impetus. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat was described as &quot;murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible.&quot; The French charges continued late into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French retreat.

The English then laid siege to the port of Calais. The battle crippled the French army&#x27;s ability to relieve the siege; the town fell to the English the following year and remained under English rule for more than two centuries, until 1558. CrÃ©cy established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.

==Background==

Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Following a series of disagreements between PhilipÂ VI of France () and EdwardÂ III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip&#x27;s Great Council in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward in France should be taken back into Philip&#x27;s hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, which was to last 116 years.
There followed eight years of intermittent but expensive and inconclusive warfare: Edward campaigned three times in northern France to no effect; Gascony was left almost entirely to its own devices and the French made significant inroads in attritional warfare. In early 1345 Edward attempted another campaign in the north; his main army sailed on 29 June and anchored off Sluys in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When it sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, it was scattered by a storm. There were further delays and it proved impossible to take any action with this force before winter. Meanwhile, Henry, Earl of Derby, led a whirlwind campaign through Gascony at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army. He heavily defeated two large French armies at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, captured more than 100 French towns and fortifications in PÃ©rigord and Agenais and gave the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth.

In March 1346 a French army numbering between 15,000 and 20,000, &quot;enormously superior&quot; to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field, including all the military officers of the royal household, and commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of PhilipVI, marched on Gascony. They besieged the strategically and logistically important town of Aiguillon. On 2April the &quot;arriÃ¨re-ban&quot;, the formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for the south of France. French financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive. Derby, now Lancaster, sent an urgent appeal for help to Edward. Edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal but contractually required to; his indenture with Lancaster stated that if Lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers, then Edward &quot;shall rescue him in one way or another&quot;.

Meanwhile, Edward was raising a fresh army, and assembled more than 700 vessels to transport it â the largest English fleet ever to that date. The French were aware of Edward&#x27;s efforts, and to guard against the possibility of an English landing in northern France, relied on their powerful navy. This reliance was misplaced, and the French were unable to prevent Edward successfully crossing the Channel.

==Prelude==


The English landed at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, Normandy, on 12 July 1346. They achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south. Edward&#x27;s soldiers razed every town in their path and looted whatever they could from the populace. Caen, the cultural, political, religious and financial centre of north-west Normandy, was stormed on 26 July and subsequently looted for five days. More than 5,000 French soldiers and civilians were killed; among the few prisoners was Raoul, Count of Eu, the Constable of France. On 29 July Edward sent his fleet back to England, laden with loot, with a letter ordering that reinforcements, supplies and money be collected, embarked and loaded respectively, and sent to rendezvous with his army at Crotoy, on the north bank of the mouth of the River Somme. The English marched out towards the River Seine on 1August.

The French military position was difficult. Their main army, commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of PhilipVI, was committed to the intractable siege of Aiguillon in the south west. After his surprise landing in Normandy, Edward was devastating some of the richest land in France and flaunting his ability to march at will through France. On 2August, a small English force supported by many Flemings invaded France from Flanders; French defences there were completely inadequate. The treasury was all but empty. On 29 July, Philip proclaimed the &quot;arriÃ¨re-ban&quot; for northern France, ordering every able-bodied male to assemble at Rouen, where Philip himself arrived on the 31st. On 7August, the English reached the Seine, south of Rouen, and turned south-east. By 12 August, Edward&#x27;s army was encamped at Poissy, from Paris, having left a 20-mile-wide swathe of destruction down the left bank of the Seine, burning villages to within of Paris. Philip&#x27;s army marched parallel to the English on the other bank, and in turn encamped north of Paris, where it was steadily reinforced. Paris was in uproar, swollen with refugees, and preparations were made to defend the capital street by street.
Philip sent orders to Duke John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north, which after delay and vacillation he did on 20 August â though he would ultimately not arrive in time to change the course of events in the north. The French army outside Paris consisted of some 8,000 men-at-arms, 6,000 crossbowmen, and many infantry levies. Philip sent a challenge on 14 August suggesting that the two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in the area. Edward indicated that he would meet Philip to the south of the Seine, without actually committing himself. On 16 August the French moved into position; Edward promptly burnt down Poissy, destroyed the bridge there, and marched north.

The French had carried out a scorched earth policy, carrying away all stores of food and so forcing the English to spread out over a wide area to forage, which greatly slowed them. Bands of French peasants attacked some of the smaller groups of foragers. Philip reached the River Somme a day&#x27;s march ahead of Edward. He based himself at Amiens and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across the Somme between Amiens and the sea. The English were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food. The French moved out of Amiens and advanced westwards, towards the English. They were now willing to give battle, knowing they would have the advantage of standing on the defensive while the English were forced to try to fight their way past them.

Edward was determined to break the French blockade of the Somme and probed at several points, vainly attacking Hangest and Pont-Remy before moving west along the river. English supplies were running out and the army was ragged, starving and beginning to suffer from a drop in morale. On the evening of 24 August the English were encamped north of Acheux while the French were away at Abbeville. During the night the English marched on a tidal ford named Blanchetaque. The far bank was defended by a force of 3,500 French. English longbowmen and mounted men-at-arms waded into the tidal river and after a short, sharp fight routed the French. The main French army had followed the English, and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons, but Edward had broken free of immediate pursuit. Such was the French confidence that Edward would not ford the Somme that the area beyond had not been denuded, allowing Edward&#x27;s army to plunder it and resupply.

Meanwhile, the Flemings, having been rebuffed by the French at Estaires, besieged BÃ©thune on 14 August. After several setbacks they fell out among themselves, burnt their siege equipment and gave up their expedition on 24 August. Edward received the news that he would not be reinforced by the Flemings shortly after crossing the Somme. The ships which were expected to be waiting off Crotoy were nowhere to be seen. Edward decided to engage Philip&#x27;s army with the force he had. Having temporarily shaken off the French pursuit, he used the respite to prepare a defensive position at CrÃ©cy-en-Ponthieu. The French returned to Abbeville, crossed the Somme at the bridge there, and doggedly set off after the English again.

==Opposing forces==
===English army===

The English army comprised almost exclusively English and Welsh soldiers, along with a handful of Normans disaffected with Philip VI and a few German mercenaries, the foreigners constituting probably no more than 150 in number. The exact size and composition of the English force is not known. Contemporary estimates vary widely; for example Froissart&#x27;s third version of his &quot;Chronicles&quot; more than doubles his estimate in the first. Modern historians have estimated its size as from 7,000 to 15,000. Andrew Ayton suggests a figure of around 14,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 5,000 longbowmen, 3,000 hobelars (light cavalry and mounted archers) and 3,500 spearmen. Clifford Rogers suggests 15,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 7,000 longbowmen, 3,250 hobelars and 2,300 spearmen. Jonathan Sumption, going by the carrying capacity of its original transport fleet, believes the force was around 7,000 to 10,000. Up to a thousand men were convicted felons serving on the promise of a pardon at the end of the campaign. Many of the English, including many of the felons, were veterans; perhaps as many as half.

The men-at-arms of both armies wore a quilted gambeson under mail armour which covered the body and limbs. This was supplemented by varying amounts of plate armour on the body and limbs, more so for wealthier and more experienced men. Heads were protected by bascinets: open-faced iron or steel helmets, with mail attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A moveable visor (face guard) protected the face. Heater shields, typically made from thin wood overlaid with leather, were carried. The English men-at-arms were all dismounted. The weapons they used are not recorded, but in similar battles they used their lances as pikes, cut them down to use as short spears, or fought with swords and battle axes.
The longbow used by the English and Welsh archers was unique to them; it took up to ten years to master and could discharge up to ten arrows per minute well over . A computer analysis in 2017 by Warsaw University of Technology demonstrated that heavy bodkin point arrows could penetrate typical plate armour of the time at . The depth of penetration would be slight at that range; predicted penetration increased as the range closed or against armour of less than the best quality available at the time. Contemporary sources speak of arrows frequently piercing armour. Archers carried one quiver of 24 arrows as standard. During the morning of the battle, they were each issued two more quivers, for a total of 72 arrows per man. This was sufficient for perhaps fifteen minutes&#x27; shooting at the maximum rate, although as the battle wore on the rate would slow. Regular resupply of ammunition would be required from the wagons to the rear; the archers would also venture forward during pauses in the fighting to retrieve arrows. Modern historians suggest that half a million arrows could have been shot during the battle.
The English army was also equipped with several types of gunpowder weapons, in unknown numbers: small guns firing lead balls; ribauldequins firing either metal arrows or grapeshot; and bombards, an early form of cannon firing metal balls in diameter. Contemporary accounts and modern historians differ as to what types of these weapons and how many were present at CrÃ©cy, but several iron balls compatible with the bombard ammunition have since been retrieved from the site of the battle.

===French army===

The exact size of the French army is even less certain, as the financial records from the CrÃ©cy campaign are lost, although there is consensus that it was substantially larger than the English. Contemporary chroniclers all note it as being extremely large for the period. The two who provide totals estimate its size as 72,000 or 120,000. The numbers of mounted men-at-arms are given as either 12,000 or 20,000. An Italian chronicler claimed 100,000 knights (men-at-arms), 12,000 infantry and 5,000 crossbowmen. Contemporary chroniclers estimated the crossbowmen present as between 2,000 and 20,000.
These numbers are described by historians as exaggerated and unrealistic, on the basis of the extant war treasury records for 1340, six years before the battle. Clifford Rogers estimates &quot;the French host was at least twice as large as the [English], and perhaps as much as three times.&quot; According to modern estimates, 8,000 mounted men-at-arms formed the core of the French army, supported by two to six thousand mercenary crossbowmen recruited by and hired from the major trading city of Genoa, and a &quot;large, though indeterminate, number of common infantry&quot;. How many common infantrymen, militia and levies of variable levels of equipment and training, were present is not known with any certainty, except that on their own they outnumbered the English army.

The French men-at-arms were equipped similarly to the English. They were mounted on entirely unarmoured horses and carried wooden lances, usually ash, tipped with iron and approximately long. Many of the men-at-arms in the French army were foreigners: many joined individually out of a spirit of adventure and the attractive rates of pay offered. Others were in contingents contributed by Philip&#x27;s allies: three kings, a prince-bishop, a duke and three counts led entourages from non-French territories.

Since Philip came to the throne, French armies had included an increasing proportion of crossbowmen. As there were few archers in France, they were usually recruited from abroad, typically Genoa; their foreign origin led to them frequently being labelled mercenaries. They were professional soldiers and in battle were protected from missiles by pavisesvery large shields with their own bearers, behind each of which three crossbowmen could shelter. A trained crossbowman could shoot his weapon approximately twice a minute to a shorter effective range than a longbowman of about .

===Initial deployments===

Edward deployed his army in a carefully selected position, facing south east on a sloping hillside, broken by copses and terracing, at CrÃ©cy-en-Ponthieu. This was in an area which Edward had inherited from his mother and well known to several of the English; it has been suggested that the position had long been considered a suitable site for a battle. The left flank was anchored against Wadicourt, while the right was protected by CrÃ©cy itself and the River Maye beyond. This made it difficult for the French to outflank them. The position had a ready line of retreat in the event that the English were defeated or put under intolerable pressure. While waiting for the French to catch up with them, the English dug pits in front of their positions, intended to disorder attacking cavalry, and set up several primitive gunpowder weapons. Edward wished to provoke the French into a mounted charge uphill against his solid infantry formations of dismounted men-at-arms, backed by Welsh spearmen and flanked by archers. The army had been in position since dawn, and so was rested and well-fed, giving them an advantage over the French, who did not rest before the battle. Having decisively defeated a large French detachment two days before, the English troops&#x27; morale was high.

The English army was divided into three battalions, or &quot;battles&quot;, deployed in a column. The King&#x27;s son, Edward, Prince of Wales, aided by the earls of Northampton and Warwick (the &#x27;constable&#x27; and &#x27;marshal&#x27; of the army, respectively), commanded the vanguard with 800 men-at-arms, 2,000 archers and 1,000 foot soldiers including Welsh spearmen. To its left, the other battle was led by the Earl of Arundel, with 800 men-at-arms and 1,200 archers. Behind them, the King commanded the reserve battle, with 700 men-at-arms and 2,000 archers. Each division was composed of men-at-arms in the centre, all on foot, with ranks of spearmen immediately behind them, and with longbowmen on each flank and in a skirmish line to their front. Many of the longbowmen were concealed in small woods, or by lying down in ripe wheat. The baggage train was positioned to the rear of the whole army, where it was circled and fortified, to serve as a park for the horses, a defence against any possible attack from the rear and a rallying point in the event of defeat.

Around noon on 26 August French scouts, advancing north from Abbeville, came in sight of the English. The crossbowmen, under Antonio Doria and Carlo Grimaldi, formed the French vanguard. Following was a large battle of mounted men-at-arms led by Count Charles of AlenÃ§on, Philip&#x27;s brother, accompanied by the blind King John of Bohemia. The next battle was led by Duke Rudolph of Lorraine and Count Louis of Blois, while Philip commanded the rearguard. As news filtered back that the English had turned to fight, the French contingents sped up, jostling with each other to reach the front of the column. The Italians stayed in the van, while the mounted men-at-arms left their accompanying infantry and wagons behind. Discipline was lost; the French were hampered by the absence of their Constable, who was normally responsible for marshalling and leading their army, but who had been captured at Caen. Once it halted, men, especially infantry, were continually joining Philip&#x27;s battle as they marched north west from Abbeville.
After reconnoitring the English position, a council of war was held where the senior French officials, who were completely confident of victory, advised an attack, but not until the next day. The army was tired from a 12-mile march, and needed to reorganise so as to be able to attack in strength. It was also known that the Count of Savoy, with more than 500 men-at-arms, was marching to join the French and was nearby. (He intercepted some of the French survivors the day after the battle). Despite this advice, the French attacked later the same afternoon; it is unclear from the contemporary sources whether this was a deliberate choice by Philip, or because too many of the French knights kept pressing forward and the battle commenced against his wishes. Philip&#x27;s plan was to use the long-range missiles of his crossbowmen to soften up the English infantry and disorder, and possibly dishearten, their formations, so as to allow the accompanying mounted men-at-arms to break into their ranks and rout them. Modern historians have generally considered this to have been a practical approach, and one with proven success against other armies.

==Battle==
===Archery duel===

The French army moved forward late in the afternoon, unfurling their sacred battle banner, the &quot;oriflamme&quot;, indicating that no prisoners would be taken. As they advanced, a sudden rainstorm broke over the field. The English archers de-strung their bows to avoid the strings becoming slackened. A contemporary account, followed by some modern historians, has the rain weakening the Genoese crossbows&#x27; strings, reducing their power and range; other modern historians state that their bowstrings were protected by leather coverings and so the Genoese were as unaffected by the storm as the English archers.

The Genoese engaged the English longbowmen in an archery duel. The longbowmen outranged their opponents and had a rate of fire more than three times greater. The crossbowmen were also without their protective pavises, which were still with the French baggage, as were their reserve supplies of ammunition. The mud also impeded their ability to reload, which required them to press the stirrups of their weapons into the ground, and thus slowed their rate of fire.

The Italians were rapidly defeated and fled; aware of their vulnerability without their pavises, they may have made only a token effort. Modern historians disagree as to how many casualties they suffered; some contemporary sources suggest they may have failed to get off any shots at all, while a recent specialist study of this duel concludes that they hastily shot perhaps two volleys, then withdrew before any real exchange with the English could develop. Italian casualties in this phase of the battle were probably light.

The knights and nobles following in AlenÃ§on&#x27;s division, hampered by the routed mercenaries, hacked at them as they retreated. By most contemporary accounts the crossbowmen were considered cowards at best and more likely traitors, and many of them were killed by the French. The clash of the retreating Genoese and the advancing French cavalry threw the leading battle into disarray. The longbowmen continued to shoot into the massed troops. The discharge of the English bombards added to the confusion, though contemporary accounts differ as to whether they inflicted significant casualties.

===Cavalry charges===

AlenÃ§on&#x27;s battle (division of the army) then launched a cavalry charge. This was disordered by its impromptu nature, by having to force its way through the fleeing Italians, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attack was further broken up by the heavy and effective shooting from the English archers, which caused many casualties. It is likely the archers preserved their ammunition until they had a reasonable chance of penetrating the French armour, which would be at a range of about . The armoured French riders had some protection, but their horses were completely unarmoured and were killed or wounded in large numbers. Disabled horses fell, spilling or trapping their riders and causing following ranks to swerve to avoid them and fall into even further disorder. Wounded horses fled across the hillside in panic. By the time the tight formation of English men-at-arms and spearmen received the French charge it had lost much of its impetus.
A contemporary described the hand-to-hand combat which ensued as &quot;murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible.&quot; Men-at-arms who lost their footing, or who were thrown from wounded horses, were trampled underfoot, crushed by falling horses and bodies and suffocated in the mud. After the battle, many French bodies were recovered with no marks on them. AlenÃ§on was among those killed. The French attack was beaten off. English infantry moved forward to knife the French wounded, loot the bodies and recover arrows. Some sources say Edward had given orders that, contrary to custom, no prisoners be taken; outnumbered as he was he did not want to lose fighting men to escorting and guarding captives. In any event, there is no record of any prisoners being taken until the next day, after the battle.

Fresh forces of French cavalry moved into position at the foot of the hill and repeated AlenÃ§on&#x27;s charge. They had the same problems as AlenÃ§on&#x27;s force, with the added disadvantage that the ground they were advancing over was littered with dead and wounded horses and men. Ayton and Preston write of &quot;long mounds of fallen warhorses and menÂ ... add[ing] significantly to the difficulties facing fresh formationsÂ ... as they sought to approach the English position.&quot; Nevertheless, they charged home, albeit in such a disordered state that they were again unable to break into the English formation. A prolonged mÃªlÃ©e resulted, with a report that at one point the Prince of Wales was beaten to his knees. One account has the Prince&#x27;s standard-bearer standing on his banner to prevent its capture. A modern historian has described the fighting as &quot;horrific carnage&quot;. Edward sent forward a detachment from his reserve battle to rescue the situation. The French were again repulsed. They came again. The English ranks were thinned, but those in the rear stepped forward to fill the gaps.

How many times the French charged is disputed, but they continued late into the night, with the dusk and then dark disorganising the French yet further. All had the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French retreat. In one attack the Count of Blois dismounted his men and had them advance on foot; the Count&#x27;s body was found on the field. The French nobility stubbornly refused to yield. There was no lack of courage on either side. Famously, blind King John of Bohemia tied his horse&#x27;s bridle to those of his attendants and galloped into the twilight; all were dragged from their horses and killed. There are accounts of entire English battles advancing on occasion to clear away broken French charges milling in front of them, then withdrawing in good order to their original positions.

Philip himself was caught up in the fighting, had two horses killed under him, and received an arrow in the jaw. The bearer of the &quot;oriflamme&quot; was a particular target for the English archers; he was seen to fall but survived, albeit abandoning the sacred banner to be captured. Finally, Philip abandoned the field of battle, although it is unclear why. It was nearly midnight and the battle petered out, with the majority of the French army melting away from the battlefield. The English slept where they had fought. The next morning substantial French forces were still arriving on the battlefield, to be charged by the English men-at-arms, now mounted, routed and pursued for miles. Their losses alone were reported as several thousand, including the Duke of Lorraine. Meanwhile, a few wounded or stunned Frenchmen were pulled from the heaps of dead men and dying horses and taken prisoner.

==Casualties==
The losses in the battle were highly asymmetrical. All contemporary sources agree that English casualties were very low. It was reported that English deaths comprised three or four men-at-arms and a small number of the rank and file, for a total of forty according to a roll-call after the battle. It has been suggested by some modern historians that this is too few and that English deaths might have numbered around three hundred. To date, only two Englishmen killed at the battle have been identified; two English knights were also taken prisoner, although it is unclear at what stage in the battle this happened.

The French casualties are considered to have been very high. According to a count made by the English heralds after the battle, the bodies of 1,542 French noble men-at-arms were found (perhaps not including the hundreds who died in the clash of the following day). More than 2,200 heraldic coats were reportedly taken from the field of battle as war booty by the English. No such count was made of the lower-born foot soldiers, as their equipment was not worth looting. No reliable figures exist for losses among them, although their casualties were also considered to have been heavy, and a large number were said to have been wounded with arrows. The dead on the second day of battle alone were said to have been exceptionally numerous, with estimates varying from 2,000 to, according to EdwardIII himself, 4,000.


A disproportionate number of magnates featured among the slain on the French side, including one king (John of Bohemia), nine princes, ten counts, a duke, an archbishop and a bishop. According to Ayton, these heavy losses can also be attributed to the chivalric ideals held by knights of the time, since nobles would have preferred to die in battle, rather than dishonourably flee the field, especially in view of their fellow knights.

No reliable figures exist for losses among the common French soldiery, although they were also considered to have been heavy. Jean Le Bel estimated 15,000â16,000. Froissart writes that the French army suffered a total of 30,000 killed or captured. The modern historian Alfred Burne estimates 10,000 infantry, as &quot;a pure guess&quot;, for a total of 12,000 French dead.

==Aftermath==

The result of the battle is described by Clifford Rogers as &quot;a total victory for the English&quot;, and by Ayton as &quot;unprecedented&quot; and &quot;a devastating military humiliation&quot;. Sumption considers it &quot;a political catastrophe for the French Crown&quot;. The battle was reported to the English parliament on 13 September in glowing terms as a sign of divine favour and justification for the huge cost of the war to date. A contemporary chronicler opined &quot;By haste and disorganisation were the French destroyed.&quot; Rogers writes that, among other factors, the English &quot;benefitted from superior organisation, cohesion and leadership&quot; and from &quot;the indiscipline of the French&quot;. According to Ayton &quot;England&#x27;s international reputation as a military power was established in an evening&#x27;s hard fighting.&quot;

Edward ended the campaign by laying siege to Calais, which fell after eleven months, the Battle of CrÃ©cy having crippled the French army&#x27;s ability to relieve the town. This secured an English entrepÃ´t into northern France which was held for two hundred years. The battle established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield. English and Welsh archers served as mercenaries in Italy in significant numbers, and some as far afield as Hungary. Modern historian Joseph Dahmus includes the Battle of CrÃ©cy in his &quot;Seven Decisive Battles of the Middle Ages&quot;.
