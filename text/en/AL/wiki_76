<text>Sam Thore Jerrie Lundwall (born 24 February 1941), published as Sam J. Lundwall, is a Swedish science fiction writer, translator, publisher and singer. He translated a number of science-fiction-related articles and works from Swedish into English.

==Career==
Lundwall debuted as a writer in the 1950s for &quot;Häpna!&quot; During the 1960s he was active as a photographer and freelance writer. He also produced the LP &quot;Visor i vår tid&quot;. In 1968, he worked as a television producer for Sveriges Radio and made a series about science fiction. In 1969, he published his first book-length work on science fiction, &quot;Science Fiction: Från begynnelsen till våra dagar&quot;. This landed him a job at Askild &amp; Kärnekull (A&amp;K) as an editor for their science fiction books. He subsequently translated this work into English, where it was published in the US in 1971 as &quot;Science Fiction: What It&#x27;s All About&quot;. This work was compared favorably to other studies of science fiction coming out at that time, such as &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;, &quot;Billion Year Spree&quot;, &quot;Seekers of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot;, and &quot;The Universe Makers&quot;. In the summer of 1973, he left A&amp;K and worked with Delta Förlag that he ran together with the literary agent Gunnar Dahl. Until the end of the 1980s Delta published about 200 science fiction books. During the 1990s Lundwall continued publishing science fiction on his own company, Sam J. Lundwall Fakta &amp; Fantasi.

Lundwall was also the editor of the science fiction magazine &quot;Jules Verne-Magasinet&quot; between 1972 and 2009 and has been active in fandom, for instance he organised conventions in Stockholm in 1961, 1963, 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979. He has been both a board member and chairman (twice) of World SF and north European coordinator for Science Fiction Writers of America. He has also been very productive as a translator.

<doc id="63316" wikidata="Q848985" url="?curid=63316" title="Microsoft Developer Network">
<text>Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) was the division of Microsoft responsible for managing the firm&#x27;s relationship with developers and testers, such as hardware developers interested in the operating system (OS), and software developers developing on the various OS platforms or using the API or scripting languages of Microsoft&#x27;s applications. The relationship management was situated in assorted media: web sites, newsletters, developer conferences, trade media, blogs and DVD distribution.

Starting in January 2020, the website was fully integrated with Microsoft Docs (itself integrated into Microsoft Learn in 2022).

== Websites ==
MSDN&#x27;s primary web presence at &quot;msdn.microsoft.com&quot; was a collection of sites for the developer community that provided information, documentation, and discussion that was authored both by Microsoft and by the community at large. Microsoft later began placing emphasis on incorporation of forums, blogs, library annotations and social bookmarking to make MSDN an open dialog with the developer community rather than a one-way service. The main website, and most of its constituent applications below were available in 56 or more languages.

=== Library ===
MSDN Library was a library of official technical documentation intended for independent developers of software for Microsoft Windows. MSDN Library documented the APIs that ship with Microsoft products and also included sample code, technical articles, and other programming information. The library was freely available on the web, with CDs and DVDs of the most recent materials initially issued quarterly as part of an MSDN subscription. However, beginning in 2006, they were available to be freely downloaded from Microsoft Download Center in the form of ISO images. 

Visual Studio Express edition integrated only with MSDN Express Library, which was a subset of the full MSDN Library, although either edition of the MSDN Library could be freely downloaded and installed standalone.

In Visual Studio 2010 MSDN Library was replaced with the new Help System, which was installed as a part of Visual Studio 2010 installation. Help Library Manager was used to install Help Content books covering selected topics.

In 2016, Microsoft introduced the new technical documentation platform, Microsoft Docs, intended as a replacement of the TechNet and MSDN libraries. Over the next two years, the content of the MSDN Library was gradually migrated into Microsoft Docs. In 2022, Microsoft Docs was itself incorporated into Microsoft Learn. MSDN Library pages now redirect to the corresponding Microsoft Learn pages.

==== Integration with Visual Studio ====
Each edition of MSDN Library could only be accessed with one help viewer (Microsoft Document Explorer or other help viewer), which was integrated with the &quot;then current&quot; single version or sometimes two versions of Visual Studio. In addition, each new version of Visual Studio did not integrate with an earlier version of MSDN. A compatible MSDN Library was released with each new version of Visual Studio and included on the Visual Studio DVD. As newer versions of Visual Studio were released, newer editions of MSDN Library did not integrate with older Visual Studio versions and did not even include old/obsolete documentation for deprecated or discontinued products. MSDN Library versions could be installed side-by-side, that is, both the older as well as the newer versions of MSDN Library could co-exist.

=== Forums ===
MSDN Forums were the web-based forums used by the community to discuss a wide variety of software development topics. MSDN Forums were migrated to an all-new platform during 2008 that provided new features designed to improve efficiency such as inline preview of threads, AJAX filtering, and a slide-up post editor.

=== Blogs ===
MSDN blogs was a series of blogs that were hosted under Microsoft&#x27;s domain codice_1. Some blogs were dedicated to a product – e.g. Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, PowerShell – or a version of a product – e.g. Windows 7, Windows 8 – while others belonged to a Microsoft employee, e.g. Michael Howard or Raymond Chen. In May 2020, the MSDN and TechNet blogs were closed and the content was archived at Microsoft Docs.

=== Social bookmarking ===
Social bookmarking on MSDN Social was first launched in 2008, built on a new web platform that had user-tagging and feeds at its core. The goal of the social bookmarking application was to provide a method whereby members of the developer community could:
* Contribute to a database of quality links on any topic from across the web. By filtering on one or more tags, (e.g. &quot;.net&quot; and &quot;database&quot;) users could discover popular or recent links and subscribe to a feed of those links.
* Find and follow experts&#x27; recommended sites. Each profile page included a feed of the user&#x27;s contributions. Users could be discovered through a drop-down menu on each bookmark.
* Demonstrate their expertise through the links displayed in their profile.
* Store their favorite links online.
The initial release of the application provided standard features for the genre, including a bookmarklet and import capabilities. The MSDN web site was also starting to incorporate feeds of social bookmarks from experts and the community, displayed alongside feeds from relevant bloggers.

The social bookmarking feature was discontinued on October 1, 2009.

=== Gallery ===
MSDN Gallery was a repository of community-authored code samples and projects. Launched in 2008, the purpose of the site evolved to complement Codeplex, the open-source project hosting site from Microsoft. MSDN Gallery was retired in 2002 and all MSDN pages now redirect to the new code samples experience on Microsoft Learn.

==Software subscriptions==
MSDN had historically offered a subscription package whereby developers had access and licenses to use nearly all Microsoft software that had ever been released to the public. Subscriptions were sold on an annual basis, and cost anywhere from US$1,000 to US$6,000 per year per subscription, as it was offered in several tiers.

Although in most cases the software itself functioned exactly like the full product, the MSDN end-user license agreement prohibited use of the software in a business production environment. This was a legal restriction, not a technical one. An exception was made for Microsoft Office, allowing personal use &quot;even for business purposes&quot; without a separate license—but only with the &quot;MSDN Premium Subscription&quot; and even so only &quot;directly related to the design, development and test and/or documentation of software projects;&quot; this &quot;does not terminate&quot;

==&quot;MSDN Magazine&quot;==
Microsoft provided editorial content for &quot;MSDN Magazine&quot;, a monthly publication. The magazine was created as a merger between &quot;Microsoft Systems Journal&quot; (MSJ) and &quot;Microsoft Internet Developer&quot; (MIND) magazines in March 2000. 

MSJ back issues were available online. &quot;MSDN Magazine&quot; was available as a print magazine in the United States, and online in 11 languages. The last issue of the magazine was released in November 2019.

===Microsoft Systems Journal===
Microsoft Systems Journal was a 1986-founded bi-monthly Microsoft magazine.

== History ==
MSDN was launched in September 1992 as a quarterly, CD-ROM-based compilation of technical articles, sample code, and software development kits. The first two MSDN CD releases (September 1992 and January 1993) were marked as pre-release discs (P1 and P2, respectively). Disc 3, released in April 1993, was the first full release. In addition to CDs, there was a 16-page tabloid newspaper, &quot;Microsoft Developer Network News&quot;, edited by Andrew Himes, who had previously been the founding editor of MacTech, the premiere Macintosh technology journal. A Level II subscription was added in 1993, that included the MAPI, ODBC, TAPI and VFW SDKs.
MSDN2 was opened in November 2004 as a source for Visual Studio 2005 API information, with noteworthy differences being updated web site code, conforming better to web standards and thus giving a long-awaited improved support for alternative web browsers to Internet Explorer in the API browser. In 2008, the original MSDN cluster was retired and MSDN2 became msdn.microsoft.com.

=== Dr GUI and the MSDN Writers Team ===
In 1996, Bob Gunderson began writing a column in &quot;Microsoft Developer Network News&quot;, edited by Andrew Himes, using the pseudonym &quot;Dr.GUI&quot;. The column provided answers to questions submitted by MSDN subscribers. The caricature of Dr. GUI was based on a photo of Gunderson. When he left the MSDN team, Dennis Crain took over the Dr. GUI role and added medical humor to the column. Upon his departure, Dr. GUI became the composite identity of the original group (most notably Paul Johns) of Developer Technology Engineers that provided in-depth technical articles to the Library. The early members included: Bob Gunderson, Dale Rogerson, Rüdiger R. Asche, Ken Lassesen, Nigel Thompson (a.k.a. Herman Rodent), Nancy Cluts, Paul Johns, Dennis Crain, and Ken Bergmann. Nigel Thompson was the development manager for Windows Multimedia Extensions that originally added multimedia capabilities to Windows. Renan Jeffreis produced the original system (Panda) to publish MSDN on the Internet and in HTML instead of the earlier multimedia viewer engine. Dale Rogerson, Nigel Thompson and Nancy Cluts all published MS Press books while on the MSDN team. As of August 2010, only Dennis Crain and Dale Rogerson remain employed by Microsoft.

<text>The Christian right are Christian political factions characterized by their strong support of socially conservative and traditionalist policies. Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.

In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition which was formed around a core of conservative Evangelical Protestants and conservative Roman Catholics. The Christian right draws additional support from politically conservative mainline Protestants, Orthodox Jews, and Mormons. The movement in American politics became dominant in American conservatism starting in the late 1970s. The Christian right gained powerful influence within the Republican party during the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States in the 1980s. Its influence draws from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues. It is part of social conservatism in the United States.

The Christian right has advanced socially conservative positions on issues such as creationism in public education, school prayer, temperance, Christian nationalism, Christian Zionism, and Sunday Sabbatarianism, as well as opposition to the teaching of biological evolution, embryonic stem cell research, LGBT rights, comprehensive sex education, abortion, euthanasia, pornography, secularism and use of drugs. Although the term &quot;Christian right&quot; is most commonly associated with politics in the United States, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority countries.

==Terminology==
The Christian right is also known as the &quot;New Christian Right&quot; (NCR) or the &quot;Religious Right&quot;, although some consider the religious right to be &quot;a slightly broader category than Christian Right&quot;.

John C. Green of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life states that Jerry Falwell used the label &quot;religious right&quot; to describe himself. Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for Focus on the Family, states that &quot;[t]erms like &#x27;religious right&#x27; have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism. The phrase &#x27;socially conservative evangelicals&#x27; is not very exciting, but that&#x27;s certainly the way to do it.&quot;

Evangelical leaders like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council have called attention to the problem of equating the term &quot;Christian right&quot; with Evangelical Protestants. Although evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all evangelicals fit the description, and a number of Roman Catholics are also members of the Christian right&#x27;s core base. The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that the label &quot;religious conservative&quot; or &quot;conservative Christian&quot; may apply to other religious groups as well. For instance, Anabaptist Christians (most notably Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians) are theologically, socially, and culturally conservative; however, there are no overtly political organizations associated with these Christian denominations, which are usually uninvolved, uninterested, apathetic, or indifferent towards politics. Evangelical theologian and pastor Tim Keller stated that conservative Christianity (theology) predates the Christian right (politics). Keller asserted that being a theological conservative does not require a person to be a political conservative, and that some political progressive views around economics, helping the poor, the redistribution of wealth, and racial diversity are compatible with theologically conservative Christianity. Conservative writer Rod Dreher has stated that a Christian can be theologically conservative while still holding left-wing economic views or even socialist views.

==History==
=== Background and predecessors ===
In 1863, representatives from eleven Christian denominations in the United States organized the National Reform Association. The organization&#x27;s goal was to amend the U.S. Constitution to make the country a Christian state. The National Reform Association is one of the first organizations through which adherents from several Christian denominations worked together in an attempt to enshrine Christianity in American government. The Christian Civic League of Maine, founded in 1897, and other early organizations of the Christian right supported the aims of the temperance movement. During the 19th and early 20th century there were also a number of evangelicals who supported progressive causes. The Scopes trial in 1925 reportedly resulted in most evangelicals abandoning the political arena in an organized fashion. However, an evangelical subculture arose, which was largely secluded from the outside world, but consisted of a number of organizations and institutions, and would ultimately lay the groundwork for the emergence of the religious right in the late 1970s.

While the influence of the Christian right is typically traced to the late 1970s, Daniel K. Williams argues in &quot;God&#x27;s Own Party&quot; that it had actually been involved in politics for most of the twentieth century. He also notes that the Christian right had previously been in alliance with the Republican Party in the 1940s through 1960s on matters such as opposition to communism and defending &quot;a Protestant-based moral order&quot;. Similarly, scholar Celestini Carmen traces the John Birch Society (JBS)&#x27;s focus on culture war issues and rhetoric of apocalypticism, conspiratorialism, and fear to the rise of the Christian right through JBS members and Christian right activists Tim LaHaye, Phyllis Schlafly, and others.

In light of the state atheism espoused by communist countries during the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s, secularization came to be seen by many Americans as the biggest threat to American and Christian values. These fears resulted in a number of actions by the federal government throughout the 1950s, including the establishment of the National Day of Prayer, the addition of the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to U.S. currency, and the addition of the words &quot;Under God&quot; to the Pledge of Allegiance. The alienation of Southern Democrats from the Democratic Party contributed to the rise of the right, as the counterculture of the 1960s provoked fear of social disintegration amongst many conservatives. In addition, as the Democratic Party became identified with liberal policies and nontraditional societal values, social conservatives joined the Republican Party in increasing numbers. Despite these trends, many white evangelicals remained politically inactive and were not a unified voting bloc, with many in the evangelical left believing political activism and engagement to be inconsistent with their beliefs.

===Early history and rise, 1970s-1980s===
The movement that would become the religious right had much of its origin in the work and activism of conservative operative Paul Weyrich, who had foreseen the potential to organize evangelicals and conservative Catholics into a political force in the early 1960s, and had reportedly started trying to do so during the 1964 Presidential election campaign. Weyrich tried a number of wedge issues throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, including abortion, pornography, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and school prayer, without success. Weyrich was not successful until the legality of segregation academies began to be challenged in the early 1970s. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service adopted a policy of rescinding the tax exempt status of private schools which did not admit African Americans, and the following year, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Coit v. Green&quot; that organizations that voluntarily practice racial discrimination are not eligible for tax exemption. The origin of this case was a legal challenge to the tax exempt status of a group of segregation academies in Holmes County, Mississippi. Many of the schools targeted by these rulings were church-sponsored, and these actions reportedly caught the attention of a number of evangelical leaders, including Jerry Falwell. The largest educational institution targeted by the IRS was Bob Jones University, which lost its tax exemption in 1976 due to its policy prohibiting interracial dating. This action reportedly further caught the ire of evangelical leaders, many of whom believed that the IRS was overstepping its legal authority. Weyrich also sought to frame the IRS crackdown on segregation academics as an issue of government intrusion and attacks on religious freedom, effectively diverting attention from the racial aspect of the issue.

In the 1976 Presidential election, Jimmy Carter, who described himself as an evangelical and a born-again Christian, received the support of a majority of American evangelicals and the emerging Christian right largely because of his much-acclaimed religious conversion. However, the issue of segregation academies carried over into Carter&#x27;s presidency, and in 1978, the IRS proposed a new rule which would have revoked the tax exemption of private schools based on their racial demographic composition relative to that of their respective communities. While this rule never went into effect, it provoked fierce backlash and protests from evangelical leaders and church congregants alike, with many believing it to be an attack on non-discriminatory institutions and religious freedom. The IRS reportedly received over 150,000 letters in opposition to this proposal, mostly from Christians. This action reportedly encouraged many white evangelicals to become politically active for the first time, and turned them against Jimmy Carter. Weyrich later stated that what got evangelicals involved in politics was &quot;Jimmy Carter&#x27;s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de facto segregation&quot;, and Richard Viguerie said that the 1978 IRS action &quot;kicked a sleeping dog.&quot; Others, including religious right leader Ed Dobson and conservative activist Grover Norquist have affirmed this as the beginnings of the religious right.

Around the same time, Weyrich began to realize that support for segregation academies was not a viable issue, and began to look for other issues. The unexpected success of mostly Catholic anti-abortion activists in the 1978 midterms convinced Weyrich that opposition to abortion might work as a wedge issue to keep evangelicals politically mobilized. He favored the issue because it could be framed in the context of family values and be used to claim moral superiority, as well as attack second-wave feminism. Prior to this time, the Catholic Church was the only Christian denomination that was staunchly anti-abortion, with many Protestant and evangelical denominations, including the Southern Baptist Convention, either supporting the legalization of the procedure in some circumstances, or not taking a stance on the issue. The following year, filmmaker Frank Schaeffer produced a series of anti-abortion films titled &quot;Whatever Happened to the Human Race?&quot;, starring his father, evangelist Francis Schaeffer and pediatric surgeon Dr. C. Everett Koop. That same year, abortion was reportedly suggested as a wedge issue during a conference call between a number of religious right leaders, although many were still skeptical of its ability to mobilize evangelicals. Schaeffer&#x27;s films were also reportedly met with tepid reception during a tour in which they were shown at numerous churches around the United States, and leaders like Jerry Falwell were initially hesitant to utilize abortion, believing that its stereotype amongst evangelicals as a &quot;Catholic issue&quot; would hinder its ability to politically mobilize them. It was not until the early 1980s that abortion would become in effect the signature wedge issue of the religious right, and conservative evangelicals began joining the anti-abortion movement in large numbers.

In 1979, the Moral Majority, widely considered the first religious right organization, was founded by Falwell, Weyrich, and other associates, and began emphasizing such issues as abortion, pornography, gay rights, and opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, and a perceived moral decline of the United States, and played a major role in mobilizing evangelicals to support Ronald Reagan in the 1980 Presidential election. In response to the rise of the Christian right, the 1980 Republican Party platform assumed a number of its positions, including adding support for a restoration of school prayer. While the platform also opposed abortion and leaned towards restricting taxpayer funding for abortions and passing a constitutional amendment which would restore protection of the right to life for unborn children, it also accepted the fact that many Americans, including fellow Republicans, were divided on the issue. At this time, both major political parties were divided internally on the abortion issue, and it was not until the late 1980s that abortion came to be viewed as a strictly partisan issue. Over the next two decades religious citizens became more politically active in a time period labeled the New Christian Right. In addition to the Moral Majority (which dissolved in the late 1980s), the religious right came to be associated with a number of organizations throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family, the Alliance Defending Freedom the Family Research Council and the American Center for Law &amp; Justice.

===Later history, 1990s to present===

Since its inception, the Christian Right has engaged in battles over abortion, euthanasia, contraception, pornography, gambling, obscenity, Christian nationalism, Sunday Sabbatarianism (concerning Sunday blue laws), state sanctioned prayer in public schools, textbook contents (concerning creationism), homosexuality, and sexual education. Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Christian Coalition, stated that the 1988 presidential campaign of Pat Robertson was the &#x27;political crucible&#x27; that led to the proliferation of Christian Right groups in the United States. The Christian right is perhaps best known for its allliance with the U.S. anti-abortion movement and its efforts to overturn the 1973 &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling, which established abortion as a constitutionally protected right in the U.S. Changing political context led to the Christian Right&#x27;s advocacy for other issues, such as opposition to euthanasia and campaigning for abstinence-only sex education.

In the 2016 Presidential election, the religious right staunchly supported President Donald Trump, who promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Many evangelicals were initially hesitant to support Trump, due to his character flaws and lack of religiosity. Trump ultimately appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, all of whom voted to overturn the decision in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; in 2022. Trump&#x27;s support amongst evangelicals has also been attributed by some, including journalist Tim Alberta, to be a result of a fear that many white evangelicals have of losing their power. Since the 1990s, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has declined, part of a larger trend of a decline of Christian affiliation throughout the Western World. Alberta, and others, have argued that many white evangelicals see Trump as a savior figure, and that his rhetoric about returning the United States to a perceived state of former greatness, embodied by his campaign slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, resonates strongly with them. In addition to their declining numbers, many have also reported a fear of being under siege by an increasingly secularizing world, which some scholars and commentators have argued has led them to embrace Trump&#x27;s policies. On many occasions, Trump has stated that he believes Christianity is under attack in the United States. Trump continued to receive strong support from the religious right in the 2020 and 2024 Presidential elections. Since the 2010s, the religious right has increasingly supported other measures targeting the separation of church in state, including school vouchers and efforts to integrate the Bible and The Ten Commandments into public school curricula.

===Organizational ability===
====Grassroots activism====
Much of the Christian right&#x27;s power within the American political system is attributed to their extraordinary turnout rate at the polls. The voters that coexist in the Christian right are also highly motivated and driven to get out a viewpoint on issues they care about. As well as high voter turnout, they can be counted on to attend political events, knock on doors and distribute literature. Members of the Christian right are willing to do the electoral work needed to see their candidate elected. Because of their high level of devotion, the Christian right does not need to monetarily compensate these people for their work.

====Political leaders and institutions====
Led by Robert Grant advocacy group Christian Voice, Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority, Ed McAteer&#x27;s Religious Roundtable Council, James Dobson&#x27;s Focus on the Family, Paul Weyrich&#x27;s Free Congress Foundation and The Heritage Foundation, and Pat Robertson&#x27;s Christian Broadcasting Network, the new Religious Right combined conservative politics with evangelical and fundamentalist teachings. The birth of the New Christian right, however, is usually traced to a 1979 meeting where televangelist Jerry Falwell was urged to create a &quot;Moral Majority&quot; organization. In 1979, Weyrich was in a discussion with Falwell when he remarked that there was a &quot;moral majority&quot; of Americans ready to be called to political action. Weyrich later recalled in a 2007 interview with the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; that after he mentioned the term &quot;moral majority&quot;, Falwell &quot;turned to his people and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the name of our organization.

Weyrich would then engineer a strong union between the Republican Party and many culturally conservative Christians. Soon, Moral Majority became a general term for the conservative political activism of evangelists and fundamentalists such as Pat Robertson, James Robison, and Jerry Falwell. Howard Schweber, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that &quot;in the past two decades&quot;, &quot;Catholic politicians have emerged as leading figures in the religious conservative movement.&quot;

==Institutions in the United States==
===National organizations===

An early attempt to bring the Christian right into American politics began in 1974 when Robert Grant, a movement leader, who founded the American Christian Cause to advocate Christian ideological teachings in Southern California. Concerned that Christians overwhelmingly voted for President Jimmy Carter in 1976, Grant founded Christian Voice to rally Christian voters behind socially conservative candidates. Prior to his alliance with Falwell, Weyrich sought an alliance with Grant. Grant and other Christian Voice staff soon set up their main office at the headquarters of Weyrich&#x27;s Heritage Foundation. The alliance between Weyrich and Grant fell apart in 1978.

In the late 1980s, Pat Robertson founded the Christian Coalition of America, building from his 1988 presidential run, with Republican activist Ralph Reed, who became the spokesman for the Coalition. In 1992, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, began producing voter guides, which it distributed to conservative Christian churches, both Protestant and Catholic, with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Under the leadership of Reed and Robertson, the Coalition quickly became the most prominent voice in the conservative Christian movement, its influence culminating with an effort to support the election of a conservative Christian to the presidency in 1996. In addition, they have encouraged the convergence of conservative Christian ideology with political issues, such as healthcare, the economy, education and crime.

Political activists lobbied within the Republican party locally and nationally to influence party platforms and nominations. More recently James Dobson&#x27;s group Focus on the Family, based in Colorado Springs, and the Family Research Council in Washington D.C. have gained enormous respect from Republican lawmakers. While strongly advocating for these ideological matters, Dobson himself is warier of the political spectrum and much of the resources of his group are devoted to other aims such as media. However, as a private citizen, Dobson has stated his opinion on presidential elections; on February 5, 2008, Dobson issued a statement regarding the 2008 presidential election and his strong disappointment with the Republican party&#x27;s candidates.

In an essay written in 1996, Ralph Reed argued against the moral absolutist tone of Christian right leaders, arguing for the Republican Party Platform to stress the moral dimension of abortion rather than placing emphasis on overturning Roe v. Wade. Reed believes that pragmatism is the best way to advocate for the Christian right.

===Partisan activity of churches===
Overtly partisan actions by churches could threaten their 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status due to the Johnson Amendment of the Internal Revenue Code. In one notable example, the former pastor of the East Waynesville Baptist Church in Waynesville, North Carolina &quot;told the congregation that anyone who planned to vote for Democratic Sen. John Kerry should either leave the church or repent&quot;. The church later expelled nine members who had voted for Kerry and refused to repent, which led to criticism on the national level. The pastor resigned and the ousted church members were allowed to return.

The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian right group now known as the Alliance Defending Freedom, started the Pulpit Freedom Initiative in 2008. ADF states that &quot;[t]he goal of Pulpit Freedom Sunday is simple: have the Johnson Amendment declared unconstitutional – and once and for all remove the ability of the IRS to censor what a pastor says from the pulpit.&quot;

===Electoral activity===

Both Christian right and secular polling organizations sometimes conduct polls to determine which presidential candidates will receive the support of Christian right constituents. One such poll is taken at the Family Research Council&#x27;s Values Voter Summit. George W. Bush&#x27;s electoral success owed much to his overwhelming support from white evangelical voters, who comprise 23% of the vote. In 2000 he received 68% of the white evangelical vote; in 2004 that percentage rose to 78%. In 2016, Donald Trump received 81% of the white evangelical vote.

===Education===

The Home School Legal Defense Association was co-founded in 1983 by Michael Farris, who would later establish Generation Joshua and Patrick Henry College, and Michael Smith. This organization attempts to challenge laws that serve as obstacles to allowing parents to home-school their children and to organize the disparate group of homeschooling families into a cohesive bloc. The number of homeschooling families has increased in the last twenty years, and around 80 percent of these families identify themselves as evangelicals.

The main universities associated with the Christian right in the United States are:
* Bob Jones University – Protestant Fundamentalist institution, founded in 1927.
* Christendom College – Roman Catholic institution, founded in 1977
* Liberty University – Baptist institution, founded in 1971
* Regent University – Evangelical Christian institution, founded in 1977

===Media===

The media has played a major role in the rise of the Christian right since the 1920s and has continued to be a powerful force for political Christianity today. The role of the media for the Religious right has been influential in its ability to connect Christian audiences to the larger American culture while at the same time bringing and keeping religion into play as both a political and a cultural force. The political agenda of the Christian right has been disseminated to the public through a variety of media outlets including radio broadcasting, television, and literature.

Religious broadcasting began in the 1920s through the radio. Between the 1950s and 1980s, TV became a powerful way for the Christian right to influence the public through shows such as Pat Robertson&#x27;s &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and The Family Channel (now Freeform). The Internet has also helped the Christian right reach a much larger audience. These organizations&#x27; websites play a strong role in popularising the Christian right&#x27;s stances on cultural and political issues, and inform interested viewers on how to get involved. For example, the Christian Coalition of America has used the Internet to inform the public, as well as to sell merchandise and gather members.

==Views==

===Education===
The Christian right strongly advocates for a system of educational choice, using a system of school vouchers, instead of public education. Vouchers would be government funded and could be redeemed for &quot;a specified maximum sum per child per years if spent on approved educational services&quot;. This method would allow parents to determine which school their child attends while relieving the economic burden associated with private schools. The concept is popular among constituents of church-related schools, including those affiliated with Roman Catholicism.

===Evolution===

The Protestant members of the Christian right in the United States generally promote the teaching of creationism and intelligent design as opposed to, or alongside, biological evolution. Some supporters of the Christian right have opposed the teaching of evolution in the past, but they did not have the ability to stop it being taught in public schools as was done during the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, in which a science teacher went on trial for teaching about the subject of evolution in a public school. Other &quot;Christian right organizations supported the teaching of creationism, along with evolution, in public schools&quot;, specifically promoting theistic evolution (also known as evolutionary creationism) in which God is regarded as the originator of the process.

Members of and organizations associated with the Christian right, such as the Discovery Institute, created and popularized the modern concept of intelligent design, which became widely known only with the publication of the book &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; in 1989. The Discovery Institute, through their intelligent design initiative called the &quot;Center for Science and Culture&quot;, has endorsed the teach the controversy approach. According to its proponents, such an approach would ensure that both the strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary theory were discussed in the curriculum. This tactic was criticized by Judge John E. Jones III in &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, describing it as &quot;at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard.&quot;

The overwhelming majority of scientific research, both in the United States and elsewhere, has concluded that the theory of evolution, using the technical definition of the word theory, is the only viable explanation of the development of life, and an overwhelming majority of biologists strongly support its presentation in public school science classes. Outside the United States, as well as among American Catholics and Mainline Protestants, Christian conservatives have generally come to accept the theory of evolution.

===Sex education===
Some Christian groups advocate for the removal of sex education literature from public schools, for parental opt-out of comprehensive sex education, or for abstinence-only sex education. Sam Harris has written that thirty percent of America&#x27;s sex-education programs are abstinence based and ineffective.

===Schooling===
The Christian right promotes homeschooling and private schooling as a valid alternative to public education for parents who object to the content being taught at school. The percentage of children being homeschooled rose from 1.7% of the student population in 1999 to 2.2% in 2003, and much of this increase has been attributed to the desire to incorporate Christian teachings into the curriculum. In 2003, 72% of parents who homeschooled their children cited the ability to provide religious or moral instruction as the reason for removing their children from public schools. The &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case established that creationism cannot be taught in public schools, and in response officials have increasingly appropriated public funds for charter schools that teach curricula like Accelerated Christian Education.

===Sunday Sabbatarianism===
The Christian right is in favor of legislation that maintains and promotes Sunday Sabbatarianism, such as Sunday blue laws that forbid shopping and restrict the sale of alcohol on Sundays, which is the Lord&#x27;s Day in mainstream Christianity.

===Role of government===
Supporters of the Christian right have no one unified stance on the role of government since the movement is primarily one that advocates social conservatism; in fact, &quot;struggles [have] broken out in state party organizations&quot; between supporters of the Christian right and other conservatives. It promotes conservative interpretations of the Bible as the basis for moral values and enforcing such values by legislation. Some members of the Christian right, especially Catholics, accept the Catholic Church&#x27;s strong support for labor unions.

===Church and state relations===

The Christian right believes that separation of church and state is not explicit in the American Constitution, believing instead that such separation is a creation of what it claims are activist judges in the judicial system. In the United States, the Christian right often supports their claims by stating that the country was &quot;founded by Christians as a Christian Nation.&quot; Members of the Christian right take the position that the Establishment Clause bars the federal government from establishing or sponsoring a state church (e.g., the Church of England), but does not prevent the government from acknowledging religion. The Christian right points out that the term &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is derived from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson, not from the Constitution itself. Furthermore, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) takes the view that the concept of &quot;separation of church and state&quot; has been used by the American Civil Liberties Union and its allies to inhibit public acknowledgment of Christianity and restrict the religious freedoms of Christians.

Thus, Christian right leaders have argued that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the display of religion in the public sphere. Leaders, therefore, believe that public institutions should be allowed, or even required, to display the Ten Commandments. This interpretation has been repeatedly rejected by the courts, which have found that such displays violate the Establishment Clause. Public officials though are prohibited from using their authority in which the primary effect is &quot;advancing or prohibiting religion&quot;, according to the Lemon Supreme Court test, and there cannot be an &quot;excessive entanglement with religion&quot; and the government. Some, such as Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association, argue that the First Amendment, which specifically restricts Congress, applies only to the Congress and not the states. This position rejects the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.

Generally, the Christian right supports the presence of religious institutions within government and the public sphere, and advocates for fewer restrictions on government funding for religious charities and schools. Both Catholics and Protestants, according to a 2005 Gallup study, have been supportive of school prayer in public schools.

===Economics===
Early American fundamentalists, such as John R. Rice often favored &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics and were outspoken critics of the New Deal and later the Great Society. The contemporary Christian right supports economic conservative policies such as tax cuts and social conservative policies such as child tax credits.

===Middle East===

Many evangelical Protestant supporters of the religious right have strongly supported the state of Israel in recent decades, encouraging support for Israel within the United States government. Some of them have linked Israel to Biblical prophesies; for example, Ed McAteer, founder of the Moral Majority, said &quot;I believe that we are seeing prophecy unfold so rapidly and dramatically and wonderfully and, without exaggerating, makes me breathless.&quot; This belief, an example of dispensationalism, arises from the idea that the establishment of Israel is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus, because it represents the Biblically prophesied Gathering of Israel. A 2017 poll indicates that this belief is held by 80% of evangelicals, and that half of evangelicals consider it an important cause of their support for the state of Israel.

During the Lebanese Civil War that started in 1975 and ended in 1990, many Christian parties endorsed the right&#x27;s political viewpoints such as the Christian Lebanese phalanges which is known as the Kataeb Party, and later, the right&#x27;s political viewpoints were also endorsed by the Lebanese Armed Forces because their power and influence were threatened by the growing power and influence of the more radical Islamist and left-wing movements, such as the Shiite Amal Movement, and the Progressive Socialist Party in the 1980s.

===Abortion and contraception===

Historically, large percentages of American Catholics and Evangelical Protestants oppose and have opposed abortion, believing that life begins at conception and that abortion is murder. Therefore, those in the movement have worked toward the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade (1973)&quot;, and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992). The Christian right has also supported incremental steps to make abortion less available. Such efforts include bans on late-term abortion (including intact dilation and extraction), prohibitions against Medicaid funding and other public funding for elective abortions, removal of taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortion services, legislation requiring parental consent or notification for abortions performed on minors, legal protections for unborn victims of violence, legal protections for infants born alive following failed abortions, and bans on abortifacient medications.

The Christian right element in the Reagan coalition strongly supported him in 1980, in the belief that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. They were astonished and dismayed when his first appointment was Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, whom they feared would tolerate abortion. They worked hard to defeat her confirmation but failed.

The Christian right contends that morning-after pills such as Plan B and Ella are possible abortifacients, able to interfere with a fertilized egg&#x27;s implantation in the uterine wall. The labeling mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Plan B and Ella state that they may interfere with implantation, but according to a June 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; article, many scientists believe that they work only by interfering with ovulation and are arguing to have the implantation language removed from product labels. The Christian right maintains that the chemical properties of morning-after pills make them abortifacients and that the politics of abortion is influencing scientific judgments. Jonathan Imbody of the Christian Medical Association says he questions &quot;whether ideological considerations are driving these decisions.&quot; Specifically, many Catholic members, as well as some conservative Protestant members, of the Christian right have campaigned against contraception altogether.

In May 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; published a leaked draft majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito. It would overturn &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; by nullifying the specific privacy rights in question, eliminating federal involvement, and leaving the issue to be determined by the states. Through a statement made by the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, the Court confirmed the document&#x27;s authenticity but said that it was not a final decision or the Justice&#x27;s final decision, which was expected by June or July.

The decision was issued on June 24, 2022, ruling 6–3 to reverse the lower court rulings; a more narrow 5–4 ruling overturned &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;. The majority opinion stated that abortion was not a constitutional right, and that states should have discretion in regulating abortion. The majority opinion, written by Alito, was substantially similar to the leaked draft. Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the judgment upholding the Mississippi law but did not join the majority in the opinion to overturn &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;.

===Biotechnology===
Due to the Christian right&#x27;s views regarding ethics and to an extent due to negative views of eugenics common to most ideologies in North America, it has worked for the regulation and restriction of certain applications of biotechnology. In particular, the Christian right opposes therapeutic and reproductive human cloning, championing a 2005 United Nations ban on the practice, and human embryonic stem cell research, which involves the extraction of one or more cells from a human embryo. The Christian right supports research with adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells which do not use cells from human embryos, as they view the harvesting of biological material from an embryo lacking the ability to give permission as an assault on a living being.

The Christian right also opposes euthanasia, and, in one highly publicized case, took an active role in seeking governmental intervention to prevent Terri Schiavo from being deprived of nutrition and hydration.

===Opposition to drugs===

The Christian right has historically supported the temperance movement, thus supporting causes such as maintaining Sunday blue laws, adding alcohol packaging warning messages to bottles and limiting alcohol advertising. It has advocated for the prohibition of drugs and has opposed efforts to legalize marijuana.

===Sex and sexuality===

The modern roots of the Christian right&#x27;s views on sexual matters were evident in the years 1950s–1960s, a period in which many conservative Christians in the United States viewed sexual promiscuity as not only excessive, but in fact as a threat to their ideal vision of the country. Beginning in the 1970s, conservative Christian protests against promiscuity began to surface, largely as a reaction to the &quot;permissive Sixties&quot; and changes in sexual behavior confirmed by &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and the LGBT rights movement. The Christian right proceeded to make sexuality issues a priority political cause.

Anita Bryant organized Save Our Children, a widespread campaign to oppose legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The group argued that gay people were &quot;recruiting&quot; or &quot;molesting children&quot; in order to make them gay. Bryant said, &quot;As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children,&quot; and also said that &quot;If gays are granted rights, next we&#x27;ll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters.&quot; The Bryant campaign achieved success in repealing some city anti-discrimination laws, and proposed other citizen initiatives such as a failed California ballot question designed to ban gay people or those who supported LGBT rights from holding public teaching jobs. Bryant&#x27;s campaign attracted widespread opposition and boycotts which put her out of business.

From the late 1970s onwards, some conservative Christian organizations such as the Christian Broadcasting Network, Focus on the Family, Concerned Women for America, the American Family Association, and the Christian Coalition of America, along with right-wing Christian hate groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church, have been outspoken against LGBT rights. Late in 1979, a new religious revival among conservative Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics ushered in the Republican coalition politically aligned with the Christian right that would reign in the United States between the years 1970s and 1980s, becoming another obstacle for the progress of the LGBTQ rights movement. During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, LGBTQ communities were further stigmatized as they became the focus of mass hysteria and suffered isolation, marginalization and violence.

The Christian right champions itself as the &quot;self-appointed conscience of American society&quot;. During the 1980s, the movement was largely dismissed by political pundits and mainstream religious leaders as &quot;a collection of buffoonish has-beens&quot;. Later, it re-emerged, better organized and more focused, taking firm positions against abortion, pornography, sexual deviancy, and extreme feminism. Beginning around the first presidency of Donald Trump, Christian conservatives have largely refrained from engaging in debates about sexual morality.

Influential Christian right organizations at the forefront of the anti-gay rights movement in the United States include Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, and the Family Research Institute. An important stratagem in Christian right anti-gay politics is in its rejection of &quot;the edicts of a Big Brother&quot; state, allowing it to profit from &quot;a general feeling of discontent and demoralization with government&quot;. As a result, the Christian right has endorsed smaller government, restricting its ability to arbitrate in disputes regarding values and traditions. In this context, gay rights laws have come to symbolize the government&#x27;s allegedly unconstitutional &quot;[interference] with individual freedom&quot;.

The central tenets of Focus on the Family and similar organizations, such as the Family Research Council, emphasise issues such as abortion and the necessity of gender roles. A number of organizations, including the New Christian Right, &quot;have in various ways rejected liberal America in favor of the regulation of pornography, anti-abortion legislation, the criminalization of homosexuality, and the virtues of faithfulness and loyalty in sexual partnerships&quot;, according to sociologist Bryan S. Turner.

Some members of the Christian right view same-sex marriage as a central issue in the culture wars, more so than other gay rights issues and even more significantly than abortion. The legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2004 changed the Christian right, causing it to put its opposition to these marriages above most other issues. It also created previously unknown interracial and ecumenical coalitions, and stimulated new electoral activity in pastors and congregations.

==Criticism==

Criticisms of the Christian right often come from Christians who believe Jesus&#x27; message was centered on social responsibility and social justice. Theologian Michael Lerner has summarized: &quot;The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a revulsion against God and religion by identifying them with militarism, ecological irresponsibility, fundamentalist antagonism to science and rational thought, and insensitivity to the needs of the poor and the powerless.&quot;

Commentators such as Rob Schenck, Randall Balmer, and Charles M. Blow criticized the Christian right for its tolerance and embrace of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election despite Trump&#x27;s failure to adhere to any of the principles advocated by the Christian right groups for decades. In a 2023 interview with NPR, Russell D. Moore stated that he had come to believe that Christianity was &quot;in a crisis&quot; after hearing multiple pastors speak of congregation members rejecting quotes from the Sermon on the Mount as &quot;liberal talking points&quot; and not backing down upon being informed of their source.

===Interpretation of Christianity===

One argument which questions the legitimacy of the Christian right posits that Jesus Christ may be considered a leftist on the modern political spectrum. Jesus&#x27; concern with the poor and feeding the hungry, among other things, are argued, by proponents of Christian leftism, to be core attributes of modern-day socialism and social justice. However, others contend that while Jesus&#x27; concern for the poor and hungry is virtuous and that individuals have a moral obligation to help others, the relationship between charity and the state should not be construed in the same manner.

According to Frank Newport of Gallup, &quot;there are fewer Americans today who are both highly religious and liberal than there are Americans who are both highly religious and conservative.&quot; Newport also noted that 52% of white conservatives identify as &quot;highly religious&quot; while only 16% of white liberals identify as the same. However, African-Americans, &quot;the most religious of any major racial or ethnic group in the country&quot;, are &quot;strongly oriented to voting Democratic&quot;. While observing that African-American Democrats are more religious than their white Democrat counterparts, Newport further noted, however, that African-American Democrats are &quot;much more likely to be ideologically moderate or conservative.&quot;

Some criticize what they see as a politicization of Christianity because they say Jesus transcends political concepts.

Mikhail Gorbachev referred to Jesus as &quot;the first Socialist&quot;.

===Race and diversity===
The Christian right has tried to recruit social conservatives in the black church. Prior to the 2016 United States presidential election, African-American Republican Ben Carson emerged as a leader of the Christian right. Other Christian African-Americans who identify with conservatism are Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, rapper Kanye West, Alveda King, and pastor Tony Evans.

===LGBT rights===
Whilst the Christian right in the United States generally identifies with aspects of LGBT rights opposition, other Christian movements argue that the biblical texts only oppose specific types of divergent sexual behaviour, such as paederasty (i.e. sexual intercourse between boys and men). During the Trump administration, there was a growing push for religious liberty bills, aimed to exempt individuals and businesses from anti-discrimination laws intended to protect LGBT people, if they claimed that their actions were motivated by religious beliefs. Among the most powerful organizations that promoted anti-LGBT and anti-transgender legislation under the Trump administration is the Alliance Defending Freedom.

===Use of dominionism labeling===
Some social scientists have used the word &quot;dominionism&quot; to refer to adherence of dominion theology, as well as to the influence in the broader Christian Right of ideas inspired by Dominion Theology. Although such influence (particularly of Reconstructionism) has been described by many authors, full adherents to Reconstructionism are few and marginalized among conservative Christians.

In the early 1990s, sociologist Sara Diamond defined &quot;dominionism&quot; in her PhD dissertation as a movement that, while it includes Dominion Theology and Reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian Right. She was followed by journalists who included Frederick Clarkson and Chris Hedges and others who have stressed the influence of Dominionist ideas on the Christian right.

The terms &quot;dominionist&quot; and &quot;dominionism&quot; are rarely used for self-description, and their usage has been attacked from right-leaning quarters. Stanley Kurtz labeled it &quot;conspiratorial nonsense&quot;, &quot;political paranoia&quot;, and &quot;guilt by association&quot;, and decried Hedges&#x27; &quot;vague characterizations&quot; that allow him to &quot;paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless &#x27;Dominionist&#x27; Christian mass.&quot; Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian Reconstructionism:

The notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it&#x27;s downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside &quot;the old polite rules of democracy.&quot; So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians – by any means necessary.

Lisa Miller of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that many warnings about &quot;dominionism&quot; are &quot;paranoid&quot; and she also said that &quot;the word creates a siege mentality in which &#x27;we&#x27; need to guard against &#x27;them. Ross Douthat of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;many of the people that writers like Diamond and others describe as &#x27;dominionists&#x27; would disavow the label, many definitions of dominionism conflate several very different Christian political theologies, and there&#x27;s a lively debate about whether the term is even useful at all.&quot; According to Joe Carter of &quot;First Things&quot;, &quot;the term was coined in the 1980s by Diamond and is never used outside liberal blogs and websites. No reputable scholars use the term for it is a meaningless neologism that Diamond concocted for her dissertation&quot;, while Jeremy Pierce of &quot;First Things&quot; coined the word &quot;dominionismist&quot; to describe those who promote the idea that there is a dominionist conspiracy.

Another criticism has focused on the proper use of the term. Berlet wrote that &quot;some critics of the Christian Right have stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point&quot;, and argued that, rather than labeling conservatives as extremists, it would be better to &quot;talk to these people&quot; and &quot;engage them&quot;. Sara Diamond wrote that &quot;[l]iberals&#x27; writing about the Christian Right&#x27;s take-over plans has generally taken the form of conspiracy theory&quot;, and argued that instead one should &quot;analyze the subtle ways&quot; that ideas like Dominionism &quot;take hold within movements and why.&quot;

Dan Olinger, a professor at the fundamentalist Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, said, &quot;We want to be good citizens and participants, but we&#x27;re not really interested in using the iron fist of the law to compel people to do everything Christians should do.&quot; Bob Marcaurelle, interim pastor at Mountain Springs Baptist Church in Piedmont, said the Middle Ages were proof enough that Christian ruling groups are almost always corrupted by power. &quot;When Christianity becomes the government, the question is whose Christianity?&quot; Marcaurelle asked.

==Movements outside the United States==

While the Christian right is a strong movement in the United States, it also has a presence in Canada. Alan Curtis suggests that the American Christian right &quot;is a phenomenon that is very hard for Europeans to understand.&quot; Robin Pettitt, a professor at Kingston University London, states, however, that like the Christian right in the US, Christian Democratic movements in Europe and Latin America are &quot;equally driven by the debate over the role of the state and the church in political, social and moral life.&quot;

=== Australia ===

In Australia, the Christian right draws from both Catholics and Protestants. Historically, the first Christian right party was the Democratic Labor Party. The Democratic Labor Party was formed in 1955 as a split from the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In Victoria, and New South Wales, state executive members, parliamentarians and branch members associated with the Industrial Groups or B. A. Santamaria and &quot;The Movement&quot; (and therefore strongly identified with Roman Catholicism) were expelled from the party, and formed the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in Queensland, with the resulting group subsequently joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from Tasmania and New South Wales at various times, though it was much stronger in the former mentioned states. The goals of the party were anti communism, the decentralization of industry, population, administration and ownership. The party decided, in its view that the ALP was filled with communists, that it would preference the ruling conservative Liberal and Country parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist and socially compassionate than the Liberals.

The DLP heavily lost ground in the federal election of 1974 that saw its primary vote cut by nearly two-thirds, and the election of an ALP government. The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party (now the Democratic Labour Party). Though his party was effectively gone, Santamaria and his National Civic Council (NCC) took a strong diametrically opposed stance to dominant Third Way/neoliberal/New Right tendencies within both the ALP and Liberal parties throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The B. A Santamaria and the Democratic Labor party produced many alumni who became the base of the Christian right in Australia. In Liberal party, these were Tony Abbott and Kevin Andrews. Outside the Liberal party, conservative commentator&#x27;s such as Greg Sheridan and Gerrard Henderson also had links to Santamaria. Within the Australian Labor Party (ALP), this alumni can be found in the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), which de-affiliated from the ALP with the industrial Groups in the 1950s, and then re-affiliated in the 1980s. The SDA opposed gay marriage and abortion, which were some reasons for workers to form another competing union. Tony Burke, who opposed euthanasia, came from the SDA. Currently, the NCC functions as a minority organization within the Christian Right.

The more Protestant strands of the Christian Right have been far more diverse. Fundamentalist Christianity directly inspired Fred Nile and his parties. Nile in 1967–68 was assistant director of the Billy Graham Crusade in Sydney. The Christian Democratic Party (initially known as the &quot;Call to Australia&quot; party) is on the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum, promoting social conservatism, opposing gay rights and abortion. It gained 9.1% of the vote in the New South Wales (NSW) state election of 1981, Its support base has generally been restricted to NSW and Western Australia, where it usually gains between 2–4% of votes, with its support being minuscule in other states. The party started to fall apart in 2019 when the moderate faction member, Paul Green, lost his seat, and when a faction of younger people attempted to dismiss the governing board. Whilst this failed, it opened up a rift between the traditional party factions that led to prolonged legal disputes and the party winding up in 2022. Fred Nile would quickly join a new party.

The Family First Party is a former political party which was linked with Pentecostal Church and other smaller Christian denominations, and was also identified with the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum. It has had one or two members in the SA parliament since 2002, and in 2004 also managed to elect a Victorian senator. Its electoral support is small, with the largest constituencies being South Australia (4–6%), and Victoria (around 4%). Family First generally receives lower support in national elections than in state elections. Family First was merged with the Australian Conservatives Party in 2017.

Outside of the Catholic links to B.A. Santamaria and the minor Protestant parties, some party members of the Liberal and National Party Coalition and the Australian Labor Party also support some of the values of the Christian right on abortion and gay rights. The Australian Christian Lobby argues for opposition to same-sex marriage in state and federal politics.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, the evangelical caucus have a great influence at the parliament and in the society in general. The bloc promotes strong socially conservative positions, like opposition to abortion, LGBT rights, marijuana legalization, sexual and gender education at schools and support to decrease of age of defense of infancy. Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like Workers&#x27; Party or Socialism and Liberty Party, Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like Social Democratic Party, Democratas, PSL, Social Christian Party, Brazilian Republican Party, Patriota and in the Party of the Republic. In 2016, Marcelo Crivella, a licensed pentecostal pastor from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, won in a runoff the election to mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest city in Brazil, with the Brazilian Republican Party, making for the first time an evangelical bloc member mayor of a big city in Brazil. In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president with massive support of conservative Catholics, Charismatics, Evangelicals and Pentecostals; Another candidate, Cabo Daciolo, from Patriota, attracted much attention from media and public in general, despite a lower votation. Both had a right-wing populist, Christian nationalist program, but Bolsonaro was near to a national conservative and economic liberal one, contrasting with an Ultranationalist, theocratic and protectionist style of Daciolo.

===Canada===

Religion has been a key factor in Canadian politics since well before the Canadian Confederation was established in 1867, when the Conservatives were the party of traditionalist Catholics and Anglicans and the Liberals were the party of Protestant dissenters and anti-clerical Catholics. This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the Christian left (represented by the Social Gospel philosophy and ecumenicism) and the Christian right (represented by fundamentalism and biblical literalism). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the New Democratic Party while the right moved to the Social Credit Party, especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the Progressive Conservatives.

The Social Credit Party, founded in 1935, represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as &quot;worldly&quot;, and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher William Aberhart or &quot;Bible Bill&quot;. Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the monetary reform theories of social credit to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple Ernest Manning then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada

In 1987, Manning&#x27;s son, Preston Manning, founded the new Reform Party of Canada, which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the official opposition from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the Canadian Alliance in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the Conservative Party of Canada, led by Stephen Harper, a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, who went on to become prime minister in 2006.

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, introduced by the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, has been controversial within the Christian right in Canada. Although this Charter entrenches rights and freedoms (such as the freedom of religion) that central in the belief systems of the Christian right, it has also been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada to strike down many laws supported by the Christian right. In 1982, the Supreme Court struck down Canada&#x27;s &quot;Lords&#x27; Day Act,&quot; which required many stored to be closed on Sundays, as an infringement the freedom of conscience and religion. Abortion, partly decriminalized in 1969 by an act of Parliament, was completely decriminalized after the two &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot; cases (in 1988 and in 1993). Parliament attempted to pass a new law governing abortion in 1993, but this legislation failed after a tie vote in the Senate. A series of provincial superior court decisions which legalized same-sex marriage led the federal government to introduce legislation that legalized same-sex marriage in all of Canada. Before he took office, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper stated that he would hold a free vote on the issue, and declared the issue closed after it was voted down in the House of Commons in 2006.

In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Canada&#x27;s prostitution law in &quot;Canada v Bedford&quot;, prompting the Stephen Harper government to introduce a new prostitution law fashioned after the Nordic Model. In 2015, the Supreme Court struck down Canada&#x27;s prohibition on euthanasia in &quot;Carter v Canada&quot;, again leading Parliament to pass a new law governing euthanasia. The Christian right has been critical of all these judicial decisions and have generally been the greatest advocates for the stringent laws against abortion, same-sex marriage, prostitution, and euthanasia, though in differing degrees. For instance, the Christian right in Canada is strongly and vocally organized on the topic of abortion, but criticism of same-sex marriage is far more seldom. In 2021 the Canadian government passed Bill C-4, banning conversion therapy nationwide, which received opposition from the Christian Right and Conservative members of parliament. Christian Pastors altered their preaching schedules to criticize and discuss this new law.

=== The Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa ===

Christian right politics in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa is strongly connected with the growing propagation of the Evangelical-Pentecostal movement in the Global South and Third World countries. Roman Catholics in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, despite being normally socially conservative, tend to be more left-wing in economics due to the traditional teachings of the Catholic social doctrine. Evangelical-Pentecostal Christians, on the other hand, are mostly from the neo-Pentecostal movement, and thus believers in the Prosperity theology that justifies most of their neoliberal economic ideas. They are also strongly socially conservative, even for Latin American standards.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the interests of the Christian right are represented by different political organisations and civil associations. The most notable case is the National Action Party, a conservative party aligned with Christian Democratic ideas, notably influenced by the Social teaching of the Catholic Church, and which has held the presidency of Mexico twice. The party&#x27;s platform states strong opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and the legalisation of drugs, among many other conservative policies. In addition, prominent figures in the party have been linked to Catholic Church organisations. The evangelical caucus, albeit for a relatively short time, was represented by the Social Encounter Party and the Solidarity Encounter Party, the latter being the successor to the former. Both parties were founded by Hugo Eric Flores, who according to some sources was an evangelical minister before entering politics. Initially statewide for Baja California, Social Encounter came to govern that state in coalition with the National Action Party. The party would later be officialised as a political party at the federal level. Other organisations and associations adhering to the ideals of the Christian right include the Frente Nacional por la Familia, the Organización del Bien Común, colloquially known as El Yunque and with close ties to the PAN, and the Legionaries of Christ, a Roman Catholic clerical religious order of priests and candidates for the priesthood established in Mexico.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, Calvinist Protestants have long had their own political parties, now called the Reformed Political Party (SGP) on the right, and the ChristianUnion (CU) in the center. For generations they operated their own newspapers and broadcasting association. The SGP has about 28,000 members, and three out of 150 members of the Dutch parliament&#x27;s lower house. It has always been in opposition to the government.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley led a Protestant fundamentalist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which had a considerable influence on the province&#x27;s culture. For a time after the 2017 United Kingdom general election, the DUP provided confidence and supply to the governing Conservative Party, although this agreement provoked concern from socially liberal elements of the party about possible DUP influence on social policy. Although there is no evidence this occurred. Karen Armstrong has mentioned British evangelical leader Colin Urquhart as advocating positions similar to the Christian Right.

===Other countries===
In Fiji, Sodelpa is a conservative, nationalist party which seeks to make Christianity the state religion, while the constitution makes Fiji a secular republic. Following the 2014 general election, Sodelpa is the main opposition party in Parliament.

In Hungary, the ruling national-conservative party Fidesz can also be considered to be a party of the Christian right. Viktor Orbán is known for his use of conservative Christian values against immigration and the rise of Islam in Europe.

In the Philippines, due to Spanish colonization, and the introduction of the Catholic Church, religious conservatism has a strong influence on national policies. Some have argued that the U.S. Christian right may have roots in the Philippines.

In Poland, the Roman Catholic national-conservative party Law and Justice can be considered to be a party of the Christian right.

In Russia, the United Russia has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church, boosting the Kremlin&#x27;s appeal to social conservatives.

In Scandinavia, the Faroe Island&#x27;s Centre Party is a bible-oriented fundamentalist party with about 4% of the vote. However, the Norwegian Christian People&#x27;s Party, the Swedish Christian Democrats and Danish Christian Democrats are less religiously orthodox and are similar to mainstream European Christian Democracy.

In Switzerland, Federal Democratic Union is a small conservative Protestant party with about 1% of the vote.

<text>Peter Seamus O&#x27;Toole (; 2 August 1932 – 14 December 2013) was an English actor known for his leading roles on stage and screen. His numerous accolades include the Academy Honorary Award, a BAFTA Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as nominations for a Grammy Award and a Laurence Olivier Award.

O&#x27;Toole started his training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London and began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company. In 1959, he made his West End debut in &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot;, and played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the National Theatre&#x27;s first production in 1963. Excelling on stage, O&#x27;Toole was known for his &quot;hellraiser&quot; lifestyle off it. He received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance for his portrayal of Jeffrey Bernard in the play &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot; (1990).

Making his film debut in 1959, O&#x27;Toole received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for portraying T. E. Lawrence in the historical epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). He was further Oscar-nominated for playing King Henry II in both &quot;Becket&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), a public school teacher in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), a paranoid schizophrenic in &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972), a ruthless film director in &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980), a film actor in &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982), and an elderly man in &quot;Venus&quot; (2006). He holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting without a win (tied with Glenn Close). In 2002, he was awarded the Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements.

O&#x27;Toole also starred in films such as &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965), &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966), &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; (1979), and &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), with supporting roles in &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; (2003), &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007), and &quot;Dean Spanley&quot; (2008). He voiced Anton Ego, the restaurant critic in Pixar&#x27;s animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007). On television, he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his portrayal of Bishop Pierre Cauchon in the CBS miniseries &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). He was Emmy-nominated for his performances as Lucius Flavius Silva in the ABC miniseries &quot;Masada&quot; (1981), and Paul von Hindenburg in the miniseries &quot;&quot; (2003).

== Early life and education ==
Peter Seamus O&#x27;Toole was born on 2 August 1932, the son of Constance Jane Eliot (née Ferguson), a Scottish nurse, and Patrick Joseph &quot;Spats&quot; O&#x27;Toole, an Irish metal plater, football player, and bookmaker. O&#x27;Toole claimed he was not certain of his birthplace or date, stating in his autobiography that he accepted 2 August as his birth date but had birth certificates from England and Ireland. The birth certificate recorded at the Leeds General Register Office says he was born at St James&#x27;s University Hospital in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, on 2 August 1932.

O&#x27;Toole had an elder sister named Patricia and grew up in the south Leeds suburb of Hunslet. When he was one year old, his family began a five-year tour of major racecourse towns in Northern England. He and his sister were brought up in their father&#x27;s Catholic faith. O&#x27;Toole was evacuated from Leeds early in the Second World War, and went to a Catholic school for seven or eight years: St Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School in Hunslet, Leeds. He later said, &quot;I used to be scared stiff of the nuns: their whole denial of womanhood—the black dresses and the shaving of the hair—was so horrible, so terrifying. [...] Of course, that&#x27;s all been stopped. They&#x27;re sipping gin and tonic in the Dublin pubs now, and a couple of them flashed their pretty ankles at me just the other day.&quot;
Upon leaving school, O&#x27;Toole obtained employment as a trainee journalist and photographer on the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;, until he was called up for national service as a signaller in the Royal Navy. As reported in a radio interview in 2006 on NPR, he was asked by an officer whether he had something he had always wanted to do. His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor.

He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship. This came after being rejected by the Abbey Theatre&#x27;s drama school in Dublin by the director Ernest Blythe, because he could not speak the Irish language. At RADA, he was in the same class as Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Brian Bedford. O&#x27;Toole described this as &quot;the most remarkable class the academy ever had, though we weren&#x27;t reckoned for much at the time. We were all considered .&quot;

== Acting career ==

=== 1954–1961: Early work and rise to prominence ===
O&#x27;Toole began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company, before making his television debut in 1954. He played a soldier in an episode of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in 1954. He was based at the Bristol Old Vic from 1956 to 1958, appearing in productions of &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;, &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;The Slave of Truth&quot; (all 1956). He was Henry Higgins in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Uncle Gustave in &quot;Oh! My Papa!&quot;, and Jimmy Porter in &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (all 1957). O&#x27;Toole was Tanner in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1958), a performance he reprised often during his career. He was also in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Holiday&quot;, &quot;Amphitryon &#x27;38&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (as Vladimir; all 1958). He hoped &quot;The Holiday&quot; would take him to the West End but it ultimately folded in the provinces; during that show he met Siân Phillips who became his first wife.

O&#x27;Toole continued to appear on television, being in episodes of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Pier&quot;, 1957), and &quot;BBC Sunday-Night Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Laughing Woman&quot;, 1958) and was in the TV adaptation of &quot;The Castiglioni Brothers&quot; (1958). He made his London debut in a musical, &quot;Oh, My Papa&quot;. He gained fame on the West End in the play &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot;, performed at the Royal Court beginning in January 1959. His co-stars included Robert Shaw and Edward Judd, and it was directed by Lindsay Anderson. O&#x27;Toole reprised his performance for television on &quot;Theatre Night&quot; in 1959 (although he did not appear in the 1961 film version). The show transferred to the West End in April and won O&#x27;Toole Best Actor of the Year in 1959.

O&#x27;Toole was in much demand. He reportedly received five offers of long-term contracts but turned them down. His first role was a small role in Disney&#x27;s version of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1960), playing the bagpipes opposite Peter Finch. His second feature was &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot; (1960) with Anthony Quinn for director Nicholas Ray. With his then wife Sian Phillips he did &quot;Siwan: The King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1960) for TV. In 1960 he had a nine-month season at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, appearing in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (as Petruchio), &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (as Shylock) and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (as Thersites). He could have made more money in films but said &quot;You&#x27;ve got to go to Stratford when you&#x27;ve got the chance.&quot;

O&#x27;Toole had been seen in &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; by Jules Buck who later established a company with the actor. Buck cast O&#x27;Toole in &quot;The Day They Robbed the Bank of England&quot; (1960), a heist thriller from director John Guillermin. O&#x27;Toole was billed third, beneath Aldo Ray and Elizabeth Sellars. The following year he appeared in several episodes of the TV series &quot;Rendezvous&quot; (&quot;End of a Good Man&quot;, &quot;Once a Horseplayer&quot;, &quot;London-New York&quot;). He lost the role in the film adaptation of &quot;Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; to Laurence Harvey. &quot;It broke my heart&quot;, he said later.

=== 1962–1972: &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and stardom ===

O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s major break came in November 1960 when he was chosen to play the eponymous hero T. E. Lawrence in Sir David Lean&#x27;s epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), after Albert Finney reportedly turned down the part. The role introduced him to a global audience and earned him the first of his eight nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He received the BAFTA Award for Best British Actor. His performance was ranked number one in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. In 2003, Lawrence as portrayed by O&#x27;Toole was selected as the tenth-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1989 &quot;The then unknown Peter O&#x27;Toole, with his charmingly diffident manner and his hair and eyes looking unnaturally gold and blue, accounted for no small part of this film&#x27;s appeal to impressionable young fans&quot;.

O&#x27;Toole played Hamlet under Laurence Olivier&#x27;s direction in the premiere production of the Royal National Theatre in 1963. The casting of O&#x27;Toole as the Dane was met with some controversy with Michael Gambon describing him as a &quot;god with bright blonde hair&quot;. On playing the role O&#x27;Toole stated he was &quot;sick with nerves&quot;, adding &quot;If you want to know what it&#x27;s like to be lonely, really lonely, try playing Hamlet.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr O&#x27;Toole, like Olivier, is an electrifyingly outgoing actor, and it is a surprise to see him make his first appearance...with his features twisted into melancholy&quot; He performed in &quot;Baal&quot; (1963) at the Phoenix Theatre.
Even prior to the making of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, O&#x27;Toole announced he wanted to form a production company with Jules Buck. In November 1961 they said their company, known as Keep Films (also known as Tricolor Productions) would make a film starring Terry-Thomas, &quot;Operation Snatch&quot;. In 1962 O&#x27;Toole and Buck announced they wanted to make a version of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; for £80,000. The film was never made. Instead their first production was &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), where O&#x27;Toole played King Henry II opposite Richard Burton. The film, done in association with Hal Wallis, was a financial success.

O&#x27;Toole turned down the lead role in &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963). Instead he and Buck made another epic, &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965), based on the novel by Joseph Conrad directed by Richard Brooks. He and Buck intended to follow this with a biopic of Will Adams and a film about the Charge of the Light Brigade, but neither project happened. Instead O&#x27;Toole went into &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965), a comedy based on a script by Woody Allen, taking over a role originally meant for Warren Beatty and starring alongside Peter Sellers. It was a huge success. He and Buck helped produce &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (1965). O&#x27;Toole returned to the stage with &quot;Ride a Cock Horse&quot; at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1965, which was harshly reviewed. He made a heist film with Audrey Hepburn, &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966), directed by William Wyler. He played the Three Angels in the all-star &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966), directed by John Huston. In 1966 at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin he appeared in productions of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; and &quot;Man and Superman&quot;.
Sam Spiegel, producer of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, reunited O&#x27;Toole with Omar Sharif in &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967), which was a box office disappointment. O&#x27;Toole played in an adaptation of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot; for TV in 1968, and had a cameo in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967). He played Henry II again in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968) alongside Katharine Hepburn, and was nominated for an Oscar again – one of the few times an actor had been nominated playing the same character in different films. The film was also successful at the box office. Less popular was &quot;Great Catherine&quot; (1968) with Jeanne Moreau, an adaptation of the play by George Bernard Shaw which Buck and O&#x27;Toole co-produced. In 1969, he played the title role in the film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, a musical adaptation of James Hilton&#x27;s novella, starring opposite Petula Clark. He was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. O&#x27;Toole fulfilled a lifetime ambition in 1970 when he performed on stage in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, alongside Donal McCann, at Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre.

In other films, he played a man in love with his sister (played by Susannah York) in &quot;Country Dance&quot; (1970). O&#x27;Toole starred in a war film for director Peter Yates, &quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot; (1971), appearing alongside Sian Phillips. He was reunited with Richard Burton in a film version of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1972) by Dylan Thomas, produced by himself and Buck; Elizabeth Taylor co-starred. The film was not a popular success. He received another Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance in &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972), done for his own company. In 1972, he played both Miguel de Cervantes and his fictional creation Don Quixote in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, the motion picture adaptation of the 1965 hit Broadway musical, opposite Sophia Loren. The film was a critical and commercial failure, criticised for using mostly non-singing actors. His singing was dubbed by tenor Simon Gilbert, but the other actors did their own singing. O&#x27;Toole and co-star James Coco, who played both Cervantes&#x27;s manservant and Sancho Panza, both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.

=== 1973–1999: Established actor ===
O&#x27;Toole did not make a film for several years. He performed at the Bristol Old Vic from 1973 to 1974 in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, &quot;Plunder&quot;, &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; and &quot;Judgement&quot;. He returned to films with &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975), a flop thriller for Otto Preminger, in which O&#x27;Toole replaced Robert Mitchum at the last minute. He followed it with &quot;Man Friday&quot; (1975), an adaptation of the Robinson Crusoe story, which was the last work from Keep Films. O&#x27;Toole made &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1976), directed by Arturo Ripstein. He was critically acclaimed for his performance in &quot;Rogue Male&quot; (1976) for British television. He did &quot;Dead Eyed Dicks&quot; on stage in Sydney in 1976. Less well received was &quot;Power Play&quot; (1978), made in Canada, and &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; (1979), shot in South Africa. He toured &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and &quot;Present Laughter&quot; on stage. In 1979, O&#x27;Toole starred as Tiberius in the controversial &quot;Penthouse&quot;-funded biopic &quot;Caligula&quot; acting alongside Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and John Gielgud.

In 1980, he received critical acclaim for playing the director in the behind-the-scenes film &quot;The Stunt Man&quot;. His performance earned him an Oscar nomination. He appeared in a mini-series for Irish TV, &quot;Strumpet City&quot;, in which he played James Larkin. He followed this with another mini-series, &quot;Masada&quot; (1981), playing Lucius Flavius Silva. In 1980, he performed in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Old Vic for $500 a week (), a performance that famously earned O&#x27;Toole some of the worst reviews of his career.

O&#x27;Toole was nominated for another Oscar for &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982), a light romantic comedy about the behind-the-scenes at a 1950s TV variety-comedy show, in which O&#x27;Toole plays an ageing swashbuckling film star reminiscent of Errol Flynn. He returned to the stage in London with a performance in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1982) that was better received than his &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He focused on television, doing an adaptation of &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1983), &quot;Svengali&quot; (1983), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1984), and &quot;Kim&quot; (1984), and providing the voice of Sherlock Holmes for a series of animated TV movies. He played in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; on stage in 1984 at the West End&#x27;s Shaftesbury Theatre.

O&#x27;Toole returned to feature films in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), &quot;Creator&quot; (1985), &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) as Sir Reginald Johnston, and &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1988). He appeared on Broadway in an adaptation of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1987), opposite Amanda Plummer. It ran for 113 performances.

He won a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot; (1989). His other appearances that decade include &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; (1989) for television. O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s performances in the 1990s include &quot;Wings of Fame&quot; (1990); &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot; (1990), with Sharif; &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991) with John Goodman; &quot;Isabelle Eberhardt&quot; (1992); &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1992), in Wales; &quot;Civvies&quot; (1992), a British TV series; &quot;The Seventh Coin&quot; (1993); &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell: North &amp; South, Book III&quot; (1994), for American TV; and &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1995), for British TV. He was in an adaptation of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1996), playing the Emperor of Lilliput; &quot;&quot; (1997), playing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; &quot;Phantoms&quot; (1998), from a novel by Dean Koontz; and &quot;&quot; (1999). He won a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Bishop Pierre Cauchon in the 1999 mini-series &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. He also produced and starred in a TV adaptation of &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot; (1999).

=== 2000–2013: Resurgence and final roles ===
O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s work in the next decade included &quot;Global Heresy&quot; (2002); &quot;The Final Curtain&quot; (2003); &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; (2003); &quot;&quot; (2003) for TV, as Paul von Hindenburg; and &quot;&quot; (2004) as Augustus Caesar. In 2004, he played King Priam in &quot;Troy&quot;. In 2005, he appeared on television as the older version of legendary 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova in the BBC drama serial &quot;Casanova&quot;. The younger Casanova, seen for most of the action, was played by David Tennant, who had to wear contact lenses to match his brown eyes to O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s blue. He followed it with a role in &quot;Lassie&quot; (2005).

O&#x27;Toole was once again nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Maurice in the 2006 film &quot;Venus&quot;, directed by Roger Michell, his eighth such nomination. He was in &quot;One Night with the King&quot; (2007) and co-starred in the Pixar animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), an animated film about a rat with dreams of becoming the greatest chef in Paris, as Anton Ego, a food critic. He had a small role in &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007). He also appeared in the second season of Showtime&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Tudors&quot; (2008), portraying Pope Paul III, who excommunicates King Henry VIII from the church; an act which leads to a showdown between the two men in seven of the ten episodes. Also in 2008, he starred alongside Jeremy Northam and Sam Neill in the New Zealand/British film &quot;Dean Spanley&quot;, based on an Alan Sharp adaptation of Irish author Lord Dunsany&#x27;s short novel, &quot;My Talks with Dean Spanley&quot;.

He was in &quot;Thomas Kinkade&#x27;s Christmas Cottage&quot; (2008); and &quot;Iron Road&quot; (2009), a Canadian-Chinese miniseries. O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s final performances came in &quot;Eldorado&quot; (2012) and &quot;For Greater Glory: The True Story of Cristiada&quot; (2012). On 10 July 2012, O&#x27;Toole released a statement announcing his retirement from acting. A number of films were released after his retirement and death: &quot;Decline of an Empire&quot; (2013), as Gallus; and &quot;Diamond Cartel&quot; (2017).

== Personal life ==
=== Personal views ===

While studying at RADA in the early 1950s, O&#x27;Toole opposed the Korean War, and later became a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. During the 1960s, he was involved in the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. He played a role in the creation of the current form of the well-known Irish folk song &quot;Carrickfergus&quot; which he related to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in the mid-1960s.

Although he lost faith in organised religion as a teenager, O&#x27;Toole expressed positive sentiments regarding the life of Jesus Christ. In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he said &quot;No one can take Jesus away from me... there&#x27;s no doubt there was a historical figure of tremendous importance, with enormous notions. Such as peace.&quot; He called himself &quot;a retired Christian&quot; who prefers &quot;an education and reading and facts&quot; to faith.

British Pakistani playwright Hanif Kureishi states in his memoir that O&#x27;Toole told him &quot;The only Paki I ever liked was Omar Sharif.&quot;

=== Ireland ===
The son of an Irishman, O’Toole had a strong affinity with Ireland and on occasion referred to himself as Irish: “I consider myself to be an Irishman but I have lived most of my life in England so I am fairly bogus Irish actor as such”. In an interview with Charlie Rose in 1992 he said Irishness was “almost the centre of my very being” and that “Everything I think of is coloured by its history, by its literature, by its people, by its geography”. He recalls that he was “a bit of a misfit, a bit of an odd man out” but that when he went to County Kerry, Ireland in 1946 he realized “I wasn’t different at all”.

He possessed an Irish passport and believed he may have been born in Connemara. He owned a house in Ireland located in Clifden, County Galway. In 1969 he met future Irish president Michael D. Higgins and the two developed a friendship.

His son Lorcan was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1983. He told his friends that he wanted him to be &quot;raised as an Irishman&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
O&#x27;Toole married Welsh actress Siân Phillips in 1959, with whom he had two daughters: actress Kate and Patricia. They were divorced in 1979. Phillips later said in two autobiographies that O&#x27;Toole had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy when she finally left him for a younger lover.

O&#x27;Toole and his girlfriend, model Karen Brown, had a son, Lorcan O&#x27;Toole (born 17 March 1983), when O&#x27;Toole was 50 years old. Lorcan, now an actor, was a pupil at Harrow School, boarding at West Acre from 1996.

=== Sports ===
O&#x27;Toole played rugby league as a child in Leeds and was also a rugby union fan, attending Five Nations matches with friends and fellow rugby fans Richard Harris, Kenneth Griffith, Peter Finch and Richard Burton. He was also a lifelong player, coach and enthusiast of cricket and a fan of Sunderland A.F.C. His support of Sunderland was passed on to him through his father, who was a labourer in Sunderland for many years. He was named their most famous fan. The actor in a later interview expressed that he no longer considered himself as much of a fan following the demolition of Roker Park and the subsequent move to the Stadium of Light. He described Roker Park as his last connection to the club and that everything &quot;they meant to him was when they were at Roker Park&quot;.

=== Health ===
Severe illness almost ended O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s life in the late 1970s. His stomach cancer was misdiagnosed as resulting from his alcoholic excess. O&#x27;Toole underwent surgery in 1976 to have his pancreas and a large portion of his stomach removed, which resulted in insulin-dependent diabetes. In 1978, he nearly died from a hematologic disease. He eventually recovered and returned to work. He resided on the Sky Road, just outside Clifden, Connemara, County Galway, from 1963, and at the height of his career maintained homes in Dublin, London, and Paris (at the Ritz, which was where his character supposedly lived in the film &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot;).

=== Interests and influences ===
In an interview with NPR in December 2006, O&#x27;Toole revealed that he knew all 154 of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. A self-described romantic, O&#x27;Toole said of the sonnets that nothing in the English language compares with them, and that he read them daily. In &quot;Venus&quot; (2006), he recites Sonnet 18 (&quot;Shall I compare thee to a summer&#x27;s day?&quot;).

O&#x27;Toole wrote two memoirs. &quot;Loitering with Intent: The Child&quot; chronicles his childhood in the years leading up to the Second World War, and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of the Year in 1992. His second, &quot;Loitering With Intent: The Apprentice&quot;, is about his years spent training with a cadre of friends at RADA.

O&#x27;Toole was interviewed at least three times by Charlie Rose on his eponymous talk show. In a 17 January 2007 interview, O&#x27;Toole stated that British actor Eric Porter had most influenced him, adding that the difference between actors of yesterday and today is that actors of his generation were trained for &quot;theatre, theatre, theatre&quot;. He also believes that the challenge for the actor is &quot;to use his imagination to link to his emotion&quot; and that &quot;good parts make good actors.&quot; However, in other venues (including the DVD commentary for &quot;Becket&quot;), O&#x27;Toole credited Donald Wolfit as being his most important mentor.

=== Death and legacy ===

O&#x27;Toole retired from acting in July 2012 owing to a recurrence of stomach cancer. He died on 14 December 2013 at the Wellington Hospital in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, at the age of 81. His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London on 21 December 2013, where his body was cremated in a wicker coffin. His family stated their intention to fulfil his wishes and take his ashes to the west of Ireland.

On 18 May 2014, a new prize was launched in memory of Peter O&#x27;Toole at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School; this includes an annual award given to two young actors from the School, including a professional contract at Bristol Old Vic Theatre. He has a memorial plaque in St Paul&#x27;s, the Actors&#x27; Church in Covent Garden, London.

On 21 April 2017, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that Kate O&#x27;Toole had placed her father&#x27;s archive at the Humanities Research Centre. The collection includes O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s scripts, extensive published and unpublished writings, props, photographs, letters, medical records, and more. It joins the archives of several of O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s collaborators and friends, including Donald Wolfit, Eli Wallach, Peter Glenville, Sir Tom Stoppard, and Dame Edith Evans.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

O&#x27;Toole was the recipient of numerous nominations and awards. He was offered a knighthood but rejected it in objection to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policies. He received four Golden Globe Awards, one BAFTA Award for Best British Actor (for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) and one Primetime Emmy Award.

Academy Award nominations

O&#x27;Toole was nominated eight times for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but was never able to win a competitive Oscar. In 2002, the Academy honoured him with an Academy Honorary Award for his entire body of work and his lifelong contribution to film. O&#x27;Toole initially balked about accepting, and wrote the Academy a letter saying that he was &quot;still in the game&quot; and would like more time to &quot;win the lovely bugger outright&quot;. The Academy informed him that they would bestow the award whether he wanted it or not. He told &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; in January 2007 that his children admonished him, saying that it was the highest honour one could receive in the filmmaking industry. O&#x27;Toole agreed to appear at the ceremony and receive his Honorary Oscar. It was presented to him by Meryl Streep, who has the most Oscar nominations of any actor or actress (21). He joked with Robert Osborne, during an interview at Turner Classic Movies&#x27; film festival that he&#x27;s the &quot;Biggest Loser of All Time&quot;, due to his lack of an Academy Award, after many nominations.

<doc id="63325" wikidata="Q41680" url="?curid=63325" title="Dionysus">
<text>In ancient Greek religion and myth, Dionysus (; ) is the god of wine-making, orchards and fruit, vegetation, fertility, festivity, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, and theatre. He was also known as Bacchus ( or ; ) by the Greeks (a name later adopted by the Romans) for a frenzy he is said to induce called &quot;baccheia&quot;. As Dionysus Eleutherius (&quot;the liberator&quot;), his wine, music, and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. His &quot;thyrsus&quot;, a fennel-stem sceptre, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.

His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. In Orphism, he was variously a son of Zeus and Persephone; a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus; or the twice-born son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. The Eleusinian Mysteries identify him with Iacchus, the son or husband of Demeter. Most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner. His attribute of &quot;foreignness&quot; as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called &quot;the god who comes&quot;.

Wine was a religious focus in the cult of Dionysus and was his earthly incarnation. Wine could ease suffering, bring joy, and inspire divine madness. Festivals of Dionysus included the performance of sacred dramas enacting his myths, the initial driving force behind the development of theatre in Western culture. The cult of Dionysus is also a &quot;cult of the souls&quot;; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.

Romans identified Bacchus with their own Liber Pater, the &quot;Free Father&quot; of the Liberalia festival, patron of viniculture, wine and male fertility, and guardian of the traditions, rituals and freedoms attached to coming of age and citizenship, but the Roman state treated independent, popular festivals of Bacchus (Bacchanalia) as subversive, partly because their free mixing of classes and genders transgressed traditional social and moral constraints. Celebration of the Bacchanalia was made a capital offence, except in the toned-down forms and greatly diminished congregations approved and supervised by the State. Festivals of Bacchus were merged with those of Liber and Dionysus.

==Name==
===Etymology===

The &quot;dio-&quot; prefix in Ancient Greek (; ) has been associated since antiquity with &quot;Zeus&quot; (genitive &quot;Dios&quot;), and the variants of the name seem to point to an original &quot;*Dios-nysos&quot;. The earliest attestation is the Mycenaean Greek dative form &quot;(di-wo-nu-so)&quot;, featured on two tablets that had been found at Mycenaean Pylos and dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. At that time, there could be no certainty on whether this was indeed a theonym, but the 1989–90 Greek-Swedish Excavations at Kastelli Hill, Chania, unearthed, &quot;inter alia&quot;, four artefacts bearing Linear B inscriptions; among them, the inscription on item KH Gq 5 is thought to confirm Dionysus&#x27;s early worship.
In Mycenaean Greek the form of Zeus is &quot;di-wo&quot;. The second element is of unknown origin. It is perhaps associated with Mount Nysa, the birthplace of the god in Greek mythology, where he was nursed by nymphs (the Nysiads), although Pherecydes of Syros had postulated as an archaic word for &quot;tree&quot; by the sixth century BC. On a vase of Sophilos the Nysiads are named (). Kretschmer asserted that () is a Thracian word that has the same meaning as (), a word similar with () (daughter in law, or bride, I-E *snusós, Sanskr. &quot;snusā&quot;). He suggested that the male form is () and this would make Dionysus the &quot;son of Zeus&quot;. Jane Ellen Harrison believed that the name Dionysus means &quot;young Zeus&quot;. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, since all attempts to find an Indo-European etymology are doubtful.

===Meaning and variants===

Later variants include and in Boeotia; in Thessaly; and in Ionia; and in Aeolia, besides other variants. A prefix is found in other names, such as that of the Dioscures, and may derive from &quot;Dios&quot;, the genitive of the name of Zeus.

Nonnus, in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, writes that the name Dionysus means &quot;Zeus-limp&quot; and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this, &quot;because Zeus while he carried his burden lifted one foot with a limp from the weight of his thigh, and &quot;nysos&quot; in Syracusan language means limping&quot;. In his note to these lines, W. H. D. Rouse writes &quot;It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong&quot;. The &quot;Suda&quot;, a Byzantine encyclopedia based on classical sources, states that Dionysus was so named &quot;from accomplishing [διανύειν] for each of those who live the wild life. Or from providing [διανοεῖν] everything for those who live the wild life.&quot;

==Origins==
Academics in the nineteenth century, using study of philology and comparative mythology, often regarded Dionysus as a foreign deity who was only reluctantly accepted into the standard Greek pantheon at a relatively late date, based on his myths which often involve this theme—a god who spends much of his time on earth abroad, and struggles for acceptance when he returns to Greece. However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture. The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from Mycenaean Greece, specifically in and around the Palace of Nestor in Pylos, dated to around 1300 BC. The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as &quot;di-wo-nu-su-jo&quot; (&quot;Dionysoio&quot; = &#x27;of Dionysus&#x27;) in Linear B, preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being &quot;of Dionysus&quot;. References have also been uncovered to &quot;women of Oinoa&quot;, the &quot;place of wine&quot;, who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.

Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name Liber Pater, indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to Károly Kerényi, these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At Knossos in Minoan Crete, men were often given the name &quot;Pentheus&quot;, who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means &quot;suffering&quot;. Kerényi argued that to give such a name to one&#x27;s child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus&#x27; followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Kerényi, the title of &quot;man who suffers&quot; likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.

The oldest known image of Dionysus accompanied by his name is found on a dinos by the Attic potter Sophilos around 570 BC and is located in the British Museum. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild satyrs, representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape.

While scholarly references are scarce, there exists a notable overlap between the Greco-Roman Dionysus and the Hindu god Shiva. Shared iconography and background include a crescent or horns on the head, panther or tiger skins, serpents, phallic symbolism (Shiva lingam), association as a wanderer and outcaste and association with ritual ecstasy. Shiva is understood to be one of a triple godhead that includes Vishnu and Brahma. Dionysus is noted in several references with an association with the east and India.

A Mycenaean variant of Bacchus was thought to have been &quot;a divine child&quot; abandoned by his mother and eventually raised by &quot;nymphs, goddesses, or even animals.&quot;

==Worship and festivals in Greece==
The worship of Dionysus had become firmly established by the seventh century BC. He may have been worshiped as early as c. 1500–1100 BC by Mycenaean Greeks; and traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete.

===Dionysia===

The Dionysia, Haloa, Ascolia and Lenaia festivals were dedicated to Dionysus. The Rural Dionysia (or Lesser Dionysia) was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus, begun in Attica, and probably celebrated the cultivation of wines. It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.

The City Dionysia (or Greater Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as Athens and Eleusis, and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.

===Anthesteria===
The Anthesteria (Ἀνθεστήρια) was an Athenian festival that celebrated the beginning of spring. It spanned three days: Pithoigia (Πιθοίγια, &quot;Jar-Opening&quot;), Choes (Χοαί, &quot;The Pouring&quot;) and Chythroi (Χύτροι &quot;The Pots&quot;). It was said the dead arose from the underworld during the span of the festival. Along with the souls of the dead, the Keres also wandered through the city and had to be banished when the festival ended. On the first day, Wine vats were opened. The wine was opened and mixed in honour of the god. The rooms and the drinking vessels were adorned with flowers along with children over three years of age.

On the second day, a solemn ritual for Dionysus occurred along with drinking. People dressed up, sometimes as members of Dionysus&#x27;s entourage, and visited others. Choes was also the occasion of a solemn and secret ceremony in one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus in the Lenaeum, which was closed for the rest of the year. The basilissa (or basilinna), wife of the basileus, underwent a symbolic ceremonial marriage to the god, possibly representing a Hieros gamos. The basilissa was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons (called Gerarai) who were chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy.

The last day was dedicated to the dead. Offerings were also offered to Hermes, due to his connection to the underworld. It was considered a day of merrymaking. Some poured Libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. Chythroi ended with a ritual cry intended to order the souls of the dead to return to the underworld. Keres were also banished from the festival on the last day.

To protect themselves from evil, people chewed leaves of whitethorn and smeared their doors with tar to protect themselves. The festival also allowed servants and slaves to participate in the festivities.

===Bacchic Mysteries===
The central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or Dionysian Mysteries. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though Orpheus was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus. Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar Orphic Mysteries actually belong to Dionysian mysteries. Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of Persephone, but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it. Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of Athens played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.

The Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people&#x27;s lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualizing women&#x27;s changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman&#x27;s life. This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as Hades and Persephone, but also with Dionysus&#x27; mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.

The religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a Minoan tomb near Phaistos in Crete.

===Eleusinian Mysteries===

As early as the fifth century BC, Dionysus became identified with Iacchus, a minor deity from the tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries. This association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus. Two black-figure lekythoi (c. 500 BC), possibly represent the earliest evidence for such an association. The nearly-identical vases, one in Berlin, the other in Rome, depict Dionysus, along with the inscription &quot;IAKXNE&quot;, a possible miswriting of &quot;IAKXE&quot;. More early evidence can be found in the works of the fifth-century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; (c. 441 BC), an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the &quot;God of many names&quot; (&quot;πολυώνυμε&quot;), who rules over the glens of Demeter&#x27;s Eleusis, and ends by identifying him with &quot;Iacchus the Giver&quot;, who leads &quot;the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire&quot; and whose &quot;attendant Thyiads&quot; dance in &quot;night-long frenzy&quot;. And in a fragment from a lost play, Sophocles describes Nysa, Dionysus&#x27; traditional place of nurture: &quot;From here I caught sight of Nysa, haunt of Bacchus, famed among mortals, which Iacchus of the bull&#x27;s horns counts as his beloved nurse&quot;. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot; (c. 405 BC), a messenger, describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron, associates Iacchus with Bromius, another of the names of Dionysus, saying, they &quot;began to wave the thyrsos ... calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice.&quot;

An inscription found on a stone stele (c. 340 BC), found at Delphi, contains a paean to Dionysus, which describes his travels. From Thebes, where he was born, he first went to Delphi where he displayed his &quot;starry body&quot;, and with &quot;Delphian girls&quot; took his &quot;place on the folds of Parnassus&quot;, then next to Eleusis, where he is called &quot;Iacchus&quot;:

:And in your hand brandishing your night-
:lighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy
:you went to the vales of Eleusis
:where the whole people of Hellas&#x27;
:land, alongside your own native witnesses
:of the holy mysteries, calls upon you
:as Iacchus: for mortals from their pains
:you have opened a haven without toils.

Strabo, says that Greeks &quot;give the name &#x27;Iacchus&#x27; not only to Dionysus but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries&quot;. In particular, Iacchus was identified with the Orphic Dionysus, who was a son of Persephone. Sophocles mentions &quot;Iacchus of the bull&#x27;s horns&quot;, and according to the first-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus, it was this older Dionysus who was represented in paintings and sculptures with horns, because he &quot;excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed&quot;. Arrian, the second-century Greek historian, wrote that it was to this Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, &quot;not the Theban Dionysus, that the mystic chant &#x27;Iacchus&#x27; is sung&quot;. The second-century poet Lucian also referred to the &quot;dismemberment of Iacchus&quot;.

The fourth- or fifth-century poet Nonnus associated the name Iacchus with the &quot;third&quot; Dionysus. He described the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus, son of Persephone, the second Dionysus Bromios, son of Semele, and the third Dionysus Iacchus:
:They [the Athenians] honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephone, and after Semele&#x27;s son; they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born, and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos. In these three celebrations Athens held high revel; in the dance lately made, the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together.

By some accounts, Iacchus was the husband of Demeter. Several other sources identify Iacchus as Demeter&#x27;s son. The earliest such source, a fourth-century BC vase fragment at Oxford, shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap. By the first-century BC, Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a common motif, that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognizable example of a lover&#x27;s euphemism. A scholiast on the second-century AD Aristides, explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus&#x27; mother.

===Orphism===

In the Orphic tradition, the &quot;first Dionysus&quot; was the son of Zeus and Persephone, and was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn. Dionysus was the patron god of the Orphics, who they connected to death and immortality, and he symbolized the one who guides the process of reincarnation.

This Orphic Dionysus is sometimes referred to with the alternate name Zagreus (). The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades&#x27; son or Hades himself. Noting &quot;Hades&#x27; identity as Zeus&#x27; &quot;katachthonios&quot; alter ego&quot;, Timothy Gantz thought it likely that Zagreus, originally, perhaps, the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone. However, no known Orphic sources use the name &quot;Zagreus&quot; to refer to the Orphic Dionysus. It is possible that the association between the two was known by the third century BC, when the poet Callimachus may have written about it in a now-lost source. Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismemberment of the infant Dionysus, and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a &quot;Dionysos Zagreus&quot;, explaining that Zagreus was the poets&#x27; name for the &quot;chthonic&quot; aspect of Dionysus. The earliest definitive reference to the belief that Zagreus is another name for the Orphic Dionysus is found in the late first century writings of Plutarch. The fifth century Greek poet Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, in which Nonnus calls him the &quot;older Dionysos  ... illfated Zagreus&quot;, &quot;Zagreus the horned baby&quot;, &quot;Zagreus, the first Dionysos&quot;, &quot;Zagreus the ancient Dionysos&quot;, and &quot;Dionysos Zagreus&quot;.

==Worship and festivals in Rome==
Bacchus was most often known by that name in Rome and other locales in the Republic and Empire, although many &quot;often called him Dionysus.&quot;

===Liber and importation to Rome===
The mystery cult of Bacchus was brought to Rome from the Greek culture of southern Italy or by way of Greek-influenced Etruria. It was established around 200 BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania, near the temple where Liber Pater (&quot;the Free Father&quot;) had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. Liber was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome&#x27;s plebeians (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the Aventine Triad, along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina. Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology, though this identification was not universally accepted. Cicero insisted on the &quot;non-identity of Liber and Dionysus&quot; and described Liber and Libera as children of Ceres.

Liber, like his Aventine companions, carried various aspects of his older cults into official Roman religion. He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility, including the vine and the &quot;soft seed&quot; of its grapes, wine and wine vessels, and male fertility and virility. Pliny called Liber &quot;the first to establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession.&quot; Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of a Dionysus-like exotic triumphal procession. In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era, several notable triumphs feature similar, distinctively &quot;Bacchic&quot; processional elements, recalling the supposedly historic &quot;Triumph of Liber&quot;.

Liber and Dionysus may have had a connection that predated Classical Greece and Rome, in the form of the Mycenaean god Eleutheros, who shared the lineage and iconography of Dionysus but whose name has the same meaning as Liber. Before the importation of the Greek cults, Liber was already strongly associated with Bacchic symbols and values, including wine and uninhibited freedom, as well as the subversion of the powerful. Several depictions from the late Republic era feature processions, depicting the &quot;Triumph of Liber&quot;.

===Bacchanalia===
In Rome, the most well-known festivals of Bacchus were the Bacchanalia, based on the earlier Greek Dionysia festivals. These Bacchic rituals were said to have included omophagic practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced &quot;enthusiasm&quot;: etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner&#x27;s body or to have her become one with Bacchus.
In Livy&#x27;s account (late 1st century BC), the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome; originally restricted to women and held only three times a year, they were corrupted by an Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken, disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome&#x27;s civil and religious laws and traditional morality (&quot;mos maiorum&quot;); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy&#x27;s sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic &quot;genre&quot; known as &quot;Satyr plays&quot;, based on Greek originals. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy&#x27;s account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the &quot;Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus&quot; (186 BC) was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, and those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.

Bacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the Liberalia. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became euhemerised as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at Leptis Magna, birthplace of the emperor Septimius Severus, who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunkards, commemorates the god&#x27;s triumphant return from the conquest of India. Pliny believed this to be the historical prototype for the Roman Triumph.
==Post-classical worship==
===Late Antiquity===
In the Neoplatonist philosophy and religion of Late Antiquity, the Olympian gods were sometimes considered to number 12 based on their spheres of influence. For example, according to Sallustius, &quot;Jupiter, Neptune, and Vulcan fabricate the world; Ceres, Juno, and Diana animate it; Mercury, Venus, and Apollo harmonize it; and, lastly, Vesta, Minerva, and Mars preside over it with a guarding power.&quot; The multitude of other gods, in this belief system, subsist within the primary gods, and Sallustius taught that Bacchus subsisted in Jupiter.

In the Orphic tradition, a saying was supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo that stated &quot;Zeus, Hades, [and] Helios-Dionysus&quot; were &quot;three gods in one godhead&quot;. This statement apparently conflated Dionysus not only with Hades, but also his father Zeus, and implied a particularly close identification with the sun-god Helios. When quoting this in his &quot;Hymn to King Helios&quot;, Emperor Julian substituted Dionysus&#x27; name with that of Serapis, whose Egyptian counterpart Osiris was also identified with Dionysus.

===Worship from the Middle Ages to the Modern period===

Three centuries after the reign of Theodosius I which saw the outlawing of pagan worship across the Roman Empire, the 692 Quinisext Council in Constantinople felt it necessary to warn Christians against participating in persisting rural worship of Dionysus, specifically mentioning and prohibiting the feast day Brumalia, &quot;the public dances of women&quot;, ritual cross-dressing, the wearing of Dionysiac masks, and the invoking of Bacchus&#x27; name when &quot;squeez[ing] out the wine in the presses&quot; or &quot;when pouring out wine into jars&quot;.

According to the Lanercost chronicle, during Easter in 1282 in Scotland, the parish priest of Inverkeithing led young women in a dance in honor of Priapus and Father Liber, commonly identified with Dionysus. The priest danced and sang at the front, carrying a representation of the phallus on a pole. He was killed by a Christian mob later that year. Historian C. S. Watkins believes that Richard of Durham, the author of the chronicle, identified an occurrence of apotropaic magic (by making use of his knowledge of ancient Greek religion), rather than recording an actual case of the survival of a pagan ritual.

The late medieval Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho secretly advocated a return to paganism in medieval Greece.

In the eighteenth century, Hellfire Clubs appeared in Britain and Ireland. Though activities varied between the clubs, some of them were very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus was one of the most popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one can still see the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.

In 1820, Ephraim Lyon founded the Church of Bacchus in Eastford, Connecticut. He declared himself High Priest, and added local drunks to the list of membership. He maintained that those who died as members would go to a Bacchanalia for their afterlife.

Modern pagan and polytheist groups often include worship of Dionysus in their traditions and practices, most prominently groups which have sought to revive Hellenic polytheism, such as the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (YSEE). In addition to libations of wine, modern worshipers of Dionysus offer the god grape vines, ivy, and various forms of incense, particularly styrax. They may also celebrate Roman festivals such as the Liberalia (17 March, close to the Spring Equinox) or Bacchanalia (Various dates), and various Greek festivals such as the Anthesteria, Lenaia, and the Greater and Lesser Dionysias, the dates of which are calculated by the lunar calendar.

==Identification with other gods==
===Osiris===

In the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian pantheon, Dionysus was often identified with Osiris. Stories of the dismembering of Osiris and his re-assembly and resurrection by Isis closely parallel those of the Orphic Dionysus and Demeter. According to Diodorus Siculus, as early as the fifth century BC, the two gods had been syncretized as a single deity known as Dionysus-Osiris. The most notable record of this belief is found in Herodotus&#x27; &#x27;Histories&#x27;. Plutarch was of the same opinion, recording his belief that Osiris and Dionysus were identical and stating that anyone familiar with the secret rituals associated with the two gods would recognize obvious parallels between them, noting that the myths of their dismembering and their associated public symbols constituted sufficient additional evidence to prove that they were, in fact the same god worshiped by the two cultures under different names.

Other syncretic Greco-Egyptian deities arose out of this conflation, including with the gods Serapis and Hermanubis. Serapis was believed to be both Hades and Osiris, and the Roman Emperor Julian considered him the same as Dionysus as well. Dionysus-Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt, as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus, and as Pharaohs they had claim to the lineage of Osiris. This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus-Osiris, alongside Cleopatra as Isis-Aphrodite.

Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and &quot;slipped them secretly out of the house&quot;. All but Osiris&#x27; penis, which since none of them &quot;was willing to take it with him&quot;, they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris&#x27; wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris&#x27; body parts &quot;into the shape of a human figure&quot;, and gave them &quot;to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god&quot;. But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests &quot;to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.&quot;

===Hades===

The fifth–fourth century BC philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life &quot;(zoë)&quot;, are the same god. Among other evidence, Karl Kerényi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn &quot;To Demeter&quot;, votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus. He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, as she states that it would be against &quot;themis&quot; for her to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone&#x27;s abduction because of this association; indicating that Hades may in fact have been a &quot;cover name&quot; for the underworld Dionysus. He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries. One of the epithets of Dionysus was &quot;Chthonios&quot;, meaning &quot;the subterranean&quot;.

Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive, particularly in southern Italy, especially when considering the heavy involvement of death symbolism included in Dionysian worship. Statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis give further evidence as the statues found bear a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus, also called &quot;Aides Kyanochaites&quot; (Hades of the flowing dark hair), known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the Underworld. The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness. Ancient portrayals show Dionysus holding in his hand the kantharos, a wine-jar with large handles, and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades. Archaic artist Xenocles portrayed on one side of a vase, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, each with his emblems of power; with Hades&#x27; head turned back to front and, on the other side, Dionysus striding forward to meet his bride Persephone, with the kantharos in his hand, against a background of grapes. Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as &quot;Chthonios&quot;, &quot;Eubouleus and Euclius&quot;.

Both Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus. Zeus, like Dionysus, was occasionally believed to have an underworld form, closely identified with Hades, to the point that they were occasionally thought of as the same god.

According to Marguerite Rigoglioso, Hades is Dionysus, and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone. This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus, not Hades, impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus. Rigoglioso argues that taken together, these myths suggest a belief that is that, with Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created (in terms quoted from Kerényi) &quot;a second, a little Dionysus&quot;, who is also a &quot;subterranean Zeus&quot;. The unification of Hades, Zeus, and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the &#x27;shining&#x27; realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades. According to Rosemarie Taylor-Perry,it is often mentioned that Zeus, Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god ... Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus, doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus, Hades abducts his &#x27;daughter&#x27; and paramour Persephone. The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force: Iacchos (Zagreus-Dionysus), also known as Liknites, the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld (chthonic) realm of Hades and the Olympian (&quot;Shining&quot;) one of Zeus.

===Sabazios and Yahweh===

The Phrygian god Sabazios was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus. The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, &quot;Suda&quot; (c. tenth century), stated: Sabazios ... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry &quot;sabazein&quot;. Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry &quot;sabasmos&quot;; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call &quot;saboi&quot; those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes ... Demosthenes [in the speech] &quot;On Behalf of Ktesiphon&quot; [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.

Strabo, in the first century, linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos. Strabo&#x27;s Sicilian contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone, However, this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to &quot;Zeus Sabazios&quot;.

Several ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the Jewish people, Yahweh, was identifiable as Dionysus or Liber via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words &quot;Euoe&quot; and &quot;Sabi&quot;, a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean M. McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch&#x27;s sources had confused the cry of &quot;Iao Sabaoth&quot; (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of &quot;Euoe Saboe&quot;, originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of &quot;Sabi&quot; could also have been conflated with the Jewish term &quot;sabbath&quot;, adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the Maccabees that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled &quot;Bacchus Judaeus&quot; (&quot;BACCHIVS IVDAEVS&quot;), and in 139 BC praetor Cornelius Scipio Hispalus deported Jewish people for attempting to &quot;infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius&quot;.

==Mythology==

Various different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus&#x27; birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian Diodorus Siculus said that according to &quot;some writers of myths&quot; there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone, but that the &quot;younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.&quot; He also said that Dionysus &quot;was thought to have two forms ... the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, and the younger one being long-haired, youthful and effeminate and young.&quot;


Though the varying genealogy of Dionysus was mentioned in many works of classical literature, only a few contain the actual narrative myths surrounding the events of his multiple births. These include the first century BC &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; by Greek historian Diodorus, which describes the birth and deeds of the three incarnations of Dionysus; the brief birth narrative given by the first century AD Roman author Hyginus, which describes a double birth for Dionysus; and a longer account in the form of Greek poet Nonnus&#x27;s epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, which discusses three incarnations of Dionysus similar to Diodorus&#x27; account, but which focuses on the life of the third Dionysus, born to Zeus and Semele.

===First birth===
Though Diodorus mentions some traditions which state an older, Indian or Egyptian Dionysus existed who invented wine, no narratives are given of his birth or life among mortals, and most traditions ascribe the invention of wine and travels through India to the last Dionysus. According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and Persephone (or alternately, Zeus and Demeter). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus Zagreus, while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with Sabazius. However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how to use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.
The Greek poet Nonnus gives a birth narrative for Dionysus in his late fourth or early fifth century AD epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;. In it, he described how Zeus &quot;intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos&quot; who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4) Zeus took the shape of a serpent (&quot;drakon&quot;), and &quot;ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.&quot; According to Nonnus, though Persephone was &quot;the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld&quot;, she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because &quot;all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.&quot; (Dionysiaca 5) After her union with Zeus, Persephone&#x27;s womb &quot;swelled with living fruit&quot;, and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him as Zeus&#x27; heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus &quot;while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.&quot; They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, &quot;where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.&quot; He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Cronus, a baby, and &quot;a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.&quot; He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in Tartaros. This caused the mother of the Titans, Gaia, to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to flood the world. (Dionysiaca 6)

====Interpretation====

In the Orphic tradition, Dionysus was, in part, a god associated with the underworld. As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. The earliest attestation of this myth of the dismemberment and rebirth of Dionysus comes from the 1st century BC, in the works of Philodemus and Diodorus Siculus. Later, Neoplatonists such as Damascius and Olympiodorus added a number of further elements to the myth, including the punishment of the Titans by Zeus for their act, their destruction by a thunderbolt from his hand, and the subsequent birth of humankind from their ashes; however, whether any of these elements were part of the original myth is the subject of debate among scholars. The dismemberment of Dionysus (the &quot;sparagmos&quot;) has often been considered the most important myth of Orphism.

Many modern sources identify this &quot;Orphic Dionysus&quot; with the god Zagreus, though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. The infant was taken to Mount Ida, where, like the infant Zeus, he was guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. Damascius claims that he was mocked by the Titans, who gave him a fennel stalk (&quot;thyrsus&quot;) in place of his rightful scepter.

Diodorus relates that Dionysus is the son of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, and that his birth narrative is an allegory for the generative power of the gods at work in nature. When the &quot;Sons of Gaia&quot; (i.e. the Titans) boiled Dionysus following his birth, Demeter gathered together his remains, allowing his rebirth. Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents: Dionysus, god of the vine, was born from the gods of the rain and the earth. He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or &quot;earth born&quot;, symbolizing the harvesting and wine-making process. Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness, the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again.

===Second birth===

The birth narrative given by Gaius Julius Hyginus ( – 17 AD) in &quot;Fabulae&quot; 167, agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber (Dionysus) was originally the son of Jove (Zeus) and Proserpine (Persephone). Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to Semele, the daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus, king and founder of Thebes. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. Juno appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: &quot;Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.&quot; When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of Nysus. Hyginus states that &quot;for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers&quot; (&quot;dimētōr&quot;).

Nonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. &quot;The Seasons, those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.&quot; Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received &quot;by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.&quot; (Dionysiaca 7).
The mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Zeus came to Semele in her bed, adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and &quot;Zeus made long wooing, and shouted &quot;Euoi!&quot; as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.&quot; Immediately, Semele&#x27;s bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: &quot;you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.&quot; (Dionysiaca 7).
During her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus&#x27; wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers but warned her that no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8). But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. &quot;So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother&#x27;s way, having passed from a mother&#x27;s womb to a father&#x27;s.&quot; (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The Seasons crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.

An alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of Ammon, who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of Libya. Ammon had married the goddess Rhea, but he had an affair with Amaltheia, who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea&#x27;s wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to Nysa (Dionysus&#x27; traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero Aristaeus. Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married Cronus.

====Interpretation====

Even in antiquity, the account of Dionysus&#x27; birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of Euhemerism (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The 4th-century Roman emperor and philosopher Julian encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter &quot;To the Cynic Heracleios&quot;, Julian wrote &quot;I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele and that he became a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.&quot; However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus&#x27;s birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was &quot;no birth but a divine manifestation&quot; to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to &quot;pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life&quot;, he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian&#x27;s interpretation, the Greeks &quot;called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.&quot; The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the intelligible realm.

===Infancy===

According to Nonnus, Zeus gave the infant Dionysus to the care of Hermes. Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to Ino for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus&#x27; account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, to hide him from Hera&#x27;s wrath. However, Hera found him, and vowed to destroy the house with a flood; however, Hermes again rescued Dionysus, this time bringing him to the mountains of Lydia. Hermes adopted the form of Phanes, most ancient of the gods, and so Hera bowed before him and let him pass. Hermes gave the infant to the goddess Rhea, who cared for him through his adolescence.

Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). In yet another version of the myth, he is raised by his cousin Macris on the island of Euboea.
Dionysus in Greek mythology is a god of foreign origin, and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location, it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south. The &quot;Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus&quot; places it &quot;far from Phoenicia, near to the Egyptian stream&quot;. Others placed it in Anatolia, or in Libya (&quot;away in the west beside a great ocean&quot;), in Ethiopia (Herodotus), or Arabia (Diodorus Siculus).
According to Herodotus:

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; seems to be following Pherecydes, who relates how the infant Dionysus, god of the grapevine, was nursed by the rain-nymphs, the Hyades at Nysa. Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the centaur Chiron. According to Ptolemy Chennus in the Library of Photius, &quot;Dionysus was loved by Chiron, from whom he learned chants and dances, the bacchic rites and initiations.&quot;

===Travels and invention of wine===

When Dionysus grew up, he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice, being the first to do so; but Hera struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Cybele, better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted several years. According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.
Another myth according to Nonnus involves Ampelus, a satyr, who was loved by Dionysus. As related by Ovid, Ampelus became the constellation &quot;Vindemitor&quot;, or the &quot;grape-gatherer&quot;: Another story of Ampelus was related by Nonnus: in an accident foreseen by Dionysus, the youth was killed while riding a bull maddened by the sting of a gadfly sent by Selene, the goddess of the Moon. The Fates granted Ampelus a second life as a vine, from which Dionysus squeezed the first wine.

===Return to Greece===

Returning in triumph to Greece after his travels in Asia, Dionysus came to be considered the founder of the triumphal procession. He undertook efforts to introduce his religion into Greece, but was opposed by rulers who feared it, on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it.

In one myth, adapted in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, Dionysus returns to his birthplace, Thebes, which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus. Pentheus, as well as his mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoe, disbelieve Dionysus&#x27; divine birth. Despite the warnings of the blind prophet Tiresias, they deny his worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness.
Dionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads, in the woods of Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual orgy, hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take him to be a mountain-dwelling lion and attack him with their bare hands. Pentheus&#x27; aunts and his mother Agave are among them, and they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus.

Euripides&#x27; description of this sparagmos was as follows:

The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.
In the Iliad, when King Lycurgus of Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus&#x27; followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the people to revolt. The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived, and his people had him drawn and quartered. Appeased by the king&#x27;s death, Dionysus lifted the curse. In an alternative version, sometimes depicted in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and slowly strangled him.

===Captivity and escape===

The &quot;Homeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus&quot; recounts how, while he sat on the seashore, some sailors spotted him, believing him a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail away to sell him for ransom or into slavery. No rope would bind him. The god turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing all in his path. Those who jumped ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.

In a similar story, Dionysus hired a Tyrrhenian pirate ship to sail from Icaria to Naxos. When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates but transforms to a divine adult when on board.

Many of the myths involve Dionysus defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that &quot;It is a measure of Bacchus&#x27;s ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated&quot;. Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus&#x27; time among mortals. In that sense, it serves as final proof of his divinity and is often followed by his descent into Hades to retrieve his mother, both of whom can then ascend into heaven to live alongside the other Olympian gods.

===Descent to the underworld===

Pausanias, in book II of his &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, describes two variant traditions regarding Dionysus&#x27; katabasis, or descent into the underworld. Both describe how Dionysus entered into the afterlife to rescue his mother Semele, and bring her to her rightful place on Olympus. To do so, he had to contend with the hell dog Cerberus, which was restrained for him by Heracles. After retrieving Semele, Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, according to the local tradition. This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival, the details of which were held secret by the local religion. According to Paola Corrente, the emergence of Dionysus from the waters of the lagoon may signify a form of rebirth for both him and Semele as they reemerged from the underworld. A variant of this myth forms the basis of Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;.

According to the Christian writer Clement of Alexandria, Dionysus was guided in his journey by Prosymnus or Polymnus, who requested, as his reward, to be Dionysus&#x27; lover. Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge, so to satisfy Prosymnus&#x27; shade, Dionysus fashioned a phallus from a fig branch and penetrated himself with it at Prosymnus&#x27; tomb. This story survives in full only in Christian sources, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology, but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the Dionysian Mysteries.

This same myth of Dionysus&#x27; descent to the underworld is related by both Diodorus Siculus in his first century BC work &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, and Pseudo-Apollodorus in the third book of his first century AD work &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera&#x27;s wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess. In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus must prove his godhood to mortals and then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.

===Secondary myths===

====Midas&#x27; golden touch====

Dionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, Silenus, had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas&#x27; rose garden). The king recognized him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.

Midas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.

The horrified king strove to divest the Midas Touch, and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this etiological myth explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.
====Love affairs====

When Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. They had a son named Oenopion, but she committed suicide or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, Dionysus had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her. Psalacantha, a nymph, promised to help Dionysus court Ariadne in exchange for his sexual favours; but Dionysus refused, so Psalacantha advised Ariadne against going with him. For this Dionysus turned her into the plant with the same name.

Dionysus fell in love with a nymph named Nicaea, in some versions by Eros&#x27; binding. Nicaea however was a sworn virgin and scorned his attempts to court her. So one day, while she was away, he replaced the water in the spring from which she used to drink with wine. Intoxicated, Nicaea passed out, and Dionysus raped her in her sleep. When she woke up and realized what had happened, she sought him out to harm him, but she never found him. She gave birth to his sons Telete, Satyrus, and others. Dionysus named the ancient city of Nicaea after her.

In Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Eros made Dionysus fall in love with Aura, a virgin companion of Artemis, as part of a ploy to punish Aura for having insulted Artemis. Dionysus used the same trick as with Nicaea to get her fall asleep, tied her up, and then raped her. Aura tried to kill herself, with little success. When she gave birth to twin sons by Dionysus, Iacchus and another boy, she ate one twin before drowning herself in the Sangarius river.

Also in the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Nonnus relates how Dionysus fell in love with a handsome satyr named Ampelos, who was killed by Selene due to him challenging her. On his death, Dionysus changed him into the first grapevine.

====Other myths====

A third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by Aristophanes in his comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the &quot;Dionysia&quot;, wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians. After a poetry slam, Aeschylus is chosen in preference to Euripides.

When Hephaestus bound Hera to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.

Callirrhoe was a Calydonian woman who scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, who threatened to afflict all the women of Calydon with insanity (see Maenad). The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her.

Dionysus also sent a fox that was fated never to be caught in Thebes. Creon, king of Thebes, sent Amphitryon to catch and kill the fox. Amphitryon obtained from Cephalus the dog that his wife Procris had received from Minos, which was fated to catch whatever it pursued.

Another account about Dionysus&#x27;s parentage indicates that he is the son of Zeus and Gê (Gaia), also named &quot;Themelê&quot; (foundation), corrupted into &quot;Semele&quot;.

Hyginus relates that Dionysus once gave human speech to a donkey. The donkey then proceeded to challenge Priapus in a contest about which between them had the better penis; the donkey lost. Priapus killed the donkey, but Dionysus placed him among the stars, above the Crab.

===Children===
The following is a list of Dionysus&#x27; offspring, by various mothers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source (in some cases approximately) dates.
==Iconography and depictions==
===Symbols===
The earliest cult images of Dionysus show a mature male, bearded and robed. He holds a fennel staff, tipped with a pine-cone and known as a &quot;thyrsus&quot;. Later images show him as a beardless, sensuous, naked or half-naked androgynous youth: the literature describes him as womanly or &quot;man-womanish&quot;. In its fully developed form, his central cult imagery shows his triumphant, disorderly arrival or return, as if from some place beyond the borders of the known and civilized. His procession &quot;(thiasus)&quot; is made up of wild female followers (maenads) and bearded satyrs with erect penises; some are armed with the &quot;thyrsus&quot;, some dance or play music. The god himself is drawn in a chariot, usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers, and is sometimes attended by a bearded, drunken Silenus. This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his Dionysian Mysteries. Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolizes the chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods.

Dionysus was a god of resurrection and he was strongly linked to the bull. In a cult hymn from Olympia, at a festival for Hera, Dionysus is invited to come as a bull; &quot;with bull-foot raging&quot;. Walter Burkert relates, &quot;Quite frequently [Dionysus] is portrayed with bull horns, and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image&quot;, and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans.
The snake and phallus were symbols of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and of Bacchus in Greece and Rome. There is a procession called the &quot;phallophoria&quot;, in which villagers would parade through the streets carrying phallic images or pulling phallic representations on carts. He typically wears a panther or leopard skin and carries a thyrsus. His iconography sometimes includes maenads, who wear wreaths of ivy and serpents around their hair or neck.

The cult of Dionysus was closely associated with trees, specifically the fig tree, and some of his bynames exhibit this, such as &quot;he in the tree&quot; or , &quot;he of the tree&quot;. Peters suggests the original meaning as &quot;he who runs among the trees&quot;, or that of a &quot;runner in the woods&quot;. Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of &quot;he who impels the (world-)tree&quot;. This interpretation explains how &quot;Nysa&quot; could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of &quot;tree&quot; to the name of a mountain: the axis mundi of Indo-European mythology is represented both as a world-tree and as a world-mountain.

Dionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star Sirius, the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when Orion is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the &quot;pure light of high summer&quot; as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus&#x27; birth from Zeus&#x27; thigh calls him &quot;the light of Zeus&quot; (&quot;Dios phos&quot;) and associates him with the light of Sirius.

===Classical art===

The god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted pottery of Ancient Greece, much of which made to hold wine. But, apart from some reliefs of maenads, Dionysian subjects rarely appeared in large sculpture before the Hellenistic period, when they became common. In these, the treatment of the god himself ranged from severe archaising or Neo Attic types such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus to types showing him as an indolent and androgynous young man, often nude. &quot;Hermes and the Infant Dionysus&quot; is probably a Greek original in marble, and the Ludovisi Dionysus group is probably a Roman original of the second century AD. Well-known Hellenistic sculptures of Dionysian subjects, surviving in Roman copies, include the Barberini Faun, the Belvedere Torso, the &quot;Resting Satyr&quot;. The Furietti Centaurs and &quot;Sleeping Hermaphroditus&quot; reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit. The marble Dancer of Pergamon is an original, as is the bronze Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, a recent recovery from the sea.

The Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe pastoral into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as centaurs, nymphs, and the gods Pan and Hermaphrodite. &quot;Nymph&quot; by this stage &quot;means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant&quot;. Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and &quot;most should be seen as part of his realm. They have in common with satyrs and nymphs that they are creatures of the outdoors and are without true personal identity.&quot; The fourth-century BC Derveni Krater, the unique survival of a very large scale Classical or Hellenistic metal vessel of top quality, depicts Dionysus and his followers.

Dionysus appealed to the Hellenistic monarchies for a number of reasons, apart from merely being a god of pleasure: He was a human who became divine, he came from, and had conquered, the East, exemplified a lifestyle of display and magnificence with his mortal followers, and was often regarded as an ancestor. He continued to appeal to the rich of Imperial Rome, who populated their gardens with Dionysian sculpture, and by the second century AD were often buried in sarcophagi carved with crowded scenes of Bacchus and his entourage.

The fourth-century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a spectacular cage cup which changes colour when light comes through the glass; it shows the bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr; this may have been used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries. Elizabeth Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos, Cyprus, details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus. In the mosaic, other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus. The mid-Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around 1000 AD, but probably not very well understood.

===Early modern art===

Bacchic subjects in art resumed in the Italian Renaissance, and soon became almost as popular as in antiquity, but his &quot;strong association with feminine spirituality and power almost disappeared&quot;, as did &quot;the idea that the destructive and creative powers of the god were indissolubly linked&quot;. In Michelangelo&#x27;s statue (1496–97) &quot;madness has become merriment&quot;. The statue tries to suggest both drunken incapacity and an elevated consciousness, but this was perhaps lost on later viewers, and typically the two aspects were thereafter split, with a clearly drunk Silenus representing the former, and a youthful Bacchus often shown with wings, because he carries the mind to higher places.
Titian&#x27;s &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot; (1522–23) and &quot;The Bacchanal of the Andrians&quot; (1523–26), both painted for the same room, offer an influential heroic pastoral, while Diego Velázquez in &quot;The Triumph of Bacchus&quot; (or &quot;Los borrachos&quot; – &quot;the drinkers&quot;, c. 1629) and Jusepe de Ribera in his &quot;Drunken Silenus&quot; choose a genre realism. Flemish Baroque painting frequently painted the Bacchic followers, as in Van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Silenus&quot; and many works by Rubens; Poussin was another regular painter of Bacchic scenes.

A common theme in art beginning in the sixteenth century was the depiction of Bacchus and Ceres caring for a representation of love – often Venus, Cupid, or Amore. This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian Terence (c. 195/185 – c. 159 BC) which became a popular proverb in the Early Modern period: &quot;Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus&quot; (&quot;without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes&quot;). Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550–1630, especially in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries, as well as by Rubens. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.

===Modern literature and philosophy===


Dionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a &quot;modern myth&quot;, as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.

Nietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche&#x27;s 1886 work &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, and later &quot;The Twilight of the Idols&quot;, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; and &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained will to power. Towards the end of his life, Nietzsche famously went mad. He was known to sign letters as both Dionysus and &quot;The Crucified&quot; in this period of his life. In &quot;The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God&quot; (1904), and &quot;Dionysus and Early Dionysianism&quot; (1921), the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Ivanov said that Dionysus&#x27; suffering &quot;was the distinctive feature of the cult&quot; just as Christ&#x27;s suffering is significant for Christianity. Karl Kerényi characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek &quot;Zoê&quot;). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus&#x27; emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes should be kept in an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.

J. M. Tolcher&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Poof&quot; (2023), features Dionysus as a character and a force of modern liberation in Australia, incorporating traditional myth and Nietzschean philosophy to represent queer suffering.

===Modern film and performance art===
In 1969, an adaption of &quot;The Bacchae&quot; was performed, called &quot;Dionysus in &#x27;69&quot;. A film was made of the same performance. The production was notable for involving audience participation, nudity, and theatrical innovations.

In 1974, Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove adapted Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot; into a modern musical, which hit broadway in 2004 and was revived in London in 2017. The musical keeps the descent of Dionysus into Hades to bring back a playwright; however, the playwrights are updated to modern times, and Dionysus is forced to choose between George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare.

In 2019, the South Korean boy band BTS released a rap-rock-synth-pop-hip hop track. named &quot;Dionysus&quot; as part of their album &quot;Map of the Soul: Persona&quot;. The naming of this song comes from the association of the namesake with debauchery and excess, this is reflected in its lyrics talking about &quot;getting drunk on art&quot; – playing on the Korean words for &quot;alcohol&quot; (술 &quot;sul&quot;) and &quot;art&quot; (예술 &quot;yesul&quot;) as an example – alongside expressions about their stardom, legacy, and artistic integrity.

In 2024, French actor and singer Phillippe Katerine portrayed a blue and near naked Dionysus at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in France.

==Parallels with Christianity==

Some scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-rising god mythological archetype. On the other hand, it has been noted that the details of Dionysus&#x27; death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus. The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts. Also, the manner of death is different; in the most common myth, Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the Titans, but &quot;eventually restored to a new life&quot; from the heart that was left over.

Another parallel can be seen in &quot;The Bacchae&quot; where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate. However, a number of scholars dispute this parallel, since the confrontation between Dionysus and Pentheus ends with Pentheus dying, torn into pieces by the mad women, whereas the trial of Jesus ends with him being sentenced to death.

E. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict monotheism by the fourth century AD; together with Mithraism and other sects, the cult formed an instance of &quot;pagan monotheism&quot; in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity. Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially Gerard Vossius, also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and Moses.

John Moles has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity, and especially how Christians understood themselves as a new religion centered around a savior deity.

<text>A salad dressing is a sauce for salads. Used on virtually all &quot;leafy salads&quot;, dressings may also be used in making salads of beans (such as three bean salad), noodle or pasta salads and antipasti, and forms of potato salad.

Salad dressings can be drizzled over a salad, added and tossed with the ingredients, offered on the side, or served as a dip, as with &quot;crudités&quot; or chicken wings.

==Types==
In Western culture, there are two basic types of salad dressing:
* Vinaigrettes based on a mixture (emulsion) of olive or salad oil and vinegar and variously flavored with herbs, spices, salt, pepper, sugar, and other ingredients such as poppy seeds or ground Parmesan cheese
* Creamy dressings, usually based on mayonnaise or fermented milk products, such as yogurt, sour cream (crème fraîche, smetana), or buttermilk.

In the United States, buttermilk-based ranch dressing is the most popular, with vinaigrettes and Caesar-style dressing following close behind.

===List===
Some salad dressings include:

* Balsamic vinaigrette
* Blue cheese
* Boiled
* Caesar
* French
* Ginger
* Green goddess
* Italian
* Louis
* Mayfair
* Honey mustard
* Peanut sauce
* Ranch
* Russian
* Salad cream
* Tahini sauce
* Thousand Island
* Wafu

<text>Roberto Carlos Durán Samaniego (born June 16, 1951) is a Panamanian former professional boxer who competed from 1968 to 2001. He held world championships in four weight classes: Lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight. Duran also reigned as the undisputed and lineal lightweight champion and the lineal welterweight champion. He is also the second boxer to have competed over a span of five decades, the first being Jack Johnson. Durán was known as a versatile, technical brawler and pressure fighter, which earned him the nickname &quot;Manos de Piedra&quot; (&quot;Hands of Stone&quot;) for his formidable punching power and excellent defense.

In 2002, Durán was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the fifth greatest fighter of the last 80 years, while boxing historian Bert Sugar rated him as the eighth greatest fighter of all time. The Associated Press voted him as the best lightweight of the 20th century, with many considering him the greatest lightweight of all time. Durán retired for good in January 2002 at age 50, following a car crash in Argentina in October 2001, after which he had required life saving surgery. He had previously retired in November 1980, June 1984 and August 1998, only to change his mind. Durán ended his career with a professional record of 119 fights, 103 wins, and 70 knockouts. From May 1971 up until his second fight against Sugar Ray Leonard in November 1980, as well as in his fight against Wilfred Benítez in January 1982, Durán was trained by legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel.

== Early life ==
Roberto Durán was born on June 16, 1951, in Guararé, Panama. His mother, Clara Samaniego, was a native of Guararé and his father, Margarito Duran, an American of Mexican heritage was stationed in Panama for the U.S. Army at the time of Roberto’s birth. He was raised in the slums of El Chorrillo in the district &quot;La Casa de Piedra&quot; (The House of Stone), in Panama City. He began sparring with experienced boxers at the Neco de La Guardia gymnasium when he was only eight years old.

== Amateur career ==
Durán competed as an amateur, compiling a record of 29–3 (other sources say 18–3 or 13–3), with all 3 losses coming in Durán&#x27;s first 3 amateur fights. Following his amateur career, Durán made his professional debut in February 1968 at the age of 16.

== Professional career ==

=== Lightweight ===

Durán won his first 31 consecutive professional fights, and scored knockout victories over future Featherweight Champion Ernesto Marcel and former Super Featherweight Champion Hiroshi Kobayashi, culminating in his first title bout in June 1972, where he defeated Ken Buchanan at Madison Square Garden for the WBA Lightweight Championship. Durán, as a 2-to-1 underdog, scored a knockdown against the defending champion just fifteen seconds into the opening round and battered him throughout the bout. He was well ahead on all three cards as the bell rang to end the 13th round, at which time Durán (apparently not hearing the bell) continued to throw a couple of extra punches as Buchanan lay on the ropes. As Durán continued punching, the referee, Johnny LoBianco, grabbed him to pull him away. He pulled down on Durán&#x27;s arms, which led to a seemingly accidental low blow. Buchanan dropped to the canvas in pain. His trainer Gil Clancy later said he had believed the blow to have been caused by a knee. Durán was not disqualified from the bout; instead, he was deemed as winner by thirteenth-round technical knockout. Columnist Red Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that LoBianco had to award the victory to Durán, even if the punch was a low blow, as &quot;anything short of pulling a knife is regarded indulgently&quot; in American boxing. Buchanan said he left the fight &quot;with sore balls&quot;.

Durán followed up on his title winning performance with several non-title matches. Later that year, in another non-title bout, he lost a ten-round decision to Esteban De Jesús. Durán got back on track with successful title defenses against Jimmy Robertson, Hector Thompson and future Lightweight Champion Guts Ishimatsu. In 1974, Durán avenged his loss to De Jesús with a brutal eleventh round knock out. In 1976, he defeated future Light Welterweight Champion Saoul Mamby. Overall, Durán made twelve successful defenses of his title (eleven coming by knockout) and amassed a record of 62–1, his last defense coming in 1978 when Durán fought a third bout with De Jesus in a unification match wherein Durán once again knocked out De Jesus and captured his WBC Lightweight Championship. Durán later visited De Jesús in 1989 when De Jesús was dying of AIDS. “When I see him there so thin, my tears run out because he used to be a muscular guy,&quot; Durán said. &quot;I start crying and I hug him, and I kiss him and I tell my daughter to kiss him.” The picture of their embrace was widely distributed, at a time when AIDS patients faced significant stigma.

Durán gave up the Undisputed Lightweight Championship in February 1979.

=== Welterweight and The Brawl in Montreal===
Vacating the Lightweight title was a buildup for an attempt at the Welterweight title. Durán earned wins against former WBC Welterweight Champion Carlos Palomino and Zeferino Gonzales, among others, setting the stage for a title bout against then-undefeated WBC Welterweight Champion Sugar Ray Leonard. The venue chosen was the Olympic Stadium in Montreal (the same location where Leonard won an Olympic gold medal during the 1976 Summer Olympics). Durán resented the fact that he was getting only one-fifth of the money that Leonard was getting, despite the fact that Durán was entering the bout with an incredible 71–1 record and seen by many as the best boxer of the decade of the 1970s. To the surprise of Leonard and his camp, who had expected a warm homecoming from the place where Leonard had won Olympic gold, Leonard only got a mixed reception in Montreal, while Durán was incredibly popular with the crowd, with Leonard later admitting that Durán&#x27;s popularity in Canada &quot;threw me for a loop&quot;. On June 20, 1980, Durán captured the WBC Welterweight title by defeating Leonard via a 15-round unanimous decision (145–144, 148–147, 146–144), although it was incorrectly announced as a majority decision in the ring with the 148–147 scorecard being incorrectly announced as 147–147. The fight became known as &quot;The Brawl in Montreal&quot;.

==== &quot;No Más&quot; in New Orleans ====
After defeating Leonard in Montreal, Durán gained iconic status in his home country, Panama. Leonard initiated the rematch clause and asked for the fight to be the following November. In their second fight, Leonard successfully changed his tactics, using more footwork and movement than he had in their first fight, and Durán was unable to get Leonard against the ropes. During the seventh round, after Leonard had gained a slight lead on the scorecards, he began taunting and mocking Durán. Towards the end of the eighth round, Durán suddenly stopped fighting, and according to referee Octavio Meyran and ABC commentator Howard Cosell, Durán repeatedly said &quot;No más&quot; (&quot;no more&quot;), which was denied by Durán, his cornermen Ray Arcel and Freddie Brown, and his manager Carlos Eleta, with Durán claiming he had said &quot;No quiero pelear con el payaso&quot; (&quot;I do not want to fight with this clown [Leonard]&quot;). According to Meyran, in addition to saying &quot;No más&quot;, Durán also said in broken English &quot;I don&#x27;t box anymore&quot;. In a 2016 interview, Durán claimed that what he actually said was, &quot;No sigo&quot; (&quot;I won&#x27;t go on&quot;). For a brief time after the &quot;No más&quot; debacle, Durán retired from boxing, but soon changed his mind, not wanting to end his career on such a bad note.

===Light middleweight and middleweight===
He took some time to recover from that fight and gained even more weight to contend for the WBC Light Middleweight title, but losing in his first attempt at a championship in that division on January 30, 1982, against Wilfred Benítez by a 15-round unanimous decision, this after having defeated Nino Gonzalez and Luigi Minchillo, two rated Light Middleweights, both by ten-round decisions in non-title bouts. Durán was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. Kirkland Laing, from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10-round walk out win over Englishman Jimmy Batten at The Battle of The Champions in Miami, Durán signed with promoter Bob Arum. This marked the beginning of a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer José Cuevas via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second crack at the light middleweight title, this time against WBA Champion Davey Moore.

The WBA title bout took place at Madison Square Garden on June 16, 1983, which also happened to be Durán&#x27;s 32nd birthday. The still inexperienced Moore (12–0) was game through the first three rounds, but by the 4th, Durán said he knew Moore couldn&#x27;t hurt him, and an onslaught began.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120968/1/index.htm&quot;&gt;He That Was Lost Has Been Found, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, June 27, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Durán crowd at ringside cheered as Durán relentlessly punished Moore. By the end of the sixth round, Moore&#x27;s eye had swollen shut and he was floored near the end of the seventh. Finally the fight was stopped in the eighth round as Moore was taking a horrific beating and Durán won his third world title. After the victory, Durán was hoisted up in the air as the crowd sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to a sobbing Durán.

Durán later fought for the World Middleweight Championship, meeting Marvelous Marvin Hagler in Las Vegas on November 10, 1983. During the fight, Duran broke his hand and lost in a very competitive fight that went the full fifteen rounds. After 13 rounds, two of the judges had Durán one point ahead, and the other judge had it even. Hagler fought tenaciously to win the final two rounds and get a unanimous decision victory. The judges&#x27; scores were 144–142, 144–143, and 146–145. Despite the loss, Durán became the second man to take Hagler to a fifteen-round decision (Vito Antuofermo was the other) and the only one to do so while Hagler was the world champion.

In June 1984, Durán was stripped of his Light Middleweight title when the WBA did not approve of his fight with WBC Champion Thomas &quot;Hitman&quot; Hearns and took away recognition of Durán as world champion the moment Durán stepped into the ring to box Hearns. Durán again made history in the fight, but this time it was the wrong kind. Hearns dropped Durán twice in the first round and as he rose to his feet after the second knockdown, which ended the round, the former champion did not know where his corner was. Hearns went on to knock Durán down a third time in the second round and the fight was stopped, marking the first time in his career that Durán had been knocked out in a fight (the &quot;No Más&quot; fight was officially recorded as a technical knockout, because Durán quit). Durán then retired for a second time, but changed his mind over a year later, and was back fighting in early 1986.

Durán did not contend another title fight until 1989, but made the shot count when he won the WBC Middleweight title from Iran Barkley in February. The fight is considered one of Durán&#x27;s greatest achievements, as the 37-year-old former lightweight champion took the middleweight crown, his fourth title. In a tough, back-and-forth fight, Durán knocked Barkley down in the eleventh round and Durán won a split decision (118–112, 116–112, 113–116). The bout was named the 1989 &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

=== Super middleweight ===

Duran moved up to super middleweight for a third fight with Sugar Ray Leonard in December 1989 (a fight dubbed &quot;Uno Más&quot; — One More — by promoters), where Leonard&#x27;s WBC super-middleweight title was on the line, although Leonard&#x27;s camp insisted that the fight with Durán be at a 162lbs catchweight instead of the 168lbs super-middleweight limit that Durán favoured. In the end, both weighed in below the 160lbs middleweight limit. Durán was uncharacteristically flat for most of what was a strange fight. Although Leonard won the fight by a wide unanimous decision (120–110, 119–109, 116–111), by the end of the fight Leonard looked the worse for wear as he had suffered several bad cuts. Leonard&#x27;s lip was busted by a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required more than 60 stitches. Durán didn&#x27;t fight again until 1991, so had given up his WBC middleweight crown that he had won against Barkley. Durán seemed to be in decline after the third fight against Leonard, but he persisted and worked his way into title shots for the lesser IBC super-middleweight and middleweight titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

Durán fought Vinny Pazienza twice, in June 1994 and January 1995, for the IBC Super Middleweight Championship, with Pazienza winning both times by unanimous decision. In the first fight, Durán put Pazienza down in Rounds 2 and 5, but referee Joe Cortez controversially ruled the Round 2 knockdown to be a slip. The first fight divided the people watching as some felt that Durán had won a close fight, but others felt that Pazienza had won either narrowly or widely after finishing strongly in the last five rounds. The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza&#x27;s favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 118–110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120–108 shutout.

In 1996, Durán fought Héctor Camacho for the vacant IBC Middleweight Championship. At the end of the fight, fans and TV commentators seemed in complete agreement that Durán had won the fight in an excellent performance, but the three judges saw the fight very differently and awarded Camacho the victory by a very controversial unanimous decision. Durán&#x27;s old rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, commentating at ringside, was baffled at the scoring and called it an early Christmas gift for Camacho, with the result motivating Leonard enough to come out of a 6-year boxing retirement to face Camacho himself in 1997. In 1997, Durán was defeated by former champion Jorge Castro in Argentina. Durán then fought Castro in a rematch bout in Panama and won via unanimous decision, maintaining his unbeaten record in Panama.

In 1998, at the age of 47, he challenged 28-year-old WBA Middleweight Champion William Joppy. Joppy, a trim, quick-fisted fighter, battered Durán to defeat in just 3 rounds. It was Durán&#x27;s most emphatic loss since the Hearns fight, over a decade earlier. Durán then announced his retirement for the third time in August 1998, but soon changed his mind and was back fighting in March 1999.

In June 2000, Durán avenged a previous loss to Pat Lawlor from 9 years before and won the NBA Super Middleweight Championship on his 49th birthday. He lost the title a year later to Héctor Camacho in a rematch bout and in what would be Durán&#x27;s final fight.

== Retirement ==

In October 2001, Durán traveled to Argentina to promote a salsa music CD that he had just released. While there, he was involved in a car crash and required life-saving surgery. After that incident, he announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 50.

Announcing his retirement, Durán cited the weight issues of his friend, Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona, as motivation for getting back in shape, stating &quot;as of now, I am exercising so that when the [retirement] honors arrive the people will see me in shape. I don&#x27;t want to [look] like Maradona did, all fat.&quot;

Durán&#x27;s five world title belts, which he won in four different divisions, were stolen from his house in Panama in 1993 during a robbery allegedly staged by his brother-in-law, who gave them to memorabilia seller Luis González Báez, who stood trial for trying to sell stolen goods. González Báez allegedly sold the belts to undercover FBI agents. He alleged that Durán authorized the sale of the five belts to him during a time that Durán was facing financial trouble. On September 23, 2003, a federal judge in Florida ordered the five belts returned to Durán.

His 70 wins by knockout place him in an exclusive group of boxers who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. He is ranked number 28 on &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

On October 14, 2006, Durán was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Riverside, California, and on June 10, 2007, into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York.

In June 2020, Durán was diagnosed with Covid-19 after going to hospital with common cold symptoms. Durán underwent treatment for the disease. Coincidentally, the diagnosis came on the 48th anniversary of Durán&#x27;s first world title victory against Ken Buchanan, which took place on June 26, 1972. He was released from the hospital weeks later.

Today he is the brand ambassador of Panama Blue, Panama&#x27;s premium bottled water.

Durán is a licensed ultralight aircraft pilot in Panama. He flew a Quick Silver MX model.
Durán&#x27;s daughter, Irichelle Durán, was a professional boxer herself who garnered a record of one win and two losses in three bouts, with one win by knockout. She is a resident of Puerto Rico.

In March 2024, it was revealed that Durán suffers a heart problem known as atrioventricular blockage, He had surgery on Monday 18 March in Panama to have a pacemaker placed in his chest.

== Appearances in film/music ==

=== Film ===
Durán&#x27;s first appearance in a movie was in the 1979 film &quot;Rocky II&quot; as a lightning-fast sparring partner for Rocky Balboa. Outside of this, Durán had minor roles in &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;.

Durán&#x27;s life and boxing career are told in the documentary &quot;Los puños de una nación&quot; (&quot;The Fists of a Nation&quot;) by Panamanian filmmaker Pituka Ortega-Heilbron. Durán also appears very briefly during an interview for the documentary &quot;The Panama Deception&quot; (1992), in which he recounts his experience during the United States invasion of Panama.

The biopic &quot;Hands of Stone&quot; stars Édgar Ramírez as Durán, Robert De Niro as Ray Arcel and Usher as Sugar Ray Leonard, and was released on August 26, 2016.

=== Television ===
Durán played the drug lord Jesús Maroto in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; season two, episode 19.

In &quot;Corporate Warriors&quot;, the fourth episode of the second season of the hit American crime drama &quot;&quot;, Durán is mentioned by the medical examiner while discussing a dead man found to have bone grafts put in his hands to boost his punching power.

=== Music ===
The song &quot;The Eyes of Roberto Durán&quot; by Tom Russell, from the album &quot;The Long Way Around&quot;, contains the lyric, &quot;Panama City – it&#x27;s three in the morning; they&#x27;re talking &#x27;bout the Hands of Stone.&quot;

Durán is mentioned in the third verse of Nas&#x27; original demo for &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Hard to Tell&quot; in the line: &quot;Metaphors of murder man, hittin&#x27; like Roberto Durán, hold the mic in my hand, my lifespan.&quot;

The musician Jackie Leven recorded a song (&quot;Museum of Childhood&quot;) that explores the events of the second world title fight between Durán and Sugar Ray Leonard.

Jazz musician Miles Davis, an avid boxing fan, recorded a tribute to Roberto Durán titled &quot;Duran&quot;.

Durán is also mentioned in the third verse of Paul Thorn&#x27;s &quot;Hammer and Nail,&quot; based on Thorn&#x27;s nationally televised fight with Durán:
Texas rockabilly band Reverend Horton Heat mentions Durán in their song &quot;Eat Steak,&quot; off of their album &quot;Smoke &#x27;Em If You Got &#x27;Em&quot;.

Durán is mentioned in the salsa song &quot;Pa&#x27;l Bailador&quot; by Colombian singer Joe Arroyo in 1989, &quot;A Roberto Duran, Aya en Panama, Mano de Piedra!&quot; (To Roberto Duran, in Panama, Hands of Stones!)

Durán is referenced multiple times in the song &quot;Uno Mas&quot; by Alex Soria&#x27;s band Chino.

Durán&#x27;s 1983 fight with Davey Moore is referenced in the 2014 single, &quot;The Possum,&quot; by American songwriter, Sun Kil Moon (i.e. Mark Kozelek), who often writes about boxers. Kozelek sings:
&quot;They threw hard vicious guttural B-flats that shook their opponent /
Like a tough Roberto &quot;Hands of Stone&quot; Durán, in the seventh round /
Davey Moore, June 16, 1983...&quot;
Durán himself was a Salsa singer once, leading an orchestra named &quot;Felicidad&quot; after his wife. They recorded albums and frequented television shows in Latin America.

Durán is also mentioned by former rap duo Max and Sam (consisting of sports analyst Max Kellerman and his brother Sam) in their song &#x27;Young Man Rumble&#x27; with the line &quot;Got skills got stamina got Hands of Stone like the champ from Panama.&quot;

Durán is indirectly referred to in Kevin Morby&#x27;s song &quot;This Is a Photograph&quot;, in which Morby&#x27;s father&#x27;s struggle with aging is likened to Durán&#x27;s career, from his early bravado to the &quot;No Más&quot; fight against Sugar Ray Leonard.

<doc id="63330" wikidata="Q3072191" url="?curid=63330" title="Railway Mania">
<text>Railway Mania was a stock market bubble in the rail transportation industry of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the 1840s. It followed a common pattern: as the price of railway shares increased, speculators invested more money, which further increased the price of railway shares, until the share price collapsed. The mania reached its zenith in 1846, when 263 Acts of Parliament for setting up new railway companies were passed, with the proposed routes totalling . About a third of the railways authorised were never built—the companies either collapsed because of poor financial planning, were bought out by larger competitors before they could build their line, or turned out to be fraudulent enterprises to channel investors&#x27; money into other businesses.

== Causes ==
The world&#x27;s first recognizably modern inter-city railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (the L&amp;M), opened in 1830 and proved to be successful for transporting both passengers and freight. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the British economy slowed. Interest rates rose, making it more attractive to invest money in government bonds—the main source of investment at the time—and political and social unrest deterred banks and businesses from investing the huge sums of money required to build railways; the L&amp;M cost £637,000 (£ adjusted for 2015).

By the mid-1840s, the economy was improving and the manufacturing industries were once again growing. The Bank of England cut interest rates, making government bonds less attractive investments, and existing railway companies&#x27; shares began to boom as they moved ever-increasing amounts of cargo and people, making people willing to invest in new railways.

Crucially, there were more investors in British business. The Industrial Revolution was creating a new, increasingly affluent middle class. While earlier business ventures had relied on a small number of banks, businessmen and wealthy aristocrats for investment, a prospective railway company also had a large, literate section of population with savings to invest. In 1825 the government had repealed the Bubble Act, brought in during the near-disastrous South Sea Bubble of 1720, which had put close limits on the formation of new business ventures and, importantly, had limited joint stock companies to a maximum of five separate investors. With these limits removed, anyone could invest money (and hopefully earn a return) on a new company, and railways were heavily promoted as a foolproof venture. New media such as newspapers and the emergence of the modern international financial and trade markets made it easy for companies to promote themselves and provide the means for the general public to invest. Shares could be purchased for a 10% deposit, with the railway company holding the right to call in the remainder at any time. The railways were so heavily promoted as a foolproof venture that thousands of investors on modest incomes bought large numbers of shares, whilst only being able to afford the deposit. Many families invested their entire savings in prospective railway companies—and many of those lost everything when the bubble collapsed and the companies called in the remainder of their due payments.

The British government promoted an almost totally &#x27;laissez-faire&#x27; system of non-regulation in the railways. Companies had to submit a bill to Parliament to gain the right to acquire land for the line, which required the route of the proposed railway to be approved, but there were no limits on the number of companies and no real checks on the financial viability of a line. Anyone could form a company, gain investment and submit a bill to Parliament. Since many Members of Parliament (MPs) were heavy investors in such schemes, it was rare for a bill to not pass during the peak of the mania in 1846, although Parliament did reject schemes that were blatantly misleading or impossible to construct.
Magnates like George Hudson developed routes in the North and Midlands by amalgamating small railway companies and rationalising routes. He was also an MP, but ultimately failed because of his fraudulent practices of, for example, paying dividends from capital.

== The end of the mania ==
As with other bubbles, the Railway Mania became a self-promoting cycle based purely on over-optimistic speculation. As the dozens of companies formed began to operate and the simple unviability of many of them became clear, investors began to realise that railways were not all as lucrative and as easy to build as they had been led to believe. Coupled to this, in late 1845 the Bank of England increased interest rates. As banks began to re-invest in bonds, the money began to flow out of railways, undercutting the boom.

The share prices of railways slowed in their rise, then leveled out. As they began to fall, investment stopped virtually overnight, leaving numerous companies without funding and numerous investors with no prospect of any return on their investment. The larger railway companies such as the Great Western Railway and the nascent Midland began to buy up strategic failed lines to expand their network. These lines could be purchased at a fraction of their real value as given a choice between a below-value offer for their shares or the total loss of their investment, shareholders naturally chose the former. Many middle-class families on modest incomes had sunk their entire savings into new companies during the mania, and they lost everything when the speculation collapsed.

The boom-and-bust cycle of early-industrial Britain was still in effect, and the boom that had created the conditions for Railway Mania began to cool and then a decline set in. The number of new railway companies fell away to almost nothing in the late 1840s and early 1850s, with the only new lines constructed being by the large companies. Economic upturns in the 1850s and 1860s saw smaller booms in railway construction, but these never reached anywhere near the scale of the mania—partly because of more thoughtful (if still very limited) government control, partly because of more cautious investors and partly because the UK railway network was approaching maturity, with none of the &#x27;blank canvas&#x27; available to numerous companies as in the 1840s.

== Results ==
Unlike some stock market bubbles, there was a net tangible result from all the investment: a vast expansion of the British railway system, though perhaps at an inflated cost. Amongst the high number of impractical, overambitious and downright fraudulent schemes promoted during the mania were a good number of practical trunk routes (most notably the initial part of the Great Northern Railway and the trans-Pennine Woodhead route) and important freight lines (such as large parts of what would become the North Eastern Railway). These projects all required vast amounts of capital, all of which had to be raised from private enterprise. The speculative frenzy of the mania made people much more willing to invest the large sums required for railway construction than they had been previously or would be in later years. Even many of the routes that failed when the mania collapsed became viable (if not lucrative) when each was in the hands of the larger company that had purchased it. A total of of railway line were built as a result of projects authorised between 1844 and 1846—by comparison, the total route mileage of the modern UK railway network is around .

== Comparisons ==
Railway and Canal Mania can be compared with a similar mania in the 1990s in the stock of telecom companies. The telecom mania resulted in the installation and deployment of a vast amount of fibre-optic telecommunications infrastructure, spurred on from the realisation that the same railway rights-of-way could make affordable conduits for fibre optics. Yet another boom occurred in the period 1995–2000, during the development of the Internet, when many companies were established to promote new services on the growing network. The dot-com bubble collapsed in 2000, and the much more extensive telecoms bubble in 2002 with the bankruptcies of Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing and QWest, although some platform companies such as Google and Amazon grew and prospered, diversifying into backbone fibre networks and cloud computing services.

<text>James I the Conqueror (Catalan/Valencian: &quot;Jaume I or Jaume el Conqueridor&quot;; Aragonese: &quot;Chaime I&quot; &quot;o Conqueridor&quot;; ; 2 February 1208 – 27 July 1276) was King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier from 1213 to 1276; King of Majorca from 1231 to 1276; and King of Valencia from 1238 to 1276. His long reign of 62 years is not only the longest of any Iberian monarch, but one of the longest monarchical reigns in history, ahead of Hirohito but remaining behind Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria, and Ferdinand III of Naples and Sicily.

King James I saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the southeast, and Valencia to the south. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he achieved the renunciation of any possible claim of French suzerainty over the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties, while he renounced northward expansion and taking back the once Catalan territories in Occitania and vassal counties loyal to the County of Barcelona, lands that were lost by his father Peter II of Aragon in the Battle of Muret during the Albigensian Crusade and annexed by the Kingdom of France, and then decided to turn south. His great part in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. One of the main reasons for this formal renunciation of most of the once Catalan territories in Languedoc and Occitania, and any expansion into them, is that he was raised by the Knights Templar Crusaders, who had defeated his father, who was fighting for the Pope alongside the French. It was thus effectively forbidden for him to try to maintain the traditional influence of the Count of Barcelona that previously existed in Occitania and Languedoc.

As a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the European kings. King James I compiled the &quot;Llibre del Consolat de Mar&quot;, which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He was an important figure in the development of the Catalan language, sponsoring Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the &quot;Llibre dels fets&quot;.

==Early life and reign until majority==
James was born at Montpellier as the only son of Peter II of Aragon and Marie of Montpellier. As a child, James was made a pawn in the power politics of Provence, where his father was engaged in struggles helping the Cathar heretics of Albi against the Albigensian Crusade led by Simon IV de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who were trying to exterminate them. Peter endeavoured to placate the northern Crusaders by arranging a marriage between his two-year-old son James and Simon&#x27;s daughter, Amicie de Montfort. He entrusted the boy to be educated in Montfort&#x27;s care in 1211, but was soon forced to take up arms against him, dying at the Battle of Muret on 12 September 1213. Montfort would willingly have used James as a means of extending his own power had not the Aragonese appealed to Pope Innocent III, who insisted that Montfort surrender him. James was handed over to the papal legate Peter of Benevento at Carcassonne in May or June 1214.

James was then sent to Monzón, where he was entrusted to the care of Guillem de Montredó, the head of the Knights Templar in Aragon and Provence; the regency meanwhile fell to his great-uncle Sancho, Count of Roussillon, and his son, the king&#x27;s cousin, Nuño. The kingdom was given over to confusion until, in 1217, the Templars and some of the more loyal nobles brought the young king to Zaragoza.

In 1221, he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile. The next six years of his reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcalá of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms.

==Acquisition of Urgell==
In 1228, James faced the sternest opposition yet from a vassal. Guerau IV de Cabrera occupied the County of Urgell in opposition to Aurembiax, the heiress of Ermengol VIII, who had died without sons in 1208. Although Aurembiax&#x27;s mother, Elvira, had made herself a protégée of James&#x27;s father, upon her death in 1220 Guerau occupied the county and displaced Aurembiax, claiming that a woman could not inherit.

James intervened on behalf of Aurembiax, to whom he owed protection. He bought Guerau off and allowed Aurembiax to reclaim her territory, which she did at Lleida, probably also becoming one of James&#x27; earliest mistresses. She surrendered Lleida to James and agreed to hold Urgell in fief for him. On her death in 1231, James exchanged the Balearic Islands for Urgell with her widower, Peter of Portugal.

==Relations with France and Navarre==
From 1230 to 1232, James negotiated with Sancho VII of Navarre, who desired his help against his nephew and closest living male relative, Theobald IV of Champagne. James and Sancho negotiated a treaty whereby James would inherit Navarre on the old Sancho&#x27;s death, but when this occurred in 1234, the Navarrese nobles elevated Theobald to the throne instead, and James disputed it. Pope Gregory IX was required to intervene. In the end, James accepted Theobald&#x27;s succession.

James endeavoured to form a state straddling the Pyrenees in order to counterbalance the power of France north of the river Loire. As with the much earlier Visigothic attempt, this policy was victim to physical, cultural, and political obstacles. As in the case of Navarre, he declined to launch into perilous adventures. By the Treaty of Corbeil, signed in May 1258, he ended his conflict with Louis IX of France, securing the renunciation of any historical French claims to sovereignty over Catalonia, including the County of Barcelona.

==Reconquest==

After his false start at uniting Aragon with the Kingdom of Navarre through a scheme of mutual adoption, James turned to the south and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. On 5 September 1229, the troops from Aragon, consisting of 155 ships, 1,500 horsemen and 15,000 soldiers, set sail from Tarragona, Salou, and Cambrils, in southern Catalonia, to conquer Majorca from Abu Yahya, the semi-independent Almohad governor of the island. Although a group of Aragonese knights took part in the campaign because of their obligations to the king, the conquest of Majorca was mainly a Catalan undertaking, and Catalans would later make up the majority of Majorca&#x27;s settlers. James conquered Majorca on 31 December 1229, and Menorca (1232) and Ibiza (1235) were later acquired during the reconquest.

Valencia capitulated to Aragonese rule on 28 September 1238, following an extensive campaign that included the Siege of Burriana and the decisive Battle of the Puig, where the Aragonese commander, Bernat Guillem I d&#x27;Entença, who was also the king&#x27;s cousin, died from wounds received in action.
Chroniclers say James used gunpowder in the siege of Museros castle.

During his remaining two decades after Corbeil, James warred with the Moors in Murcia, on behalf of his son-in-law Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 March 1244, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Almizra to establish their zones of expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between them. Specifically, it defined the borders of the newly created Kingdom of Valencia. James signed it on that date, but Alfonso did not affirm it until much later. According to the treaty, all lands south of a line from Biar to Villajoyosa through Busot were reserved for Castile.

==Crusade of 1269==

Abaqa, the &quot;Khan of Tartary&quot; (actually the Ilkhan), corresponded with James in early 1267, inviting him to join forces with the Mongols and go on crusade. James sent an ambassador to Abaqa in the person of Jayme Alaric de Perpignan, who returned with a Mongol embassy in 1269. Pope Clement IV tried to dissuade James from crusading, regarding his moral character as sub-par, and Alfonso X did the same. Nonetheless, James, who was then campaigning in Murcia, made peace with Muhammad I, the Sultan of Granada, and set about collecting funds for a crusade. After organising the government for his absence and assembling a fleet at Barcelona in September 1269, he was ready to sail east. The troubadour Olivier lo Templier composed a song praising the voyage and hoping for its success. A storm, however, drove him off course, and he landed at Aigues-Mortes. According to the continuator of William of Tyre, he returned via Montpellier &quot;por l&#x27;amor de sa dame Berenguiere&quot; (&quot;for the love of his lady Berengaria&quot;) and abandoned any further effort at a crusade.

James&#x27;s sons Pedro Fernández and Fernán Sánchez, who had been given command of part of the fleet, did continue on their way to Acre, where they arrived in December. They found that Baibars, the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, had broken his truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was making a demonstration of his military power in front of Acre. During the demonstration, Egyptian troops hidden in the bushes ambushed a returning Frankish force that had been in Galilee. James&#x27;s sons, initially eager for a fight, changed their minds after this spectacle and returned home via Sicily, where Fernán Sánchez was knighted by Charles of Anjou.

==Patronage of art, learning, and literature==

James built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida, which was constructed in a style transitional between Romanesque and Gothic with little influence from Moorish styles.

James was a patron of the University of Montpellier, which owed much of its development to his impetus. He also founded a &quot;studium&quot; at Valencia in 1245 and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV, but it did not develop as splendidly. In 1263, James presided over a debate in Barcelona between the Jewish rabbi Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a prominent &quot;converso&quot;.

James was the first great sponsor and patron of vernacular Catalan literature. Indeed, he may himself be called &quot;the first of the Catalan prose writers.&quot; James wrote or dictated at various stages a chronicle of his own life in Catalan, &quot;Llibre dels fets&quot;, the first autobiography by a Christian king. As well as being a fine example of autobiography, the &quot;Book of Deeds&quot; expresses concepts of the power and purpose of monarchy, examples of loyalty and treachery in the feudal order, and medieval military tactics. More controversially, some historians have looked at these writings as a source of Catalan identity, separate from that of Occitania and Rome.

James also wrote the &quot;Libre de la Saviesa&quot; or &quot;Book of Wisdom.&quot; The book contains proverbs from various authors, reaching from the time of King Solomon to nearly his own time with Albertus Magnus. It even contains maxims from the medieval Arab philosophers and from the &quot;Apophthegmata Philosophorum&quot; of Honein ben Ishak, which was probably translated at Barcelona during his reign. A Hebrew translator by the name of Jehuda was employed at James&#x27;s court during this period.

Though James was himself a prose writer and sponsored mostly prose works, he had an appreciation of verse. In consequence of the Albigensian Crusade, many troubadours were forced to flee southern France and many found refuge in Aragon. Notwithstanding his early patronage of poetry, by the influence of his confessor Ramon de Penyafort, James brought the Inquisition into his realm in 1233 to prevent any vernacular translation of the Bible.

==Succession==

The favour James showed his illegitimate offspring led to protest from the nobles, and to conflicts between his legitimate and illegitimate sons. When one of the latter, Fernán Sánchez, who had behaved with gross ingratitude and treason toward his father, was slain by the legitimate son Peter, the old king recorded his grim satisfaction.

In his will, James divided his states between his sons by Yolanda of Hungary: the aforementioned Peter received the Hispanic possessions on the mainland and James received the Kingdom of Majorca, which included the Balearic Islands, the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya, and the Lordship of Montpellier. The division inevitably produced fratricidal conflicts. In 1276, the king fell very ill at Alzira and resigned his crown, intending to retire to the monastery of Poblet, but he died at Valencia on 27 July.

His mummified body was later exhumed in 1856, when the monastery was under repair. A photograph of the king was taken. The photograph of the head of the mummy clearly shows the wound in the left eyebrow that the king himself explained in a passage from his Llibre dels fets (Book of Deeds):

As I was coming with the men, I happened to turn my head towards the town in order to look at the Saracens, who had come out in great force, when a cross-bowman shot at me, and hit me beside the sun-hood, and the shot struck me on the head, the bolt lighting near the forehead. It was God&#x27;s will it did not pass through the head, but the point of the arrow went half through it. In anger I struck the arrow so with my hand that I broke it: the blood came out down my face; I wiped it off with a mantle of &quot;sendal&quot; I had, and went away laughing, that the army might not take alarm.

==Marriages and children==
James first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. Though he later had the marriage annulled, his one son by her was declared legitimate:
* Alfonso (1229–1260), married Constance of Béarn, Viscountess of Marsan

In 1235, James remarried to Yolanda, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary by his second wife Yolande de Courtenay. They had numerous children:
* Yolanda, also known as Violant, (1236–1301), married Alfonso X of Castile
* Constance (1239–1269), married Manuel of Castile, son of Ferdinand III
* Peter III (1240–1285), successor in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia
* James II (1243–1311), successor in Balearics and Languedoc
* Ferdinand (1245–1250)
* Sancha (1246–before 1275), died in the Holy Land.
* Isabella (1248–1271), married Philip III of France
* Maria (1248–1267), nun
* Sancho (1250–1275), Archbishop of Toledo
* Eleanor (born 1251, died young)

James married thirdly Teresa Gil de Vidaure, but only by a private document, and left her when (as he claimed) she developed leprosy.
* James (–1285), lord of Xèrica
* Peter (1259–1318), lord of Ayerbe

The children in the third marriage were recognised in his last will as being in the line of succession to the throne, should the senior lines fail.

James also had several lovers, both during and after his marriages, and fathered several illegitimate sons.

<text>Ineffability is the quality of something that surpasses the capacity of language to express it, often being in the form of a taboo or incomprehensible term. This property is commonly associated with philosophy, aspects of existence, and similar concepts that are inherently &quot;too great&quot;, complex or abstract to be communicated adequately. Illogical statements, principles, reasons and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with impossibilities, contradictions and paradoxes.

Terminology describing the nature of experience cannot be conveyed properly in dualistic symbolic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates. Profanity and vulgarisms can easily and clearly be stated, but by those who believe they should not be said, they are considered ineffable. Thus, one method of describing something that is ineffable is by using apophasis, i.e. describing what it is &quot;not&quot;, rather than what it &quot;is&quot;. An example is the name of God in Judaism, written as YHWH but substituted with Adonai (&quot;the Lord&quot;) or HaShem (&quot;the name&quot;) when reading.

==In the Roman Catholic Church==
The ineffability about God is affirmed by the First Vatican Council&#x27;s apostolic constitution &quot;Dei Filius&quot;:
God&#x27;s ineffability deals with His being infinite, invisible and incomprehensible.

This dogmatic definition comes from a longtime tradition: Tertullian, Athenagoras of Athens, and Clement of Alexandria believed that ineffability is a property of God.

<text>Childhood&#x27;s End is a 1953 science fiction novel by the British author Arthur C. Clarke. The story follows the peaceful alien invasion of Earth by the mysterious Overlords, whose arrival begins decades of apparent utopia under indirect alien rule, at the cost of human identity and culture.

Clarke&#x27;s idea for the book began with his short story &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; (published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; #8, winter 1950), which he expanded into a novel in 1952, incorporating it as the first part of the book, &quot;Earth and the Overlords&quot;. Completed and published in 1953, &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; sold out its first printing, received good reviews and became Clarke&#x27;s first successful novel. The book is often regarded by both readers and critics as Clarke&#x27;s best novel and is described as &quot;a classic of alien literature&quot;. Along with &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; (1986), Clarke considered &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; to be one of his favourites of his own novels. The novel was nominated for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2004.

Several attempts to adapt the novel into a film or miniseries have been made with varying levels of success. Director Stanley Kubrick expressed interest in the 1960s, but collaborated with Clarke on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) instead. The novel&#x27;s theme of transcendent evolution also appears in Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; series. In 1997, the BBC produced a two-hour radio dramatization of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; that was adapted by Tony Mulholland. The Syfy Channel produced a three-part, four-hour television miniseries of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, which was broadcast on 14–16 December 2015.

==Plot summary==
In the late 20th century, the United States and the Soviet Union are competing to launch the first spacecraft into orbit when alien spaceships suddenly position themselves above Earth&#x27;s principal cities. After one week, the aliens announce they are assuming supervision of international affairs, to prevent humanity&#x27;s extinction. They become known as the Overlords. In general, they let humans go on conducting their affairs in their own way, although some humans are suspicious of the Overlords&#x27; benign intent, as they never allow themselves to be seen.

The Overlord Karellen, the &quot;Supervisor for Earth&quot;, periodically meets with Rikki Stormgren, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Karellen tells Stormgren that the Overlords will reveal themselves in 50 years, when humanity will have become used to their presence. When the Overlords finally reveal their appearance, they resemble the traditional Christian folk images of demons, with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and barbed tails. Humankind enters a golden age of prosperity at the expense of creativity. 

The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak&#x27;s presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert&#x27;s brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords&#x27; home star. The Ouija board reveals a number which Jan recognizes as a star-catalogue number and learns that it is consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. Jan stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light years to their home planet.

Well over a century after the Overlords&#x27; arrival, human children, beginning with the Greggsons&#x27;, begin to display clairvoyance and telekinetic powers. Karellen reveals the Overlords&#x27; purpose: they serve the Overmind, a vast cosmic intelligence, as a kind of &quot;bridge species&quot;, fostering other races&#x27; eventual union with it.

As Rashaverak explains, the time of humanity as a race composed of single individuals with a concrete identity is coming to an end. The children&#x27;s minds reach into each other and merge into a single vast group consciousness. For the transformed children&#x27;s safety, they are segregated on a continent of their own. No more human children are born and many parents die or commit suicide. When Jan Rodricks returns to Earth, he finds an unexpectedly altered planet. Humanity has effectively become extinct and he is now the last man alive.

Some Overlords remain on Earth to study the children from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon&#x27;s rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes too dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth&#x27;s end and transmit a report of what he sees.

==Publication history==

=== Development ===
The novel first took shape in July 1946, when Clarke wrote &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, a short story that would eventually become Part I of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. Clarke&#x27;s portrayal of the Overlords as devils was influenced by John W. Campbell&#x27;s depiction of the devilish Teff-Hellani species in &quot;The Mightiest Machine&quot;, first serialized in &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; in 1934. After finishing &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, Clarke enrolled at King&#x27;s College London and served as the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1953. He earned a first-class degree in mathematics and physics from King&#x27;s in 1948, after which he worked as an assistant editor for &quot;Science Abstracts&quot;. &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; was submitted for publication but was rejected by several editors, including Campbell. At the request of Clarke&#x27;s agent and unbeknown to Clarke, the story was edited by James Blish, who rewrote the ending. Blish&#x27;s version of the story was accepted for publication in April 1950 by &quot;Famous Fantastic Mysteries&quot; magazine. Clarke&#x27;s original version of &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; was later published in the Winter 1950 issue of &quot;New Worlds&quot; magazine.

After Clarke&#x27;s nonfiction science book &quot;The Exploration of Space&quot; (1951) was successfully received, he began to focus on his writing career. In February 1952, Clarke started working on the novelization of &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;; he completed a first draft of the novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; in December, and a final revision in January 1953. Clarke travelled to New York in April 1953 with the novel and several of his other works. Literary agent Bernard Shir-Cliff convinced Ballantine Books to buy everything Clarke had, including &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Encounter in the Dawn&quot; (1953), (which Ballantine retitled &quot;Expedition to Earth&quot;), and &quot;Prelude to Space&quot; (1951). However, Clarke had composed two different endings for the novel, and the last chapter of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; was still not finished. Clarke proceeded to Tampa Bay, Florida, to go scuba diving with George Grisinger, and on his way there visited his friend Frederick C. Durant – President of the International Astronautical Federation from 1953 to 1956 – and his family in the Washington Metropolitan Area, whilst he continued working on the last chapter. He next traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, where he visited Ian Macauley, a friend who was active in the civil rights movement. Clarke finished the final chapter in Atlanta while Clarke and Macauley discussed racial issues; these conversations may have influenced the development of the last chapter, particularly Clarke&#x27;s choice to make the character of Jan Rodricks – the last surviving member of the human species – a black man.

Clarke arrived in Florida at the end of April. The short story, &quot;The Man Who Ploughed the Sea&quot;, included in the &quot;Tales from the White Hart&quot; (1957) collection, was influenced by his time in Florida. While in Key Largo in late May, Clarke met Marilyn Mayfield, and after a romance lasting less than three weeks, they travelled to Manhattan and married at New York City Hall. The couple spent their honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where Clarke proofread &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. In July, Clarke returned to England with Mayfield, but it quickly became clear that the marriage would not last as Clarke spent most of his time reading and writing, and talking about his work. Further, Clarke wanted to be a father, and Marilyn, who had a son from a previous marriage, informed Clarke after their marriage that she could no longer have children. When &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; was published the following month, it appeared with a dedication: &quot;To Marilyn, For letting me read the proofs on our honeymoon.&quot; The couple separated after a few months together, but remained married for the next decade.

===Publication===
Ballantine wanted to publish &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; before &quot;Expedition to Earth&quot; and &quot;Prelude to Space&quot;, but Clarke wanted to wait. He felt that it was a difficult book to release. He had written two different endings for the novel and was unsure of which to use. According to biographer Neil McAleer, Clarke&#x27;s uncertainty may have been because of its thematic focus on the paranormal and transcendence with the alien Overmind. While the theme was used effectively by Clarke in the novel, McAleer wrote that &quot;it was not science fiction based on science, which he came to advocate and represent&quot;. When he wrote &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, Clarke was interested in the paranormal, and did not become a sceptic until much later in his life. Ballantine convinced Clarke to let them publish &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; first, and it was published in August 1953, with a cover designed by American science fiction illustrator Richard M. Powers. &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; first appeared in paperback and hardcover editions, with the paperback as the primary edition, an unusual approach for the 1950s. For the first time in his career, Clarke became known as a novelist.

Decades later, Clarke was preparing a new edition of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; after the story had become dated. The initial chapter of the 1953 novel correctly foresees a race between the US and Soviet Union to first land men on the Moon (and the prominence of German rocket scientists in both space programs), but sets it later than it would actually happen (post-1975; the exact year is not given in the text, but 1945 is said to be more than thirty years ago). After the book was first published, the Apollo missions landed humans on the Moon in 1969, and in 1989 US President George H. W. Bush announced the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI), calling for astronauts to eventually explore Mars. In 1990, Clarke added a new foreword and rewrote the first chapter, placing it in the early 21st century, changing the goal from the Moon to Mars, and implying a joint effort rather than a race. Editions since have appeared with the original opening or have included both versions. &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; has also appeared in two short story collections: &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke&quot; (2001).

On October 28, 2008, Audible released a 7-hour 47 minute unabridged audiobook version of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, narrated by Eric Michael Summerer, under its Audible Frontiers imprint. An &quot;AudioFile&quot; review commended Summerer&#x27;s narration as &quot;smoothly presented and fully credible&quot;. An audio introduction and commentary is provided by Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer.

==Reception==
The novel was well received by most readers and critics. Two months after publication, all 210,000 copies of the first printing had been sold. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published two positive reviews of the book: Basil Davenport compared Clarke to Olaf Stapledon, C. S. Lewis, and H. G. Wells, a &quot;very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas&quot;. William DuBois called the book &quot;a first rate tour de force that is well worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen in this age of anxiety&quot;. Don Guzman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke&#x27;s role as a writer to that of an artist, &quot;a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words&quot;. &quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Groff Conklin called the novel &quot;a formidably impressive job ... a continuous kaleidoscope of the unexpected&quot;.
While acknowledging &quot;inexpressible unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings after reading it&quot;, Japanese author Yukio Mishima declared, &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid to call it a masterpiece.&quot;

Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were more skeptical, and faulted the novel&#x27;s &quot;curious imbalance between its large-scale history and a number of episodic small-scale stories&quot;. While praising Clarke&#x27;s work as &quot;Stapledonian [for] its historic concepts and also for the quality of its prose and thinking&quot;, they concluded that &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; was &quot;an awkward and imperfect book&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller said the novel was &quot;all imagination and poetry&quot;, but concluded it was &quot;not up to some of Clarke&#x27;s other writing&quot; due to weakness in its &quot;episodic structure&quot;.

Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove wrote that &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; rested on &quot;a rather banal philosophical idea&quot;, but that Clarke &quot;expressed [it] in simple but aspiring language that vaguely recalls the Psalms [and] combined [it] with a dramatized sense of loss [for] undeniable effect&quot;.

In 2004 &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; was nominated for a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954. In 2021, the novel was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to feature on a series of UK postage stamps.

==Adaptations==

In the 1960s, director Stanley Kubrick was interested in making a film adaptation of the novel, but blacklisted director Abraham Polonsky had already optioned it. Instead, Kubrick collaborated with Clarke on adapting the short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; into what eventually became &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). Months before his performance at Woodstock in 1969, folk singer and guitarist Richie Havens told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine about his appreciation of Clarke&#x27;s story and expressed his interest in working on a future film adaptation of &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. Screenplays by Polonsky and Howard Koch were never made into films.

David Elgood first proposed a radio adaptation of the novel in 1974, but nothing came of it in that decade.

Philip DeGuere, whose credits include the TV series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, developed a script in the late 1970s for Universal, who planned to film it initially as a six-hour mini-series for CBS Television, and later as a two- or three-hour telemovie for ABC. However, Universal discovered that its contracts with Arthur C. Clarke – some of which dated back to 1957 – were out of date. These contractual difficulties were resolved in 1979 and DeGuere worked with legendary comic book artist Neal Adams on preproduction drawings and other material. The project had Clarke&#x27;s approval. However Universal decided that the budget required would be nearly $40 million and they were only prepared to spend $10 million, so the movie was not made.

Director Brian Lighthill revisited the radio adaptation proposal and obtained the rights in 1995. After Lighthill received a go-ahead from BBC Radio in 1996, he commissioned a script from Tony Mulholland, resulting in a new, two-part adaptation. The BBC produced the two-hour radio dramatization of the novel, and broadcast it on BBC Radio 4 in November 1997. The recording was released on cassette by BBC Audiobooks in 1998 and on CD in 2007.

, film rights to the novel were held by Universal Pictures, with director Kimberly Peirce attached to a project.

On April 10, 2013, the Syfy Channel announced its plans to develop a &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; TV miniseries. The three-episode, four-hour production premiered December 14, 2015. Charles Dance portrays the Supervisor Karellen.

An illustration of an Overlord as depicted by artist Wayne Barlowe was published in &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Guide to Extraterrestrials&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; has inspired the work of many contemporary musicians and artists. These include Pink Floyd (&quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;), Van der Graaf Generator (&quot;Childlike Faith in Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;), David Bowie (&quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;), and Genesis (&quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;).The novel also inspired the Hipgnosis cover art for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;.

The sixth episode of the 2023 Netflix series &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; was titled &quot;Childhood’s end&quot; as an homage to Arthur C. Clarke.

<doc id="63337" wikidata="Q334104" url="?curid=63337" title="Supersaturation">
<text>In physical chemistry, supersaturation occurs with a solution when the concentration of a solute exceeds the concentration specified by the value of solubility at equilibrium. Most commonly the term is applied to a solution of a solid in a liquid, but it can also be applied to liquids and gases dissolved in a liquid. A supersaturated solution is in a metastable state; it may return to equilibrium by separation of the excess of solute from the solution, by dilution of the solution by adding solvent, or by increasing the solubility of the solute in the solvent.

== History ==

Early studies of the phenomenon were conducted with sodium sulfate, also known as Glauber&#x27;s Salt because, unusually, the solubility of this salt in water may decrease with increasing temperature. Early studies have been summarised by Tomlinson. It was shown that the crystallization of a supersaturated solution does not simply come from its agitation, (the previous belief) but from solid matter entering and acting as a &quot;starting&quot; site for crystals to form, now called &quot;seeds&quot;. Expanding upon this, Gay-Lussac brought attention to the kinematics of salt ions and the characteristics of the container having an impact on the supersaturation state. He was also able to expand upon the number of salts with which a supersaturated solution can be obtained. Later Henri Löwel came to the conclusion that both nuclei of the solution and the walls of the container have a catalyzing effect on the solution that cause crystallization. Explaining and providing a model for this phenomenon has been a task taken on by more recent research. Désiré Gernez contributed to this research by discovering that nuclei must be of the same salt that is being crystallized in order to promote crystallization.

== Occurrence and examples ==
=== Solid precipitate, liquid solvent ===
A solution of a chemical compound in a liquid will become supersaturated when the temperature of the saturated solution is changed. In most cases solubility decreases with decreasing temperature; in such cases the excess of solute will rapidly separate from the solution as crystals or an amorphous powder. 
In a few cases the opposite effect occurs. The example of sodium sulfate in water is well-known and this was why it was used in early studies of solubility.

Recrystallization is a process used to purify chemical compounds. A mixture of the impure compound and solvent is heated until the compound has dissolved. If there is some solid impurity remaining it is removed by filtration. When the temperature of the solution is subsequently lowered it briefly becomes supersaturated and then the compound crystallizes out until chemical equilibrium at the lower temperature is achieved. Impurities remain in the supernatant liquid. In some cases crystals do not form quickly and the solution remains supersaturated after cooling. This is because there is a thermodynamic barrier to the formation of a crystal in a liquid medium. Commonly this is overcome by adding a tiny crystal of the solute compound to the supersaturated solution, a process known as &quot;seeding&quot;. Another process in common use is to rub a rod on the side of a glass vessel containing the solution to release microscopic glass particles which can act as nucleation centres. In industry, centrifugation is used to separate the crystals from the supernatant liquid.

Some compounds and mixtures of compounds can form long-living supersaturated solutions. Carbohydrates are a class of such compounds; The thermodynamic barrier to formation of crystals is rather high because of extensive and irregular hydrogen bonding with the solvent, water. For example, although sucrose can be recrystallised easily, its hydrolysis product, known as &quot;invert sugar&quot; or &quot;golden syrup&quot; is a mixture of glucose and fructose that exists as a viscous, supersaturated, liquid. Clear honey contains carbohydrates which may crystallize over a period of weeks.

Supersaturation may be encountered when attempting to crystallize a protein.

=== Gaseous solute, liquid solvent ===
The solubility of a gas in a liquid increases with increasing gas pressure. When the external pressure is reduced, the excess gas comes out of solution.

Fizzy drinks are made by subjecting the liquid to carbon dioxide, under pressure. In champagne the CO2 is produced naturally in the final stage of fermentation. When the bottle or can is opened some gas is released in the form of bubbles.

Release of gas from supersaturated tissues can cause an underwater diver to suffer from decompression sickness (a.k.a. the bends) when returning to the surface. This can be fatal if the released gas obstructs critical blood supplies causing ischaemia in vital tissues.

Dissolved gases can be released during oil exploration when a strike is made. This occurs because the oil in oil-bearing rock is under considerable pressure from the over-lying rock, allowing the oil to be supersaturated with respect to dissolved gases.

=== Liquid formation from a mixture of gases ===
A cloudburst is an extreme form of production of liquid water from a supersaturated mixture of air and water vapour in the atmosphere. Supersaturation in the vapour phase is related to the surface tension of liquids through the Kelvin equation, the Gibbs–Thomson effect and the Poynting effect.

The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) provides a special equation for the Gibbs free energy in the metastable-vapor region of water in its &quot;Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam&quot;. All thermodynamic properties for the metastable-vapor region of water can be derived from this equation by means of the appropriate relations of thermodynamic properties to the Gibbs free energy.

== Measurement ==
When measuring the concentration of a solute in a supersaturated gaseous or liquid mixture it is obvious that the pressure inside the cuvette may be greater than the ambient pressure. When this is so a specialized cuvette must be used. The choice of analytical technique to use will depend on the characteristics of the analyte.

== Applications ==
The characteristics of supersaturation have practical applications in terms of pharmaceuticals. By creating a supersaturated solution of a certain drug, it can be ingested in liquid form. The drug can be made driven into a supersaturated state through any normal mechanism and then prevented from precipitating out by adding precipitation inhibitors. Drugs in this state are referred to as &quot;supersaturating drug delivery services,&quot; or &quot;SDDS.&quot; Oral consumption of a drug in this form is simple and allows for the measurement of very precise dosages. Primarily, it provides a means for drugs with very low solubility to be made into aqueous solutions. In addition, some drugs can undergo supersaturation inside the body despite being ingested in a crystalline form. This phenomenon is known as in vivo supersaturation.

The identification of supersaturated solutions can be used as a tool for marine ecologists to study the activity of organisms and populations. Photosynthetic organisms release O2 gas into the water. Thus, an area of the ocean supersaturated with O2 gas can likely determined to be rich with photosynthetic activity. Though some O2 will naturally be found in the ocean due to simple physical chemical properties, upwards of 70% of all oxygen gas found in supersaturated regions can be attributed to photosynthetic activity.

Supersaturation in vapor phase is usually present in the expansion process through steam nozzles that operate with superheated steam at the inlet, which transitions to saturated state at the outlet. Supersaturation thus becomes an important factor to be taken into account in the design of steam turbines, as this results in an actual mass flow of steam through the nozzle being about 1 to 3% greater than the theoretically calculated value that would be expected if the expanding steam underwent a reversible adiabatic process through equilibrium states. In these cases supersaturation occurs due to the fact that the expansion process develops so rapidly and in such a short time, that the expanding vapor cannot reach its equilibrium state in the process, behaving as if it were superheated. Hence the determination of the expansion ratio, relevant to the calculation of the mass flow through the nozzle, must be done using an adiabatic index of approximately 1.3, like that of the superheated steam, instead of 1.135, which is the value that should have to be used for a quasi-static adiabatic expansion in the saturated region.

The study of supersaturation is also relevant to atmospheric studies. Since the 1940s, the presence of supersaturation in the atmosphere has been known. When water is supersaturated in the troposphere, the formation of ice lattices is frequently observed. In a state of saturation, the water particles will not form ice under tropospheric conditions. It is not enough for molecules of water to form an ice lattice at saturation pressures; they require a surface to condense on to or conglomerations of liquid water molecules of water to freeze. For these reasons, relative humidities over ice in the atmosphere can be found above 100%, meaning supersaturation has occurred. Supersaturation of water is actually very common in the upper troposphere, occurring between 20% and 40% of the time. This can be determined using satellite data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder.

<doc id="63340" wikidata="Q858316" url="?curid=63340" title="Doge of Venice">
<text>The Doge of Venice ( ) was the doge or highest role of authority within the Republic of Venice (697 CE to 1797 CE). The word derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;leader,&quot; and Venetian Italian for “duke”, highest official of the republic of Venice for over 1,000 years. Originally referring to any military leader, becoming in the Late Roman Empire the title for a leader of an expeditionary force formed by detachments () from the frontier army (), separate from, but subject to, the governor of a province, authorized to conduct operations beyond provincial boundaries.

The Doge of Venice acted as both the head of state and head of the Venetian oligarchy. Doges were elected for life through a complex voting process.

==History==
===Byzantine era===
The first Doge of Venice, Paolo Lucio Anafesto, was elected in 698 and served until 717. Anafesto was not a typical Venetian Doge, as he was a subject of Byzantium. While he is considered to be the first Doge of Venice, Venetians were not truly free from the Byzantine Empire until 742.

While it is not known for certain, historians widely accept that Anafesto was born in Oderzo, a city in modern-day Veneto. Historians are unsure of how and where Anafesto died. According to some, he was the victim of a conspiracy hatched by the nobles of Malamocco in 717. Others suggest that he died in the ducal residence of Eraclea. Another theory suggests he died in battle in 728, after being promoted to exarch of Ravenna.

Not much is known about the second Doge of Venice, Marcello Tegalliano, who ruled from 717 to 726. At the time of his appointment, the duchy was in turmoil as a result of growing tensions between pro-Lombard bishop of Aquileia and the pro-Byzantine leaders of Grado. 

In the latter half of the eighth century, Mauritius Galba was elected duke and took the title , &#x27;master of the soldiers, consul and imperial duke of the province of Venice&#x27;. Doge Justinian Partecipacius (d. 829) used the title , &#x27;imperial &quot;hypatos&quot; and humble duke of Venice&#x27;.

These early titles combined Byzantine honorifics and explicit reference to Venice&#x27;s subordinate status. Titles like , , , and were granted by the emperor to the recipient for life but were not inherent in the office (, ), but the title belonged to the office (, ). Thus, into the eleventh century the Venetian doges held titles typical of Byzantine rulers in outlying regions, such as Sardinia. As late as 1202, the Doge Enrico Dandolo was styled , a title granted to him by Alexios III Angelos.

As Byzantine power declined in the region in the late ninth century, reference to Venice as a province disappeared in the titulature of the doges. The simple titles (duke of the Venetians) and (duke of the Venetias) predominate in the tenth century. The plural reflects the doge&#x27;s rule of several federated townships and clans.

===Dukes of Dalmatia and Croatia===
After defeating Croatia and conquering some Dalmatian territory in 1000, Doge Pietro II Orseolo adopted the title , &#x27;Duke of Dalmatia&#x27;, or in its fuller form, , &#x27;Duke of the Venetians and Dalmatians&#x27;.

This title was recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II in 1002. After a Venetian request, it was confirmed by the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1082. In a chrysobull dated that year, Alexios granted the Venetian doge the imperial title of , and recognised him as imperial over the Dalmatian theme.

The expression (&#x27;by the grace of God&#x27;) was adopted consistently by the Venetian chancery only in the course of the eleventh century. An early example, however, can be found in 827–29, during the joint reign of Justinian and his brother John I: , &#x27;by divine grace dukes of the Venetian provinces&#x27;.

Between 1091 and 1102, the King of Hungary acquired the Croatian kingdom in a personal union. In these circumstances, the Venetians appealed to the Byzantine emperor for recognition of their title to Croatia (like Dalmatia, a former Byzantine subject). Perhaps as early as the reign of Vital Falier (d. 1095), and certainly by that of Vital Michiel (d. 1102), the title had been added, giving the full dogal title four parts: , &#x27;Duke of Venice, Dalmatia and Croatia and Imperial &quot;Protosebastos&quot;&#x27;. In the fourteenth century, the doges periodically objected to the use of Dalmatia and Croatia in the Hungarian king&#x27;s titulature, regardless of their own territorial rights or claims. Later medieval chronicles mistakenly attributed the acquisition of the Croatian title to Doge Ordelaf Falier (d. 1117).

According to the &quot;Venetiarum Historia&quot;, written around 1350, Doge Domenico Morosini added (&#x27;and lord of Istria&#x27;) to his title after forcing Pula on Istria to submit in 1150. Only one charter, however, actually uses a title similar to this: (1153).

===Post-1204===
The next major change in the dogal title came with the Fourth Crusade, which conquered the Byzantine Empire (1204). The Byzantine honorific had by this time been dropped and was replaced by a reference to Venice&#x27;s allotment in the partitioning of the Byzantine Empire. The new full title was &#x27;By the grace of God duke of the Venices, Dalmatia and Croatia and lord of a fourth part and a half [three eighths] of the whole Empire of Romania&#x27; ( [or ] [or ] ).

Although traditionally ascribed by later medieval chroniclers to Doge Enrico Dandolo, who led the Venetians during the Fourth Crusade, and hence known as the &quot;arma Dandola&quot;, in reality the title of &#x27;lord of a fourth part and a half of the Empire of Romania&#x27; was first claimed by the ambitious Venetian &quot;podestà&quot; of Constantinople, Marino Zeno, in his capacity as the Doge&#x27;s representative in the &#x27;Empire of Romania&#x27;, and it was only subsequently adopted as part of the dogal title by Doge Pietro Ziani.

The Greek chronicler George Akropolites used the term to translate , &#x27;lord&#x27;, which has led to some confusion with the Byzantine court title of despot. The latter title was never claimed by the doges, but was sometimes used by the Venetian &quot;podestàs&quot; of Constantinople in their capacity as the doge&#x27;s representatives.

The title of &#x27;lord of a fourth part and a half of the whole Empire of Romania&#x27; was used in official titulature thereafter, with the exception, after the re-establishment in 1261 of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty, of Venice&#x27;s relations with the Byzantine emperors, when that part of the dogal titulature was substituted by &#x27;and lord of the lands and islands subject to his dogate&#x27; () or similar formulations.

In a similar manner, the disputes between Venice and Hungary over Dalmatia and Croatia led to the Kings of Hungary addressing the Doges of Venice without that part of their title, while in turn the Venetians tried to force the Hungarian kings to drop any title laying claim to the two provinces.

This dispute ended in the Treaty of Zadar of 1358, where Venice renounced its claims to Dalmatia; a special article in the treaty removed Dalmatia and Croatia from the doge&#x27;s title. The resulting title was , &#x27;Duke of the Venices and the rest&#x27;. Even though Dalmatia would be regained by Venice in the early 15th century, the title was never modified, and remained in use until the end of the Republic. Even when the body of such documents was written in Italian, the title and dating clause were in Latin.

==Selection of the doge==

The doge&#x27;s prerogatives were not defined with precision. While the position was entrusted to members of the inner circle of powerful Venetian families, after several doges had associated a son with themselves in the ducal office, this tendency toward a hereditary monarchy was checked by a law that decreed that no doge had the right to associate any member of his family with himself in his office, nor to name his successor.

After 1172 the election of the doge was entrusted to a committee of forty, who were chosen by four men selected from the Great Council of Venice, which was itself nominated annually by twelve persons. After a deadlocked tie at the election of 1229, the number of electors was increased from forty to forty-one.

New regulations for the elections of the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force until the end of the republic in 1797. Their intention was to minimize the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, chosen by lot, were reduced by lot to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced by lot to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced by lot to nine, and the nine elected forty-five. These forty-five were once more reduced by lot to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who elected the doge.

Election required at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors.

Before taking the oath of investiture, the doge-elect was presented to the concio with the words: &quot;This is your doge, if it please you.&quot; This ceremonial gesture signified the assent of the Venetian people. This practice came to an end with the abolition of the concio in 1423; after the election of Francesco Foscari, he was presented with the unconditional pronouncement – &quot;Your doge&quot;.

==Regulations==

While doges had great temporal power at first, after 1268, the doge was constantly under strict surveillance: he had to wait for other officials to be present before opening dispatches from foreign powers; he was not allowed to possess any property in a foreign land.

The doges normally ruled for life (although a few were forcibly removed from office). After a doge&#x27;s death, a commission of &quot;inquisitori&quot; passed judgment upon his acts, and his estate was liable to be fined for any discovered malfeasance. The official income of the doge was never large, and from early times holders of the office remained engaged in trading ventures. These ventures kept them in touch with the requirements of the &quot;grandi&quot;.

From 7 July 1268, during a vacancy in the office of doge, the state was headed &quot;ex officio&quot;, with the style &quot;vicedoge&quot;, by the senior &quot;consigliere ducale&quot; (ducal counsellor).

==Ritual role==


One of the ceremonial duties of the doge was to celebrate the symbolic marriage of Venice with the sea. This was done by casting a ring from the state barge, the &quot;Bucentaur&quot;, into the Adriatic. In its earlier form this ceremony was instituted to commemorate the conquest of Dalmatia by Doge Pietro II Orseolo in 1000, and was celebrated on Ascension Day. It took its later and more magnificent form after the visit to Venice in 1177 of Pope Alexander III and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. On state occasions the Doge was surrounded by an increasing amount of ceremony, and in international relations he had the status of a sovereign prince.

The doge took part in ducal processions, which started in the Piazza San Marco. The doge would appear in the center of the procession, preceded by civil servants ranked in ascending order of prestige and followed by noble magistrates ranked in descending order of status. Francesco Sansovino described such a procession in minute detail in 1581. His description is confirmed and complemented by Cesare Vecellio&#x27;s 1586 painting of a ducal procession in the Piazza San Marco.

==Regalia==
From the 14th century onward, the ceremonial crown and well-known symbol of the doge of Venice was called &quot;corno ducale&quot;, a unique ducal hat. It was a stiff horn-like bonnet, which was made of gemmed brocade or cloth-of-gold and worn over the camauro. This was a fine linen cap with a structured peak reminiscent of the Phrygian cap, a classical symbol of liberty. This ceremonial cap may have been ultimately based on the white crown of Upper Egypt. Every Easter Monday the doge headed a procession from San Marco to the convent of San Zaccaria, where the abbess presented him a new &quot;camauro&quot; crafted by the nuns.

The Doge&#x27;s official costume also included golden robes, slippers and a sceptre for ceremonial duties.

==Death and burial==

Until the 15th century, the funeral service for a deceased doge would normally be held at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, where some early holders of this office are also buried. After the 15th century, however, the funerals of all later doges were held at the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo. Twenty-five doges are buried there.

==Decline of the office==
As the oligarchical element in the constitution developed, the more important functions of the ducal office were assigned to other officials, or to administrative boards. The doge&#x27;s role became a mostly representative position. The last doge was Ludovico Manin, who abdicated in 1797, when Venice passed under the power of Napoleon&#x27;s France following his conquest of the city.

While Venice would shortly declare itself again as a republic, attempting to resist annexation by Austria, it would never revive the title of doge. It used various titles, including dictator, and collective heads of state to govern the jurisdiction, including a triumvirate.

<doc id="63341" wikidata="Q197581" url="?curid=63341" title="Revolutionary Organization 17 November">
<text>Revolutionary Organization 17 November (, &quot;Epanastatiki Organosi dekaefta Noemvri&quot;), also known as 17N or the 17 November Group, was a Greek Marxist–Leninist urban guerrilla organization. Formed in 1975 and led by Alexandros Giotopoulos, 17N conducted an extensive urban guerrilla campaign of left-wing violence against the Greek state, banks, and businesses. The organization committed 103 known armed robberies, assassinations, and bombing attacks, during which 23 people were killed.

The organization is known for targeting American, British and other foreign diplomats and military personnel, particularly in retribution against the United States for its support of the coup d&#x27;état and the dictatorship known as the Regime of the Colonels. Their demands have included the removal of American military bases in Greece, the removal of Turkish military forces from Northern Cyprus and the withdrawal of Greece from NATO and the European Union. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Terrorism&quot; describes them as &quot;a durable, lethal and successful group&quot; who evaded authorities for over 25 years.

==Attacks==
17N&#x27;s first attack, on 23 December 1975, was against the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s station chief in Athens, Richard Welch. Welch was gunned down outside his residence by three assailants, in front of his wife and driver. 17N&#x27;s repeated claims of responsibility were ignored until 25 December 1976, when it subsequently murdered the former Intelligence Chief of the Greek security police, Evangelos Mallios, convicted of torturing political prisoners during the dictatorship, and left &quot;scattered leaflets&quot; at the scene claiming responsibility for the 1975 Welch murder. 17N used two M1911 pistols in these killings.

After their first attack against the CIA station chief, the group tried to get mainstream newspapers to publish their manifesto. Their first proclamation, claiming the murder of Richard Welch, was first sent to &quot;Libération&quot; in Paris, France. It was given to the publisher of &quot;Libération&quot; via the offices of Jean-Paul Sartre.

One of their demands was the removal of US military bases from Greece. When the Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou renewed the US base agreement, 17N responded to the perceived betrayal by attempting to assassinate US Master Sergeant Robert Judd, firing five rounds at him while his car was stopped in traffic. They issued a communique after the attack: &quot;American Imperialists, The people do not want you! Take your bases and go!&quot;

Police suspected the group of using a stolen anti-armor rocket to attack a downtown branch of the American Citibank in April 1998. The attack caused damage but no injuries, as the warhead did not explode. The rocket was fired by remote control from a private car parked outside the bank on Drossopoulou Street in the downtown district of Kypseli.

A British defence attaché, Brigadier Stephen Saunders, was shot and killed on 8 June 2000 by two men on motorbikes as he drove to work in Kifissia, Athens.

===Victims===
17N&#x27;s known murdered (23) and injured victims include:

==Trial==
The trial of 19 individuals suspected of involvement with 17N commenced in Athens on 3 March 2003, with Christos Lambrou serving as the lead prosecutor for the Greek state. Because of the 20-year statute of limitations, crimes committed before 1984 (such as the killing of the CIA station chief) could not be tried by the court. On 8 December, fifteen of the accused, including Giotopoulos and Koufontinas, were found guilty; another four defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence. The convicted members were sentenced on 17 December 2003. All those convicted defendants appealed. On 3 May 2007, the convictions were upheld.

== Prison ==
In early January 2014, Christodoulos Xyros, one of the imprisoned leaders of the organization, escaped from prison. On 6 January, he failed to report to the police after leaving prison under the condition to report to the police every day, which he did six times in 18 months. He was taken into custody while riding a bicycle in the southern suburb of Anavyssos in early January 2015.

In 2018 the group&#x27;s alleged hitman, Dimitris Koufontinas, was moved from Korydallos Prison to a low security agricultural facility after the prison council approved his parole request, citing exemplary behaviour.

=== 2021 hunger strike ===
On 8 January 2021, at 63 years of age, Koufontinas entered a hunger strike with the demand of transfer to Korydallos Prison after being sent to a high security prison in Domokos. On 22 February whilst in intensive care at Lamia Hospital Koufontinas started to reject water and medical care, forcibly removing a catheter from his arm before the courts issued an order to force feed the prisoner a few days later, a practice condemned by many, including a Greek union of doctors, as torture. It was reported that on 5 March, Koufontinas had to be resuscitated due to kidney failure. Koufontinas ended his hunger strike on 14 March after 65 days, despite his demands not being met.

Street demonstrations were held in multiple cities across Greece as well as attacks against property has been claimed in support of Koufontinas, including a demonstration outside of president Katerina Sakellaropoulou&#x27;s home and vandalism of buildings belonging to Action 24 TV station and the office of Education Minister Niki Kerameus with paint and projectiles by multiple groups of protesters. Other left-wing activists have shown support for Koufontinas, including Miguel Urbán, a co-founder of Podemos, and political filmmaker Costa-Gavras.

==Theories ==
Some Greek officials considered Revolutionary Struggle (EA), the group that fired a Chinese-made RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade at the U.S. Embassy in Athens in January 2007, to be a spin-off of 17N. However, three self-admitted EA members arrested in April 2010 claimed that they were anarchists—a designation 17N rejected in its proclamations. For many years, leading politicians of the right-wing New Democracy party, as well as the conservative press, falsely claimed that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was the mastermind behind 17N. Virginia Tsouderou, who became Deputy Foreign Minister in the Kyriakos Mitsotakis government, and journalist Giorgos Karatzaferis (later the founder and leader of a right-wing party, LAOS) claimed that terrorism in Greece was controlled by Papandreist officers of Hellenic National Intelligence Service (the Greek security and intelligence service), and named Kostas Tsimas (the head of EYP) and Colonel Alexakis as two of the supposed controllers of 17N. However, after 17N members were arrested, the only connection between the terrorist organization and PASOK was the fact that Dimitris Koufontinas was a member of PAMK (&quot;Panellinia Agonistiki Mathitiki Kinisi&quot;, Panhellenic Militant Pupil&#x27;s Movement), the PASOK militant high school students organization, and had been an admirer of Andreas Papandreou in his late teens.

Other writers have also claimed that 17N may have been a tool of foreign secret services. In December 2005, Kleanthis Grivas published an article in &quot;To Proto Thema&quot;, a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused &quot;Sheepskin&quot;, the Greek branch of Gladio, NATO&#x27;s stay-behind paramilitary organization during the Cold War, of the 1975 assassination of Welch as well as of the 2000 assassination of Saunders. This was denied by the US State Department, which responded that &quot;the Greek terrorist organization &#x27;17 November&#x27; was responsible for both assassinations&quot;, and asserted that Grivas&#x27; central piece of evidence had been the &quot;Westmoreland Field Manual&quot;, which the State Department as well as a Congressional inquiry, had dismissed as a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, &quot;Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials&quot; as well as the Greek government&#x27;s statements to the effect that the &quot;stay behind&quot; network had been dismantled in 1988.

<doc id="63342" wikidata="Q207515" url="?curid=63342" title="P. G. Wodehouse">
<text>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, ( ; 15 October 1881 – 14 February 1975) was an English writer and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. His creations include the feather-brained Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr. Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.

Born in Guildford, the third son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction. Most of Wodehouse&#x27;s fiction is set in his native United Kingdom, although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. He wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies during and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, that played an important part in the development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naive revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.

In 1934 Wodehouse moved to France for tax reasons; in 1940 he was taken prisoner at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made five broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death he lived in the US; he took US citizenship in 1955 while retaining his British one. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in Southampton, New York, one month after he was awarded a knighthood of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).

Wodehouse was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He worked extensively on his books, sometimes having two or more in preparation simultaneously. He would take up to two years to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career Wodehouse would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared to comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Wodehouse was born in Guildford, Surrey, the third son of Henry Ernest Wodehouse (1845–1929), a magistrate resident in the British colony of Hong Kong, and his wife, Eleanor (1861–1941), daughter of the Rev John Bathurst Deane. The Wodehouses, who traced their ancestry back to the 13th century, belonged to a cadet branch of the family of the earls of Kimberley. Eleanor Wodehouse was also of ancient aristocratic ancestry. She was visiting her sister in Guildford when Wodehouse was born there prematurely.
The boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and was named after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, &quot;If you ask me to tell you frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess that I do not... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897.&quot; The first name was rapidly elided to &quot;Plum&quot;, the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.

Mother and son sailed for Hong Kong, where for his first two years Wodehouse was raised by a Chinese amah (nurse), alongside his elder brothers Philip Peveril John (1877–1951) and Ernest Armine (1879–1936). When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor&#x27;s father and mother.

The boys&#x27; parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that &quot;it went like a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly&quot;. The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse&#x27;s isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, &quot;Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own.&quot;

In 1886 the brothers were sent to a dame-school in Croydon, where they spent three years. Peveril was then found to have a &quot;weak chest&quot;; sea air was prescribed, and the three boys were moved to Elizabeth College on the island of Guernsey. In 1891 Wodehouse went on to Malvern House Preparatory School in Kent, which concentrated on preparing its pupils for entry to the Royal Navy. His father had planned a naval career for him, but the boy&#x27;s eyesight was found to be too poor for it. He was unimpressed by the school&#x27;s narrow curriculum and zealous discipline; he later parodied it in his novels, with Bertie Wooster recalling his early years as a pupil at a &quot;penitentiary... with the outward guise of a prep school&quot; called Malvern House.

Cheney Court, Ditteridge, a large 17th-century house near Box in Wiltshire, was one of Wodehouse&#x27;s homes while his parents were living in Hong Kong. His grandmother died in 1892, after which he was largely brought up by his aunts, including the writer Mary Bathurst Deane,
the original of Bertie Wooster&#x27;s fictional Aunt Agatha. In 1955 Wodehouse wrote &quot;Aunt Agatha is definitely my Aunt Mary, who was the scourge of my childhood.&quot;

Throughout their school years the brothers were sent to stay during the holidays with various uncles and aunts from both sides of the family. In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Iain Sproat counts twenty aunts and considers that they played an important part not only in Wodehouse&#x27;s early life, but, thinly disguised, in his mature novels, as the formidable aunts who dominate the action in the Wooster, Blandings, and other stories. The boys had fifteen uncles, four of whom were clergymen. Sproat writes that they inspired Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;pious but fallible curates, vicars, and bishops, of which he wrote with friendly irreverence but without mockery&quot;.

At the age of twelve in 1894, to his great joy, Wodehouse was able to follow his brother Armine to Dulwich College. He was entirely at home there; Donaldson comments that Dulwich gave him, for the first time, &quot;some continuity and a stable and ordered life&quot;. He loved the camaraderie, distinguished himself at cricket, rugby and boxing, and was a good, if not consistently diligent, student. The headmaster at the time was A. H. Gilkes, a respected classicist, who was a strong influence on Wodehouse. In a study of Wodehouse&#x27;s works, Richard Usborne argues that &quot;only a writer who was himself a scholar and had had his face ground into Latin and Greek (especially Thucydides) as a boy&quot; could sustain the complex sequences of subordinate clauses sometimes found in Wodehouse&#x27;s comic prose.

Wodehouse&#x27;s six years at Dulwich were among the happiest of his life: &quot;To me the years between 1894 and 1900 were like heaven.&quot; In addition to his sporting achievements he was a good singer and enjoyed taking part in school concerts; his literary leanings found an outlet in editing the school magazine, &quot;The Alleynian&quot;. For the rest of his life he remained devoted to the school. The biographer Barry Phelps writes that Wodehouse &quot;loved the college as much as he loved anything or anybody&quot;.

===Reluctant banker; budding writer: 1900–1908===

Wodehouse expected to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family&#x27;s finances took a turn for the worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, &quot;The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash&quot;. Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for &quot;Public School Magazine&quot;. In November 1900 his first comic piece, &quot;Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings&quot;, was accepted by &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;. A new magazine for boys, &quot;The Captain&quot;, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.
In 1901, with the help of a former Dulwich master, William Beach Thomas, Wodehouse secured an appointment—at first temporary and later permanent—writing for &quot;The Globe&quot;″s popular &quot;By the Way&quot; column. He held the post until 1909. At around the same time his first novel was published – a school story called &quot;The Pothunters&quot;, serialised incomplete in &quot;Public School Magazine&quot; in early 1902, and issued in full in hardback in September. He resigned from the bank that month to devote himself to writing full-time.

Between the publication of &quot;The Pothunters&quot; 1902 and that of &quot;Mike&quot; in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R. D. B. French writes that, of Wodehouse&#x27;s work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: &quot;I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to me that I was able to write at all.&quot;

From his boyhood Wodehouse had been fascinated by America, which he conceived of as &quot;a land of romance&quot;; he &quot;yearned&quot; to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: &quot;In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment.&quot; This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that &quot;in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that &quot;terra incognita&quot;... After that trip to New York I was a man who counted... My income rose like a rocketing pheasant.&quot;

Wodehouse&#x27;s other new venture in 1904 was writing for the stage. Towards the end of the year the librettist Owen Hall invited him to contribute an additional lyric for a musical comedy &quot;Sergeant Brue&quot;. Wodehouse had loved theatre since his first visit, aged thirteen, when Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot; had made him &quot;drunk with ecstasy&quot;. His lyric for Hall, &quot;Put Me in My Little Cell&quot;, was a Gilbertian number for a trio of comic crooks, with music by Frederick Rosse; it was well received and launched Wodehouse on a career as a theatre writer that spanned three decades.

Although it made little impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel &quot;Love Among the Chickens&quot; contained what French calls the author&#x27;s first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Globe&quot; colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, &quot;Brother Alfred&quot;. Wodehouse would return to the character in short stories over the next six decades.

In early 1906 the actor-manager Seymour Hicks invited Wodehouse to become resident lyricist at the Aldwych Theatre, to add topical verses to newly imported or long-running shows. Hicks had already recruited the young Jerome Kern to write the music for such songs. The first Kern-Wodehouse collaboration, a comic number for &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot; titled &quot;Mr Joseph] Chamberlain&quot;, was a show-stopper and was briefly the most popular song in London.

===Psmith, Blandings, Wooster and Jeeves: 1908–1915===

Wodehouse&#x27;s early period as a writer came to an end in 1908 with the serialisation of &quot;The Lost Lambs&quot;, published the following year in book form as the second half of the novel &quot;Mike&quot;. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse&#x27;s development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte—&quot;the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it&quot;. Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter&#x27;s monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: &quot;Psmith in the City&quot; (1910), a burlesque of banking; &quot;Psmith, Journalist&quot; (1915) set in New York; and &quot;Leave It to Psmith&quot; (1923), set at Blandings Castle.

In May 1909 Wodehouse made his second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; for a total of $500, a much higher fee than he had commanded previously. He resigned from &quot;The Globe&quot; and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining &quot;The Globe&quot; and also contributing regularly to &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.

Wodehouse was in New York when the war began. Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, &quot;née&quot; Newton (1885–1984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel&#x27;s personality was in contrast with her husband&#x27;s: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat&#x27;s phrase, she &quot;took charge of Wodehouse&#x27;s life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write&quot;. There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel&#x27;s daughter Leonora (1905–1944) and legally adopted her.
Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; &quot;Psmith, Journalist&quot;, mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; paid $3,500 to serialise &quot;Something New&quot;, the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled &quot;Something Fresh&quot;). It was Wodehouse&#x27;s first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;, the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.

===Broadway: 1915–1919===

A third milestone in Wodehouse&#x27;s life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse&#x27;s closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot;, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was &quot;Miss Springtime&quot; (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including &quot;Leave It to Jane&quot; (1917), &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; (1917–18) and &quot;Oh, Lady! Lady!!&quot; (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse&#x27;s lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.

Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert&#x27;s do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of American Music&quot; Larry Stempel writes, &quot;By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy.&quot; The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse &quot;the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day&quot;. The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, &quot;Before Larry Hart, only P. G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public.&quot;

===1920s===
In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler&#x27;s Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club.
The Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running &quot;Sally&quot; (1920, New York), &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot; (1922, London) and &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; (1926), adapted from Ferenc Molnár, and &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel.

Though never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including A. A. Milne, Ian Hay, Frederick Lonsdale and E. Phillips Oppenheim, and stage performers including George Grossmith Jr., Heather Thatcher and Dorothy Dickson.

===Hollywood: 1929–1931===
There had been films of Wodehouse stories since 1915, when &quot;A Gentleman of Leisure&quot; was based on his 1910 novel of the same name. Further screen adaptations of his books were made between then and 1927, but it was not until 1929 that Wodehouse went to Hollywood where Bolton was working as a highly paid writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Ethel was taken with both the financial and social aspects of Hollywood life, and she negotiated a contract with MGM on her husband&#x27;s behalf under which he would be paid $2,000 a week. This large salary was particularly welcome because the couple had lost considerable sums in the Wall Street crash of 1929.
The contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, &quot;It&#x27;s odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one&#x27;s salary.&quot; Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that &quot;Those Three French Girls&quot; (1930) was &quot;as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced.&quot;

Wodehouse&#x27;s contract ended after a year and was not renewed. At MGM&#x27;s request, he gave an interview to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;. Wodehouse was described by Herbert Warren Wind as &quot;politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly&quot;, and he caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood&#x27;s inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making, and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been &quot;a storm in a teacup&quot;, and Donaldson comments that, in the straitened post-crash era, the reforms would have been inevitable.

Wind&#x27;s view of Wodehouse&#x27;s naïveté is not universally held. Biographers including Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps suggest that his unworldliness was only part of a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse&#x27;s sharpest and most biting satire.

===Best-seller: 1930s===
During the 1930s Wodehouse&#x27;s theatrical work tailed off. He wrote or adapted four plays for the West End; &quot;Leave it to Psmith&quot; (1930), which he adapted in collaboration with Ian Hay, was the only one to have a long run. The reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; praised the play, but commented: &quot;It is Mr Wodehouse&#x27;s own inimitable narrative comments and descriptions in his own person of the antics of his puppets that one misses. They cannot be got into a play and they are at least half the fun of the novels.&quot; In 1934 Wodehouse collaborated with Bolton on the book for Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (Porter wrote his own lyrics), but at the last minute their version was almost entirely rewritten by others at the instigation of the producer, who disliked the original script. Concentrating on writing novels and short stories, Wodehouse reached the peak of his productivity in this decade, averaging two books each year, and grossing an annual £100,000.
His practice of dividing his time between Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. The matter was settled after lengthy negotiations, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt by moving to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in the north.

In 1935 Wodehouse created the last of his regular cast of principal characters, Lord Ickenham, otherwise known as Uncle Fred, who, in Usborne&#x27;s words, &quot;leads the dance in four novels and a short story... a whirring dynamo of misrule&quot;. His other books from the decade include &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, which Donaldson judged his best work, &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot;, which the writer Bernard Levin considered the best, and &quot;Blandings Castle&quot;, which contains &quot;Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend&quot;, which Rudyard Kipling thought &quot;one of the most perfect short stories I have ever read&quot;.

Other leading literary figures who admired Wodehouse were A. E. Housman, Max Beerbohm and Hilaire Belloc; on the radio and in print Belloc called Wodehouse &quot;the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession&quot;. Wodehouse regarded Belloc&#x27;s plaudit as &quot;a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked&quot;. Wodehouse was never sure that his books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.

===Second World War: internment and broadcasts===
At the start of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife remained at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.
The Germans occupied Le Touquet on 22 May 1940 and Wodehouse had to report to the authorities daily. After two months of occupation the Germans interned all male enemy nationals under 60, and Wodehouse was sent to a former prison in Loos, a suburb of Lille, on 21 July; Ethel remained in Le Touquet. The internees were placed four to a cell, each of which had been designed for one man. One bed was available per cell, which was made available to the eldest man—not Wodehouse, who slept on the granite floor. The prisoners were not kept long in Loos before they were transported in cattle trucks to a former barracks in Liège, Belgium, which was run as a prison by the SS. After a week the men were transferred to Huy in Liège Province, where they were incarcerated in the local citadel. They remained there until September 1940, when they were transported to Tost in Upper Silesia (then Germany, now Toszek in Poland).

Wodehouse&#x27;s family and friends had not had any news of his location after the fall of France, but an article from an Associated Press reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator W. Warren Barbour presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to pass the time, he wrote &quot;Money in the Bank&quot;. Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the first indication that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.

On 21 June 1941, while he was in the middle of playing a game of cricket, Wodehouse received a visit from two members of the Gestapo. He was given ten minutes to pack his things before he was taken to the Hotel Adlon, a top luxury hotel in Berlin. He stayed there at his own expense; royalties from the German editions of his books had been put into a special frozen bank account at the outset of the war, and Wodehouse was permitted to draw upon this money he had earned while staying in Berlin. He was thus released from internment a few months before his sixtieth birthday—the age at which civilian internees were released by the Nazis. Shortly afterwards Wodehouse was, in the words of Phelps, &quot;cleverly trapped&quot; into making five broadcasts to the US via German radio, with the Berlin-based correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System. The broadcasts—aired on 28 June, 9, 23 and 30 July and 6 August—were titled &quot;How to be an Internee Without Previous Training&quot;, and comprised humorous anecdotes about Wodehouse&#x27;s experiences as a prisoner, including some gentle mocking of his captors. The German propaganda ministry arranged for the recordings to be broadcast to Britain in August. The day after Wodehouse recorded his final programme, Ethel joined him in Berlin, having sold most of her jewellery to pay for the journey.

===Aftermath: reactions and investigation===
The reaction in Britain to Wodehouse&#x27;s broadcasts was hostile, and he was &quot;reviled ... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward&quot;, although, Phelps observes, many of those who decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front-page article in &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; stated that Wodehouse &quot;lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country&#x27;s heart, ... [he] was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn&#x27;t the guts ... even to stick it out in the internment camp.&quot; In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse&#x27;s actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.
On 15 July the journalist William Connor, under his pen name Cassandra, broadcast a postscript to the news programme railing against Wodehouse. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the broadcast &quot;provoked a storm of complaint ... from listeners all over the country&quot;. Wodehouse&#x27;s biographer, Joseph Connolly, thinks the broadcast &quot;inaccurate, spiteful and slanderous&quot;; Phelps calls it &quot;probably the most vituperative attack on an individual ever heard on British radio&quot;. The broadcast was made at the direct instruction of Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, who overruled strong protests made by the BBC against the decision to air the programme. Numerous letters appeared in the British press, both supporting and criticising Wodehouse. The letters page of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; became a focus for censuring Wodehouse, including one from Wodehouse&#x27;s friend, ; a reply from their fellow author Compton Mackenzie in defence of Wodehouse was not published because the editor claimed a lack of space. Most of those defending Wodehouse against accusations of disloyalty, including Sax Rohmer, Dorothy L. Sayers and Gilbert Frankau, conceded that he had acted stupidly. Some members of the public wrote to the newspapers to say that the full facts were not yet known and a fair judgment could not be made until they were. The management of the BBC, who considered Wodehouse&#x27;s actions no worse than &quot;ill advised&quot;, pointed out to Cooper that there was no evidence at that point whether Wodehouse had acted voluntarily or under compulsion.

When Wodehouse heard of the furore the broadcasts had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In &quot;Performing Flea&quot;, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, &quot;Of course I ought to have had the sense to see that it was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn&#x27;t. I suppose prison life saps the intellect.&quot; The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication &quot;PM&quot; accused Wodehouse of &quot;play[ing] Jeeves to the Nazis&quot;, but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.
The Wodehouses remained in Germany until September 1943, when, because of the Allied bombings, they were allowed to move back to Paris. They were living there when the city was liberated on 25 August 1944; Wodehouse reported to the American authorities the following day, asking them to inform the British of his whereabouts. He was subsequently visited by Malcolm Muggeridge, recently arrived in Paris as an intelligence officer with MI6. The young officer quickly came to like Wodehouse and considered the question of treasonable behaviour as &quot;ludicrous&quot;; he summed up the writer as &quot;ill-fitted to live in an age of ideological conflict&quot;. On 9 September Wodehouse was visited by an MI5 officer and former barrister, Major Edward Cussen, who formally investigated him, a process that stretched over four days. On 28 September Cussen filed his report, which states that in regard to the broadcasts, Wodehouse&#x27;s behaviour &quot;has been unwise&quot;, but advised against further action. On 23 November Theobald Matthew, the Director of Public Prosecutions, decided there was no evidence to justify prosecuting Wodehouse.

In November 1944 Duff Cooper was appointed British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper complained to the French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. The Wodehouses were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, he managed to get Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;.

While still detained by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in questions in the House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the &quot;matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action&quot;. Two months later, Orwell wrote the essay &quot;In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse&quot;, where he stated that &quot;it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity&quot;. Orwell&#x27;s rationale was that Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, and according to the public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins&quot;, which was compounded by his &quot;complete lack—so far as one can judge from his printed works—of political awareness&quot;.

On 15 January 1945 the French authorities released Wodehouse, but they did not inform him, until June 1946, that he would not face any official charges and was free to leave the country.

===American exile: 1946–1975===
Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made preparations to return to New York. They were delayed by Ethel&#x27;s insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse&#x27;s wish to finish writing the novel &quot;The Mating Season&quot; in the peace of the French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, and for the first time in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.

Wodehouse remained unsettled until he and Ethel left New York City for Long Island. Bolton and his wife lived in the prosperous hamlet of Remsenburg, part of the Southampton area of Long Island, east of Manhattan. Wodehouse stayed with them frequently, and in 1952 he and Ethel bought a house nearby. They lived at Remsenburg for the rest of their lives. Between 1952 and 1975 he published more than twenty novels, as well as two collections of short stories, a heavily edited collection of his letters, a volume of memoirs, and a selection of his magazine articles. He continued to hanker after a revival of his theatrical career. A 1959 off-Broadway revival of the 1917 Bolton-Wodehouse-Kern &quot;Leave It to Jane&quot; was a surprise hit, running for 928 performances, but his few post-war stage works, some in collaboration with Bolton, made little impression.

Although Ethel made a return visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America after his arrival in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British government indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse&#x27;s writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind&#x27;s eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades. During their years in Long Island, the couple often took in stray animals and contributed substantial funds to a local animal shelter.

In 1955 Wodehouse became an American citizen, though he remained a British subject, and was therefore still eligible for UK state honours. He was considered for the award of a knighthood three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in the January 1975 New Year Honours list. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Wodehouse&#x27;s honour signalled &quot;official forgiveness for his wartime indiscretion... It is late, but not too late, to take the sting out of that unhappy incident.&quot;

The following month Wodehouse entered Southampton Hospital, Long Island, for treatment of a skin complaint. While there, he suffered a heart attack and died on 14 February 1975 at the age of 93. He was buried at Remsenburg Presbyterian Church four days later. Ethel outlived him by more than nine years; Leonora had predeceased him, dying suddenly in 1944.

==Writing==
===Technique and approach===
Before starting a book Wodehouse would write up to four hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that &quot;It&#x27;s the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes such a long time to work one out.&quot; He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that &quot;For a humorous novel you&#x27;ve got to have a scenario, and you&#x27;ve got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in ... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible.&quot; He preferred working between 4 and 7 pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while &quot;Bachelors Anonymous&quot;, published in 1973, took around six months. Although studies of language production in normal healthy ageing show a marked decline from the mid-70s on, a study of Wodehouse&#x27;s works did not find any evidence of a decline in linguistic ability with age.

Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that &quot;If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It&#x27;s probably because you were born that way.&quot; He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as &quot;making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether&quot;. The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse&#x27;s stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proofreading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.
Most of Wodehouse&#x27;s canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse&#x27;s novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as &quot;a fairyland&quot;. Although some critics thought Wodehouse&#x27;s fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that &quot;it did. It was going strong between the wars&quot;, although he agreed that his version was to some extent &quot;a sort of artificial world of my own creation&quot;. The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely—and mistakenly in McCrum&#x27;s view—did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story &quot;Bingo Bans the Bomb&quot;.

When dealing with the dialogue in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book&#x27;s characters as if they were actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: &quot;If they aren&#x27;t in interesting situations, characters can&#x27;t be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them.&quot; Many of Wodehouse&#x27;s parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that &quot;a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb.&quot; The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore &quot;shares with [Charles] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject&quot;.

Much of Wodehouse&#x27;s use of slang terms reflects the influence of his time at school in Dulwich, and partly reflects Edwardian slang. As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Jerome K. Jerome, and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work. The scholar Clarke Olney lists those quoted, including Milton, Byron, Longfellow, Coleridge, Swinburne, Tennyson, Wordsworth and Shakespeare. Another favoured source was the King James Bible.

===Language===

In 1941 the &quot;Concise Cambridge History of English Literature&quot; opined that Wodehouse had &quot;a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce&quot;, while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine &quot;high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style&quot;, particularly in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;; the novelist Anthony Powell believes Wodehouse to be a &quot;comic poet&quot;. Robert A. Hall Jr., in his study of Wodehouse&#x27;s style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse &quot;one of the finest and purest writers of English prose&quot;. Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character &quot;de-Beaned the cupboard&quot;. Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides &quot;hobnobbing&quot; when he writes: &quot;To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing.&quot;

Richard Voorhees, Wodehouse&#x27;s biographer, believes that the author used clichés in a deliberate and ironic manner. His opinion is shared by the academic Stephen Medcalf, who deems Wodehouse&#x27;s skill is to &quot;bring a cliché just enough to life to kill it&quot;, although Pamela March, writing in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, considers Wodehouse to have &quot;an ability to decliché a cliché&quot;. Medcalf provides an example from &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; in which the teetotal Gussie Fink-Nottle has surreptitiously been given whisky and gin in a punch prior to a prize-giving:

&lt;poem&gt;
 &#x27;It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest.&#x27;
&#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27;
&#x27;What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?&#x27;
&#x27;One finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture, sir.&#x27;
&#x27;You mean imagination boggles?&#x27;
&#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27;
I inspected my imagination. He was right. It boggled.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse&#x27;s work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse&#x27;s ability to accentuate &quot;resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous&quot;. Examples can be seen in &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, Chapter 29: &quot;There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action&quot;, or &quot;Psmith&quot;, Chapter 7: &quot;A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation.&quot; Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on the teaspoon.&quot;
—&quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, Chapter 5

&quot;As I sat in the bath-tub, soaping a meditative foot ...&quot;
—&quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, Chapter 1

&quot;The first thing he did was to prod Jeeves in the lower ribs with an uncouth forefinger.&quot;
—&quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, Chapter 4
&lt;/poem&gt;

Wordplay is a key element in Wodehouse&#x27;s writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells, and says that he has &quot;a pinched look&quot; about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot; when Constable Potter says he has been &quot;assaulted by the duck pond&quot;. In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word &quot;by&quot;, asks: &quot;How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?&quot; Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little&#x27;s infant child who &quot;not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail&quot;, or Wooster&#x27;s complaint that &quot;the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup.&quot; Bertie Wooster&#x27;s half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; Bertie asks Jeeves &quot;Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and ... what&#x27;s the word? Something about cats.&quot; Jeeves replies, &quot;Cataclysms, sir?&quot;

==Reception and reputation==
===Literary reception===
Wodehouse&#x27;s early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy&quot;. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning £40,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity—and the sales figures—slowly recovered over time.
Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A. E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh—the last of whom opines, &quot;One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.&quot; There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that &quot;inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious&quot;, while the literary critic Q. D. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a &quot;stereotyped humour ... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place&quot;. In a 2010 study of Wodehouse&#x27;s few relatively serious novels, such as &quot;The Coming of Bill&quot; (1919), &quot;Jill the Reckless&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Adventures of Sally&quot; (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life—and in his most comic works—the author seemed to lack. &quot;Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It&#x27;s an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it&#x27;s a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.&quot;

The American literary analyst Robert F. Kiernan, defining &quot;camp&quot; as &quot;excessive stylization of whatever kind&quot;, brackets Wodehouse as &quot;a master of the camp novel&quot;, along with Thomas Love Peacock, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Firbank, E. F. Benson and Ivy Compton-Burnett. The literary critic and writer Cyril Connolly calls Wodehouse a &quot;politicians&#x27; author&quot;—one who does &quot;not like art to be exacting and difficult&quot;. Two former British prime ministers, H. H. Asquith and Tony Blair, are on record as Wodehouse aficionados, and the latter became a patron of the Wodehouse Society. Seán O&#x27;Casey, a successful playwright of the 1920s, thought little of Wodehouse; he commented in 1941 that it was damaging to England&#x27;s dignity that the public or &quot;the academic government of Oxford, dead from the chin up&quot; considered Wodehouse an important figure in English literature. His jibe that Wodehouse was &quot;English literature&#x27;s performing flea&quot; provided his target with the title of his collected letters, published in 1953. McCrum, writing in 2004, observes, &quot;Wodehouse is more popular today than on the day he died&quot;, and &quot;his comic vision has an absolutely secure place in the English literary imagination&quot;.

===Honours and influence===

The proposed nominations of Wodehouse for a knighthood in 1967 and 1971 were blocked for fear that such an award would &quot;revive the controversy of his wartime behaviour and give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was doing its best to eradicate&quot;. When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood, only four years later, the journalist Dennis Barker wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the writer was &quot;the solitary surviving English literary comic genius&quot;. After his death six weeks later, the journalist Michael Davie, writing in the same paper, observed that &quot;Many people regarded ... [Wodehouse] as he regarded Beachcomber, as &#x27;one, if not more than one, of England&#x27;s greatest men, while in the view of the obituarist for &quot;The Times&quot; Wodehouse &quot;was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce&quot;. In September 2019 Wodehouse was commemorated with a memorial stone in Westminster Abbey; the dedication was held two days after it was installed.

Since Wodehouse&#x27;s death there have been numerous adaptations and dramatisations of his work on television and film; Wodehouse himself has been portrayed on radio and screen numerous times. There are several literary societies dedicated to Wodehouse. The P. G. Wodehouse Society (UK) was founded in 1997 and has over 1,000 members as at 2015. Alexander Armstrong became president of the society in 2017; past presidents have included Terry Wogan and Richard Briers. There are also groups of Wodehouse fans in Australia, Belgium, France, Finland, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden and the US. As at 2015 the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; contains over 1,750 quotations from Wodehouse, illustrating terms from &quot;crispish&quot; to &quot;zippiness&quot;. Voorhees, while acknowledging that Wodehouse&#x27;s antecedents in literature range from Ben Jonson to Oscar Wilde, writes:

<doc id="63348" wikidata="Q625529" url="?curid=63348" title="Lacrimosa (band)">
<text>Lacrimosa is a Swiss gothic metal band led by German musician Tilo Wolff, who is also the main composer, and Finn Anne Nurmi. They are currently based in Switzerland, but originally from Germany. Originally counted among the bands of the Neue Deutsche Todeskunst genre, Lacrimosa are most commonly associated with the gothic metal genre.

Their musical style mixes gothic rock and heavy metal, along with violin, trumpet, and more classical instruments, although their musical development throughout the years has led to changes in instrumentation. Lacrimosa&#x27;s lyrics are written almost exclusively in German, although since the 1995 album &quot;Inferno,&quot; every album has featured one or two songs in English. These songs are generally written by Anne Nurmi. Finnish has also appeared in the spoken intro to two songs (&quot;Schakal&quot; on &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;The Turning Point&quot; on &quot;Elodia&quot;) and on a bonus track in a limited edition release of &quot;Fassade&quot; called &quot;Vankina&quot;. Their lyrics are mainly about loneliness, sadness, darkness, despair, and love.

The band has sold more than 20,000 copies of each album in Germany, but has also gained a large fanbase in Russia, Mexico and China.

==Brief timeline==

* 1990: Tilo Wolff releases a tape called &quot;Clamor&quot; using the band name of Lacrimosa.
* 1991: Tilo Wolff founds a new record company called Hall of Sermon, as an independent label to publish Lacrimosa&#x27;s records.
* 1993: Anne Nurmi joins the solo project to play keyboard, becoming a permanent member soon after.

==Style and themes==


Lacrimosa&#x27;s first album, &quot;Angst&quot;, is slow and minimal music, dominated by keyboards and voice. This early period explores fear, helplessness, loneliness, non-existence, unattainability, the illusionary nature of love, and death. The same themes can be found on the next three albums, &quot;Einsamkeit&quot;, &quot;Satura&quot;, and &quot;Inferno&quot;. Musically, this period is characterised by the introduction of electric guitars and basses, with more rock elements being added.

&quot;Stille&quot; was the beginning of their metal style. Heavy guitars and bombastic arrangements for classical instruments dominate the music in the style of symphonic metal. Thematically, &quot;Stille&quot; features several uplifting songs. &quot;Stolzes Herz&quot; (&quot;Proud heart&quot;) and &quot;Die Strasse der Zeit&quot; (&quot;The Lane of Time&quot;) praise individual and cultural strength. &quot;Die Strasse der Zeit&quot; describes a journey backwards through a history of war, greed, and stupidity, until the protagonist finds solace in ancient Greek culture.
The next album, &quot;Elodia&quot;, reduced the metal-style guitars and increases the symphonic, classical arrangements, this time recorded in part by the London Symphony Orchestra. Presented as a play in three parts, &quot;Elodia&quot; revolves around the theme of love. The gothic element is still present and the themes of loss and death feature prominently in the latter half, but it ends with an affirmation of hope.

&quot;Fassade&quot; features a variety of musical visions, from the metal sound of &quot;Liebesspiel&quot; (&quot;Love Game&quot;) to flowing keyboards of &quot;Senses&quot;, and the symphonic interplay between guitars and orchestra on &quot;Fassade&quot;. The latter, a piece in three movements arranged on the album as tracks 1, 5, and 8, explores a critique of modern society. It ends with an affirmation of individuality and the protagonist&#x27;s retreat from society.

In &quot;Echos,&quot; guitars and other rock elements appear less often, whereas classical instruments feature more prominently. The orchestral arrangements move away from standard symphonic arrangements often found in contemporary metal music, as in the album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Kyrie - Overture&quot;. &quot;Echos&quot; also shows influence from electronic and industrial music, as in the song &quot;Ein Hauch von Menschlichkeit&quot; (&quot;A Touch of Humanity&quot;). This album is more personal and quieter than those before it. It continues to explore love with gothic twists.

Lacrimosa&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Lichtgestalt&quot;, retains the classical elements, but rock elements begin to resurface. The first track, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, begins as a slow, classical song but halfway moves into a metal section; the pace of the song increases, a heavy guitar backing takes over, and Wolff switches from singing into a high-pitched death grunt for a few minutes. The remaining songs display a similar mix of styles to previous albums, with some upbeat songs, a song written and sung in English mainly by Anne Nurmi, and some slower-paced, sadder pieces.

In 2005, &quot;Lichtgestalten&quot; was released, containing a new electronic version of the song &quot;Lichtgestalt&quot;, produced by Tilo for his solo project, &quot;Snakeskin&quot;.
In 2006, a DVD called &quot;Musikkurzfilme&quot; was released, which contained all the video clips that Lacrimosa shot throughout their career, including the video for &quot;Lichtgestalt&quot;.

&quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was released in 2009. Wolff wanted to create an album that was less conceptual and more spontaneous than the previous releases, so &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; features a variety of musical expressions.

In 2008, Lacrimosa&#x27;s label Hall of Sermon reclaimed the rights to all of the band&#x27;s Nuclear Blast releases. In March 2008, Lacrimosa started working on their next studio album, entitled &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, which was released on 8 May 2009.

Their eleventh studio album was released in September 2012, called &quot;Revolution&quot;. The first song on this release was written in 2009 while they were touring in China.

In 2015, &quot;Hoffnung&quot; was released, followed in 2017 by &quot;Testimonium&quot;, which was meant as a commemorative album for recently deceased musicians like David Bowie and Prince. The band&#x27;s latest album was released on 24 December 2021 with the title &quot;Leidenschaft&quot; (&quot;Passion&quot;).

<text>Frederick Sanger (; 13 August 1918 – 19 November 2013) was a British biochemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice.

He won the 1958 Chemistry Prize for determining the amino acid sequence of insulin and numerous other proteins, demonstrating in the process that each had a unique, definite structure; this was a foundational discovery for the central dogma of molecular biology.

At the newly constructed Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, he developed and subsequently refined the first-ever DNA sequencing technique, which vastly expanded the number of feasible experiments in molecular biology and remains in widespread use today. The breakthrough earned him the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg.

He is one of only three people to have won multiple Nobel Prizes in the same category (the others being John Bardeen in physics and Karl Barry Sharpless in chemistry), and one of five persons with two Nobel Prizes.

==Early life and education==
Frederick Sanger was born on 13 August 1918 in Rendcomb, a small village in Gloucestershire, England, the second son of Frederick Sanger, a general practitioner, and his wife, Cicely Sanger (née Crewdson). He was one of three children. His brother, Theodore, was only a year older, while his sister May (Mary) was five years younger. His father had worked as an Anglican medical missionary in China but returned to England because of ill health. He was 40 in 1916 when he married Cicely, who was four years younger. Sanger&#x27;s father converted to Quakerism soon after his two sons were born and brought up the children as Quakers. Sanger&#x27;s mother was the daughter of an affluent cotton manufacturer and had a Quaker background, but was not a Quaker.

When Sanger was around five years old the family moved to the small village of Tanworth-in-Arden in Warwickshire. The family was reasonably wealthy and employed a governess to teach the children. In 1927, at the age of nine, he was sent to the Downs School, a residential preparatory school run by Quakers near Malvern. His brother Theo was a year ahead of him at the same school. In 1932, at the age of 14, he was sent to the recently established Bryanston School in Dorset. This used the Dalton system and had a more liberal regime which Sanger much preferred. At the school he liked his teachers and particularly enjoyed scientific subjects. Able to complete his School Certificate a year early, for which he was awarded seven credits, Sanger was able to spend most of his last year of school experimenting in the laboratory alongside his chemistry master, Geoffrey Ordish, who had originally studied at Cambridge University and been a researcher in the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with Ordish made a refreshing change from sitting and studying books and awakened Sanger&#x27;s desire to pursue a scientific career. In 1935, prior to heading off to college, Sanger was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany on an exchange program. The school placed a heavy emphasis on athletics, which caused Sanger to be much further ahead in the course material compared to the other students. He was shocked to learn that each day was started with readings from Hitler&#x27;s Mein Kampf, followed by a Sieg Heil salute.

In 1936 Sanger went to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study natural sciences. His father had attended the same college. For Part I of his Tripos he took courses in physics, chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics but struggled with physics and mathematics. Many of the other students had studied more mathematics at school. In his second year he replaced physics with physiology. He took three years to obtain his Part I. For his Part II he studied biochemistry and obtained a 1st Class Honours. Biochemistry was a relatively new department founded by Gowland Hopkins with enthusiastic lecturers who included Malcolm Dixon, Joseph Needham and Ernest Baldwin.

Both his parents died from cancer during his first two years at Cambridge. His father was 60 and his mother was 58. As an undergraduate Sanger&#x27;s beliefs were strongly influenced by his Quaker upbringing. He was a pacifist and a member of the Peace Pledge Union. It was through his involvement with the Cambridge Scientists&#x27; Anti-War Group that he met his future wife, Joan Howe, who was studying economics at Newnham College. They courted while he was studying for his Part II exams and married after he had graduated in December 1940. Sanger, although brought up and influenced by his religious upbringing, later began to lose sight of his Quaker related ways. He began to see the world through a more scientific lens, and with the growth of his research and scientific development he slowly drifted farther from the faith he grew up with. He had nothing but respect for the religious and states he took two things from it, truth and respect for all life. Under the Military Training Act 1939 he was provisionally registered as a conscientious objector, and again under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939, before being granted unconditional exemption from military service by a tribunal. In the meantime he undertook training in social relief work at the Quaker centre, Spicelands, Devon and served briefly as a hospital orderly.

Sanger began studying for a PhD in October 1940 under N.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Pirie. His project was to investigate whether edible protein could be obtained from grass. After little more than a month Pirie left the department and Albert Neuberger became his adviser. Sanger changed his research project to study the metabolism of lysine and a more practical problem concerning the nitrogen of potatoes. His thesis had the title, &quot;The metabolism of the amino acid lysine in the animal body&quot;. He was examined by Charles Harington and Albert Charles Chibnall and awarded his doctorate in 1943.

==Research and career==
===Sequencing insulin===
Neuberger moved to the National Institute for Medical Research in London, but Sanger stayed in Cambridge and in 1943 joined the group of Charles Chibnall, a protein chemist who had recently taken up the chair in the Department of Biochemistry. Chibnall had already done some work on the amino acid composition of bovine insulin and suggested that Sanger look at the amino groups in the protein. Insulin could be purchased from the pharmacy chain Boots and was one of the very few proteins that were available in a pure form. Up to this time Sanger had been funding himself. In Chibnall&#x27;s group he was initially supported by the Medical Research Council and then from 1944 until 1951 by a Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical Research.

Sanger&#x27;s first triumph was to determine the complete amino acid sequence of the two polypeptide chains of bovine insulin, A and B, in 1952 and 1951, respectively. Prior to this it was widely assumed that proteins were somewhat amorphous. In determining these sequences, Sanger proved that proteins have a defined chemical composition.

To get to this point, Sanger refined a partition chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger&#x27;s reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger&#x27;s reagent proved effective at labelling the N-terminal amino group at one end of the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called &quot;fingerprints&quot;. The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.

By repeating this type of procedure Sanger was able to determine the sequences of the many peptides generated using different methods for the initial partial hydrolysis. These could then be assembled into the longer sequences to deduce the complete structure of insulin. Finally, because the A and B chains are physiologically inactive without the three linking disulfide bonds (two interchain, one intrachain on A), Sanger and coworkers determined their assignments in 1955. Sanger&#x27;s principal conclusion was that the two polypeptide chains of the protein insulin had precise amino acid sequences and, by extension, that every protein had a unique sequence. It was this achievement that earned him his first Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1958. This discovery was crucial to the later sequence hypothesis of Francis Crick for developing ideas of how DNA codes for proteins.

===Sequencing RNA===
From 1951 Sanger was a member of the external staff of the Medical Research Council and when they opened the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1962, he moved from his laboratories in the Biochemistry Department of the university to the top floor of the new building. He became head of the Protein Chemistry division.

Prior to his move, Sanger began exploring the possibility of sequencing RNA molecules and began developing methods for separating ribonucleotide fragments generated with specific nucleases. This work he did while trying to refine the sequencing techniques he had developed during his work on insulin.

The key challenge in the work was finding a pure piece of RNA to sequence. In the course of the work he discovered in 1964, with Kjeld Marcker, the formylmethionine tRNA which initiates protein synthesis in bacteria. He was beaten in the race to be the first to sequence a tRNA molecule by a group led by Robert Holley from Cornell University, who published the sequence of the 77 ribonucleotides of alanine tRNA from &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; in 1965. By 1967 Sanger&#x27;s group had determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5S ribosomal RNA from &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a small RNA of 120 nucleotides.

===Sequencing DNA===

Sanger then turned to sequencing DNA, which would require an entirely different approach. He looked at different ways of using DNA polymerase I from &quot;E. coli&quot; to copy single-stranded DNA. In 1975, together with Alan Coulson, he published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the &quot;Plus and Minus&quot; technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3&#x27; termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, his group were able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174. This was the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. To their surprise they discovered that the coding regions of some of the genes overlapped with one another.

In 1977 Sanger and colleagues introduced the &quot;dideoxy&quot; chain-termination method for sequencing DNA molecules, also known as the &quot;Sanger method&quot;. This was a major breakthrough and allowed long stretches of DNA to be rapidly and accurately sequenced. It earned him his second Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1980, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg. The new method was used by Sanger and colleagues to sequence human mitochondrial DNA (16,569 base pairs) and bacteriophage λ (48,502 base pairs). The dideoxy method was eventually used to sequence the entire human genome.

===Postgraduate students===
During the course of his career Sanger supervised more than ten PhD students, two of whom went on to also win Nobel Prizes. His first graduate student was Rodney Porter who joined the research group in 1947. Porter later shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Gerald Edelman for his work on the chemical structure of antibodies. Elizabeth Blackburn studied for a PhD in Sanger&#x27;s laboratory between 1971 and 1974. She shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak for her work on telomeres and the action of telomerase.

===Sanger&#x27;s rule===
This rule should not be confused with Terence Sanger&#x27;s rule, which is related to Oja&#x27;s rule.

===Awards and honours===
, Sanger is one of the only two people to have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice (the other being Karl Barry Sharpless in 2001 and 2022&quot;)&quot;, and one of only five two-time Nobel laureates: The other four were Marie Curie (Physics, 1903 and Chemistry, 1911), Linus Pauling (Chemistry, 1954 and Peace, 1962), John Bardeen (twice Physics, 1956 and 1972), and Karl Barry Sharpless (twice Chemistry, 2001 and 2022).

==Personal life==

===Marriage and family===
Sanger married Margaret Joan Howe (not to be confused with Margaret Sanger, the American pioneer of birth control) in 1940. She died in 2012. They had three children—Robin, born in 1943, Peter born in 1946 and Sally Joan born in 1960. He said that his wife had &quot;contributed more to his work than anyone else by providing a peaceful and happy home.&quot;

===Later life===

Sanger retired in 1983, aged 65, to his home, &quot;Far Leys&quot;, in Swaffham Bulbeck outside Cambridge.

In 1992, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council founded the Sanger Centre (now the Sanger Institute), named after him. The institute is on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus near Hinxton, only a few miles from Sanger&#x27;s home. He agreed to having the Centre named after him when asked by John Sulston, the founding director, but warned, &quot;It had better be good.&quot; It was opened by Sanger in person on 4 October 1993, with a staff of fewer than 50 people, and went on to take a leading role in the sequencing of the human genome. The Institute had about 900 people in 2020 and is one of the world&#x27;s largest genomic research centres.

Sanger said he found no evidence for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the &quot;Times&quot; newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: &quot;My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult. I would need to see proof.&quot;

He declined the offer of a knighthood, as he did not wish to be addressed as &quot;Sir&quot;. He is quoted as saying, &quot;A knighthood makes you different, doesn&#x27;t it, and I don&#x27;t want to be different.&quot; In 1986 he accepted admission to the Order of Merit, which can have only 24 living members.

In 2007 the British Biochemical Society was given a grant by the Wellcome Trust to catalogue and preserve the 35 laboratory notebooks in which Sanger recorded his research from 1944 to 1983. In reporting this matter, &quot;Science&quot; noted that Sanger, &quot;the most self-effacing person you could hope to meet&quot;, was spending his time gardening at his Cambridgeshire home.

Sanger died in his sleep at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge on 19 November 2013. As noted in his obituary, he had described himself as &quot;just a chap who messed about in a lab&quot;, and &quot;academically not brilliant&quot;.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<text>Jacques-Bénigne Lignel Bossuet (; 27 September 1627 – 12 April 1704) was a French bishop and theologian. Renowned for his sermons, addresses and literary works, he is regarded as a brilliant orator and literary stylist of the French language.

A native of Dijon, Bossuet was educated at a Jesuit school before enrolling in the College of Navarre in Paris, where he studied philosophy and theology. In 1652, he was ordained a priest and became a Doctor of Divinity. He spent the next seven years at Metz, where he honed his skills in oratory and politics, before returning to Paris and establishing his reputation as a great preacher. By the early 1660s, Bossuet was preaching regularly before the court of King Louis XIV at Versailles. He was appointed tutor to the Dauphin in 1670 and elected to the Académie Française a year later. In 1681, he was appointed Bishop of Meaux, a position he held until his death. Bossuet was a strong advocate of political absolutism and the divine right of kings. Later in his life, he was also involved in the controversies over Gallicanism and Quietism, and supported the king&#x27;s revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority. Bossuet died in 1704 at the age of 76.

The works of Bossuet best known to English speakers are three great orations delivered at the funerals of Queen Henrietta Maria, widow of Charles I of England (1669), of her daughter Henriette, Duchess of Orléans (1670), and of the outstanding military commander &quot;le Grand Condé&quot; (1687). He published his &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;histoire universelle&quot; &quot;(Discourse on Universal History)&quot; in 1681.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bossuet was born at Dijon. He came from a family of prosperous Burgundian lawyers – on both his paternal and maternal sides, his ancestors had held legal posts for at least a century. He was the fifth son born to Beneigne Bossuet, a judge of the &quot;parlement&quot; (a provincial high court) at Dijon, and Marguerite Mouchet. His parents decided on a career in the Church for their fifth son, so he was tonsured at age eight.

The boy was sent to school at the Collège des Godrans, a classical school run by the Jesuits of Dijon. When his father was appointed to the &quot;parlement&quot; at Metz, Bossuet was left in Dijon under the care of his uncle Claude Bossuet d&#x27;Aiseray, a renowned scholar. At the Collège des Godrans, he gained a reputation for hard work: fellow students nicknamed him &quot;Bos suetus aratro&quot;, an &quot;ox accustomed to the plough&quot;. His father&#x27;s influence at Metz allowed him to obtain for the young Bossuet a canonry in the cathedral of Metz when the boy was just 13 years old.

In 1642, Bossuet enrolled in the Collège de Navarre in Paris to finish his classical studies and to begin the study of philosophy and theology. His mentor there was the college&#x27;s president, Nicolas Cornet, the theologian whose denunciation of Antoine Arnauld at the Sorbonne in 1649 was a major episode in the Jansenist controversy.

For the time being, however, Cornet and Arnaud were still on good terms. In 1643, Arnaud introduced Bossuet to the Hôtel de Rambouillet, a great centre of aristocratic culture and the original home of the &quot;Précieuses&quot;. Bossuet was already showing signs of the oratorical brilliance which served him so well throughout his life. On one celebrated occasion at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, during a dispute about extempore preaching, the 16-year-old Bossuet was called on to deliver an impromptu sermon at 11 pm. Vincent Voiture famously quipped: &quot;I never heard anybody preach so early nor so late&quot;.

===Early clerical career===
Bossuet became a Master of Arts in 1643. He sustained his first thesis (&quot;tentativa&quot;) in theology on 25 January 1648, in the presence of the Prince de Condé. Later in 1648, he was ordained a subdeacon by Sébastien Zamet, Bishop of Langres. His ordination as a deacon came in 1649, after which he began to preach his first sermons.

He sustained his second thesis (&quot;sorbonica&quot;) on 9 November 1650. Then, in preparation for the priesthood, he spent the next two years in retirement under the spiritual direction of Saint Vincent de Paul at Saint Lazare in Paris.

===Priest at Metz===

In January 1652, Bossuet returned to public life, being named Archdeacon of Sarrebourg. He was ordained a priest on 18 March 1652. A few weeks later, he defended his brilliant doctoral work and became a Doctor of Divinity.

He spent the next seven years at Metz, where he now had the office of archdeacon. He was plunged at once into the thick of controversy; nearly half of Metz was Protestant, and Bossuet&#x27;s first appearance in print was a refutation of the Huguenot pastor Paul Ferry (1655). During the rest of his time at Metz he frequently engaged in religious controversies with Protestants (and, less regularly, with Jews). Reconciling the Protestants with the Catholic Church became his dream, and for this purpose, he began to train himself carefully for the pulpit, an all-important centre of influence in a land where political assemblies were unknown and novels and newspapers scarcely born. His youthful imagination was unbridled, and his ideas ran easily into a kind of paradoxical subtlety, redolent of divinity faculties. Nevertheless, his time at Metz was an important time for developing his pulpit oratory and for allowing him to continue his study of Scripture and the Church Fathers. He also gained political experience through his participation in the local Assembly of the Three Orders.

In 1657, in Metz, Bossuet preached before Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV. As a result, he received the honorific title of &quot;Counselor and Preacher to the King&quot;.

===Early career in Paris===

In 1657, St. Vincent de Paul convinced Bossuet to move to Paris and give himself entirely to preaching. (He did not entirely sever his connections with the cathedral of Metz, though: he continued to hold his benefice, and in 1664, when his widowed father was ordained as a priest and became a canon of the Metz cathedral chapter, Bossuet was named chapter&#x27;s dean.)

Bossuet quickly gained a reputation as a great preacher, and by 1660, he was preaching regularly before the court in the Chapel Royal. In 1662, he preached his famous sermon &quot;On the Duties of Kings&quot; to Louis XIV at the Louvre.

In Paris, the congregations had no mercy on purely clerical logic or clerical taste; if a preacher wished to catch their ear, he had to manage to address them in terms they would agree to consider sensible and well-bred. Having very stern ideas of the dignity of a priest, Bossuet refused to descend to the usual devices for arousing popular interest.

The narrative element in Bossuet&#x27;s sermons grew shorter with each year. He never drew satirical pictures like his great rival Louis Bourdaloue. He would not write out his discourses in full, much less learn them off by heart: of the two hundred printed in his works, all but a fraction are rough drafts. Ladies such as Mme de Sévigné forsook him when Bourdaloue dawned on the Paris horizon in 1669, though Fénelon and La Bruyère, two much sounder critics, refused to follow their example.

Bossuet possessed the full equipment of the orator: voice, language, flexibility, and strength. He never needed to strain for effect; his genius struck out at a single blow the thought, the feeling, and the word. What he said of Martin Luther applied peculiarly to himself: he could fling his fury into theses and thus unite the dry light of argument with the fire and heat of passion. These qualities reached their highest point in the &quot;Oraisons funèbres&quot; (&quot;Funeral Orations&quot;).

Bossuet was always best when at work on a large canvas; besides, here no conscientious scruples intervened to prevent him from giving much time and thought to the artistic side of his subject. The &quot;Oraison&quot;, as its name betokened, stood midway between the sermon proper and what would nowadays be called a biographical sketch. At least that was what Bossuet made it; for on this field, he stood not merely first, but alone.

137 of Bossuet&#x27;s sermons preached in the period from 1659 to 1669 are extant, and it is estimated that he preached more than a hundred more that have since been lost. Apart from state occasions, Bossuet seldom appeared in a Paris pulpit after 1669.

===Tutor to the Dauphin, 1670–1681===
A favourite of the court, in 1669 Bossuet was gazetted bishop of Condom in Gascony without being obliged to reside there. He was consecrated bishop on 21 September 1670, but he resigned the see when he was elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot; in 1671.

On 18 September 1670 he was appointed tutor to the nine-year-old Dauphin, eldest child of Louis XIV. The choice was scarcely fortunate. Bossuet unbent as far as he could, but his genius was by no means fitted to enter into the feelings of a child; and the dauphin was a choleric, ungainly, sullen boy. Probably no one was happier than the tutor when his charge turned sixteen and was married off to a Bavarian princess. Still, Bossuet&#x27;s nine years at court were by no means wasted.

Bossuet&#x27;s tutorial functions involved composing all the necessary books of instruction, including not just handwriting samples, but also manuals of philosophy, history, and religion fit for a future King of France. Among the books written by Bossuet during this period are three classics. First came the &quot;Traité de la connaissance de Dieu et de soi-même&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Knowledge of God and of Oneself&quot;) (1677), then the &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;histoire universelle&quot; (&quot;Discourse on Universal History&quot;) (1679, published 1682), and lastly the &quot;Politique tirée de l&#x27;Écriture Sainte&quot; (&quot;Politics Drawn from Holy Scripture&quot;) (1679, published 1709). The three books fit into each other. The &quot;Traité&quot; is a general sketch of the nature of God and the nature of man. The &quot;Discours&quot; is a history of God&#x27;s dealings with humanity in the past. The &quot;Politique&quot; is a code of rights and duties drawn up in the light thrown by those dealings. Bossuet&#x27;s conclusions are only drawn from Holy Scripture because he wished to gain the highest possible sanction for the institutions of his country and to hallow the France of Louis XIV by proving its astonishing likeness to the Israel of Solomon. Then, too, the veil of Holy Scripture enabled him to speak out more boldly than court etiquette would have otherwise allowed, to remind the son of Louis XIV that kings have duties as well as rights.

The Grand Dauphin had often forgotten these duties, but his son, the Petit Dauphin, would bear them in mind. The tutor&#x27;s imagination looked forward to a time when France would blossom into Utopia, with a Christian philosopher on the throne. That is what made him so stalwart a champion of authority in all its forms: &quot;le roi, Jesus-Christ et l&#x27;Eglise, Dieu en ces trois noms&quot; (&quot;the king, Jesus Christ, and the Church, God in His three names&quot;), he says in a characteristic letter. The object of his books was to provide authority with a rational basis. Bossuet&#x27;s worship of authority by no means killed his confidence in reason- what it did was make him doubt the honesty of those who reasoned otherwise than himself.

The whole chain of argument seemed to him so clear and simple. Philosophy proves that God exists and that He shapes and governs the course of human affairs. History shows that this governance is, for the most part, indirect, exercised through certain venerable corporations, as well civil and ecclesiastical, all of which demand implicit obedience as the immediate representatives of God. Thus all revolt, whether civil or religious, is a direct defiance of the Almighty.

Oliver Cromwell becomes a moral monster, and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes was the greatest achievement of the second Constantine. The France of his youth had known the misery of divided counsels and civil war; the France of his adulthood, brought together under an absolute sovereign, had suddenly burgeoned into a splendour comparable only with ancient Rome. Why not, then, strain every nerve to hold innovation at bay and prolong that splendour for all time? Bossuet&#x27;s own &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;histoire universelle&quot; might have furnished an answer, for there the fall of many empires is detailed; but then the &quot;Discours&quot; was composed with a single purpose in mind.

To Bossuet, the establishment of Christianity was the one point of real importance in the whole history of the world. He totally ignores the history of Islam and Asia; on Greece and Rome, he only touched insofar as they formed part of the Praeparatio Evangelica. Yet his &quot;Discours&quot; is far more than a theological pamphlet. While Pascal might refer to the rise and fall of empires to Providence or chance or a little grain of sand in the English lord protectors&#x27; veins, Bossuet held fast to his principle that God works through secondary causes. It is His will that every great change should have its roots in the ages that went before it. Bossuet, accordingly, made a heroic attempt to grapple with origins and causes, and in this way, his book deserves its place as one of the first of philosophic histories.

===Bishop of Meaux, 1681–1704===

With the period of the Dauphin&#x27;s formal education ending in 1681, Bossuet was appointed Bishop of Meaux by the King on 2 May 1681, which was approved by Pope Innocent XI on 17 November. But before he could take possession of his see, he was drawn into a violent quarrel between Louis XIV and Pope Innocent XI. Here he found himself in a quandary: to support the Pope meant supporting the Jesuits, and he hated their supposed casuistry and &quot;dévotion aisée&quot; almost as much as Pascal; to oppose the Pope was to play into the hands of Louis XIV, who was eager to subject the Church to the will of the State. Therefore, Bossuet attempted to steer a middle course. In 1682, before the general Assembly of the French Clergy, he preached a great sermon on the unity of the Church and made it a magnificent plea for compromise. As Louis XIV insisted on his clergy making an anti-papal declaration, Bossuet got leave to draw it up and made it as moderate as he could, and when the Pope declared it null and void, he set to work on a gigantic &quot;Defensio Cleri Gallicani&quot;, only published after his death. Throughout this controversy, unlike the court bishops, Bossuet constantly resided in his diocese and took an active interest in its administration.

====Efforts to combat Protestantism====
The Gallican storm a little abated, he turned back to a project very near his heart. Ever since the early days at Metz, he had been busy with schemes for uniting the Huguenots to the Catholic Church. In 1668, he converted Turenne; in 1670, he published an &quot;Exposition de la foi catholique&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Catholic Faith&quot;), so moderate in tone that adversaries were driven to accuse him of having fraudulently watered down the Catholic dogmas to suit Protestant taste.

Finally, in 1688, his great &quot;Histoire des variations des Églises protestantes&quot; (&quot;History of the Variations of the Protestant Churches&quot;), perhaps the most brilliant of all his works, appeared. Few writers could have made the Justification controversy interesting or even intelligible. His argument is simple enough. Without rules, an organized society cannot hold together, and rules require an authorized interpreter. The Protestant churches had thrown over this interpreter; and Bossuet had small trouble in showing that, the longer they lived, the more they varied on increasingly important points.

The Protestant Minister Pierre Jurieu having responded to the &quot;Histoire des variations&quot;, Bossuet published the &quot;Avertissements aux protestants sur les lettres du ministre Jurieu contre l&#x27;Histoire des variations&quot; (&quot;Warnings to Protestants on the letters of Minister Jurieu against the History of Variations&quot;, 1689–1691). In the fifth of these &quot;Avertissements&quot; (1690), he denied the thesis of the explicit or implicit contract between the prince and his subjects, which Jurieu supported, and formulated the famous sentence: &quot;To condemn this state [= slavery], it would not only be condemn the law of nations, where servitude is admitted, as it appears by all the laws; but that would be to condemn the Holy Spirit, who commands slaves, through the mouth of St. Paul, to remain in their state, and does not oblige their masters to free them. Flaubert, in his &quot;Sottisier&quot;, noted that in the 19th century, Catholic theology had varied to the point of expressing ideas on slavery diametrically opposed to those of Bossuet.

For the moment, the Protestants were pulverized; but before long, they began to ask whether variation was necessarily so great an evil. Between 1691 and 1701, Bossuet corresponded with Leibniz with a view to reunion, but negotiations broke down precisely at this point. Leibniz thought his countrymen might accept individual Roman doctrines, but he flatly refused to guarantee that they would necessarily believe tomorrow what they believe today. We prefer, he said, a church eternally variable and forever moving forwards.

Next, Protestant writers began to accumulate some alleged proofs of Rome&#x27;s own variations; and here, they were backed up by Richard Simon, a priest of the Paris Oratory and the father of biblical criticism in France. He accused St Augustine, Bossuet&#x27;s own special master, of having corrupted the primitive doctrine of grace.

Bossuet set to work on a &quot;Defense de la tradition&quot;, but Simon calmly went on to raise issues graver still. Under a veil of politely ironic circumlocutions, such as did not deceive the Bishop of Meaux, he claimed his right to interpret the Bible like any other book. Bossuet denounced him again and again; Simon told his friends he would wait until the old fellow was no more. Another Oratorian proved more dangerous still. Simon had endangered miracles by applying to them lay rules of evidence, but Malebranche abrogated miracles altogether. It was blasphemous, he argued, to suppose that the Author of nature would violate the law He had Himself established. Bossuet might scribble &quot;nova, mira, falsa&quot; in the margins of his book and urge Fénelon to attack them; Malebranche politely met his threats by saying that to be refuted by such a pen would do him too much honor. These repeated checks soured Bossuet&#x27;s temper.

In his earlier controversies, he had borne himself with great magnanimity, and the Huguenot ministers he refuted had found him a kindly advocate at court. His approval of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes stopped far short of approving dragonnades within his Diocese of Meaux, but now his patience was waning. A dissertation by one Father Caffaro, an obscure Italian monk, became his excuse for writing certain, violent &quot;Maximes sur la comédie&quot; (1694), wherein he made an attack on the memory of Molière, dead more than twenty years.

====Controversy with Fénelon====

Three years later, he was battling with Bishop François Fénelon over the love of God. Fénelon, 24 years his junior, was an old pupil who had suddenly become a rival; like Bossuet, Fénelon was a bishop who served as a royal tutor.

The controversy concerned their different reactions to the opinions of Jeanne Guyon: her ideas were similar to the Quietism of Molinos, which was condemned by Pope Innocent XI in 1687. When Mme de Maintenon began questioning the orthodoxy of Mme Guyon&#x27;s opinions, an ecclesiastical commission of three members, including Bossuet, was appointed to report on the matter. The commission issued 34 articles known as the &quot;Articles d&#x27;Issy&quot;, which condemned Mme Guyon&#x27;s ideas very briefly and provided a short treatise on the orthodox, Catholic conception of prayer. Fénelon, who had been attracted to Mme Guyon&#x27;s ideas, signed off on the Articles, and Mme Guyon submitted to the judgment.

Bossuet now composed &quot;Instructions sur les états d&#x27;oraison&quot;, a work that explained the &quot;Articles d&#x27;Issy&quot; in greater depth. Fénelon refused to endorse this treatise, however, and instead composed his own explanation as to the meaning of the &quot;Articles d&#x27;Issy&quot;, his &quot;Explication des Maximes des Saints&quot;. He explained his view that the goal of human life should be to have love of God as its perfect object, with neither fear of punishment nor desire for the reward of eternal life having anything to do with this pure love of God. King Louis XIV reproached Bossuet for failing to warn him that his grandsons&#x27; tutor had such unorthodox opinions and instructed Bossuet and other bishops to respond to the &quot;Maximes des Saints&quot;.

Bossuet and Fénelon thus spent the years 1697–1699 battling each other in pamphlets and letters until the Inquisition finally condemned the &quot;Maximes des Saints&quot; on 12 March 1699. Pope Innocent XII selected 23 specific passages for condemnation. Bossuet triumphed in the controversy and Fénelon submitted to Rome&#x27;s determination of the matter.

====Death====

Until he was over 70 years, Bossuet enjoyed good health, but in 1702 he developed chronic kidney stones. Two years later he was a hopeless invalid, and on 12 April 1704 he died quietly. His funeral oration was given by Charles de la Rue, SJ. He was buried at Meaux Cathedral.

==Preaching==

Bossuet is widely considered to be one of the most influential homilists of all time. He is one of the preachers, along with John Tillotson and Louis Bourdaloue, who began the transition from Baroque to Neoclassical preaching. He preached with a simple eloquence that eschewed the grandiose extravagances of earlier preaching. He focused on ethical rather than doctrinal messages, often drawing from the lives of saints or saintly contemporaries as examples. He preached, for example, on St. Francis de Sales as well as funeral orations on Queen Henrietta Maria of France and Henrietta Anne of England. Bossuet&#x27;s funeral orations in particular had lasting importance and were translated early into many languages, including English. Such was their power that even Voltaire, normally so antagonistic toward clergy, praised his oratorical excellence.

==Works==
An edition of Bossuet&#x27;s sermons was edited by Abbé Lebarq in 6 vols. (Paris, 1890, 1896), as the &quot;Œuvres oratoires de Bossuet&quot;. His complete works were edited by Lachat in 31 vols. (Paris, 1862–1864).

===&quot;Politics Drawn from the Very Words of Holy Scripture&quot;===
When Bossuet was chosen to be the tutor of the Dauphin, oldest child of Louis XIV, he wrote several works for the edification of his pupil, one of which was &quot;Politics Derived from the Words of Holy Scripture&quot;, a discourse on the principles of royal absolutism. The work was published posthumously in 1709.

The work consists of several books which are divided into articles and propositions which lay out the nature, characteristics, duties, and resources of royalty. To justify his propositions, Bossuet quotes liberally from the Bible and various psalms.

Throughout his essay, Bossuet emphasizes the fact that royal authority comes directly from God and that the person of the king is sacred. In the third book, Bossuet asserts that &quot;God establishes kings as his ministers, and reigns through them over the people.&quot; He also states that &quot;the prince must be obeyed on principle, as a matter of religion and of conscience.&quot; While he declares the absolute authority of rulers, he emphasizes the fact that kings must use their power only for the public good and that the king is not above the law &quot;for if he sins, he destroys the laws by his example.&quot;

In books six and seven, Bossuet describes the duties of the subjects to the prince and the special duties of royalty. For Bossuet, the prince was synonymous with the state, which is why, according to him, the subjects of the prince owe the prince the same duties that they owe their country. He also states that &quot;only public enemies make a separation between the interest of the prince and the interest of the state.&quot; As far as the duties of royalty, the primary goal is the preservation of the state. Bossuet describes three ways that this can be achieved: by maintaining a good constitution, making good use of the state&#x27;s resources, and protecting the state from the dangers and difficulties that threaten it.

In books nine and ten, Bossuet outlines the various resources of royalty (arms, wealth, and counsel) and how they should be used. In regards to arms, Bossuet explains that there are just and unjust grounds for war. Unjust causes include ambitious conquest, pillage, and jealousy. As far as wealth is concerned, he then lays out the types of expenditures that a king has and the various sources of wealth for the kingdom. He emphasizes that the true wealth of a kingdom is its men and says that it is important to improve the people&#x27;s lot and that there would be no more poor.

==Trivia==
&quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1913) calls Bossuet the greatest pulpit orator of all time, ranking him even ahead of Augustine and Chrysostom.

The exterior of Harvard&#x27;s Sanders Theater includes busts of the eight greatest orators of all time – they include a bust of Bossuet alongside such giants of oratory as Demosthenes, Cicero, and Chrysostom.

A character in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, being from Meaux and an orator, is nicknamed Bossuet by his friends.

Bossuet was one of several co-editors on the &quot;Ad usum Delphini&quot; book series (commonly known as the Delphin Classics) of the Latin classics.

Bossuet was the uncle of Louis Bossuet.

Bossuet was quoted and mentioned in the song &#x27;Un poison violent, c&#x27;est ça l&#x27;amour&#x27; by Serge Gainsbourg in Anna (1967 film)

Bossuet has a school named after him.

<doc id="63355" wikidata="Q10856" url="?curid=63355" title="Columbidae">
<text>Columbidae is a bird family consisting of doves and pigeons. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with small heads, relatively short necks and slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They feed largely on plant matter, feeding on seeds (granivory), fruit (frugivory), and foliage (folivory). 

In colloquial English, the smaller species tend to be called &quot;doves&quot;, and the larger ones &quot;pigeons&quot;, although the distinction is not consistent, and there is no scientific separation between them. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation. The bird most commonly referred to as &quot;pigeon&quot; is the domestic pigeon, descendant of the wild rock dove, which is a common inhabitant of cities as the feral pigeon.

Columbidae contains 51 genera divided into 353 species. The family occurs worldwide, often in close proximity to humans, but the greatest diversity is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. 118 species (34%) are at risk, and 13 are extinct, with the most famous examples being the dodo, a large, flightless, island bird, and the passenger pigeon, that once flocked in the billions.

==Etymology==
 is a French word that derives from the Latin , for a chick, while &quot;dove&quot; is an ultimately Germanic word, possibly referring to the bird&#x27;s diving flight. The English dialectal word appears to derive from Latin . A group of doves has sometimes been called a &quot;dule&quot;, taken from the French word ().

==Origin and evolution==
Columbiformes is one of the most diverse non-passerine clades of neoavians, and its origins are in the Cretaceous and the result of a rapid diversification at the end of the K-Pg boundary. Whole genome analyses have found Columbiformes is the sister clade to the clade Pteroclimesites a clade consisting the orders Pterocliformes (sandgrouses) and Mesitornithiformes (mesites). The columbiform-pteroclimesitean clade, or Columbimorphae, monophyly has been supported from several studies.

===Taxonomy and systematics===
The name &#x27;Columbidae&#x27; for the family was first used by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819. However, Illiger in 1811 established an older name for the family group (&quot;Columbini&quot;) and would actually be the proper authority for Columbidae.

The interrelationships of columbids (between subfamilies) and the ergotaxonomy of them has been debated, with many different interpretations of how they should be classified. As many as five to six families, along with many subfamilies and tribes, have been used in the past including the family Raphidae for the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire. A 2024 paper on the systematics and nomenclature of the dodo and the solitaire from Young and colleagues also provided an overview of columbid family-group nomina. They recommended recognizing three subfamilies: Columbinae (New World doves and quail-doves, and columbin doves), Claravinae (American ground-doves), and Raphinae (Old World doves and pigeons including the dodo and solitaire). A 2025 paper on the molecular phylogenetic placement of the Cuban endemic blue-headed quail-dove from Oswald and colleagues found the species to be a sister group to Columbinae, as opposed to being a true columbine or a raphine as previous authors have suggested in the past. These authors recommended that the blue-headed quail-dove should be placed in fourth monotypic subfamily, Starnoenadinae.

These taxonomic issues are exacerbated by columbids not being well represented in the fossil record, with no truly primitive forms having been found to date. The genus &quot;Gerandia&quot; has been described from Early Miocene deposits in France, but while it was long believed to be a pigeon, it is now considered a sandgrouse. Fragmentary remains of a probably &quot;ptilinopine&quot; Early Miocene pigeon were found in the Bannockburn Formation of New Zealand and described as &quot;Rupephaps&quot;; &quot;&quot;Columbina&quot; prattae&quot; from roughly contemporary deposits of Florida is nowadays tentatively separated in &quot;Arenicolumba&quot;, but its distinction from &quot;Columbina/Scardafella&quot; and related genera needs to be more firmly established (e.g. by cladistic analysis). Apart from that, all other fossils belong to extant genera.

== Description ==

=== Anatomy and physiology ===

Overall, the anatomy of Columbidae is characterized by short legs, short bills with a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. Like some other birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders. Some medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile (gall), which in the medieval theory of the four humours explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves. In fact, however, they do have bile (as Aristotle had earlier realized), which is secreted directly into the gut.

The wings of most species are large, and have eleven primary feathers; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds.

In a series of experiments in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant.

===Feathers===

Columbidae have unique body feathers, with the shaft being generally broad, strong, and flattened, tapering to a fine point, abruptly. In general, the aftershaft is absent; however, small ones on some tail and wing feathers may be present. Body feathers have very dense, fluffy bases, are attached loosely into the skin, and drop out easily. Possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism, large numbers of feathers fall out in the attacker&#x27;s mouth if the bird is snatched, facilitating the bird&#x27;s escape. The plumage of the family is variable.

Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly coloured plumage. The genera &quot;Chalcophaps&quot;, &quot;Ptilinopus&quot; and &quot;Alectroenas&quot; include some of the most brightly coloured pigeons. Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, some pigeon species may have crests or other ornamentation.

=== Flight ===
Many Columbidae are excellent fliers due to the lift provided by their large wings, which results in low wing loading; They are highly maneuverable in flight and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their wings, allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators, but at a high energy cost. A few species are long-distance migrants, with some populations of the European turtle dove migrating in excess of 5,000 km between northern Europe in summer and tropical Africa in winter, and the Oriental turtle dove nearly as far in eastern Asia between eastern Siberia and southern China.

=== Size ===
Pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size, ranging in length from , and in weight from to above . The largest extant species are the crowned pigeons of New Guinea, which are nearly turkey-sized, with lengths of and weights ranging . One of the largest arboreal species, the Marquesan imperial pigeon with a length of , currently battles extinction. The extinct, flightless dodo is the largest columbid to have ever existed, with a height of about , and a range of suggested weights from , although the higher estimates are thought to be based on overweight birds.

The least massive columbids belong to species in the genus &quot;Columbina&quot;; the common ground dove (&quot;Columbina passerina&quot;) and the plain-breasted ground dove (&quot;Columbina minuta&quot;) which are about the same size as a house sparrow, weighing a little above . The dwarf fruit dove, which may measure as little as long, has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth, having adapted to most terrestrial habitats available on the planet, except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world&#x27;s oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.

Columbid species may be arboreal, terrestrial, or semi-terrestrial. They inhabit savanna, grassland, shrubland, desert, temperate woodland and forest, tropical rainforests, mangrove forest, and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls.

Some species have large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the entirety of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.

When including human-mediated introductions, the largest range of any species is that of the rock dove, also known as the common pigeon. This species had a large natural distribution from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The common pigeon is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. A 2020 study found that the east coast of the United States includes two pigeon genetic megacities, in New York and Boston, and observes that the birds do not mix together.

As well as the rock dove, several other species of pigeon have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.

Other species of Columbidae have tiny, restricted distributions, usually seen on small islands, such as the whistling dove, which is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove, restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove, which is only found on the island of Grenada in the Caribbean.

Some continental species also have tiny distributions, such as the black-banded fruit dove, which is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon, found only in a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno&#x27;s ground dove, endemic to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===

Seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves, and the family can be loosely divided between seed-eating (granivorous) species, and fruit-and-mast-eating (frugivorous) species, though many species consume both.

The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species are more arboreal, tending to feed in trees. The morphological adaptations used to distinguish between the two groups include granivores tending to having thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi, with the frugivores evolved with thin walls, and the fruit-eating species have short intestines, as opposed to the seed eaters having longer intestines. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.

In addition to fruit and seeds, a number of other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves. Flowers are also taken by some species.

Urban feral pigeons, descendants of domestic rock doves (&quot;Columbia livia&quot;), reside in urban environments, disturbing their natural feeding habits. They depend on human activities and interactions to obtain food, causing them to forage for spilled food or food provided by humans.

===Reproduction===
Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks, other vegetable matter, and other debris, which may be placed on trees, on rocky ledges, or on the ground, depending on species. The female may either build the nest, with material gathered by the male, or the male builds the nest by himself. A few species nest colonially, others nest in aggregation.

Most lay a clutch of one or (usually) two white eggs at a time which take 11-30 days to hatch (larger species have longer incubation times). Both parents care for the young; unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and pigeons produce &quot;crop milk&quot; to feed their young. This fluid is secreted by a sloughing of epithelial cells from the lining of the crop. 

Unfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by five weeks old. These fledglings, with their immature squeaking voices, are called squeakers once they are weaned, and leave the nest after 25–32 days.

== Status and conservation ==
While many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) are two of the most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.

The passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United States throughout the 19thcentury.

The dodo, and its extinction, was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in general. Like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators, it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and many other island species that have become extinct.

118 columbid species are at risk (34% of the total), with 48 species NT, 40 VU, 18 EN, 11 CR, and 1 EW. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, or a combination of these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown (DD); the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and may or may not be extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.

Various conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (&quot;ex situ&quot; conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.

==Domestication==

The domestic pigeon (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;) is a descendant of the rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) that underwent domestication, with studies suggesting domestication as early as 10 thousand years ago. Domestic pigeons have long been a part of human culture; doves were important symbols of the goddesses Innana, Asherah, and Aphrodite, and revered by the early Christian, Islamic and Jewish religions. Domestication of pigeons led to significant use of homing pigeons for communication, including war pigeons, such as the 32 pigeons who were awarded the Dickin Medal for &quot;brave service&quot; to their country, in World War II.

The ringneck dove is a smaller species of domestic columbid that was kept as a source of food. As a result of selection for tame individuals who would not escape their cages, they lack a survival instinct and cannot survive release.

<text>Mikhail Alekseyevich Lavrentyev (or Lavrentiev, ; November 19, 1900 – October 15, 1980) was a Soviet mathematician and hydrodynamicist.

==Early years==
Lavrentyev was born in Kazan, where his father was an instructor at a college (he later became a professor at Kazan University, then Moscow University).

He entered Kazan University, and, when his family moved to Moscow in 1921, he transferred to the Department of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow University. He graduated in 1922. He continued his studies in the university in 1923-26 as a graduate student of Nikolai Luzin.

Although Luzin was alleged to plagiarize in science and indulge in anti-Sovietism by some of his students in 1936, Lavrentyev did not participate in the notorious political persecution of his teacher which is known as the Luzin case or Luzin affair. In fact Luzin was a friend of his father.

==Mid career==
In 1927, Lavrentyev spent half a year in France, collaborating with French mathematicians, and upon returned took up a position with Moscow University. Later he became a member of the staff of the Steklov Institute. His main contributions relate to conformal mappings and partial differential equations. Mstislav Keldysh was one of his students.

In 1939, Oleksandr Bogomolets, the president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, asked Lavrentyev to become director of the Institute of Mathematics at Kyiv.

One of Lavrentyev&#x27;s scientific interests was the physics of explosive processes, in which he had become involved when doing defense work during World War II. A better understanding of the physics of explosions made it possible to use controlled explosions in construction, the best-known example being the construction of the Medeu Mudflow Control Dam outside of Almaty in Kazakhstan.

==In Siberia==
Mikhail Lavrentyev was one of the main organizers and the first Chairman of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in his time the Academy of Sciences of the USSR) from its founding in 1957 to 1975. The foundation of the Siberia&#x27;s &quot;Academic Town&quot; Akademgorodok (now a district of Novosibirsk) remains his most widely known achievement.

Six months after the decision to found the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences Novosibirsk State University was established. The Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR was signed January 9, 1958. From 1959 to 1966 he was a professor at Novosibirsk State University.

Lavrentyev was also a founder of the Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences which since 1980 has been named after Lavrentyev.

Lavrentyev was awarded the honorary title of Hero of Socialist Labour, a Lenin and 2 Stalin Prizes, and a Lomonosov Gold Medal. He was elected a member of several world-renowned academies, and an honorable citizen of Novosibirsk.

Mikhail A. Lavrentyev&#x27;s son, also named Mikhail (Mikhail M. Lavrentyev, 1930-2010), also became a mathematician and was a member of the leadership of Akademgorodok.

<text>Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov (; , ; – ) was a Russian polymath, scientist and writer, who made important contributions to literature, education, and science. Among his discoveries were the atmosphere of Venus and the law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions. His spheres of science were natural science, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, history, art, philology, optical devices and others. The founder of modern geology, Lomonosov was also a poet and influenced the formation of the modern Russian literary language.

==Early life and family==
Lomonosov was born in the village of Mishaninskaya, later renamed Lomonosovo in his honor, in Archangelgorod Governorate, on an island not far from Kholmogory, in the far north of Russia. His father, Vasily Dorofeyevich Lomonosov, was a prosperous peasant fisherman turned ship owner, who amassed a small fortune transporting goods from Arkhangelsk to Pustozyorsk, Solovki, Kola, and Lapland. Lomonosov&#x27;s mother was Vasily&#x27;s first wife, a deacon&#x27;s daughter, Elena Ivanovna Sivkova.

He remained at Denisovka until he was ten, when his father decided that he was old enough to participate in his business ventures, and Lomonosov began accompanying Vasily on trading missions.

Learning was young Lomonosov&#x27;s passion, not business. The boy&#x27;s thirst for knowledge was insatiable. Lomonosov had been taught to read as a boy by his neighbor Ivan Shubny, and he spent every spare moment with his books. He continued his studies with the village deacon, S.N. Sabelnikov, but for many years the only books he had access to were religious texts. When he was fourteen, Lomonosov was given copies of Meletius Smotrytsky&#x27;s &quot;Modern Church Slavonic&quot; (a grammar book) and Leonty Magnitsky&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetic&quot;. Lomonosov was a Russian Orthodox Christian all his life, but had close encounters with Old Believers schism in early youth and later in life he became a deist.

In 1724, his father married for the third and final time. Lomonosov and his stepmother Irina had an acrimonious relationship. Unhappy at home and intent on obtaining a higher education, which Lomonosov could not receive in Mishaninskaya, he was determined to leave the village.

==Education==

In 1730, determined to &quot;study sciences,&quot; the 19-year-old Lomonosov walked all the way to Moscow. Shortly after arrival, he was admitted into the Slavic Greek Latin Academy by falsely claiming to be a son of a Kholmogory nobleman. In 1734 that initial falsehood, as well as another lie that he was the son of a priest, nearly got him expelled from the academy, but the investigation ended without severe consequences.

Lomonosov lived on three kopecks a day, eating only black bread and kvass, but he made rapid progress scholastically. It is believed that in 1735, after three years in Moscow he was sent to Kiev to study for short period at the Kiev Academy. He quickly became dissatisfied with the education he was receiving there, and returned to Moscow. In five years Lomonosov completed a twelve-year study course and in 1736, among 12 best graduates, was awarded a scholarship at the St. Petersburg Academy. He plunged into his studies and was rewarded with a four-year grant to study abroad, in Germany, first at the University of Marburg and then in Freiberg.

=== Education abroad ===
The University of Marburg was among Europe&#x27;s most important universities in the mid-18th century due to the presence of the philosopher Christian Wolff, a prominent figure of the German Enlightenment. Lomonosov became one of Wolff&#x27;s students while at Marburg from November 1736 to July 1739. Both philosophically and as a science administrator, this connection would be the most influential of Lomonosov&#x27;s life. In 1739–1740 he studied mineralogy and philosophy at the University of Göttingen; there he intensified his studies of German literature.
Lomonosov quickly mastered the German language, and in addition to philosophy, seriously studied chemistry, discovered the works of 17th century Irish theologian and natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and even began writing poetry. He also developed an interest in German literature. He is said to have especially admired Günther. His &quot;Ode on the Taking of Khotin from the Turks,&quot; composed in 1739, attracted a great deal of attention in Saint Petersburg. 

Contrary to his adoration for Wolff, Lomonosov had fierce disputes with Henckel over the training and education courses he and his two compatriot students were getting in Freiberg, as well as over very limited financial support which Henckel was instructed to provide to the Russians after numerous debts they had accumulated in Marburg. As the result, Lomonosov left Freiberg without permission and wandered for quite a while over Germany and Holland, unsuccessfully trying to obtain permission from Russian envoys to return to the St. Petersburg Academy.

During his residence in Marburg, Lomonosov boarded with Catharina Zilch, a brewer&#x27;s widow. He fell in love with Catharina&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Christine Zilch. They were married in June 1740. Lomonosov found it extremely difficult to maintain his growing family on the scanty and irregular allowance granted him by the Russian Academy of Sciences. As his circumstances became desperate, he got permission to return to Saint Petersburg.

=== Return to Russia ===
Lomonosov returned to Russia in June 1741, after being abroad 4 years and 8 months. A year later he was named an Adjunct of the Russian Academy of Science in the physics department. In May 1743, Lomonosov was accused, arrested, and held under house arrest for eight months, after he supposedly insulted various people associated with the academy. He was released and pardoned in January 1744 after apologising to all involved.

Lomonosov was made a full member of the academy and named professor of chemistry in 1745. He established the academy&#x27;s first chemistry laboratory. Eager to improve Russia&#x27;s educational system, in 1755, Lomonosov joined his patron Count Ivan Shuvalov in founding Moscow University.

In 1760, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1764, he was elected Foreign Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna. In 1764, Lomonosov was appointed to the position of the State Councillor which was of Rank V in the Russian Empire&#x27;s Table of Ranks. He died on 4 April (o.s.), 1765 in Saint Petersburg. He is widely and deservingly regarded as the &quot;Father of Russian Science,&quot; though many of his scientific accomplishments were relatively unknown outside Russia until long after his death and gained proper appreciation only in late 19th and, especially, 20th centuries.

== Science and inventions ==

===Physics===

In 1756, Lomonosov tried to replicate Robert Boyle&#x27;s experiment of 1673. He concluded that the commonly accepted phlogiston theory was false. Anticipating the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier, he wrote in his diary: &quot;Today I made an experiment in hermetic glass vessels in order to determine whether the mass of metals increases from the action of pure heat. The experiments – of which I append the record in 13 pages – demonstrated that the famous Robert Boyle was deluded, for without access of air from outside the mass of the burnt metal remains the same.&quot;

That is the Law of Mass Conservation in chemical reaction, which is well-known today as &quot;in a chemical reaction, the mass of reactants is equal to the mass of the products.&quot; Lomonosov, together with Lavoisier, is regarded as the one who discovered the law of mass conservation.

He stated that all matter is composed of corpuscles – molecules that are &quot;collections&quot; of elements – atoms. In his dissertation &quot;Elements of Mathematical Chemistry&quot; (1741, unfinished), the scientist gives the following definition: &quot;An element is a part of a body that does not consist of any other smaller and different bodies ... corpuscle is a collection of elements forming one small mass.&quot; In a later study (1748), he uses the term &quot;atom&quot; instead of &quot;element&quot;, and &quot;particula&quot; (particle) or &quot;molecule&quot; instead of &quot;corpuscle.&quot;

He regarded heat as a form of motion, suggested the wave theory of light, contributed to the formulation of the kinetic theory of gases, and stated the idea of conservation of matter in the following words: &quot;All changes in nature are such that inasmuch is taken from one object insomuch is added to another. So, if the amount of matter decreases in one place, it increases elsewhere. This universal law of nature embraces laws of motion as well, for an object moving others by its own force in fact imparts to another object the force it loses&quot; (first articulated in a letter to Leonhard Euler dated 5 July 1748, rephrased and published in Lomonosov&#x27;s dissertation &quot;Reflexion on the solidity and fluidity of bodies,&quot; 1760).

===Astronomy===

Lomonosov was the first to discover and appreciate the atmosphere of Venus during his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 in a small observatory near his house in St Petersburg. At least in the English-speaking world, this attribution seems to have been owing to comments from the multi-lingual popular astronomy writer Willy Ley (1966), who consulted sources in both Russian and German, and wrote that Lomonosov observed a luminous ring (this was Ley&#x27;s interpretation and was not indicated in quotes) and inferred from it the existence of an atmosphere &quot;maybe greater than that of the Earth&quot; (which was in quotes). Because many modern transit observers have also seen a threadlike arc produced by refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere of Venus when the planet has progressed off the limb of the Sun, it has generally, if rather uncritically, been assumed that this was the same thing that Lomonosov saw. Indeed, the term &quot;Lomonosov’s arc&quot; has frequently been used in the literature. 

In 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan consulted original sources, and questioned the basis for the claim that Lomonosov observed the thin arc produced by the atmosphere of Venus. A reference to the paper was even picked up by the Russian state-controlled media group RIA Novosti on 31 January 2013, under the headline &quot;Astronomical Battle in US Over Lomonosov’s discovery.&quot; An attempt was made by a group of researchers to experimentally reconstruct Lomonosov&#x27;s observation using antique telescopes during the transit of Venus on 5–6 June 2012. One of them, Y. Petrunin, suggested that the telescope Lomonosov actually used was probably a 50 mm Dollond with a magnifying power of 40x. 

It was preserved at Pulkova Observatory but destroyed when the Germans bombed the observatory during World War II. Thus, Lomonosov&#x27;s actual telescope was not available, but other presumably similar instruments were employed on this occasion, and led the researchers to affirm their belief that Lomonosov&#x27;s telescope would have been adequate to the task of detecting the arc. Thus A. Koukarine, using a 67 mm Dollond on Mt. Hamilton, where seeing was likely much better than Lomonosov enjoyed at St. Petersburg, clearly observed the spiderweb-thin arc known to be due to refraction in the atmosphere of Venus. However, Koukarine&#x27;s sketches do not really resemble the diagram published by Lomonosov. 

Koukarine&#x27;s colleague V. Shiltsev, who more nearly observed under the same conditions as Lomonosov, using a 40 mm Dollond at Batavia, Illinois, produced a close duplicate of Lomonosov&#x27;s diagram. However, the rather large wing of light shown next to the black disk of Venus in his drawing (and Lomonosov&#x27;s) is too coarse to have been the arc. Instead it appears to be a complicated manifestation of the celebrated optical effect known as the &quot;black drop&quot;. It should be kept in mind that, as stated in Sheehan and Westfall, &quot;optical distortions at the interface between Venus and the Sun during transits are impressively large, and any inferences from them are fraught with peril&quot;.

Again, the actual words used by Lomonosov do not refer to an &quot;arc&quot; at all. In the Russian version, he described a brief brightening lasting a second or so, just before third contact, which appeared to Pasachoff and Sheehan to most probably indicate a last fleeting glimpse of the photosphere. As a check against this, Lomonosov&#x27;s German version (he had learned to speak and write German fluently as a student at Marburg) was also consulted; he describes seeing &quot;ein ganz helles Licht, wie ein Haar breit&quot;=”a very bright light, as wide as a hair&quot;. Here, the adverb &quot;ganz&quot; in connection with &quot;helles&quot; (bright) could mean &quot;as bright as possible&quot; or &quot;completely bright&quot;), i.e., as bright as the surface brightness of the solar disk, which is even stronger evidence that this can&#x27;t be Venus&#x27;s atmosphere, which always appears much fainter. 

Lomonosov&#x27;s original sketches, if they existed, do not appear to have survived, Modern observations made during the nineteenth century transits and especially those of 2004 and 2012 suggest that what Lomonosov saw was not the arc associated with the atmosphere of Venus at all but the bright flash of the solar photosphere before third contact. The first observers to record the actual arc associated with the atmosphere of Venus, in a form comporting with modern observations, appear to have been Chappe, Rittenhouse, Wayles and Dymond, and several others at the transit in June 1769.
In 1762, Lomonosov presented an improved design of a reflecting telescope to the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. His telescope had its primary mirror adjusted at an angle of four degrees to the telescope&#x27;s axis. This made the image focus at the side of the telescope tube, where the observer could view the image with an eyepiece without blocking the image. This invention was not published until 1827, so this type of telescope has become associated with a similar design by William Herschel, the Herschelian telescope.

===Chemistry and geology===
In 1759, with his collaborator, academician Joseph Adam Braun, Lomonosov was the first person to record the freezing of mercury and to carry out initial experiments with it. Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous evolution, he demonstrated the organic origin of soil, peat, coal, petroleum and amber. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of icebergs.

In 1763, he published &quot;On The Strata of the Earth&quot; – his most significant geological work. This work puts him before James Hutton, who has been traditionally regarded as the founder of modern geology. Lomonosov based his conceptions on the unity of the Earth&#x27;s processes in time, and necessity to explain the planet&#x27;s past from present.

===Geography===
Lomonosov&#x27;s observation of iceberg formation led into his pioneering work in geography. Lomonosov got close to the theory of continental drift, theoretically predicted the existence of Antarctica (he argued that icebergs of the Southern Ocean could be formed only on a dry land covered with ice), and invented sea tools which made writing and calculating directions and distances easier. In 1764, he organized an expedition (led by Admiral Vasili Chichagov) to find the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by sailing along the northern coast of Siberia.

=== Engineering ===

The idea of a coaxial rotor originated from Mikhail Lomonosov. In July 1754, he developed a model of a small helicopter with a coaxial rotor and demonstrated it to the Russian Academy of Sciences.

===Mosaic===
Lomonosov was proud to restore the ancient art of mosaics. In 1754, in his letter to Leonhard Euler, he wrote that his three years of experiments on the effects of chemistry of minerals on their colour led to his deep involvement in the mosaic art. In 1763, he set up a glass factory that produced the first stained glass mosaics outside of Italy. There were forty mosaics attributed to Lomonosov, with only twenty-four surviving to the present day. Among the best is the portrait of Peter the Great and the &quot;Battle of Poltava&quot;, measuring .

===Grammarian, poet, historian===
Besides his scientific activities, Lomonosov also paid considerable attention to literature. Together with his contemporaries Alexander Sumarokov and Vasily Trediakovsky, Lomonosov sought the creation of a system of Russian linguistic conventions, syntax and prosody which would allow the advancement of a native literary tradition on the basis of Western European genres. He laid out his literary theories in his work &quot;Epistle on the Rules of Russian Versification&quot; (1739). Lomonosov is considered the founder of accentual-syllabic (or syllabo-tonic) verse in Russian poetry, although statistical analysis suggests the adoption of this system was already in progress when Lomonosov publicized his theories. His &quot;Ode on the Taking of Khotin&quot; has been called the first &quot;aesthetically indisputable example&quot; of accentual-syllabic verse in the history of Russian literature. The iambic tetrameter and hexameter verse and the ten-line odic stanza which he developed had a lasting role in Russian poetry. His advocacy of the iamb won out over Trediakovsky&#x27;s arguments for the trochee as the basic metrical foot.

Lomonosov wrote solemn occasional, spiritual, as natural-philosophical odes, as well as an Anacreontic ode. According to A. Kahn, &quot;the turgidity of the Lomonosovian ode derives from a propensity to create semantic clusters, usually through etymologic play or tropes, such as zeugma.&quot; His &quot;Evening Meditation on God&#x27;s Grandeur&quot; and &quot;Morning Meditation on God&#x27;s Grandeur&quot; are the first Russian poems on the theme of sublime admiration of nature. He applied an idiosyncratic theory to his later poems – tender subjects needed words containing the front vowel sounds E, I, Y and U, whereas things that may cause fear (like &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;envy&quot;, &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;sorrow&quot;) needed words with back vowel sounds O, U and Y. That was a version of what is now called sound symbolism. He also wrote two verse tragedies, &quot;Tamira i Selim&quot; and &quot;Demofont&quot;. 

Lomonosov wrote an important Russian grammar in 1755 (published in 1757), in which he distinguished Old Church Slavonic and colloquial Russian forms. His work on rhetoric &quot;Kratkoye rukovodstvo k krasnorechiyu&quot; (Brief guide to eloquence, 1748) is the first such work in Russian and expounds a theory of literature on the basis of Russian literary models. His treatise &quot;Predisloviye o polze knig tserkovnykh v rossiyskom yazyke&quot; (Introduction to the usefulness of church books in the Russian language, 1757) is the first Russian work on stylistics. Lomonosov adopted classical views on the existence of three distinct styles—high, middle, and low—and applied them to the Russian literary language. It also addresses the problems of the combination of Church Slavonic and Russian forms and the categorization of literary genres. In 1760, Lomonosov published a history of Russia. In addition, he attempted to write a grand &quot;Aeneid&quot;-inspired epic about Peter the Great, but he died before he could finish it.

==Legacy==
His granddaughter Sophia Konstantinova (1769–1844) married Russian military hero and statesman General Nikolay Raevsky. His great-granddaughter was Princess Maria (Raevskaya) Volkonskaya, the wife of the Decembrist Prince Sergei Volkonsky.

The city of Lomonosov, Russia (formerly Oranienbaum), and a lunar crater bear his name, as does a crater on Mars and the asteroid 1379 Lomonosowa. A Russian satellite launched in 2016 was named Mikhailo Lomonosov after him. The Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg was renamed after him from 1925 to 2005. In 1948, the underwater Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean was named in his honor.

Lomonosov Bridge in Saint Petersburg was named after the polymath. Originally called Tchernyshov Bridge (Chernyshev Bridge) in honour of one of Peter the Great&#x27;s most prominent generals, whose estates were located nearby, the bridge was erected in 1785−1987, and replaced a wooden bridge which had previously stood at the site. It was one of seven moveable stone bridges of similar design crossing the Fontanka River, built simultaneously with the river&#x27;s granite embankments. Only Lomonosov Bridge and Staro-Kalinkin Bridge have survived more or less intact.

Moscow&#x27;s Domodedovo Airport is officially named after Lomonosov.

The Lomonosov Gold Medal was established in 1959 and is awarded annually by the Russian Academy of Sciences to a Russian and a foreign scientist.

Lomonosovskaya Station on the Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya Line of the Saint Petersburg Metro is named after him. It was opened in 1970.

The street &quot;Lomonosova iela&quot; in the Maskavas Forštate district of Riga is named in honor of Lomonosov. During the Soviet era, a main street in Tallinn, Estonia, was named in his honor as &quot;M. Lomonossovi&quot;, but from 1991, the year when Estonia restored its independence, the street was renamed after Jakob Johann Gonsior, a 19th-century alderman and lawyer.
In Dnipro, Ukraine, a statue of Lomonosov replaced a statue of Catherine the Great in 1919. It stood until 6 January 2023, when it was removed by the city of Dnipro because of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion into Ukraine.

On 19 November 2011, Google celebrated his 300th birthday with a Google Doodle.

A great number of different stamps was issued in honor of Lomonosov throughout the years: Mikhail Lomonosov and the Academy of Sciences building in Leningrad stamp of 1925, stamps depicting Lomonosov issued in 1949, in 1956 and in 1961, a 275th Birth Anniversary of M.V. Lomonosov stamp of 1986, a History of Russia (Ekaterina II) stamp depicting Lomonosov and his study room talking to the queen that was issued in 2004, three 300th Anniversary of the Birth of M.V. Lomonosov stamps were issued in 2011.

The &quot;Akademik Lomonosov&quot;, the first of a series of Russian floating nuclear power stations, is named after him. It started operation on 19 December 2019.

Moscow State University, founded by him in 1755, was renamed &quot;M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University &quot; in 1940, while celebrating its 185th anniversary. There are also Moscow Institute of Mechanics and Electrical Engineering M.V. Lomonosov (Lomonosov Institute), Lomonosov Institute of Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Petrography, USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Lomonosov Northern (Arctic) Federal University, Odessa Technological Institute of Food Industry n.a. M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies n.a. M.V. Lomonosov, and several other schools in Russia and Kazakhstan.

On 19 November 1986, on the 275th anniversary of the birth of M.V. Lomonosov, the USSR State Bank issued a 1 ruble commemorative coin from a copper-nickel alloy.

On 6 December 2022, the City Council of the Ukrainian city Dnipro decided to remove from the city all monuments to figures of Russian culture and history, in particular it was mentioned that the monuments to Lomonosov, Alexander Pushkin and Maxim Gorky would be removed from the public space of the city.

<doc id="63376" wikidata="Q107002" url="?curid=63376" title="Evelyn Waugh">
<text>Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh (; 28 October 1903 – 10 April 1966) was an English writer of novels, biographies, and travel books; he was also a prolific journalist and book reviewer. His most famous works include the early satires &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (1928) and &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934), the novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945), and the Second World War trilogy &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; (1952–1961). He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the 20th century.

Waugh was the son of a publisher, educated at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford. He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for country house society.

He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from Abyssinia at the time of the 1935 Italian invasion. Waugh served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh&#x27;s detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.

Waugh converted to Catholicism in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981).

== Family background ==
Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903 to Arthur Waugh (1866–1943) and Catherine Charlotte Raban (1870–1954), into a family with English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Huguenot origins. Distinguished relatives included Lord Cockburn (1779–1854), a leading Scottish advocate and judge, William Morgan (1750–1833), a pioneer of actuarial science who served The Equitable Life Assurance Society for 56 years, and Philip Henry Gosse (1810–1888), a natural scientist who became notorious through his depiction as a religious fanatic in his son Edmund&#x27;s memoir &quot;Father and Son&quot;. Among ancestors bearing the Waugh name, the Rev. Alexander Waugh (1754–1827) was a minister in the Secession Church of Scotland who helped found the London Missionary Society and was one of the leading Nonconformist preachers of his day. His grandson Alexander Waugh (1840–1906) was a country medical practitioner, who bullied his wife and children and became known in the Waugh family as &quot;the Brute&quot;. The elder of Alexander&#x27;s two sons, born in 1866, was Evelyn&#x27;s father, Arthur Waugh.

After attending Sherborne School and New College, Oxford, Arthur Waugh began a career in publishing and as a literary critic. In 1902 he became managing director of Chapman and Hall, publishers of the works of Charles Dickens. He had married Catherine Raban (1870–1954) in 1893; their first son Alexander Raban Waugh (always known as Alec) was born on 8 July 1898. Alec Waugh later became a novelist of note. At the time of his birth the family were living in North London, at Hillfield Road, West Hampstead where, on 28 October 1903, the couple&#x27;s second son was born, &quot;in great haste before Dr Andrews could arrive&quot;, Catherine recorded. On 7 January 1904 the boy was christened Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh but was known in the family and in the wider world as Evelyn.

== Childhood ==

=== Golders Green and Heath Mount ===

In 1907, the Waugh family left Hillfield Road for Underhill, a house which Arthur had built in North End Road, Hampstead, close to Golders Green, then a semi-rural area of dairy farms, market gardens and bluebell woods. Evelyn received his first school lessons at home, from his mother, with whom he formed a particularly close relationship; his father, Arthur Waugh, was a more distant figure, whose close bond with his elder son, Alec, was such that Evelyn often felt excluded. In September 1910, Evelyn began as a day pupil at Heath Mount preparatory school. By then, he was a lively boy of many interests, who already had written and completed &quot;The Curse of the Horse Race&quot;, his first story. A positive influence on his writing was a schoolmaster, Aubrey Ensor. Waugh spent six relatively contented years at Heath Mount; on his own assertion he was &quot;quite a clever little boy&quot; who was seldom distressed or overawed by his lessons. Physically pugnacious, Evelyn was inclined to bully weaker boys; among his victims was the future society photographer Cecil Beaton, who never forgot the experience.

Outside school, he and other neighbourhood children performed plays, usually written by Waugh. On the basis of the xenophobia fostered by the genre books of invasion literature, that the Germans were about to invade Britain, Waugh organised his friends into the &quot;Pistol Troop&quot;, who built a fort, went on manoeuvres and paraded in makeshift uniforms. In 1914, after the First World War began, Waugh and other boys from the Boy Scout Troop of Heath Mount School were sometimes employed as messengers at the War Office; Evelyn loitered about the War Office in hope of glimpsing Lord Kitchener, but never did.

Family holidays usually were spent with the Waugh aunts at Midsomer Norton in Somerset, in a house lit with oil lamps, a time that Waugh recalled with delight, many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an altar boy at the local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited &quot;The Cynic&quot; school magazine.

=== Lancing ===
Like his father before him, Alec Waugh went to school at Sherborne. It was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Evelyn&#x27;s older brother Alec to leave after a homosexual relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote &quot;The Loom of Youth&quot; (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec&#x27;s novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, he was sent to Lancing College, in his opinion a decidedly inferior school.

Waugh soon overcame his initial aversion to Lancing, settled in and established his reputation as an aesthete. In November 1917 his essay &quot;In Defence of Cubism&quot; (1917) was accepted by and published in the arts magazine &quot;Drawing and Design&quot;; it was his first published article. Within the school, he became mildly subversive, mocking the school&#x27;s cadet corps and founding the Corpse Club &quot;for those who were bored stiff&quot;. The end of the war saw the return to the school of younger masters such as J. F. Roxburgh, who encouraged Waugh to write and predicted a great future for him. Another mentor, Francis Crease, taught Waugh the arts of calligraphy and decorative design; some of the boy&#x27;s work was good enough to be used by Chapman and Hall on book jackets.

In his later years at Lancing, Waugh achieved success as a house captain, editor of the school magazine and president of the debating society, and won numerous art and literature prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College, Oxford, and left Lancing in December 1921.

== Oxford ==
Waugh arrived in Oxford in January 1922. He was soon writing to old friends at Lancing about the pleasures of his new life; he informed Tom Driberg: &quot;I do no work here and never go to Chapel&quot;. During his first two terms, he generally followed convention; he smoked a pipe, bought a bicycle, and gave his maiden speech at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion that &quot;This House would welcome Prohibition&quot;. Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines, &quot;Cherwell&quot; and &quot;Isis&quot;, and he acted as a film critic for &quot;Isis&quot;. He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society, &quot;an onerous but not honorific post&quot;, he told Driberg. Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship as a reward for past efforts rather than a stepping-stone to future academic success, he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his &quot;History Previous&quot;, an essential preliminary examination.

The arrival in Oxford in October 1922 of the sophisticated Etonians Harold Acton and Brian Howard changed Waugh&#x27;s Oxford life. Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an avant-garde circle known as the Hypocrites&#x27; Club (Waugh was the secretary of the club), whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically; he later wrote: &quot;It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life&quot;. He began drinking heavily, and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with Hugh Lygon, Richard Pares and Alastair Graham (potentially the inspiration for the fictional character Lord Sebastian Flyte in the novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, though this is rather disputed and was most likely a blend of numerous individuals including Stephen Tennant).

He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was &quot;fatuously haughty&quot;; from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred. Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell&#x27;s name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.

Waugh&#x27;s dissipated lifestyle continued into his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: &quot;I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened&quot;. He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms&#x27; residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university&#x27;s statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.

Back at home, Waugh began a novel, &quot;The Temple at Thatch&quot;, and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, &quot;The Scarlet Woman&quot;, which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for Kenya, Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, Heatherley&#x27;s.

== Early career ==

=== Teaching and writing ===
Waugh began at Heatherley&#x27;s in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys&#x27; preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925, and staying at Plas Dulas nearby. He took with him the notes for his novel, &quot;The Temple at Thatch&quot;, intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.

In the summer of 1925, Waugh&#x27;s outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust&#x27;s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton&#x27;s reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.

During the following two years Waugh taught at schools in Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and Notting Hill in London. He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write. A short story, &quot;The Balance&quot;, written in an experimental modernist style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, &quot;Georgian Stories&quot;. An extended essay on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the Shakespeare Head Press in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was undergoing training as a printer. This led to a contract from the publishers Duckworths for a full-length biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which Waugh wrote during 1927. He also began working on a comic novel; after several temporary working titles this became &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;. Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in April–May 1927. That year he met (possibly through his brother Alec) and fell in love with Evelyn Gardner, the daughter of Lord and Lady Burghclere.

=== &quot;He-Evelyn&quot; and &quot;She-Evelyn&quot; ===
In December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company. Among their friends, they quickly became known as &quot;He-Evelyn&quot; and &quot;She-Evelyn&quot;. Waugh was at this time dependent on a £4-a-week allowance () from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism. The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: J. C. Squire in &quot;The Observer&quot; praised the book&#x27;s elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist Rebecca West wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh were the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;″s references to him as &quot;Miss Waugh&quot;.

When &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; was completed, Duckworths objected to its &quot;obscenity&quot;, but Chapman &amp; Hall agreed to publish it. This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul&#x27;s Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Robert Byron, Alec Waugh and the bride&#x27;s friend Pansy Pakenham present. The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, Islington. The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner&#x27;s poor health, which persisted into the autumn.

In September 1928, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free Mediterranean cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, John Heygate, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the annulment of their marriage a few years later.

== Novelist and journalist ==

=== Recognition ===

Waugh&#x27;s first biographer, Christopher Sykes, records that after the divorce friends &quot;saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness&quot; in Waugh&#x27;s outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he &quot;did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live&quot;, he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;, and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on the meaning of the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.

&quot;Vile Bodies&quot;, a satire on the Bright Young People of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh&#x27;s first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, &quot;a manifesto of disillusionment&quot;, according to biographer Martin Stannard. As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism. Amid regular work for &quot;The Graphic&quot;, &quot;Town and Country&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, he quickly wrote &quot;Labels&quot;, a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.

=== Conversion to Catholicism ===

On 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: &quot;Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church&quot;. The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, &quot;I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson&quot;. Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, &quot;She bullied me into the Church&quot;. It was she who led him to Father Martin D&#x27;Arcy, a Jesuit, who persuaded Waugh &quot;on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion&quot; that &quot;the Christian revelation was genuine&quot;. In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was &quot;unintelligible and unendurable without God&quot;.

=== Writer and traveller ===
On 10 October 1930, Waugh, representing several newspapers, departed for Abyssinia to cover the coronation of Haile Selassie. He reported the event as &quot;an elaborate propaganda effort&quot; to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means. A subsequent journey through the British East Africa colonies and the Belgian Congo formed the basis of two books; the travelogue &quot;Remote People&quot; (1931) and the comic novel &quot;Black Mischief&quot; (1932). Waugh&#x27;s next extended trip, in the winter of 1932–1933, was to British Guiana (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite Teresa Jungman. On arrival in Georgetown, Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to Boa Vista in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown. His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account &quot;Ninety-two Days&quot;, and the novel &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, both published in 1934.

Back from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and blasphemy from the Catholic journal &quot;The Tablet&quot;, which objected to passages in &quot;Black Mischief&quot;. He defended himself in an open letter to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Francis Bourne, which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to Spitsbergen in the Arctic, an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use. On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the Jesuit martyr Edmund Campion as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-Protestant stance but brought its writer the Hawthornden Prize. He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia &quot;a savage place which Mussolini was doing well to tame&quot; according to his fellow reporter, William Deedes. Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent. Deedes remarks on the older writer&#x27;s snobbery: &quot;None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home&quot;. However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh&#x27;s courage &quot;deeply reassuring&quot;. Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, &quot;Waugh in Abyssinia&quot; (1936), which Rose Macaulay dismissed as a &quot;fascist tract&quot;, on account of its pro-Italian tone. A better-known account is his novel &quot;Scoop&quot; (1938), in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.

Among Waugh&#x27;s growing circle of friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper, Nancy Mitford who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner&#x27;s, and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D&#x27;Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family&#x27;s villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel&#x27;s 17-year-old sister, Laura.

=== Second marriage ===

On his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the annulment of the marriage on the grounds of &quot;lack of real consent&quot;. The case was heard by an ecclesiastical tribunal in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936. In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert. He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936. There were initial misgivings from the Herberts, an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner. Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the Church of the Assumption in Warwick Street, London.

As a wedding present the bride&#x27;s grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire. The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, Auberon Alexander, on 17 November 1939. Between these events, &quot;Scoop&quot; was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim. In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to Mexico after which he wrote &quot;Robbery Under Law&quot;, based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing &quot;little with travel and much with political questions&quot;.

== Second World War ==

=== Royal Marine and commando ===

Waugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War and moved his young family to Pixton Park in Somerset, the Herbert family&#x27;s country seat, while he sought military employment. He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration, but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as &quot;Work Suspended and Other Stories&quot; (1943).

Waugh&#x27;s daily training routine left him with &quot;so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen&quot;. In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to captain and given command of a company of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men. Even after the German invasion of the Low Countries (10 May – 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action. Waugh&#x27;s inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion&#x27;s Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the Battle of Dakar in West Africa (23–25 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the Free French Forces to overthrow the Vichy French colonial government and install General Charles de Gaulle. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town&#x27;s defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh&#x27;s comment on the affair was this: &quot;Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.&quot;

In November 1940, Waugh was posted to a commando unit, and, after further training, became a member of &quot;Layforce&quot;, under Colonel (later Brigadier) Robert Laycock. In February 1941, the unit sailed to the Mediterranean, where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Bardia, on the Libyan coast. In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of Crete: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops. In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot; (1942), a novel of the war&#x27;s early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s. Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, on Laycock&#x27;s recommendation. On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple&#x27;s fourth child.

=== Frustration, &quot;Brideshead&quot; and Yugoslavia ===

Waugh&#x27;s elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of Operation Husky (9 July – 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of Sicily. Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier. After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in Windsor, Waugh began parachute training at Tatton Park, Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a fibula. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months&#x27; unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for Chagford, Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was &quot;Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred &amp; Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder&quot; (1945), the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer Douglas Lane Patey commented that it was &quot;the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation&quot;.

Waugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by Randolph Churchill to serve in the Maclean Mission to Yugoslavia, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from Bari, Italy, to the Croatian island of Vis. There, they met Marshal Tito, the Communist leader of the Partisans, who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.

The mission eventually arrived at Topusko, where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group&#x27;s liaison duties, between the British Army and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the Serbian Orthodox Church and would fare worse when the Communists took control. He expressed those thoughts in a long report, &quot;Church and State in Liberated Croatia&quot;. After spells in Dubrovnik and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the Foreign Office suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.

== Postwar ==

=== Fame and fortune ===

&quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; was published in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book&#x27;s qualities, &quot;my first novel rather than my last&quot;. It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh&#x27;s principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war&#x27;s combatants and later described it as &quot;a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts&quot;. Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the 1945 general election, he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new &quot;Dark Age&quot;.
In September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, &quot;Scott-King&#x27;s Modern Europe&quot;. In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of &quot;Brideshead&quot;. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1948). In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th-century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.

In between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on &quot;Helena&quot;, a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the True Cross that was by &quot;far the best book I have ever written or ever will write&quot;. Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, &quot;the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud&quot;.

In 1952 Waugh published &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war. Other books published during this period included &quot;When The Going Was Good&quot; (1946), an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, &quot;The Holy Places&quot; (published by the Ian Fleming-managed Queen Anne Press, 1952) and &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1953), a dystopian tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world. Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, &quot;selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible&quot; and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression. Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.

From 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector, particularly of Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London&#x27;s Portobello Market and from house clearance sales. His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to Gloucester, where he bought &quot;a lion of wood, finely carved for £25, also a bookcase £35 ... a charming Chinese painting £10, a Regency easel £7&quot;. Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid £10 for Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of the Rainbow&quot; to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.

=== Breakdown ===

By 1953, Waugh&#x27;s popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, &quot;Officers and Gentlemen&quot;, had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: &quot;they tried to make a fool of me, and I don&#x27;t think they entirely succeeded&quot;, Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. Peter Fleming in &quot;The Spectator&quot; likened the interview to &quot;the goading of a bull by matadors&quot;.

Early in 1954, Waugh&#x27;s doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for Ceylon, hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of &quot;other passengers whispering about me&quot; and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC interlocutor, Stephen Black. He left the ship in Egypt and flew on to Colombo, but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him. Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, Frances Donaldson, whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was suffering from demonic possession. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from bromide poisoning from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared. Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: &quot;Clean off my onion!&quot;. The experience was fictionalised a few years later, in &quot;The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold&quot; (1957).

In 1956, Edwin Newman made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned dip pen. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of whisky, and that every American had been divorced at least once.

=== Late works ===
Restored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished &quot;Officers and Gentlemen&quot;. In June 1955 the &quot;Daily Express&quot; journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: &quot;I felt it was polluted&quot;, he told Nancy Mitford. Late in 1956, the family moved to Combe Florey House in the Somerset village of Combe Florey. In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain–Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the &quot;Express&quot; and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh&#x27;s books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.

&quot;Gilbert Pinfold&quot; was published in the summer of 1957, &quot;my barmy book&quot;, Waugh called it. The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate. Waugh&#x27;s next major book was a biography of his longtime friend Ronald Knox, the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in Cyprus. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter&#x27;s return to Britain. The critic and literary biographer David Wykes called Waugh&#x27;s sang-froid &quot;astonishing&quot; and the family&#x27;s apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.

Although most of Waugh&#x27;s books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life. In 1950, as a means of tax avoidance, he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the &quot;Save the Children Fund&quot;, after the well-established charity of that name) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books. He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it. Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the &quot;Face to Face&quot; series conducted by John Freeman. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer Selina Hastings, Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a &quot;pose of world-weary boredom&quot;.

In 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a CBE but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a knighthood. In September, he produced his final travel book, &quot;A Tourist in Africa&quot;, based on a visit made in January–March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but &quot;despised&quot; the book. The critic Cyril Connolly called it &quot;the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken&quot;. The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot;.

===Decline and death===

As he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, &quot;fat, deaf, short of breath&quot;, according to Patey. His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of &quot;an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink&quot;. In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story &quot;Basil Seal Rides Again&quot;. This revival of the protagonist of &quot;Black Mischief&quot; and &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot; was published in 1963; the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; called it a &quot;nasty little book&quot;. However, that same year, he was awarded with the title Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature (its highest honour). When the first volume of autobiography, &quot;A Little Learning&quot;, was published in 1964, Waugh&#x27;s often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.

Waugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope&#x27;s death in 1963. However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Pope Paul VI, until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a &quot;Spectator&quot; article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as &quot;sharp-edged reasonableness&quot;. He wrote to Nancy Mitford that &quot;the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me ... We write letters to the paper. A fat lot of good that does.&quot;

In 1965, a new financial crisis arose from an apparent flaw in the terms of the &quot;Save the Children&quot; trust, and a large sum of back tax was being demanded. Waugh&#x27;s agent, A. D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount, but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography. Waugh&#x27;s physical and mental deterioration prevented any work on these projects, and the contracts were cancelled. He described himself as &quot;toothless, deaf, melancholic, shaky on my pins, unable to eat, full of dope, quite idle&quot; and expressed the belief that &quot;all fates were worse than death&quot;. His only significant literary activity in 1965 was the editing of the three war novels into a single volume, published as &quot;Sword of Honour&quot;.

On Easter Day, 10 April 1966, after attending a Latin Mass in a neighbouring village with members of his family, Waugh died of heart failure at his Combe Florey home, aged 62. He was buried, by special arrangement, in a consecrated plot outside the Anglican churchyard of the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Combe Florey. A Requiem Mass, in Latin, was celebrated in Westminster Cathedral on 21 April 1966.

== Character and opinions ==
In the course of his lifetime, Waugh made enemies and offended many people; writer James Lees-Milne said that Waugh &quot;was the nastiest-tempered man in England&quot;. Waugh&#x27;s son, Auberon, said that the force of his father&#x27;s personality was such that, despite his lack of height, &quot;generals and chancellors of the exchequer, six-foot-six and exuding self-importance from every pore, quail[ed] in front of him&quot;.

In the biographic &quot;Mad World&quot; (2009), Paula Byrne said that the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a &quot;snobbish misanthrope&quot; is a caricature; she asks: &quot;Why would a man, who was so unpleasant, be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends?&quot; His generosity to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures; after his libel-court victory over Nancy Spain, he sent her a bottle of champagne. Hastings said that Waugh&#x27;s outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at &quot;finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity&quot;. Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself—the elderly buffer, &quot;crusty colonel&quot; image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.
As an instinctive conservative, Waugh believed that class divisions, with inequalities of wealth and position, were natural and that &quot;no form of government [was] ordained by God as being better than any other&quot;. In the post-war &quot;Age of the Common Man&quot;, he attacked socialism (the &quot;Cripps–Attlee terror&quot;) and complained, after Churchill&#x27;s election in 1951, that &quot;the Conservative Party have never put the clock back a single second&quot;. Waugh never voted in elections; in 1959, he expressed a hope that the Conservatives would win the election, which they did, but would not vote for them, saying &quot;I should feel I was morally inculpated in their follies&quot; and added: &quot;I do not aspire to advise my sovereign in her choice of servants&quot;.

Waugh&#x27;s Catholicism was fundamental: &quot;The Church ... is the normal state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves.&quot; He believed that the Catholic Church was the last, great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the welfare state and the spreading of working-class culture. Strictly observant, Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men. When Nancy Mitford asked him how he reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian, Waugh replied that &quot;were he not a Christian he would be even more horrible&quot;.

Waugh&#x27;s conservatism was aesthetic as well as political and religious. Although he praised younger writers, such as Angus Wilson, Muriel Spark and V. S. Naipaul, he was scornful of the 1950s writers&#x27; group known as &quot;The Movement&quot;. He said that the literary world was &quot;sinking into black disaster&quot; and that literature might die within thirty years. As a schoolboy Waugh had praised Cubism, but he soon abandoned his interest in artistic modernism. In 1945, Waugh said that Pablo Picasso&#x27;s artistic standing was the result of a &quot;mesmeric trick&quot; and that his paintings &quot;could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised masters&quot;. In 1953, in a radio interview, he named Augustus Egg (1816–1863) as a painter for whom he had particular esteem. Despite their political differences, Waugh came to admire George Orwell, because of their shared patriotism and sense of morality. Orwell in turn commented that Waugh was &quot;about as good a novelist as one can be ... while holding untenable opinions&quot;.

Waugh has been criticised for expressing racial and anti-semitic prejudices. Wykes describes Waugh&#x27;s anti-semitism as &quot;his most persistently noticeable nastiness&quot;, and his assumptions of white superiority as &quot;an illogical extension of his views on the naturalness and rightness of hierarchy as the principle of social organization&quot;.

== Works ==

=== Themes and style ===

Wykes observes that Waugh&#x27;s novels reprise and fictionalise the principal events of his life, although in an early essay Waugh wrote: &quot;Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to assume that he is incapable of anything but the mere transcription of what he observes&quot;. The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters. Nevertheless, in the Introduction to the &quot;Complete Short Stories&quot;, Ann Pasternak Slater said that the &quot;delineation of social prejudices and the language in which they are expressed is part of Waugh&#x27;s meticulous observation of his contemporary world&quot;.

The critic Clive James said of Waugh: &quot;Nobody ever wrote a more unaffectedly elegant English ... its hundreds of years of steady development culminate in him&quot;. As his talent developed and matured, he maintained what literary critic Andrew Michael Roberts called &quot;an exquisite sense of the ludicrous, and a fine aptitude for exposing false attitudes&quot;. In the first stages of his 40-year writing career, before his conversion to Catholicism in 1930, Waugh was the novelist of the Bright Young People generation. His first two novels, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (1928) and &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; (1930), comically reflect a futile society, populated by two-dimensional, basically unbelievable characters in circumstances too fantastic to evoke the reader&#x27;s emotions. A typical Waugh trademark evident in the early novels is rapid, unattributed dialogue in which the participants can be readily identified. At the same time Waugh was writing serious essays, such as &quot;The War and the Younger Generation&quot;, in which he castigates his own generation as &quot;crazy and sterile&quot; people.

Waugh&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism did not noticeably change the nature of his next two novels, &quot;Black Mischief&quot; (1934) and &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934), but, in the latter novel, the elements of farce are subdued, and the protagonist, Tony Last, is recognisably a person rather than a comic cipher. Waugh&#x27;s first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story &quot;Out of Depth&quot; (1933) about the immutability of the Mass. From the mid-1930s onwards, Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non-fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with &quot;Scoop&quot; (1938), a novel about journalism, journalists, and unsavoury journalistic practices.

In &quot;Work Suspended and Other Stories&quot; Waugh introduced &quot;real&quot; characters and a first-person narrator, signalling the literary style he would adopt in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; a few years later. &quot;Brideshead&quot;, which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the &quot;Life&quot; magazine article &quot;Fan Fare&quot; (1946), Waugh said that &quot;you can only leave God out [of fiction] by making your characters pure abstractions&quot; and that his future novels shall be &quot;the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God.&quot; As such, the novel &quot;Helena&quot; (1950) is Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s most philosophically Christian book.

In &quot;Brideshead&quot;, the proletarian junior officer Hooper illustrates a theme that persists in Waugh&#x27;s postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the &quot;Age of the Common Man&quot;. In the trilogy &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; (&quot;Men at Arms&quot;, 1952; &quot;Officers and Gentlemen&quot;, 1955, &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot;, 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character &quot;Trimmer&quot;, a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella &quot;Scott-King&#x27;s Modern Europe&quot; (1947), Waugh&#x27;s pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster&#x27;s admonition: &quot;I think it would be very wicked indeed to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world&quot;. Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government&#x27;s social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that &quot;The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold&quot; (1957) stands out &quot;a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game&quot;. Waugh&#x27;s final work of fiction, &quot;Basil Seal Rides Again&quot; (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a &quot;senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth&quot;. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, &quot;The Balance&quot; of 1926, with a &quot;fusillade of unattributed dialogue&quot;.

=== Reception ===

Of Waugh&#x27;s early books, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; was hailed by Arnold Bennett in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; as &quot;an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire&quot;. The critical reception of &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; two years later was even more enthusiastic, with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was &quot;destined to be the dazzling figure of his age&quot;. However, &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, later widely regarded as a masterpiece, received a more muted welcome from critics, despite the author&#x27;s own high estimation of the work. Chapter VI, &quot;Du Côté de Chez Todd&quot;, of &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor, was thought by the critic Henry Yorke to reduce an otherwise believable book to &quot;phantasy&quot;. Cyril Connolly&#x27;s first reaction to the book was that Waugh&#x27;s powers were failing, an opinion that he later revised.

In the later 1930s, Waugh&#x27;s inclination to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his standing with the general reading public. The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be &quot;so rigidly biased that it has no claims to make as history&quot;. The pro-fascist tone in parts of &quot;Waugh in Abyssinia&quot; offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America. There was general relief among critics when &quot;Scoop&quot;, in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh&#x27;s earlier comic style. Critics had begun to think that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.

Waugh maintained his reputation in 1942, with &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot;, which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing. Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; three years later, on both sides of the Atlantic. &quot;Brideshead&quot;&#x27;s selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages. Despite the public&#x27;s enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. &quot;Brideshead&#x27;s&quot; Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh&#x27;s earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien who, in the Irish literary magazine &quot;The Bell&quot;, wrote of Waugh&#x27;s &quot;almost mystical veneration&quot; for the upper classes. Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh&#x27;s genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan &quot;alter ego&quot; and that he had lost his detachment: &quot;In art so naturally ironic and detached as his, this is a serious loss&quot;. Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, Graham Greene and, in glowing terms, by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford. In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: &quot;I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book&quot;.

In &quot;Fan Fare&quot;, Waugh forecasts that his future books will be unpopular because of their religious theme. On publication in 1950, &quot;Helena&quot; was received indifferently by the public and by critics, who disparaged the awkward mixing of 20th-century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose. Otherwise, Waugh&#x27;s prediction proved unfounded; all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy. During his successful 1957 lawsuit against the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Waugh&#x27;s counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books, two thirds in Britain and the rest in America. &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, the first volume of his war trilogy, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1953; initial critical comment was lukewarm, with Connolly likening &quot;Men at Arms&quot; to beer rather than champagne. Connolly changed his view later, calling the completed trilogy &quot;the finest novel to come out of the war&quot;. Of Waugh&#x27;s other major postwar works, the Knox biography was admired within Waugh&#x27;s close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy. The book did not sell well—&quot;like warm cakes&quot;, according to Waugh. &quot;Pinfold&quot; surprised the critics by its originality. Its plainly autobiographical content, Hastings suggests, gave the public a fixed image of Waugh: &quot;stout, splenetic, red-faced and reactionary, a figure from burlesque complete with cigar, bowler hat and loud checked suit&quot;.

=== Reputation ===

In 1973, Waugh&#x27;s diaries were serialised in &quot;The Observer&quot; prior to publication in book form in 1976. The revelations about his private life, thoughts and attitudes created controversy. Although Waugh had removed embarrassing entries relating to his Oxford years and his first marriage, there was sufficient left on the record to enable enemies to project a negative image of the writer as intolerant, snobbish and sadistic, with pronounced fascist leanings. Some of this picture, it was maintained by Waugh&#x27;s supporters, arose from poor editing of the diaries, and a desire to transform Waugh from a writer to a &quot;character&quot;. Nevertheless, a popular conception developed of Waugh as a monster. When, in 1980, a selection of his letters was published, his reputation became the subject of further discussion. Philip Larkin, reviewing the collection in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, thought that it demonstrated Waugh&#x27;s elitism; to receive a letter from him, it seemed, &quot;one would have to have a nursery nickname and be a member of White&#x27;s, a Roman Catholic, a high-born lady or an Old Etonian novelist&quot;.
The publication of the diaries and letters promoted increased interest in Waugh and his works and caused publication of much new material. Christopher Sykes&#x27;s biography had appeared in 1975, between 1980 and 1998 three more full biographies were issued and other biographical and critical studies have continued to be produced. A collection of Waugh&#x27;s journalism and reviews was published in 1983, revealing a fuller range of his ideas and beliefs. The new material provided further grounds for debate between Waugh&#x27;s supporters and detractors.

The 1981 Granada Television adaptation of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; introduced a new generation to Waugh&#x27;s works, in Britain and in America. There had been earlier television treatment of Waugh&#x27;s fiction, as &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; had been serialised by the BBC in 1967, but the impact of Granada&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead&quot; was much wider. Its nostalgic depiction of a vanished form of Englishness appealed to the American mass market; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s TV critic described the series as &quot;a novel ... made into a poem&quot;, and listed it among the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;. There have been further cinematic Waugh adaptations: &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; in 1988, &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; (filmed as &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;) in 2003 and &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; again in 2008. These popular treatments have maintained the public&#x27;s appetite for Waugh&#x27;s novels, all of which remain in print and continue to sell. Several have been listed among various compiled lists of the world&#x27;s greatest novels.

Stannard concludes that beneath his public mask, Waugh was &quot;a dedicated artist and a man of earnest faith, struggling against the dryness of his soul&quot;. Graham Greene, in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; shortly after Waugh&#x27;s death, acknowledged him as &quot;the greatest novelist of my generation&quot;, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s obituarist called him &quot;the grand old mandarin of modern British prose&quot; and asserted that his novels &quot;will continue to survive as long as there are readers who can savor what critic V. S. Pritchett calls &#x27;the beauty of his malice&#x27; &quot;. Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, &quot;What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything. That&#x27;s what none of the people who wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all&quot;.

<text>Contemporary art is a term used to describe the art of today, generally referring to art produced from the 1970s onwards. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or &quot;-ism&quot;. Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.

In English, &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;contemporary&quot; are synonyms, resulting in some conflation and confusion of the terms &quot;modern art&quot; and &quot;contemporary art&quot; by non-specialists.

==Scope==
The classification of &quot;contemporary art&quot; as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of Modernism in the English-speaking world. In London, the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic Roger Fry and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums. A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the Contemporary Art Society of Adelaide, Australia, and an increasing number after 1945. Many, like the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston changed their names from ones using &quot;modern art&quot; in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical art movement, and much &quot;modern&quot; art ceased to be &quot;contemporary&quot;. The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.

Particular points that have been seen as marking a change in art styles include the end of World War II and the 1960s. There has perhaps been a lack of natural break points since the 1960s, and definitions of what constitutes &quot;contemporary art&quot; in the 2010s vary, and are mostly imprecise. Art from the past 20 years is very likely to be included, and definitions often include art going back to about 1970; &quot;the art of the late 20th and early 21st century&quot;; &quot;both an outgrowth and a rejection of modern art&quot;; &quot;Strictly speaking, the term &#x27;contemporary art&#x27; refers to art made and produced by artists living today&quot;; &quot;Art from the 1960s or [19]70s up until this very minute&quot;; and sometimes further, especially in museum contexts, as museums which form a permanent collection of contemporary art inevitably find this aging. Many use the formulation &quot;Modern and Contemporary Art&quot;, which avoids this problem. Smaller commercial galleries, magazines and other sources may use stricter definitions, perhaps restricting the &quot;contemporary&quot; to work from 2000 onwards. Artists who are still productive after a long career, and ongoing art movements, may present a particular issue; galleries and critics are often reluctant to divide their work between the contemporary and non-contemporary.

Sociologist Nathalie Heinich draws a distinction between modern and contemporary art, describing them as two different paradigms which partially overlap historically. She found that while &quot;modern art&quot; challenges the conventions of representation, &quot;contemporary art&quot; challenges the very notion of an artwork. She regards Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Fountain&quot; (which was made in the 1910s in the midst of the triumph of modern art) as the starting point of contemporary art, which gained momentum after World War II with Gutai&#x27;s performances, Yves Klein&#x27;s monochromes and Rauschenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erased de Kooning Drawing&quot;.

==Themes==

Contemporary artwork is characterised by diversity: diversity of material, of form, of subject matter, and even time periods. It is &quot;distinguished by the very lack of a uniform organizing principle, ideology, or - ism&quot; that is seen in many other art periods and movements. Contemporary art does not have one, single objective or point of view, so it can be contradictory and open-ended. There are nonetheless several common themes that have appeared in contemporary works, such as identity politics, the body, globalization and migration, technology, contemporary society and culture, time and memory, and institutional and political critique.

==Institutions==

The functioning of the art world is dependent on art institutions, ranging from major museums to private galleries, non-profit spaces, art schools and publishers, and the practices of individual artists, curators, writers, collectors, and philanthropists. A major division in the art world is between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, although in recent years the boundaries between for-profit private and non-profit public institutions have become increasingly blurred. Most well-known contemporary art is exhibited by professional artists at commercial contemporary art galleries, by private collectors, art auctions, corporations, publicly funded arts organizations, contemporary art museums or by artists themselves in artist-run spaces. Contemporary artists are supported by grants, awards, and prizes as well as by direct sales of their work. Career artists train at art school or emerge from other fields.

There are close relationships between publicly funded contemporary art organizations and the commercial sector. For instance, in 2005 the book &quot;Understanding International Art Markets and Management&quot; reported that in Britain a handful of dealers represented the artists featured in leading publicly funded contemporary art museums. Commercial organizations include galleries and art fairs.

Corporations have also integrated themselves into the contemporary art world, exhibiting contemporary art within their premises, organizing and sponsoring contemporary art awards, and building up extensive corporate collections. Corporate advertisers frequently use the prestige associated with contemporary art and coolhunting to draw the attention of consumers to luxury goods.

The institutions of art have been criticized for regulating what is designated as contemporary art. Outsider art, for instance, is literally contemporary art, in that it is produced in the present day. However, one critic has argued it is not considered so because the artists are self-taught and are thus assumed to be working outside of an art historical context. Craft activities, such as textile design, are also excluded from the realm of contemporary art, despite large audiences for exhibitions. Art critic Peter Timms has said that attention is drawn to the way that craft objects must subscribe to particular values in order to be admitted to the realm of contemporary art. &quot;A ceramic object that is intended as a subversive comment on the nature of beauty is more likely to fit the definition of contemporary art than one that is simply beautiful.&quot;

==Public attitudes==
Contemporary art can sometimes seem at odds with a public that does not feel that art and its institutions share its values. In Britain, in the 1990s, contemporary art became a part of popular culture, with artists becoming stars, but this did not lead to a hoped-for &quot;cultural utopia&quot;. Some critics like Julian Spalding and Donald Kuspit have suggested that skepticism, even rejection, is a legitimate and reasonable response to much contemporary art. Brian Ashbee in an essay called &quot;Art Bollocks&quot; criticizes &quot;much installation art, photography, conceptual art, video and other practices generally called post-modern&quot; as being too dependent on verbal explanations in the form of theoretical discourse. However, the acceptance of nontraditional art in museums has increased due to changing perspectives on what constitutes an art piece.

==Concerns==

A common concern since the early part of the 20th century has been the question of what constitutes art. In the contemporary period (1970 to now), the concept of avant-garde may come into play in determining what artworks are noticed by galleries, museums, and collectors.

The concerns of contemporary art come in for criticism too. Andrea Rosen has said that some contemporary painters &quot;have absolutely no idea of what it means to be a contemporary artist&quot; and that they &quot;are in it for all the wrong reasons.&quot;

<text>Rambling Syd Rumpo was a folk singer character, played by the English comedian and actor Kenneth Williams, originally in the 1960s BBC Radio comedy series &quot;Round the Horne&quot;.

==History==
The Rambling Syd sketches generally began with a short discourse on the nature of the song, which would inexorably follow. The discourses and the songs involved suggestiveness and double entendre. Rambling Syd was customarily introduced by Kenneth Horne, who would set things up by (for example) inquiring as to the nature and origin of the song. Rambling Syd would usually respond with an &quot;Ello, me dearios&quot;, before launching into the ensuing detailed explanation, which left a great deal to the imagination.

The songs themselves pushed and extended boundaries of sexual suggestiveness, using nonsense (or little-known) words such as &quot;moolies&quot; and &quot;nadgers&quot; in suggestive contexts. Many of the words used by Rambling Syd were invented by the &quot;Round the Horne&quot; scriptwriters Barry Took and Marty Feldman, who wrote the majority of the songs&#x27; lyrics, based upon traditional folk songs. Some were existing words used in a suggestive context, such as &quot;artefacts&quot; (often used in an archaeological context for things such as grave goods) and &quot;nadgers&quot;, which had already appeared in &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

On 3 July 1967, Williams, in the guise of Rambling Syd, recorded a series of the songs before a live audience at Abbey Road Studios. In his diary, Williams wrote that, &quot;the laughter was so intrusive it broke up the rhythm of some of the songs&quot;. One of the producers told Williams that the audience had been given a party before the recording and most were drunk.

This is a lyrical excerpt of &quot;Good King Boroslav&quot;, from a Christmas episode, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, first broadcast on Christmas Eve 1967:

:&quot;Good King Boroslav looked out,&quot;
:&quot;On the night of ,&quot;
:&quot;Saw them round about,&quot;
:&quot;Armed with rubber plungers,&quot;
:&quot;Brightly shone their artefacts,&quot;
:&quot;Red their possets glowing,&quot;
:&quot;He knew not from whence they came, &quot; (switches back into suggestive accent)
:&quot;But &#x27;e knew where they were going!

In 1975, Williams starred with Leslie Phillips, Lance Percival, Miriam Margolyes and others, in the short-lived radio sketch show &quot;Oh, Get On with It&quot;, based on a pilot episode entitled &quot;Get On With It&quot;, which also featured appearances by Rambling Syd.

Sid James portrayed &quot;The Rumpo Kid&quot; in the film &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965) starring alongside Kenneth Williams.
