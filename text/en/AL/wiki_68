<text>Polyploidy is a condition in which the cells of an organism have more than two paired sets of (homologous) chromosomes. Most species whose cells have nuclei (eukaryotes) are diploid, meaning they have two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each of two parents; each set contains the same number of chromosomes, and the chromosomes are joined in pairs of homologous chromosomes. However, some organisms are polyploid. Polyploidy is especially common in plants. Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells, but produce haploid gametes (eggs and sperm) by meiosis. A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes, and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. Males of bees and other Hymenoptera, for example, are monoploid. Unlike animals, plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations. The gametophyte generation is haploid, and produces gametes by mitosis; the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis.

Polyploidy is the result of whole-genome duplication during the evolution of species. It may occur due to abnormal cell division, either during mitosis, or more commonly from the failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis or from the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. In addition, it can be induced in plants and cell cultures by some chemicals: the best known is colchicine, which can result in chromosome doubling, though its use may have other less obvious consequences as well. Oryzalin will also double the existing chromosome content.

Among mammals, a high frequency of polyploid cells is found in organs such as the brain, liver, heart, and bone marrow. It also occurs in the somatic cells of other animals, such as goldfish, salmon, and salamanders. It is common among ferns and flowering plants (see &quot;Hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot;), including both wild and cultivated species. Wheat, for example, after millennia of hybridization and modification by humans, has strains that are diploid (two sets of chromosomes), tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes) with the common name of durum or macaroni wheat, and hexaploid (six sets of chromosomes) with the common name of bread wheat. Many agriculturally important plants of the genus &quot;Brassica&quot; are also tetraploids. Sugarcane can have ploidy levels higher than octaploid.

Polyploidization can be a mechanism of sympatric speciation because polyploids are usually unable to interbreed with their diploid ancestors. An example is the plant &quot;Erythranthe peregrina&quot;. Sequencing confirmed that this species originated from &quot;E. × robertsii&quot;, a sterile triploid hybrid between &quot;E. guttata&quot; and &quot;E. lutea,&quot; both of which have been introduced and naturalised in the United Kingdom. New populations of &quot;E. peregrina&quot; arose on the Scottish mainland and the Orkney Islands via genome duplication from local populations of &quot;E. × robertsii&quot;. Because of a rare genetic mutation, &quot;E. peregrina&quot; is not sterile. 

On the other hand, polyploidization can also be a mechanism for a kind of &#x27;reverse speciation&#x27;, whereby gene flow is enabled following the polyploidy event, even between lineages that previously experienced no gene flow as diploids. This has been detailed at the genomic level in &quot;Arabidopsis arenosa&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis lyrata&quot;. Each of these species experienced independent autopolyploidy events (within-species polyploidy, described below), which then enabled subsequent interspecies gene flow of adaptive alleles, in this case stabilising each young polyploid lineage. Such polyploidy-enabled adaptive introgression may allow polyploids at act as &#x27;allelic sponges&#x27;, whereby they accumulate cryptic genomic variation that may be recruited upon encountering later environmental challenges.

== Terminology ==

=== Types ===
Polyploid types are labeled according to the number of chromosome sets in the nucleus. The letter &quot;x&quot; is used to represent the number of chromosomes in a single set:

*haploid (one set; 1&quot;x&quot;), for example male European fire ants
*diploid (two sets; 2&quot;x&quot;), for example humans
*triploid (three sets; 3&quot;x&quot;), for example sterile saffron crocus, or seedless watermelons, also common in the phylum Tardigrada
*tetraploid (four sets; 4&quot;x&quot;), for example, Plains viscacha rat, Salmonidae fish, the cotton &quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot;
*pentaploid (five sets; 5&quot;x&quot;), for example Kenai Birch (&quot;Betula kenaica&quot;)
*hexaploid (six sets; 6&quot;x&quot;), for example some species of wheat, kiwifruit
*heptaploid or septaploid (seven sets; 7&quot;x&quot;), for example some cultured Siberian sturgeon
*octaploid or octoploid, (eight sets; 8&quot;x&quot;), for example &quot;Acipenser&quot; (genus of sturgeon fish), dahlias
*decaploid (ten sets; 10&quot;x&quot;), for example certain strawberries
*dodecaploid or duodecaploid (twelve sets; 12&quot;x&quot;), for example the plants &quot;Celosia argentea&quot; and &quot;Spartina anglica&quot; or the amphibian &quot;Xenopus ruwenzoriensis&quot;.
*tetratetracontaploid (forty-four sets; 44&quot;x&quot;), for example black mulberry

=== Classification ===

==== Autopolyploidy ====
Autopolyploids are polyploids with multiple chromosome sets derived from a single taxon.

Two examples of natural autopolyploids are the piggyback plant, &quot;Tolmiea menzisii&quot; and the white sturgeon, &quot;Acipenser transmontanum&quot;. Most instances of autopolyploidy result from the fusion of unreduced (2&quot;n&quot;) gametes, which results in either triploid (&quot;n&quot; + 2&quot;n&quot; = 3&quot;n&quot;) or tetraploid (2&quot;n&quot; + 2&quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;n&quot;) offspring. Triploid offspring are typically sterile (as in the phenomenon of triploid block), but in some cases they may produce high proportions of unreduced gametes and thus aid the formation of tetraploids. This pathway to tetraploidy is referred to as the &quot;triploid bridge&quot;. Triploids may also persist through asexual reproduction. In fact, stable autotriploidy in plants is often associated with apomictic mating systems. In agricultural systems, autotriploidy can result in seedlessness, as in watermelons and bananas. Triploidy is also utilized in salmon and trout farming to induce sterility.

Rarely, autopolyploids arise from spontaneous, somatic genome doubling, which has been observed in apple (&quot;Malus domesticus&quot;) bud sports. This is also the most common pathway of artificially induced polyploidy, where methods such as protoplast fusion or treatment with colchicine, oryzalin or mitotic inhibitors are used to disrupt normal mitotic division, which results in the production of polyploid cells. This process can be useful in plant breeding, especially when attempting to introgress germplasm across ploidal levels.

Autopolyploids possess at least three homologous chromosome sets, which can lead to high rates of multivalent pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, also known as neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of aneuploid gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring bivalent pairing during meiosis. Rapid adaptive evolution of the meiotic machinery, resulting in reduced levels of multivalents (and therefore stable autopolyploid meiosis) has been documented in &quot;Arabidopsis arenosa&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis lyrata&quot;, with specific adaptive alleles of these species shared between only the evolved polyploids. 

The high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or allopolyploid, these categories represent the ends of a spectrum of divergence between parental subgenomes. Polyploids that fall between these two extremes, which are often referred to as segmental allopolyploids, may display intermediate levels of polysomic inheritance that vary by locus.

About half of all polyploids are thought to be the result of autopolyploidy, although many factors make this proportion hard to estimate.

==== Allopolyploidy ====
Allopolyploids or amphipolyploids or heteropolyploids are polyploids with chromosomes derived from two or more diverged taxa.

As in autopolyploidy, this primarily occurs through the fusion of unreduced (2&quot;n&quot;) gametes, which can take place before or after hybridization. In the former case, unreduced gametes from each diploid taxon – or reduced gametes from two autotetraploid taxa – combine to form allopolyploid offspring. In the latter case, one or more diploid F1 hybrids produce unreduced gametes that fuse to form allopolyploid progeny. Hybridization followed by genome duplication may be a more common path to allopolyploidy because F1 hybrids between taxa often have relatively high rates of unreduced gamete formation – divergence between the genomes of the two taxa result in abnormal pairing between homoeologous chromosomes or nondisjunction during meiosis. In this case, allopolyploidy can actually restore normal, bivalent meiotic pairing by providing each homoeologous chromosome with its own homologue. If divergence between homoeologous chromosomes is even across the two subgenomes, this can theoretically result in rapid restoration of bivalent pairing and disomic inheritance following allopolyploidization. However multivalent pairing is common in many recently formed allopolyploids, so it is likely that the majority of meiotic stabilization occurs gradually through selection.

Because pairing between homoeologous chromosomes is rare in established allopolyploids, they may benefit from fixed heterozygosity of homoeologous alleles. In certain cases, such heterozygosity can have beneficial heterotic effects, either in terms of fitness in natural contexts or desirable traits in agricultural contexts. This could partially explain the prevalence of allopolyploidy among crop species. Both bread wheat and triticale are examples of an allopolyploids with six chromosome sets. Cotton, peanut, and quinoa are allotetraploids with multiple origins. In Brassicaceous crops, the Triangle of U describes the relationships between the three common diploid Brassicas (&quot;B. oleracea, B. rapa,&quot; and &quot;B. nigra&quot;) and three allotetraploids (&quot;B. napus, B. juncea,&quot; and &quot;B. carinata&quot;) derived from hybridization among the diploid species. A similar relationship exists between three diploid species of &quot;Tragopogon&quot; (&quot;T. dubius, T. pratensis,&quot; and &quot;T. porrifolius&quot;) and two allotetraploid species (&quot;T. mirus&quot; and &quot;T. miscellus&quot;). Complex patterns of allopolyploid evolution have also been observed in animals, as in the frog genus &quot;Xenopus.&quot;

==== Aneuploid ====

Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or over-represented are said to be aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning &quot;not&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;fold&quot;). Aneuploidy refers to a numerical change in part of the chromosome set, whereas polyploidy refers to a numerical change in the whole set of chromosomes.

==== Endopolyploidy ====
Polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid, such as human muscle tissues. This is known as endopolyploidy. Species whose cells do not have nuclei, that is, prokaryotes, may be polyploid, as seen in the large bacterium &quot;Epulopiscium fishelsoni&quot;. Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell.

==== Monoploid ====

A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. The more general term for such organisms is haploid.

=== Temporal terms ===

==== Neopolyploidy ====
A polyploid that is newly formed.

==== Mesopolyploidy ====
That has become polyploid in more recent history; it is not as new as a neopolyploid and not as old as a paleopolyploid. It is a middle aged polyploid. Often this refers to whole genome duplication followed by intermediate levels of diploidization.

==== Paleopolyploidy ====

Ancient genome duplications probably occurred in the evolutionary history of all life. Duplication events that occurred long ago in the history of various evolutionary lineages can be difficult to detect because of subsequent diploidization (such that a polyploid starts to behave cytogenetically as a diploid over time) as mutations and gene translations gradually make one copy of each chromosome unlike the other copy. Over time, it is also common for duplicated copies of genes to accumulate mutations and become inactive pseudogenes.

In many cases, these events can be inferred only through comparing sequenced genomes. Examples of unexpected but recently confirmed ancient genome duplications include baker&#x27;s yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), mustard weed/thale cress (&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;), rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;), and two rounds of whole genome duplication (the 2R hypothesis) in an early evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates (which includes the human lineage) and another near the origin of the teleost fishes. Angiosperms (flowering plants) have paleopolyploidy in their ancestry. All eukaryotes probably have experienced a polyploidy event at some point in their evolutionary history.

=== Other similar terms ===

==== Karyotype ====

A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome complement of a eukaryote species. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytology and, more specifically, cytogenetics.

Although the replication and transcription of DNA is highly standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are highly variable between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization despite being constructed out of the same macromolecules. In some cases, there is even significant variation within species. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in what might be called evolutionary cytology.

==== Homoeologous chromosomes ====

Homoeologous chromosomes are those brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. For example, durum wheat is the result of the inter-species hybridization of two diploid grass species &quot;Triticum urartu&quot; and &quot;Aegilops speltoides&quot;. Both diploid ancestors had two sets of 7 chromosomes, which were similar in terms of size and genes contained on them. Durum wheat contains a hybrid genome with two sets of chromosomes derived from &quot;Triticum urartu&quot; and two sets of chromosomes derived from &quot;Aegilops speltoides&quot;. Each chromosome pair derived from the &quot;Triticum urartu&quot; parent is homoeologous to the opposite chromosome pair derived from the &quot;Aegilops speltoides&quot; parent, though each chromosome pair unto itself is homologous.

== Examples ==

===Animals===
Examples in animals are more common in non-vertebrates such as flatworms, leeches, and brine shrimp. Within vertebrates, examples of stable polyploidy include the salmonids and many cyprinids (i.e. carp). Some fish have as many as 400 chromosomes. Polyploidy also occurs commonly in amphibians; for example the biomedically important genus &quot;Xenopus&quot; contains many different species with as many as 12 sets of chromosomes (dodecaploid). Polyploid lizards are also quite common. Most are sterile and reproduce by parthenogenesis; others, like &quot;Liolaemus chiliensis&quot;, maintain sexual reproduction. Polyploid mole salamanders (mostly triploids) are all female and reproduce by kleptogenesis, &quot;stealing&quot; spermatophores from diploid males of related species to trigger egg development but not incorporating the males&#x27; DNA into the offspring.

While some tissues of mammals, such as parenchymal liver cells, are polyploid, rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death. An octodontid rodent of Argentina&#x27;s harsh desert regions, known as the plains viscacha rat (&quot;Tympanoctomys barrerae&quot;) has been reported as an exception to this &#x27;rule&#x27;. However, careful analysis using chromosome paints shows that there are only two copies of each chromosome in &quot;T. barrerae&quot;, not the four expected if it were truly a tetraploid. This rodent is not a rat, but kin to guinea pigs and chinchillas. Its &quot;new&quot; diploid (2&quot;n&quot;) number is 102 and so its cells are roughly twice normal size. Its closest living relation is &quot;Octomys mimax&quot;, the Andean Viscacha-Rat of the same family, whose 2&quot;n&quot; = 56. It was therefore surmised that an &quot;Octomys&quot;-like ancestor produced tetraploid (i.e., 2&quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;x&quot; = 112) offspring that were, by virtue of their doubled chromosomes, reproductively isolated from their parents.

Polyploidy was induced in fish by Har Swarup (1956) using a cold-shock treatment of the eggs close to the time of fertilization, which produced triploid embryos that successfully matured. Cold or heat shock has also been shown to result in unreduced amphibian gametes, though this occurs more commonly in eggs than in sperm. John Gurdon (1958) transplanted intact nuclei from somatic cells to produce diploid eggs in the frog, &quot;Xenopus&quot; (an extension of the work of Briggs and King in 1952) that were able to develop to the tadpole stage. The British scientist J. B. S. Haldane hailed the work for its potential medical applications and, in describing the results, became one of the first to use the word &quot;clone&quot; in reference to animals. Later work by Shinya Yamanaka showed how mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, extending the possibilities to non-stem cells. Gurdon and Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this work.

==== Humans ====

True polyploidy rarely occurs in humans, although polyploid cells occur in highly differentiated tissue, such as liver parenchyma, heart muscle, placenta and in bone marrow. Aneuploidy is more common.

Polyploidy occurs in humans in the form of triploidy, with 69 chromosomes (sometimes called 69, XXX), and tetraploidy with 92 chromosomes (sometimes called 92, XXXX). Triploidy, usually due to polyspermy, occurs in about 2–3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages. The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as a miscarriage; those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases, survival past birth may be extended if there is mixoploidy with both a diploid and a triploid cell population present. There has been one report of a child surviving to the age of seven months with complete triploidy syndrome. He failed to exhibit normal mental or physical neonatal development, and died from a &quot;Pneumocystis carinii&quot; infection, which indicates a weak immune system.

Triploidy may be the result of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by reduplication of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases less than weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.

Complete tetraploidy is more rarely diagnosed than triploidy, but is observed in 1–2% of early miscarriages. However, some tetraploid cells are commonly found in chromosome analysis at prenatal diagnosis and these are generally considered &#x27;harmless&#x27;. It is not clear whether these tetraploid cells simply tend to arise during &quot;in vitro&quot; cell culture or whether they are also present in placental cells &quot;in vivo&quot;. There are, at any rate, very few clinical reports of fetuses/infants diagnosed with tetraploidy mosaicism.

Mixoploidy is quite commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and includes haploid/diploid as well as diploid/tetraploid mixed cell populations. It is unknown whether these embryos fail to implant and are therefore rarely detected in ongoing pregnancies or if there is simply a selective process favoring the diploid cells.

==== Fish ====
A polyploidy event occurred within the stem lineage of the teleost fish.

=== Plants ===
Polyploidy is frequent in plants, some estimates suggesting that 30–80% of living plant species are polyploid, and many lineages show evidence of ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) in their genomes. Huge explosions in angiosperm species diversity appear to have coincided with the timing of ancient genome duplications shared by many species. It has been established that 15% of angiosperm and 31% of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase.

Polyploid plants can arise spontaneously in nature by several mechanisms, including meiotic or mitotic failures, and fusion of unreduced (2&quot;n&quot;) gametes. Both autopolyploids (e.g. potato) and allopolyploids (such as canola, wheat and cotton) can be found among both wild and domesticated plant species.

Most polyploids display novel variation or morphologies relative to their parental species, that may contribute to the processes of speciation and eco-niche exploitation. The mechanisms leading to novel variation in newly formed allopolyploids may include gene dosage effects (resulting from more numerous copies of genome content), the reunion of divergent gene regulatory hierarchies, chromosomal rearrangements, and epigenetic remodeling, all of which affect gene content and/or expression levels. Many of these rapid changes may contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation. However, seed generated from interploidy crosses, such as between polyploids and their parent species, usually have aberrant endosperm development which impairs their viability, thus contributing to polyploid speciation. Polyploids may also interbreed with diploids and produce polyploid seeds, as observed in the agamic complexes of &quot;Crepis&quot;.

Some plants are triploid. As meiosis is disturbed, these plants are sterile, with all plants having the same genetic constitution: Among them, the exclusively vegetatively propagated saffron crocus (&quot;Crocus sativus&quot;). Also, the extremely rare Tasmanian shrub &quot;Lomatia tasmanica&quot; is a triploid sterile species.

There are few naturally occurring polyploid conifers. One example is the Coast Redwood &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;, which is a hexaploid (6&quot;x&quot;) with 66 chromosomes (2&quot;n&quot; = 6&quot;x&quot; = 66), although the origin is unclear.

Aquatic plants, especially the Monocotyledons, include a large number of polyploids.

==== Crops ====
The induction of polyploidy is a common technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, triticale is the hybrid of wheat (&quot;Triticum turgidum&quot;) and rye (&quot;Secale cereale&quot;). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale.

In some situations, polyploid crops are preferred because they are sterile. For example, many seedless fruit varieties are seedless as a result of polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques, such as grafting.

Polyploidy in crop plants is most commonly induced by treating seeds with the chemical colchicine.

===== Examples =====

* Triploid crops: some apple varieties (such as Belle de Boskoop, Jonagold, Mutsu, Ribston Pippin), banana, citrus, ginger, watermelon, saffron crocus, white pulp of coconut
* Tetraploid crops: very few apple varieties, durum or macaroni wheat, cotton, potato, canola/rapeseed, leek, tobacco, peanut, kinnow, Pelargonium
* Hexaploid crops: chrysanthemum, bread wheat, triticale, oat, kiwifruit
* Octaploid crops: strawberry, dahlia, pansies, sugar cane, oca (&quot;Oxalis tuberosa&quot;)
* Dodecaploid crops: some sugar cane hybrids

Some crops are found in a variety of ploidies: tulips and lilies are commonly found as both diploid and triploid; daylilies (&quot;Hemerocallis&quot; cultivars) are available as either diploid or tetraploid; apples and kinnow mandarins can be diploid, triploid, or tetraploid.

=== Fungi ===

Besides plants and animals, the evolutionary history of various fungal species is dotted by past and recent whole-genome duplication events (see Albertin and Marullo 2012 for review). Several examples of polyploids are known:
*autopolyploid: the aquatic fungi of genus &quot;Allomyces&quot;, some &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; strains used in bakery, etc.
*allopolyploid: the widespread &quot;Cyathus stercoreus&quot;, the allotetraploid lager yeast &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, the allotriploid wine spoilage yeast &quot;Dekkera bruxellensis&quot;, etc.
*paleopolyploid: the human pathogen &quot;Rhizopus oryzae&quot;, the genus &quot;Saccharomyces&quot;, etc.

In addition, polyploidy is frequently associated with hybridization and reticulate evolution that appear to be highly prevalent in several fungal taxa. Indeed, homoploid speciation (hybrid speciation without a change in chromosome number) has been evidenced for some fungal species (such as the basidiomycota &quot;Microbotryum violaceum&quot;).
As for plants and animals, fungal hybrids and polyploids display structural and functional modifications compared to their progenitors and diploid counterparts. In particular, the structural and functional outcomes of polyploid &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; genomes strikingly reflect the evolutionary fate of plant polyploid ones. Large chromosomal rearrangements leading to chimeric chromosomes have been described, as well as more punctual genetic modifications such as gene loss. The homoealleles of the allotetraploid yeast &quot;S. pastorianus&quot; show unequal contribution to the transcriptome. Phenotypic diversification is also observed following polyploidization and/or hybridization in fungi, producing the fuel for natural selection and subsequent adaptation and speciation.

=== Chromalveolata ===
Other eukaryotic taxa have experienced one or more polyploidization events during their evolutionary history (see Albertin and Marullo, 2012 for review). The oomycetes, which are non-true fungi members, contain several examples of paleopolyploid and polyploid species, such as within the genus &quot;Phytophthora&quot;. Some species of brown algae (Fucales, Laminariales and diatoms) contain apparent polyploid genomes. In the Alveolata group, the remarkable species &quot;Paramecium tetraurelia&quot; underwent three successive rounds of whole-genome duplication and established itself as a major model for paleopolyploid studies.

=== Bacteria ===

Each &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; bacterium contains 4-8 copies of its chromosome. Exposure of &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; to X-ray irradiation or desiccation can shatter its genomes into hundred of short random fragments. Nevertheless, &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; is highly resistant to such exposures. The mechanism by which the genome is accurately restored involves RecA-mediated homologous recombination and a process referred to as extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA).

&quot;Azotobacter vinelandii&quot; can contain up to 80 chromosome copies per cell. However this is only observed in fast growing cultures, whereas cultures grown in synthetic minimal media are not polyploid.

===Archaea===

The archaeon &quot;Halobacterium salinarium&quot; is polyploid and, like &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, is highly resistant to X-ray irradiation and desiccation, conditions that induce DNA double-strand breaks. Although chromosomes are shattered into many fragments, complete chromosomes can be regenerated by making use of overlapping fragments. The mechanism employs single-stranded DNA binding protein and is likely homologous recombinational repair.

<text>Parma Calcio 1913 () is an Italian professional football club based in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, which competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian league system, following promotion from Serie B in the 2023–24 season.

&quot;Parma Football Club&quot; was originally founded in December 1913, while the current society dates back to 2015. The team has been playing its home matches at the 27,906-seat Stadio Ennio Tardini, often referred to as simply &quot;Il Tardini&quot;, since 1923.

Financed by Calisto Tanzi, the club won eight trophies between 1992 and 2002, a period in which it achieved its best ever league finish as runners-up in the 1996–97 season. The club has won three Coppa Italia, one Supercoppa Italiana, two UEFA Cups, one European Super Cup and one UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Financial troubles were brought about in late 2003 by the Parmalat scandal which caused the parent company to collapse and resulted in the club operating in controlled administration until January 2007. The club was declared bankrupt in 2015 and refounded in the Serie D, but secured a record three straight promotions to return to the top flight in 2018.

==History==
===Early years (1913–1968)===

The club was founded in July 1913 as Verdi Foot Ball Club in honour of the centenary of famous opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, who was born in the province of Parma. It adopted yellow and blue as its colours.

In December of the same year, Parma Foot Ball Club was formed from many of the original club&#x27;s players and began wearing white shirts emblazoned with a black cross. Parma began playing league football during the 1919–20 season after the end of World War I. Construction of a stadium, the Stadio Ennio Tardini, began two years later. Parma became a founder member of Serie B after finishing as runners-up in the Prima Divisione in the 1928–29 season. The club would remain in Serie B for three years before being relegated and changing its name to Associazione Sportiva Parma in 1930. In the 1935–36 season, Parma became a founding member of Serie C, where the club stayed until winning promotion back to Serie B in 1943. Italian football was then brought to a halt as the Second World War intensified, although the team did make an appearance in the Campianto Alta Italia in 1944.
Following the restart of organised football, Parma spent three years in Serie B, then split into two regional divisions, before again being relegated in 1948–49 to Serie C. The side would spend another five seasons in Serie C before an eleven-year spell in Serie B that included the achievement of ninth position in 1954–55, a club record at that time. This was an era in which the club&#x27;s players generally held down other jobs or were still in education and when the town&#x27;s amateur rugby union and volleyball sides, Rugby Parma F.C. 1931 and Ferrovieri Parma, proved more popular among the more privileged. Parma made its debut in European competition during the 1960–61 season, defeating Swiss side AC Bellinzona in the Coppa delle Alpi, but relegation to Serie C followed in 1964–65 season. Parma spent just one season in Serie C before a second successive relegation, this time to Serie D, in 1966.

===Rebirth and improvement (1968–1989)===
The club was in turmoil and was ordered into liquidation by the Court of Parma in 1968, changing its name to Parma Football Club that year. In 1969, another local team, Associazione Calcio Parmense, won promotion to Serie D. On 1 January 1970, A.C. Parmense adopted the sporting licence of the liquidated club which had been formed in 1913. This meant that it had the right to use the &quot;Crociata&quot; shirts, the badge and the city&#x27;s name. This brought about a change of luck in both financial and sporting terms, as the side was crowned Serie D champions and spent three years in Serie C before promotion to Serie B; however, it was a short stay. The team was relegated back to Serie C in its second season in the division. A return to Serie B did not materialise until the end of the 1970s and the club again lasted only one season in the second division of Italian football.
Under the management of Cesare Maldini, Parma once again returned to Serie B after winning its division in 1984 with victory on the final day over Sanremo; Juventus-bound Stefano Pioli scored the only goal of the game. The Ducali again only spent a year in Serie B, finishing third from bottom and succumbing to relegation as a consequence. Arrigo Sacchi did, however, manage to return the club to Serie B in 1986 after a single season in the third tier. The side enjoyed good success that season in missing out on promotion to Italy&#x27;s top tier by just three points and eliminating A.C. Milan from the Coppa Italia, a result that convinced owner Silvio Berlusconi to hire Sacchi as the new manager of the &quot;Rossoneri&quot;. Sacchi&#x27;s replacement, Zdeněk Zeman, was fired after just seven matches and replaced by Giampieri Vitali, who secured two consecutive mid-table finishes.

===Success and insolvency (1989–2004)===
Nevio Scala was appointed as head coach in 1989. Scala&#x27;s Parma secured a historic promotion in 1990 to Serie A with a 2–0 Derby dell&#x27;Enza win over Reggiana. Investment from parent company Parmalat helped to improve the team&#x27;s fortunes and the club made its debut in UEFA competition in 1991. Scala led the club to its first four major honours. The first of these was the Coppa Italia in 1991–92, beating Juventus 2–1 over two legs. The following year came the first international triumph in a 3–1 victory in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup over Belgian side Antwerp at Wembley. The next season, the side was successful in the European Super Cup, overcoming Milan 2–1 on aggregate, but lost the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final 1–0 to Arsenal. Scala&#x27;s final success with Parma was in another two-legged final against Juventus: Dino Baggio scored twice to give Parma a 2–1 aggregate win, but Juventus exacted revenge in the Coppa Italia final. Replaced by Carlo Ancelotti, Scala departed in 1996 and was a popular coach for the trophies he won and because the team played attractive football in the tradition of the club.
Ancelotti overhauled the team and guided it to a record second place in 1997. Parma consequently made its debut in the UEFA Champions League the following year. Alberto Malesani was installed as coach in 1998 and the club completed a rare cup double in his first season, winning the Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina on the away goals rule and the UEFA Cup against Marseille at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow with a 3–0 victory before 1999 Supercoppa Italiana victory over league champions Milan followed in August 1999. In 2000, Hernán Crespo was sold to Lazio for a world record transfer fee and Malesani departed.

Under replacement Renzo Ulivieri, the club lost the Coppa Italia final to Fiorentina. Under Pietro Carmignani in 2002, Parma won the third Coppa Italia trophy against Juventus (but would slip to defeat in the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana) and finished outside the top six for the first time since promotion in 1990. This success earned it a tag as one of the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;. In April 2004, the club was declared insolvent following the financial meltdown of Parmalat and the club remained in special administration for three years.

===Rebirth and another bankruptcy (2004–2015)===
The club re-formed as Parma Football Club SpA in June 2004 (as a subsidiary of being liquidated Parma AC SpA) and the 2004–05 season saw Parma plummet to its lowest finish in Serie A – despite a second consecutive 23-goal haul from Gilardino, who was then sold for €25 million – as managers came and went. Parma ended the following season, its first without European competition since 1991, in tenth, but returned in 2006 after the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal.
On 24 January 2007, Tommaso Ghirardi bought the club out of administration and became the owner and president of the club. Manager Claudio Ranieri helped the team avoid relegation to Serie B on the final day of the 2006–07 season following his February appointment. However, under a succession of managers, Parma&#x27;s battle with relegation the following year was not successful, consigning the club to Serie B after 18 years in the top flight.

Francesco Guidolin won promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt with a second-place finish and led the side to eighth on its return to Serie A in 2009–10, narrowly missing out on qualification for the UEFA Europa League before leaving for Udinese. In May 2010, Guidolin swapped jobs with Pasquale Marino, who was sacked by Ghirardi in April 2011 when Parma was caught in another relegation dogfight. Under Marino&#x27;s replacement, Franco Colomba, Parma escaped the threat of relegation with two games to spare. In January 2012, Colomba was replaced by Roberto Donadoni following a winless run that culminated in a 5–0 loss to Inter Milan and the new coach led the team to eighth position in a Serie A club record seven-match winning run.

In 2014, Donadoni guided Parma to sixth in Serie A and a third consecutive top ten finish, but a return to Europe in the Europa League for the first time since 2007 was barred due to the late payment of income tax on salaries, not qualifying for a UEFA license, for which the club would also be docked points during the 2014–15 Serie A season. Financial troubles precipitated a succession of ownership changes and the club&#x27;s eventual bankruptcy in March 2015 with total liabilities of €218 million, including €63m unpaid salaries. The club was allowed to finish the season but finished bottom of the league in 20th place. Administrators Angelo Anedda and Alberto Guiotto were forced to put some trophies to sell in an auction in a desperate attempt to raise money to cover the debt. These included: three Coppa Italia won in 1992, 1999 and 2002, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup from 1993, the 1994 UEFA Super Cup, two UEFA Cup of 1995 and 1999 and the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana.

===Another rebirth (2015–present)===
The re-founded club, S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913, was formed in July 2015, taking its name from the year of foundation of the predecessor club and securing a place in the 2015–16 Serie D under article 52 of N.O.I.F. as the representative of Parma. Ex-head coach Nevio Scala was appointed as president and former player Luigi Apolloni was chosen as head coach. In the club&#x27;s first season, it sold over 9,000 season tickets, more than doubling the Serie D record. Parma achieved promotion from Serie D into professional football league Lega Pro with three games to spare following a 2–1 win against Delta Rovigo, ending the season in first place with 94 points from 38 games, and an unbeaten run of 28 victories and 10 draws.

Parma ended the 2016–17 Lega Pro season in second place of Group B, but were promoted to Serie B after a 2–0 win over Alessandria in the promotion play-off final.

On 18 May 2018, Parma achieved a third promotion in three seasons, becoming the first Italian football club to achieve this, having finished the 2017–18 Serie B season second behind champions Empoli and level on points with Frosinone, but achieving automatic promotion due to a better head-to-head record, thus making a comeback to the top flight for the next season in 2018–19 Serie A just three seasons after their bankruptcy relegation to Serie D.

On 23 July 2018, Parma were handed a 5 point deduction for the 2018–19 Serie A season, following text messages from Parma player Emanuele Calaio &quot;eliciting a reduced effort&quot; from two players of Spezia (Filippo De Col and Claudio Terzi) during the 2017–18 season, a match Parma won 2–0 to secure promotion. On 9 August, Parma had the 5-point deduction expunged. In the club&#x27;s first season back in Serie A, they managed to achieve a 14th placed finish on the table, three points above the relegation zone.

For the 2019–20 Serie A season, Parma finished in 11th place with 49 points. Dejan Kulusevski, playing for Parma on loan from Atalanta, won the Best Young Player in Serie A award.

Ahead of the 2020–21 Serie A season, manager Roberto D&#x27;Aversa was sacked on 23 August 2020 and replaced by Fabio Liverani. Liverani would only last until 7 January 2021, himself being replaced by his predecessor D&#x27;Aversa. Parma finished the season in bottom place, managing just three wins from 38 games and were relegated to Serie B. In September 2020, Parma was purchased by American Kyle Krause.

Enzo Maresca was appointed as the new head coach for the 2021–22 Serie B season. Maresca was sacked on 23 November 2021 and replaced by Giuseppe Iachini the same day. Parma finished the season in 12th place. Argentinian attacher Franco Vázquez was the joint second highest scorer in the league with 14 goals. Fabio Pecchia took over as coach for the 2022–23 Serie B season. Parma was promoted to Serie A in the following season.

==Colours and badge==
Originally, the club wore blue and yellow chequered shirts in honour of the city&#x27;s traditional colours, which date back to 1545 when the Duchy of Parma was established, but white shirts with a black cross on the chest were introduced after the First World War, drawing inspiration from Juventus&#x27; colours, following a name change. White continued to be worn as the main colour of the home kits for much of the remainder of the century, although often complemented with yellow, blue or both, rather than black. The club did, however, experiment in the 1950s with blue shirts and blue and yellow striped shirts. The cross shirts were restored and worn until bankruptcy in 1968, when white shirts with off-centre blue and yellow vertical bands were worn, but the cross returned from 1970 until 1983 when a yellow and blue-sleeved white shirt was introduced and used for 8 years.

After decades in the lower divisions, Parma was promoted to Serie A in 1990, where the side immediately became a major force in the battle for major trophies, on many notable occasions in direct opposition to Juventus, who would become fierce rivals of Parma&#x27;s. This rivalry and the influence of Parmalat led to the demotion of the white shirts to the away kit, so the side wore yellow and blue hooped shirts at home for six seasons between 1998 and 2004, and navy blue shirts often worn as third choice in this period. This was a time of great success for the club, thus the shirts became synonymous with Parma, often still called the &quot;Gialloblù&quot; (Yellow and Blues) today, despite a recent reversion to the traditional white shirts emblazoned with a cross caused by parent company Parmalat&#x27;s collapse and the clubs subsequent re-foundation as Parma Football Club. Yellow and blue were Parma&#x27;s traditional change colours, used in various combinations from 2004 to 2015, such as vertical stripes, hoops, crosses or as solid colour designs.

Parma&#x27;s logo changed in 2005 to reflect the name change from Parma A.C. to Parma F.C., but the logo otherwise remained the same, encompassing the city colours of yellow and blue and the club&#x27;s traditional black cross set on a white background, and has not changed much in years, although it was dramatically overhauled to feature a prancing bull for one season in 2000–01 before it was criticised and discontinued in favour of the old badge. A new badge with broadly similar features was introduced for the 2014–15 season following the use of a commemorative centenary badge for the 2013–14 campaign. The newly formed club in 2015 adopted a new logo before acquiring the rights to a number of legacy items for €250,000 a year later.

=== Kit manufacturers and sponsors ===
==Grounds==
Parma initially had no permanent home and used the &quot;Piazza d&#x27;Armi&quot;, where two wooden posts constituted the frame of each goal. In December 1914, the club began to use land between the Via Emilia, the Eridania refinery and the Ferraguti factory, but it was sold, so the club returned to the &quot;Piazza d&#x27;Armi&quot; before transferring to the &quot;Tre Pioppi&quot;, the first fenced-off pitch in the city. Parma moved into the Stadio Ennio Tardini in 1923 and remains there today, although the stadium saw drastic change from the vision of Ennio Tardini, under whose auspices the stadium was to be built, but who died before completion of the venue. Much of the renovation took place after the club&#x27;s first promotion to Serie A at the start of the 1990s.

Since 1996, the first team has trained and played friendly matches at the Centro Sportivo di Collecchio in Collecchio, which is located 15 kilometres to the south-west of the stadium. Parma&#x27;s youth teams also play their home matches in the same complex. Until 2015, younger youth teams trained at Campi Stuard but now train at Collechio. In 2018, the refounded Parma Calcio 1913 acquired the centre from the administrator of Eventi Sportivi S.p.A., the parent company of Parma F.C., and the former owner of the centre, for about €3 million.

==Support==

The supporters of Parma are seen as placid fans. Traditionally, they have been seen as fans who enjoy the spectacle of football and are less partisan, although they have been more characterised by impatience of late. The supporters were praised for their loyalty after the club sold more season tickets in 2015 when playing in Serie D than the previous year in Serie A following bankruptcy. In Northeast Italy, the team is the fifth best supported, behind Inter Milan, Juventus, Milan and Bologna, the first three of which are not based in that region. They are represented by three main groups: &quot;il Centro di Coordinamento dei Parma Club&quot; (which represents most of the fanbase), &quot;l&#x27;Associazione Petitot&quot; and the club&#x27;s ultras, &quot;Boys Parma&quot;, which was established on 3 August 1977 by young fans wanting to split from the Centro di Coordinamento and to encourage meetings with opposition fans. The Boys Parma occupy the northern end of the home stadium, &quot;La Curva Nord&quot;, directly opposite to where the away fans sit in the south stand. In 2008, the Curva Nord was renamed in honour of Boys Parma 1977 member Matteo Bagnaresi, who died when he was run over on the way to the Tardini by a coach which was carrying the opposition Juventus fans. In a not uncommon practice, the number 12 shirt has been reserved for the Parma fans, meaning no player is registered to play with that number on his kit for the club. The implication is that the supporters, particularly those of the famous Curva Nord, are the twelfth man. The last player to be registered with the number was Gabriele Giroli for the 2002–03 season. Parma&#x27;s club anthem is &quot;Il grido di battaglia&quot;, which means &quot;The Battle Cry&quot;.

===Rivalries===

Parma maintains rivalries with regional and national clubs; some of these are keenly fought local derbies. &quot;Derby dell&#x27;Enza&quot; opponents Reggiana are the club&#x27;s bitterest rivals. The ill-feeling with Reggiana comes from a traditional city rivalry between Parma and Reggio Emilia. Parma contests the &quot;Derby dell&#x27;Emilia&quot; with Bologna. Bologna and Parma are Emilia-Romagna&#x27;s two most decorated clubs, winning the region&#x27;s only domestic titles: 7 Serie A titles and 5 Coppe Italia. Two other local derbies are the &quot;Derby dei Ducati&quot;, which is contested with neighbours Modena, and the &quot;Derby del Ducato&quot;, which is played against Piacenza. Despite their relative obscurity, Lombardian side Cremonese and Tuscan outfit Carrarese, to Parma&#x27;s north and south, respectively, are both seen as rivals too.

Juventus is considered a great rival of Parma largely due to their recent duels, which include Parma&#x27;s 1995 UEFA Cup victory, its first and third Coppa Italia triumphs, Supercoppa Italiana defeats in 1995 and 2002, and its 1995 domestic cup final defeat to &quot;The Old Lady&quot;. These six matches comprise nearly half of the fourteen major finals Parma has participated in. Ironically, Parma&#x27;s colours have their origins in those Juventus wears, and the switch from white and black to a yellow and blue home kit in the late 1990s took place in order to distance and distinguish Parma from Juventus. Parma maintain keenly fought rivalries with Vicenza and Genoa.

In Italy, it is common for clubs to be twinned in an arrangement called &quot;gemellaggi&quot;. This is a practice uncommon elsewhere. Parma enjoy amicable relations with Empoli in an arrangement that dates back to a game played in foggy conditions in 1984 that ended in the Parma fans congratulating those of Empoli on its win when the full-time whistle was blown without the &quot;Azzurri&quot; fans&#x27; knowledge. Perhaps a more current bond is felt towards the fans of Sampdoria.

==Ownership and finances==
In 1991, the club was bought by multinational Italian dairy and food corporation Parmalat. This was the platform for success on the pitch but the club eventually succumbed to administration in 2004 due to Parmalat&#x27;s massive bankruptcy with debts of $20 billion and fraudulent activity at Parmalat worth over €10 billion and a €167 million net loss by the club in 2003. On 24 January 2007, engineering entrepreneur Tommaso Ghirardi bought the club after three years of administration for $39 million and incorporated Eventi Sportivi as a holding company owning 100% of the club&#x27;s shares of €20 million nominal value. Eventi Sportivi Srl (later S.p.A.), at first had a share capital of just €3 million, with Banca Monte Parma, owned 10% of the shares as minority. By 21 January 2009, Ghirardi&#x27;s ownership of Eventi Sportivi was 75% with Banca Monte Parma holding 10% and Marco Ferrari, former vice-president Diego Penocchio and Penocchio&#x27;s company Brixia Incipit each owning 5%. In July 2011, Ghirardi sold to both Alberto Rossi and Alberto Volpi 5% each of Eventi Sportivi. On 29 February 2014, Energy T.I. Group bought 10% of the shares in the club from Eventi Sportivi.
On 19 December 2014 and as a result of a ruling which barred the club from a first European campaign under Tommaso Ghirardi, Ghirardi sold his 66.55% controlling stake in Eventi Sportivi to Dastraso Holding Ltd, a company based in Cyprus and controlled by Rezart Taçi for €1, at which point the club was $200 million in debt. The club became the third Serie A club to become foreign-owned as a result and Albanian Emir Kodra was installed as president.

In February 2015, Taci sold his stake to Giampietro Manenti for the price he bought it, €1, less than two months after buying it, at which point salaries at the financially stricken club had not been paid since the previous summer. With Parma bottom of Serie A, Manenti was arrested in March 2015 on allegations of money laundering and his involvement in a credit card fraud ring, imperilling the already precarious situation as the club was plunged further into debt.

On 19 March 2015, the club was declared bankrupt with a total liabilities of €218 million (including unpaid wages of €63 million). On 22 April 2015, the intermediate holding company of Parma, Eventi Sportivi SpA, was also declared bankruptcy by the Tribunal of Parma. The club was then declared legally bankrupt on 22 June 2015 after no new investors willing to refurbish €22.6 million debt in order to trigger Comma 3 of Article 52 of N.O.I.F. to allow the club to remain in Serie B. Other debts of the club were either waived by the footballers or settled by the administrator. New investor was not required to repay the subordinated debt and bank debt of the old company. The medals of Parma, which was owned by the company, as well as Centro Sportivo di Collecchio which was owned by its holding company Eventi Sportivi, were under auction after the bankruptcy.

The phoenix club S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913 S.r.L. was incorporated in 2015 under the ownership of Nuovo Inizio SrL with share capital of €250,000. Nuovo Inizio was owned by a number of backers including representatives of Parmalat and local businessmen Guido Barilla (co-owner of Barilla Group), Paolo Pizzarotti (president of Impresa Pizzarotti), Mauro Del Rio and Giampaolo Dallara. The new owners sought to overhaul the core philosophy of Italian club ownership and formed Parma Partecipazioni Calcistiche SrL to act as a vehicle for fan ownership, so issued a further €89,286 of shares to that company. Fans therefore own approximately 25% of the club at a cost of €500 per share.

In June 2017, Chinese businessman Jiang Lizhang&#x27;s Desports group acquired a 60% majority stake in the club. The seven local businessman who launched the club in 2015 retained 30% of the club, while the remaining 10% remained in the hands of fans through Parma Partecipazione Calcistiche. At the end of October 2018 the local Nuovo Inizio group regained control of the club reacquiring 60% of the shares, with the Chinese partners forced to downsize to 30% in light of alleged lack of diligence in meeting their obligations, while 10% remained unchanged in the public company Partecipazioni Calcistiche. On 9 November Parma Calcio held a shareholders&#x27; Meeting to appoint a new board of directors, at the end of which Pietro Pizzarotti, at the time vice-president, was appointed the new president of the club.

In 2020, Parma were purchased by the Krause Group, owners of American-based convenience store chain Kum &amp; Go.

Since 2013 the main sponsor is Cetilar by Pharmanutra.

<doc id="62614" wikidata="Q409687" url="?curid=62614" title="Pyrrolysine">
<text>Pyrrolysine (symbol Pyl or O; encoded by the &#x27;amber&#x27; stop codon UAG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins in some methanogenic archaea and bacteria; it is not present in humans. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated – form under biological conditions) and a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions). Its pyrroline side-chain is similar to that of lysine in being basic and positively charged at neutral pH.

==Genetics==
Nearly all genes are translated using only 20 standard amino acid building blocks. Two unusual genetically-encoded amino acids are selenocysteine and pyrrolysine. Pyrrolysine was discovered in 2002 at the active site of methyltransferase enzyme from a methane-producing archeon, &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot;. This amino acid is encoded by UAG (normally a stop codon), and its synthesis and incorporation into protein is mediated via the biological machinery encoded by the &quot;pylTSBCD&quot; cluster of genes.

==Composition==
As determined by X-ray crystallography and MALDI mass spectrometry, pyrrolysine is made up of 4-methylpyrroline-5-carboxylate in amide linkage with the εN of lysine.

==Synthesis==
Pyrrolysine is synthesized &quot;in vivo&quot; by joining two molecules of -lysine. One molecule of lysine is first converted to (3&quot;R&quot;)-3-methyl--ornithine, which is then ligated to a second lysine. An NH2 group is eliminated, followed by cyclization and dehydration step to yield -pyrrolysine.

==Catalytic function==
The extra pyrroline ring is incorporated into the active site of several methyltransferases, where it is believed to rotate relatively freely. It is believed that the ring is involved in positioning and displaying the methyl group of methylamine for attack by a corrinoid cofactor. The proposed model is that a nearby carboxylic acid bearing residue, glutamate, becomes protonated, and the proton can then be transferred to the imine ring nitrogen, exposing the adjacent ring carbon to nucleophilic addition by methylamine. The positively charged nitrogen created by this interaction may then interact with the deprotonated glutamate, causing a shift in ring orientation and exposing the methyl group derived from the methylamine to the binding cleft where it can interact with corrinoid. In this way a net is transferred to the cofactor&#x27;s cobalt atom with a change of oxidation state from I to III. The methylamine-derived ammonia is then released, restoring the original imine.

==Genetic coding==
Unlike posttranslational modifications of lysine such as hydroxylysine, methyllysine, and hypusine, pyrrolysine is incorporated during translation (protein synthesis) as directed by the genetic code, just like the standard amino acids. It is encoded in mRNA by the UAG codon, which in most organisms is the &#x27;amber&#x27; stop codon. This requires only the presence of the &quot;pylT&quot; gene, which encodes an unusual transfer RNA (tRNA) with a CUA anticodon, and the &quot;pylS&quot; gene, which encodes a class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges the &quot;pylT&quot;-derived tRNA with pyrrolysine.

This novel tRNA-aaRS pair (&quot;orthogonal pair&quot;) is independent of other synthetases and tRNAs in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and further possesses some flexibility in the range of amino acids processed, making it an attractive tool to allow the placement of a possibly wide range of functional chemical groups at arbitrarily specified locations in modified proteins. For example, the system provided one of two fluorophores incorporated site-specifically within calmodulin to allow the real-time examination of changes within the protein by FRET spectroscopy, and site-specific introduction of a photocaged lysine derivative. &quot;(See Expanded genetic code)&quot;

It was originally proposed that a specific downstream sequence &quot;PYLIS&quot;, forming a stem-loop in the mRNA, forced the incorporation of pyrrolysine instead of terminating translation in methanogenic archaea. This would be analogous to the SECIS element for selenocysteine incorporation. However, the PYLIS model has lost favor in view of the lack of structural homology between PYLIS elements and the lack of UAG stops in those species.

==Evolution==
The &quot;pylT&quot; (tRNA) and &quot;pylS&quot; (aa-tRNA synthase) genes are part of an operon of &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot;, with homologues in other sequenced members of the &quot;Methanosarcinaceae&quot; family: &quot;M. acetivorans&quot;, &quot;M. mazei&quot;, and &quot;M. thermophila&quot;. Pyrrolysine-containing proteins are known to include monomethylamine methyltransferase (mtmB), dimethylamine methyltransferase (mtbB), and trimethylamine methyltransferase (mttB). Homologs of &quot;pylS&quot; and &quot;pylT&quot; have also been found in an Antarctic archaeon, &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot; and a Gram-positive bacterium, &quot;Desulfitobacterium hafniense&quot;. The other genes of the &quot;Pyl&quot; operon mediate pyrrolysine biosynthesis, leading to description of the operon as a &quot;natural genetic code expansion cassette&quot;.

A number of evolutionary scenarios have been proposed for the pyrrolysine system. The current (2022) view, given available sequences for tRNA and Pyl-tRNA (PylRS) synthase genes, is that:
* tRNA(Pyl) diverged from tRNA(Phe) some time between the divergence of the three domains (~LUCA) and the divergence of archaeal phyla, but was lost in non-archaeal lineages;
* PylRS originated within a common ancestor of all archaea. A number of domain organizations of PylRS is known: &quot;pylS&quot; itself consists of an N-terminal tRNA-binding domain and a C-terminal synthase domain, but other organizations consist of two domains in separate proteins or a protein made up of a lone C-terminal domain. The CTD probably originated from PheRS. The NTD is an archaeal innovation with no known relative. The ancestral PylRS probably adopted the &quot;two separate proteins&quot; configuration.
* The &quot;genetic code expansion cassette&quot; was later transferred into various bacteria. This cassette&#x27;s PylRS has a split-domain configuration.

Earlier evolutionary scenarios were limited by the taxonomic range of known synthases:
* In 2007, when use of the amino acid appeared confined to the &quot;Methanosarcinaceae&quot;, the system was described as a &quot;late archaeal invention&quot; by which a 21st amino acid was added to the genetic code. It is now known that a wide range of prokaryotes have these two genes.
* In 2009, structure comparison suggested that PylRS may have originated in the LUCA, but it only persisted in organisms using methylamines as energy sources. It is now known that some non-methanogens also have these two genes, but the dating was not too far off.
* In 2009, it was suggested that the system could have migrated into bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. This is probably true based on the 2022 study, though the paper originally assumed a link to methanogenesis.

==Potential for an alternative translation==
The tRNA(CUA) can be charged with lysine &quot;in vitro&quot; by the concerted action of the &quot;M. barkeri&quot; Class I and Class II lysyl-tRNA synthetases, which do not recognize pyrrolysine. Charging a tRNA(CUA) with lysine was originally hypothesized to be the first step in translating UAG amber codons as pyrrolysine, a mechanism analogous to that used for selenocysteine. More recent data favor direct charging of pyrrolysine on to the tRNA(CUA) by the protein product of the &quot;pylS&quot; gene, leading to the suggestion that the LysRS1:LysRS2 complex may participate in a parallel pathway designed to ensure that proteins containing the UAG codon can be fully translated using lysine as a substitute amino acid in the event of pyrrolysine deficiency. Further study found that the genes encoding LysRS1 and LysRS2 are not required for normal growth on methanol and methylamines with normal methyltransferase levels, and they cannot replace &quot;pylS&quot; in a recombinant system for UAG amber stop codon suppression.

<text>Hortense Eugénie Cécile Bonaparte (; , ; 10 April 1783 – 5 October 1837) was Queen of Holland as the wife of King Louis Bonaparte. She was the stepdaughter of Emperor Napoléon I as the daughter of his first wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais. Hortense later married Napoléon I&#x27;s brother, Louis, making her Napoleon&#x27;s sister-in-law. She became queen consort of Holland when Louis was made King of Holland in 1806. She and Louis had three sons: Napoléon-Charles Bonaparte; Napoleon III, Emperor of the French; and Louis II of Holland. She also had an illegitimate son, Charles, Duke of Morny, with her lover, the Comte de Flahaut.

==Early life==

Hortense Eugénie Cécile Bonaparte was born in Paris, France, on 10 April 1783. She was born as the second child and first daughter to Alexandre François Marie, &quot;Vicomte de Beauharnais&quot;, and Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie. Her parents separated when she was five years old and, between the ages of five and ten, she was sent to live in Martinique. Her father was executed on 23 July 1794, at the time of the French Revolution, a few days before the end of the Reign of Terror. Her mother was imprisoned in the Carmelites’ prison, from which she was released on 6 August 1794, due to the intervention of her friend Thérèse Tallien. Two years later, her mother married Napoléon Bonaparte.

Hortense was described as having been an amusing and pretty child with long, pale golden-blonde hair and blue eyes. She received her education at the school of Madame Jeanne Campan in St-Germain-en-Laye together with Napoléon&#x27;s youngest sister Caroline Bonaparte, who later married Joachim Murat. She was sent to boarding school when her mother, Josephine, decided that she did not have enough time to raise children. There, she developed a love for fine art and music. Hortense was an accomplished amateur musical composer and supplied the army of her stepfather with rousing marches, including Partant pour la Syrie. She also enjoyed playing games and excelled at billiards particularly.

In 1802, at Napoléon&#x27;s request, Hortense married his brother Louis Bonaparte. Hortense was reluctant to marry at first, but her mother persuaded her to accept the proposal for the political wellbeing and prosperity of the family.

==Queen of Holland ==

Napoléon appointed his brother Louis as King of Holland in 1806 and Hortense accompanied her husband to The Hague. Hortense&#x27;s reaction to her appointment as Queen of Holland was negative for two reasons. First, it was necessary for her to move there with Louis, with whom she did not get along. Second, she had to leave her life as a celebrated member of Parisian society. She had hoped to be &quot;a Queen of Holland in Paris,&quot; but Napoléon did not agree. She was forced to depart to the Netherlands with Louis eventually, where she arrived on 18 June 1806.

Queen Hortense was pleasantly surprised when the Dutch public welcomed her warmly. She quickly became accustomed to life in the Netherlands and came to like the country. She attended official celebrations and ceremonies, visited the marketplaces where she made large purchases, and was much liked by the public, which annoyed her husband. She learned water-colour painting and made trips around the countryside. Nevertheless, she hated her stay there because of her relationship with King Louis. The couple lived in different parts of the palace and avoided each other at every opportunity, with Hortense describing herself as a prisoner. She also refused to give up her French citizenship and declare herself Dutch as Louis did.

In 1807 her first son died; she was allowed to stay in France subsequently, as the climate there was considered better for raising her other son Louis-Napoléon. She remained in France, again pleased by her status as a queen at the French court, until 1810, when Napoléon remarried to Marie Louise of Austria.

This forced Hortense to return to the Netherlands and reconcile with her husband. When Napoleon married Marie Louise, Hortense returned to the Netherlands temporarily, but found that the Dutch did not welcome her. She considered this the end of her marriage and left for France shortly before her husband abdicated the throne to their oldest living son, Napoleon-Louis Bonaparte, making him Louis II of Holland.

==Personal life==
Hortense was now free to respond to the romantic overtures of the man whom she had long admired, Colonel Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, a sophisticated, handsome man, who was an illegitimate son of Talleyrand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dard 1938 https://www.jstor.org/stable/44850143?read-now=1&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents 341-342&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became lovers.
In 1811, at an unspecified inn in Switzerland, close to Lake Geneva, Hortense gave birth to a son by Comte de Flahaut secretly,
Charles Auguste Louis Joseph ( 21 October 1811 - 10 March 1865), created Duke of Morny by his half-brother, Napoléon III, in 1862.

Only her brother Eugène, her closest companions, and Adélaïde Filleul de Souza (Charles de Flahaut&#x27;s mother) were aware of her pregnancy and the subsequent birth. She had used poor health to explain her prolonged visit to Switzerland, which Adélaïde arranged. Hortense disguised her pregnancy cleverly (she was, by then, in her sixth month) during the baptism of Napoléon&#x27;s son, Napoléon II, when Napoléon I made her one of the child&#x27;s godmothers, an honour she shared with Madame Mère, mother of the Emperor.

In 1814 Flahaut had an affair with the Comédie-Française actress Mademoiselle Mars. When Hortense read Mars’ &quot;passionate outpourings&quot; in one of her letters to Charles, she ended the affair. Although Hortense still had a deep attachment to Charles and remained in correspondence with him initially, she then made up her mind to release him. When, months later, he had mentioned that he had met &quot;a rich young woman who seemed to like him,” Hortense begged him to forget the promises he had made to her. In October that year she went on a pilgrimage to the Benedictine shrine of Our Lady of the Hermits at Einsiedeln Abbey in the Swiss canton of Schwyz. After renouncing her claims on Charles, she presented a bouquet of diamond hydrangeas to the Virgin and a ring for the abbot, having been blessed, she wrote, with &quot;so many consolations, such happiness at Einsiedeln not to wish that my memory remain there after I had left.&quot;

=== Composer ===

Hortense de Beauharnais found love for music during her time in boarding school and she became a self-acclaimed amateur composer there (Beaucour, 2007). Though she did not have any known education in composition, it is said that she was a very talented singer and pianist. Fétis wrote about her in his article, Biographie Universelle des Musiciens, the following lines:

: “Plantade was Queen Hortense’s singing-master when she was at Mad. Campan’s school; what her Majesty gained more especially from her lessons was a great capability of stint, she composed several pieces of this kind, among which is the one beginning with the words: ‘Partant pour la Syrie.’ This romance, which enjoyed a great vogue about 1810, again became popular in France after 1852.” While her stepfather, Napoleon, ruled over France, she wrote marches and the French Troops sung some of her songs.

Hortense was banished when Napoleon was defeated and there she wrote numerous pieces, mostly notably her 12 Romances she wrote for her brother Eugene. Although she was banished, Hortense’s home exemplified the spirit of French art culture. There she presented her arts for her many visitors. Famous contemporary artists like Franz Liszt, Alexandre Dumas, and Lord Byron came to visit and listen to her piano performances. Hortense’s most famous composition ‘Partant pour la Syrie’ became the national hymn of France after her son Emperor Napoleon III instated it as such. (Last FM, 2010). French composer Camille Saint-Saens quotes “Partant pour la Syrie” in “Fossils” from his Carnival of the Animals.

A collection of some of her writing, art, and compositions can be found in her “Livre d’art de la reine Hortense.”

=== Charities ===
Hortense donated to the poor often and was also known to be a favourite amongst them. She states in her memoirs, “Going to one of the mulatto houseservants I announced, ‘John, look at all this money granny gave me for the poor black people. Take me round to their cabins so I can give it to them.’”

==Later years==
At the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Hortense received the protection of Alexander I of Russia. At his instigation, Louis XVIII granted her the title of Duchess of Saint-Leu (duchesse de Saint-Leu) on 30 May 1814. During the Hundred Days, however, Hortense supported her stepfather and brother-in-law Napoléon. In turn, Louis XVIII banished Hortense from France after Napoleon’s final defeat. She left Paris on 17 July 1815.

During her banishment, Hortense began to focus on writing her memoirs, composing and publishing her musical works, drawing, and painting. Her home became a center for French art and culture. Established artists, composers, and writers were all fascinated by the banished queen in Switzerland.

Despite residing in Switzerland, Hortense remained involved in her sons’ lives. When one of her sons, Napoleon-Louis (Louis II of Holland), died in the Italian revolt against Austrian rule, she and her youngest son Louis-Napoleon escaped to France in April 1831. They reached Paris later that month, where Hortense discreetly contacted the new King of the French Louis-Philippe asking for passports so that she and her son could travel on to England. Louis-Philippe received her warmly at the Tuileries Palace and agreed to secure the passports. He told her that, for the time being, the Law of Exile against the Bonapartes would be upheld, assuring her that &quot;the time is not too distant that there will be no more exiles.&quot; According to Maxime du Camp, who had access to official dossiers, during his mothers&#x27; interview with the king, Louis-Napoleon was observed by authorities meeting with a group of conspirators who were planning to stage a coup to overthrow Louis-Philippe and bring Napoleon II to power. Hortense and her son were both implicated in the scheme. To further complicate the situation, rumor of Hortense&#x27;s presence in Paris began to spread, and on 5 May a crowd of Bonapartists came to demonstrate outside her hotel on Place Vendôme, shouting &quot;Vive l&#x27;Empereur&quot;. The new Orléanist government ordered Hortense and her son to leave France the next day.

She traveled in Germany and Italy before she purchased the Château Arenenberg in the Swiss canton of Thurgau in 1817. She lived there until she died of cancer on 5 October 1837, at the age of fifty-four. She is buried next to her mother Joséphine in the Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul church in Rueil-Malmaison. After her death, her remaining legitimate son, Charles-Louis Napoleon, returned to Paris, where he became Emperor Napoleon III.

A portrait of Hortense hangs at James Monroe’s Highland, the Virginia plantation home of James Monroe, fifth President of the United States. It was one of three portraits Hortense gave to Monroe&#x27;s daughter Eliza, with whom she attended school in France. (The other two portraits are of Hortense&#x27;s brother Eugène de Beauharnais and of Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, the headmistress of the school Hortense and Eliza attended.) Eliza named her daughter, Hortensia Monroe Hay, in honour of her Godmother Hortense.

==Issue==
With Louis Bonaparte, she had three sons:
* Napoléon Louis Charles Bonaparte (10 October 1802 - 5 May 1807), who died when he was four years old.
* Napoléon Louis Bonaparte (11 October 1804 - 17 March 1831), who married Charlotte Napoléone Bonaparte on 23 July 1826. 
* Charles-Louis Napoléon Bonaparte, later Napoleon III (20 April 1808 - 9 January 1873), who married Eugénie de Palafox, Countess of Montijo on 29 January 1853. They had one son.

With Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, she had one son: 
* Charles Auguste Louis Joseph (21 October 1811 - 10 March 1865), whom his half-brother Napoléon III created Duke of Morny in 1862.

<text>Calvados (, , ) is a department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It takes its name from a cluster of rocks off the Normandy coast. In 2019, it had a population of 694,905.

==History==
Calvados is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, in application of the law of 22 December 1789. It had been part of the former province of Normandy. The name &quot;Orne-Inférieure&quot; was originally proposed, but it was ultimately called Calvados after a group of rocks off its coast.

One popular legend ascribes its etymology to the &quot;Salvador&quot;, a ship from the Spanish Armada that sank by the rocks near Arromanches-les-bains in 1588. It is more likely, however, that the name &quot;Calvados&quot; was derived from &quot;calva dorsa&quot;, meaning &quot;bare backs&quot;, in reference to two sparsely vegetated rocks off its shore.

After the allied victory at Waterloo the department was occupied by Prussian troops between June 1815 and November 1818.

On 6 June 1944, the Allied forces landed on the beaches of the Bay of the Seine in what became known as the Battle of Normandy.

==Geography==
Calvados belongs to the region of Normandy and borders the departments of Seine-Maritime (maritime border), Eure, Orne and Manche. To the north is the Baie de la Seine, part of the English Channel. On the east, the river Seine forms the boundary with Seine-Maritime. Calvados includes the Bessin area, the Pays d&#x27;Auge and the area known as the &quot;Suisse normande&quot; (&quot;Norman Switzerland&quot;).

The most notable places in Calvados include Deauville and the formerly elegant 19th-century casino resorts along the coast.

==Economy==
Agriculture dominates the economy of Calvados. The area is known for producing butter, cheese, cider, and Calvados, the apple spirit that takes its name from the area.

==Politics==
The President of the Departmental Council is the centrist Jean-Léonce Dupont, the former dominant figure of the right and centre in the department. The Conseil General of Calvados and Devon County Council signed a Twinning Charter in 1971 to develop links with the English county of Devon.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Demography==

The inhabitants of Calvados are called &quot;Calvadosiens&quot; (male) and &quot;Calvadosiennes&quot; (female). In 2019, Calvados had 648,299 inhabitants, making it the 34th most populated French department.

Age distribution in Calvados (2019):
* 75 years and older: 10.0%
* 60–74 years old: 18.1%
* 45–59 years old: 19.4%
* 30–44 years old: 17.4%

==Culture==
The Bayeux Tapestry is on display in Bayeux and makes the city one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Normandy.

Juno Beach Centre at Courseulles-sur-Mer, Calvados, commemorates the D-Day landing of the Canadian liberation forces at Juno Beach during World War II in 1944. The cult of Saint Thérèse de Lisieux brings large numbers of people on pilgrimage to Lisieux, where she lived in a Carmelite convent. Every September, Deauville hosts the Festival of the American Movie and the beach resort of Cabourg hosts the Festival of the Romantic Movie. Annually, the city of Caen celebrates the festival of the electronical cultures called &quot;Nordik Impakt&quot; and the festival of Beauregard, just around Caen.

The local dialect of the Norman language is known as Augeron. It is spoken by a minority of the population.

==Tourism==
Calvados is one of the most visited areas in France because of its seaside resorts which are among the most prestigious in France with their luxurious hotels, casinos, green countryside, manors, castles, the quiet, the chalk cliffs, the typical Norman houses, the history of William the Conqueror, Caen, Bayeux, Lisieux, the famous D-day beaches and numerous museums about the Second World War. Culinary specialties from the verdant countryside of Calvados are abundant: cider, calvados, camembert, and Pont-l&#x27;Évêque cheeses.

One of the advantage of Calvados is to be fairly near large urban centers (Paris, Ile de France). Calvados is therefore often preferred for holidays and for weekends and sometimes considered as the &quot;countryside of Paris&quot;.

Calvados, via the port of Ouistreham, is an entrance to the continent from Britain. There are two airports: Caen-Carpiquet and Deauville-Saint Gatien. The department of Calvados has several popular tourist areas: the Bessin, the Plain of Caen, the Bocage Virois, the Côte de Nacre, the Côte Fleurie and the Pays d&#x27;Auge. Several beaches of Calvados are popular for water sports, including Cabourg and Merville-Franceville-Plage.

Tourist capacity (2022):
* 10,200 hotel rooms
* 14,410 camping sites
* 12,795 other beds (tourist resorts, holiday villages, rural gites, youth hostels)

===Second homes===
As of 2019, 17.9% of available housing in the department were second homes.

<doc id="62622" wikidata="Q3510438" url="?curid=62622" title="Ballistic Missile Defense Organization">
<text>The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) was an agency of the United States Department of Defense that began on 20 May 1974 with the responsibility for all U.S. ballistic missile defense efforts. It was renamed the Missile Defense Agency in 2002.

==History==
BMDO evolved from the SAFEGUARD System Organization. The original mission of BMDO was comparable to that of SAFEGUARD, which was to defend U.S. ballistic missile sites, but BMDO additionally had the more general role of conducting research and development in advanced ballistic missile defense (BMD) technology and also managed what was then called the Kwajalein Missile Range (KMR). In July 1984, BMDO became a part of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) and one year later BMDO was renamed the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command.

The name &quot;Ballistic Missile Defense Organization&quot; (BMDO) came back into use in 1993 when SDIO was renamed BMDO by the administration of President Bill Clinton and this was accompanied by a shift in emphasis from national missile defense to theater missile defense, i.e. from global to regional coverage. 
In 1998, focus shifted back to national missile defense when Defense secretary William Cohen proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on ballistic missile defense programs to build a national system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.

BMDO became better known in the public eye in 1994 when it launched a space probe, Clementine, to the Moon, in collaboration with NASA. BMDO was primarily interested in field testing new satellite and space reconnaissance technologies incorporated in Clementine, technologies which enabled Clementine to discover pockets of ice at the Moon&#x27;s south pole.

BMDO was renamed the Missile Defense Agency in 2002 by the administration of President George W. Bush.

<text>Joséphine Bonaparte (, born Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie; 23 June 1763 – 29 May 1814) was the first wife of Emperor Napoleon I and as such Empress of the French from 18 May 1804 until their marriage was annulled on 10 January 1810. As Napoleon&#x27;s consort, she was also Queen of Italy from 26 May 1805 until the 1810 annulment. She is widely known as Joséphine de Beauharnais ().

Joséphine&#x27;s marriage to Napoleon was her second. Her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, was guillotined during the Reign of Terror, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes Prison until five days after his execution. Through her children by Beauharnais, she was the grandmother of Emperor Napoleon III of France and Empress Amélie of Brazil. Members of the current royal families of Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, and Norway and the grand ducal family of Luxembourg also descend from her. Because she did not bear Napoleon any children, he had their marriage annulled and married Marie Louise of Austria. Joséphine was the recipient of numerous love letters written by Napoleon, many of which still exist.

A patron of art, Joséphine worked closely with sculptors, painters and interior decorators to establish a unique Consular and Empire style at the Château de Malmaison. She became one of the leading collectors of different forms of art of her time, such as sculpture and painting. The Château de Malmaison was noted for its rose garden, which she supervised closely.

== Name ==
Although she is often referred to as &quot;Joséphine de Beauharnais&quot;, it is not a name she herself used. &quot;Beauharnais&quot; is the name of her first husband, which she ceased to use upon her marriage to Napoleon, taking the last name &quot;Bonaparte&quot;. She did not use the name &quot;Joséphine&quot; before meeting Napoleon, who was the first to call her such, perhaps from her middle name, Josèphe. Before she met Napoleon, she went by the name of Rose, or Marie-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, later de Beauharnais. She sometimes reverted to using her maiden name in later life. After her marriage to then-General Bonaparte, she adopted the name Joséphine Bonaparte. The misnomer &quot;Joséphine de Beauharnais&quot; emerged during the restoration of the Bourbons, who were hesitant to refer to her by either Napoleon&#x27;s surname or her imperial title.

==Family background==

The Taschers were an ancient French noble family of landed gentry, and Joséphine&#x27;s grandfather, Gaspard-Joseph Tascher de La Pagerie (1705-1767) was the first to settle in Le Carbet on Martinique in 1726. He seems to have lived in poverty there, but secured a position for his son, Joseph-Gaspard Tascher de La Pagerie (5 July 1735 – 7 November 1790) as a page in the household of the &quot;Dauphine&quot; of France, Maria Josepha of Saxony.

After spending three years from 1752 in France, Joseph-Gaspard returned to Martinique and married on 9 November 1761 Marie Rose-Claire des Vergers de Sannois (27 August 1736 – 1 June 1807), whose maternal grandfather, Anthony Brown, may have been Irish. Rose-Claire was from one of the oldest European families on the island, and the Tascher family home near Les Trois-Îlets, a sugar plantation, which is now a museum, was part of her dowry.

On Martinique, Joseph-Gaspard earned his living as a plantation owner and a lieutenant of the &quot;Troupes de marine&quot;, apart from a small pension for his previous work in the royal household. He was almost always close to bankruptcy and suffered from ill health.

==Disputed birthplace==

Officially, Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher de La Pagerie was born in Les Trois-Îlets on Martinique on 23 June 1763. However, this has been disputed by several sources. The church registry in Les Trois-Îlets states that Joséphine was baptised there by Emmanuel Capuchin but does not say she was born there.

Joséphine&#x27;s father owned an estate in Soufrière District on Saint Lucia, called Malmaison, which later was also the name of her famous French residence. In 1802, Dom Daviot, parish priest in Gros Islet on Saint Lucia, wrote a letter to one of his friends, stating that &quot;&quot;it is in the vicinity of [my] parish that the wife of the first consul was born&quot;. He asserted that he was well acquainted with Joséphine&#x27;s cousin, his parishioner.

In Henry H. Breen&#x27;s 1844 &quot;The History of St. Lucia&quot;, he stated that he had met with &quot;several well-informed persons&quot;&quot; who were convinced that Empress Joséphine had been born there. Breen presented some evidence for this, including a newspaper clipping from 1831 which said that it was &quot;alleged&quot; that the de Taschers were among the first settlers of Saint Lucia, and that the future empress was born on a small estate on a hill then called La Cauzette, and later known as Morne Paix Bouche. According to this story, the family lived there until 1771, when the father went to serve as intendant of Martinique. Some people even claimed to have been among Joséphine&#x27;s playmates, and one of them said that he had been &quot;graciously received&quot; by the empress in Château de Malmaison outside Paris. Breen received further confirmation from Joséphine&#x27;s enslaved nanny, Dede, who said that she nursed Joséphine at La Cauzette. 

According to those who believe that Joséphine was born on Saint Lucia, the de Tascher estate in Martinique was only a &quot;pied-à-terre&quot;, occasional lodging, for when they wanted to stay with his mother-in-law. Saint Lucia switched hands between Great Britain and France fourteen times, and there were no civil registers on the island when Joséphine was born. Saint Lucia&#x27;s frequent change of ownership between Britain and France could be seen as the reason her birthplace was left out of her birth record, as it would have affected her nationality.

Regardless of where she was born, Joséphine was her parents&#x27; first child, and they had two more: Catherine-Désirée in 1764 and Marie-Françoise in 1766. At the ages of ten and nine, Joséphine and Catherine-Désirée were sent to a boarding school in Fort-Royal, run by the Bénédictines de la Providence. There, they learned to read, write, sing, dance, and embroider for four years. After the death of Catherine-Désirée, Joséphine returned to her parents&#x27; plantation. Joséphine&#x27;s nurse was an enslaved person called Marion, whose freedom she would secure in 1807.

== First marriage ==

Joséphine&#x27;s paternal aunt, Marie Euphémie Désirée Tascher de la Pagerie (1739–1803), was at first the mistress, later became the second wife of a French naval officer, François de Beauharnais, Governor of Martinique, who came from a less ancient but richer noble Beauharnais family. While living on Martinique, de Beauharnais had a son, Alexandre, by his first wife, Marie Anne Henriette Françoise Pyvart de Chastullé (1722-1766). Soon, the parents returned to France, and left the infant with the Tascher family until 1766. When he had come of age, his father&#x27;s mistress, who was also Alexandre&#x27;s godmother, decided that it would be advantageous to her if he married one of her nieces. Aged seventeen, he judged fifteen-year-old Joséphine to be too close to him in age, and thus, Catherine-Désirée Tascher de la Pagerie (1764-1777) was chosen for him. As the bride&#x27;s father was impoverished and the bridegroom was to become a wealthy man upon his marriage, he asked for no dowry.

By the time Alexandre&#x27;s father had proposed in a letter, Catherine-Désirée had died in 1777. Not wanting to lose the rich suitor, her father offered his youngest daughter instead, which was accepted by Alexandre. Marie-Françoise was not yet twelve, however, and her mother and grandmother were not willing to let her go. In the end, Joséphine was engaged to Alexandre.

In October 1779, she went to France with her father. She married Alexandre on 13 December 1779, in Noisy-le-Grand. They had two children: a son, Eugène de Beauharnais, and a daughter, Hortense de Beauharnais (who later married Napoleon&#x27;s brother Louis Bonaparte in 1802). Joséphine and Alexandre&#x27;s marriage was not a happy one. Alexandre abandoned his family for over a year to live with a mistress and frequented brothels, leading to a court-ordered separation during which Joséphine and the children lived at Alexandre&#x27;s expense in the Pentemont Abbey. 

On 2 March 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the arrest of her husband. He was jailed in the Carmes Prison in Paris. Considering Joséphine as being too close to the counter-revolutionary financial circles, the Committee ordered her arrest on 18 April 1794. A warrant of arrest was issued against her on 21 April 1794, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes Prison until 28 July. During this time, Joséphine was only allowed to communicate with her children by their scrawls on the laundry list, which the jailers soon prohibited.

Her husband was accused of having poorly defended Mainz in July 1793, and being considered an aristocratic suspect, was sentenced to death and guillotined with his cousin Augustin on 23 July 1794, on the &quot;Place de la Révolution&quot; (today &quot;Place de la Concorde&quot;) in Paris. Joséphine was freed five days later, thanks to the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre, which ended the Reign of Terror. On 27 July 1794 Tallien arranged the liberation of Thérèse Cabarrus, and soon after that of Joséphine. In June 1795, a new law allowed her to recover the possessions of Alexandre.

==Marriage to Napoleon==
Madame de Beauharnais had affairs with several leading political figures, including Paul Barras. In 1795, she met Napoleon Bonaparte, six years her junior, and became his mistress. In a letter to her in December, he wrote, &quot;I awake full of you. Your image and the memory of last night&#x27;s intoxicating pleasures has left no rest to my senses.&quot; In January 1796, Napoleon proposed to her and they were married on 9 March. On the marriage certificate, Joséphine reduced her age by 4 years and increased Napoleon&#x27;s by 18 months, making the newly-weds appear to be roughly the same age. Until meeting Bonaparte, she was known as &quot;Rose&quot;, but Bonaparte preferred to call her &quot;Joséphine&quot;, the name she adopted from then on.

The marriage was not well received by Napoleon&#x27;s family, who were shocked that he had married an older widow with two children. His mother and sisters were especially resentful of Joséphine, as they felt clumsy and unsophisticated in her presence. 

Two days after the wedding, Bonaparte left Paris to lead the Army of Italy. During their separation, he sent her many love letters. In February 1797, he wrote: &quot;You to whom nature has given spirit, sweetness, and beauty, you who alone can move and rule my heart, you who know all too well the absolute empire you exercise over it!&quot; 

Joséphine, left behind in Paris, in 1796 began an affair with a handsome Hussar lieutenant, Hippolyte Charles. Rumors of the affair reached Napoleon; he was infuriated, and his love for her changed entirely.

In 1798, Napoleon led a French army to Egypt. During this campaign, Napoleon started an affair of his own with Pauline Fourès, the wife of a junior officer, who became known as &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Cleopatra.&quot; The relationship between Joséphine and Napoleon was never the same after this.

In December 1800, Joséphine was nearly killed in the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt on Napoleon&#x27;s life with a bomb planted in a parked cart. On 24 December, she and Napoleon went to see a performance of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot; at the Opéra, accompanied by several friends and family. The party travelled in two carriages. Joséphine was in the second, with her daughter, Hortense; her pregnant sister-in-law, Caroline Murat; and General Jean Rapp. Joséphine had delayed the party while getting a new silk shawl draped correctly, and Napoleon went ahead in the first carriage. The bomb exploded as her carriage was passing. The bomb killed several bystanders and one of the carriage horses, and blew out the carriage&#x27;s windows; Hortense was struck in the hand by flying glass. There were no other injuries and the party proceeded to the Opéra.

===Empress of the French===
Napoleon was elected Emperor of the French in 1804, making Joséphine empress. The coronation ceremony, officiated by Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre-Dame de Paris, on 2 December. Napoleon first crowned himself, then put the crown on Joséphine&#x27;s head, proclaiming her empress. This showed his rejection of the clergy as the power of Europe.

In her role as empress, Josephine had a court appointed to her and reinstated the offices which composed the household of the queen before the French revolution, with Adélaïde de La Rochefoucauld as &quot;Première dame d&#x27;honneur&quot;, Émilie de Beauharnais as &quot;Dame d&#x27;atour&quot;, and the wives of his own officials and generals, Jeanne Charlotte du Lucay, Madame de Rémusat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhouët, Lauriston, d&#x27;Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duchâtel, Sophie de Segur, Séran, Colbert, Savary and Aglaé Louise Auguié Ney, as &quot;Dame de Palais&quot;.

Shortly before their coronation, there was an incident at the Château de Saint-Cloud that nearly sundered the marriage between the two. Joséphine caught Napoleon in the bedroom of her lady-in-waiting, Élisabeth de Vaudey, and Napoleon threatened to divorce her as she had not produced an heir since he felt pressured from his family to do so. Eventually, however, through the efforts of her daughter Hortense, the two were reconciled.

When after a few years it became clear she could not have a child, Napoleon, while still loving Joséphine, began to think about the possibility of an annulment. The final die was cast when Napoleon&#x27;s nephew (and Joséphine&#x27;s grandson) Napoléon Charles Bonaparte, who had been declared his heir, died of croup in 1807. Once again requested per Napoleon’s family, he began to create lists of eligible princesses. At dinner on 30 November 1809, he let Joséphine know that—in the interest of France—he must find a wife who could produce an heir. He let Joséphine know that this was his family&#x27;s wish and that he wished it were not so. Joséphine agreed to the divorce so the Emperor could remarry in the hope of having an heir. The divorce ceremony took place on 10 January 1810 and was a grand but solemn social occasion, and each read a statement of devotion to the other.

On 11 March, Napoleon married Marie-Louise of Austria by proxy; the formal ceremony took place at the Louvre in April. Napoleon once remarked that despite her quick infatuation with him, &quot;It is a womb that I am marrying&quot;. Even after their separation, Napoleon insisted Joséphine retain the title of empress. &quot;It is my will that she retain the rank and title of empress, and especially that she never doubt my sentiments, and that she ever hold me as her best and dearest friend.&quot;

==Later life and death==

===Duchess of Navarre===

After the annulment, Joséphine lived at the Château de Malmaison, near Paris. She remained on good terms with Napoleon, who once said that the only thing to come between them was her debts. (Joséphine remarked privately, &quot;The only thing that ever came between us was my debts; certainly not his manhood.&quot;) In April 1810, by letters patent, Napoleon created her Duchess of Navarre. Some claim Napoleon and Joséphine were still secretly in love, though it is impossible to verify this.

In March 1811, Marie Louise delivered a long-awaited heir, Napoleon II, to whom Napoleon gave the title &quot;King of Rome&quot;. Two years later Napoleon arranged for Joséphine to meet the young prince &quot;who had cost her so many tears&quot;.

===Death===

Joséphine died of pneumonia in Rueil-Malmaison on 29 May 1814, soon after walking with Emperor Alexander I of Russia in the gardens of Malmaison, where she allegedly begged to join Napoleon in exile. She was buried in the nearby church of Saint Pierre-Saint Paul in Rueil. Her daughter Hortense is interred near her.

Napoleon learned of her death via a French journal while in exile on Elba, and stayed locked in his room for two days, refusing to see anyone. He claimed to a friend, while in exile on Saint Helena, that &quot;I truly loved my Joséphine, but I did not respect her.&quot; Despite numerous affairs, eventual marriage annulment, and his remarriage, the Emperor&#x27;s last words on his death bed at St. Helena were: &quot;France, the Army, the Head of the Army, Joséphine.&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

==Descendants==
Hortense&#x27;s son, Napoleon III, became Emperor of the French. Eugène&#x27;s son Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg married into the Russian Imperial family, was granted the style of Imperial Highness and founded the Russian line of the Beauharnais family, while Eugene&#x27;s daughter Joséphine married King Oscar I of Sweden, the son of Napoleon&#x27;s one-time fiancée, Désirée Clary. Through her, Joséphine is a direct ancestor of the present heads of the royal houses of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden and of the grandducal house of Baden.

A number of jewels worn by modern-day royals are often said to have been worn by Joséphine. Through the Leuchtenberg inheritance, the Norwegian royal family possesses an emerald and diamond parure said to have been Joséphine&#x27;s. The Swedish royal family owns several pieces of jewelry frequently linked to Joséphine, including the Leuchtenberg Sapphire Parure, a suite of amethyst jewels, and the Cameo Parure, worn by Sweden&#x27;s royal brides.

Another of Eugène&#x27;s daughters, Amélie of Leuchtenberg, married Emperor Pedro I of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, and became Empress of Brazil, and they had one surviving daughter, Princess Maria Amélia of Brazil, who was briefly engaged to Archduke Maximilian of Austria, before he became Maximilian I of Mexico, before her early death.

==Personality and appearance==
Her biographer Carolly Erickson wrote, &quot;In choosing her lovers [Joséphine] followed her head first, then her heart&quot;, meaning that she was adept in terms of identifying the men who were most capable of fulfilling her financial and social needs. She was aware of Napoleon&#x27;s potential. Joséphine was a renowned spendthrift and Barras may have encouraged the relationship with General Bonaparte in order to get her off his hands. Joséphine was naturally full of kindness, generosity and charm, and was praised as an engaging hostess.

Joséphine was described as being of average height, svelte, and shapely, with silky, long, chestnut-brown hair, hazel eyes, and a rather sallow complexion. Her nose was small and straight, and her mouth was well-formed; however, she kept it closed most of the time to hide her bad teeth. She was praised for her elegance, style, and low, &quot;silvery&quot;, beautifully modulated voice.

==Patroness of roses==
In 1799 while Napoleon was in Egypt, Joséphine purchased the Chateau de Malmaison. She had it landscaped in an English style, hiring landscapers and horticulturalists from Britain. These included Thomas Blaikie, a Scottish horticultural expert, another Scottish gardener, Alexander Howatson, the botanist, Ventenat, and the horticulturist, André Dupont. The rose garden was begun soon after purchase; inspired by Dupont&#x27;s love of roses. Joséphine took a personal interest in the gardens and the roses, and learned a great deal about botany and horticulture from her staff. Joséphine wanted to collect all known roses so Napoleon ordered his warship commanders to search all seized vessels for plants to be forwarded to Malmaison.

Pierre-Joseph Redouté was commissioned by her to paint the flowers from her gardens. &quot;Les Roses&quot; was published 1817–20 with 168 plates of roses; 75–80 of the roses grew at Malmaison. The English nursery Lee and Kennedy was a major supplier, despite Britain and France being at war, his shipments were allowed to cross blockades. Specifically, when Hume&#x27;s Blush Tea-Scented China was imported to England from China, the British and French Admiralties made arrangements in 1810 for specimens to cross naval blockades for Joséphine&#x27;s garden. Sir Joseph Banks, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also sent her roses.

The general assumption is that she had about 250 roses in her garden when she died in 1814. Unfortunately the roses were not catalogued during her tenure. There may have been only 197 rose varieties in existence in 1814, according to calculations by Jules Gravereaux of Roseraie de l’Haye. There were 12 species, about 40 centifolias, mosses and damasks, 20 Bengals, and about 100 gallicas. The botanist Claude Antoine Thory, who wrote the descriptions for Redouté&#x27;s paintings in &quot;Les Roses&quot;, noted that Joséphine&#x27;s Bengal rose R. indica had black spots on it. She produced the first written history of the cultivation of roses, and is believed to have hosted the first rose exhibition, in 1810.

Modern hybridization of roses through artificial, controlled pollination began with Joséphine&#x27;s horticulturalist Andre Dupont. Prior to this, most new rose cultivars were spontaneous mutations or accidental, bee-induced hybrids, and appeared rarely. With controlled pollination, the appearance of new cultivars grew exponentially. Of the roughly 200 types of roses known to Joséphine, Dupont had created 25 while in her employ. Subsequent French hybridizers created over 1000 new rose cultivars in the 30 years following Joséphine&#x27;s death. In 1910, less than 100 years after her death, there were about 8000 rose types in Gravereaux&#x27;s garden. Bechtel also feels that the popularity of roses as garden plants was boosted by Joséphine&#x27;s patronage. She was a popular ruler and fashionable people copied her.

Brenner and Scanniello call her the &quot;Godmother of modern rosomaniacs&quot; and attribute her with our modern style of vernacular cultivar names as opposed to Latinized, pseudo-scientific cultivar names. For instance, &quot;R. alba incarnata&quot; became &quot;Cuisse de Nymphe Emue&quot; in her garden. After Joséphine&#x27;s death in 1814 the house was vacant at times, the garden and house ransacked and vandalised, and the garden&#x27;s remains were destroyed in a battle in 1870. 

Jacques-Louis Descemet dedicated &quot;Impératrice Joséphine&quot; to her sometime before 1815. Similarly, Jean-Pierre Vibert dedicated &quot;Joséphine Beauharnais&quot; in her honor in 1823. The rose &#x27;Souvenir de la Malmaison&#x27; appeared in 1844, 30 years after her death, named in her honor by a Russian Grand Duke planting one of the first specimens in the Imperial Garden in St. Petersburg.

== Art patronage ==
Empress Joséphine was a great lover of all art. She was known for an interest in horticulture and loved all things artistic. She surrounded herself with creative people whose work ranged from paintings and sculpture to furniture and the architecture all around her. Joséphine always had an interest in art but it was with her marriage to her first husband that she would gain more access to art and artists. Due to her husband&#x27;s high position in society she was often able to frequent many influential people&#x27;s homes and learned from the works that were in their houses. After marrying Napoleon and becoming Empress she was surrounded by the works of the time, however Joséphine also appreciated the works of old masters. She was also drawn to artists and styles that were not widely used in her time, searching for artists that challenged the accepted standards. She visited the Salon to build relationships with contemporary artists. Joséphine became a patron to several different artists, helping to build their careers though their connection to her. After buying the Château de Malmaison, Joséphine had a blank canvas to showpiece her art and style and used it to create salons, galleries, a theater and her famous garden. The Malmaison and Tuileries Palace became centers for Napoleon&#x27;s government but was recognized as an important place for the arts in any forms. Joséphine&#x27;s court became the leading court in Europe for the arts. She became the first French female royal collector of this scale, leading in the Consular and Empire Style.

=== Paintings ===
Joséphine worked with and sought out the works of many artists throughout her lifetime. In the area of painters she mainly was a collector of paintings but she was painted by and worked with several artists such as Jacques-Louis David and François Gérard. However, there was one painter whom Joséphine favored and commissioned more often than others, Antoine-Jean Gros. Gros, upon hearing that Joséphine would be visiting Genoa, worked to get an introduction knowing that the association with Joséphine would help him become more well-known.

Upon meeting with Gros and seeing his work, Joséphine asked him to come back to Milan with her and to live in her residences. Joséphine then commissioned him to create a portrait of her husband, the then General Bonaparte. The work took several sittings between Gros and Napoleon and would be named &quot;Bonaparte at the Pont d&#x27;Arcole&quot;. This painting would become a big part of Napoleon&#x27;s propaganda and iconography. Gros would go on to paint other portraits of Napoleon, which always portrayed him as a fierce conqueror, propagating the image of Napoleon as powerful and unstoppable. Joséphine as a supporter and patron of Gros, aided him in becoming a central conduit for the message that the government was trying to disseminate about the rule of the Emperor in that time.

=== Sculpture ===
Over her lifetime Joséphine commissioned four major pieces from the Italian Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova. The Empress was given a copy of Canova&#x27;s work &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, which was originally promised to Colonel John Campbell, but because of unforeseen circumstances it was gifted to Joséphine. She would commission Canova to create a sculpture and the result would be &quot;Dancer with Hands on Hips&quot;. The work was commissioned in 1802 but was not finished until 1812, Joséphine allowed him to create on his own terms, which were based on the classics but with a more relaxed and joyful appearance. He would create several sculptures based on dancing. &quot;Dancer with Hands on Hips&quot; was praised by the art community because it was not based on any specific ancient sculpture, but with a classical style, making it a completely original sculpture.

Joséphine would commission Canova again for another sculpture called &quot;Paris&quot;. The work&#x27;s plaster cast was completed in 1807 but the marble statue was not finished until 1812. arriving in Malmaison in 1813 a year before Joséphine&#x27;s death. The final sculpture that the Empress would commission was &quot;The Three Graces&quot;. This work would not be completed until after Joséphine&#x27;s death in 1816. All four works were eventually sold to Tsar Alexander of Russia.

=== Furniture/Design ===
The architects Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine essentially became the decorators for Joséphine and Napoleon. Many of Joséphine&#x27;s most well-known furnishings were created especially for her by Percier and Fontaine. The two architects worked within many of the empire&#x27;s residences, creating spaces for the Empress to feel at home in. Percier and Fontaine had their own unique style and created pieces for both the Emperor and his Empress, which can be easily identified as their work, even when they were not stamped as created by Percier or Fontaine. Percier and Fontaine are known for their use of cheval glass and the use of a feminine, softer feel for the pieces used in the boudoir of the Empress. These pieces were unique for the time and appreciated for their creativity. The architects Percier and Fontaine are connected to the Empire style associated with the time period.

==In popular culture==

===Statue===
In 1859, French Emperor Napoleon III commissioned a statue of Joséphine, which was installed in the La Savane park in downtown Fort-de-France. In 1991, the statue was symbolically decapitated and spattered with red paint. The acts of vandalism were done on the belief that Joséphine had influenced her husband to issue the Law of 20 May 1802, which reinstated slavery in the French colonial empire (including Martinique). The statue was never repaired by the city administration, and every year more red paint was added to it. In July 2020, the statue was torn down and destroyed by rioters in the wake of the George Floyd protests.

<text>Eugène Rose de Beauharnais (; 3 September 1781 – 21 February 1824) was a French statesman and military officer who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Through the second marriage of his mother, Joséphine de Beauharnais, he was the stepson of Napoleon Bonaparte. Under the French Empire he also became Napoleon&#x27;s adopted son (but not the heir to the imperial throne). He was Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy under his stepfather, from 1805 to 1814, and commanded the Army of Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. Historians consider him one of Napoleon&#x27;s most able relatives.

==Family ==
Eugène Rose de Beauharnais was born in Paris on 3 September 1781 as the son of Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais and Marie-Josèphe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (future empress Josephine), both born in the French colony of Martinique. His parents separated when Eugène was three years old. At the age of five, Eugène was entrusted to his father&#x27;s care, attending various boarding schools. His father served as a general during the early Revolutionary Wars. After losing the Siege of Mainz (1793) he was imprisoned, and executed by guillotine on 23 July 1794, a few days before the fall of Maximilien Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror.

==Early career==

Eugène joined the French Revolutionary Army soon after his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s release from prison, initially serving as an orderly to General Lazare Hoche during the War in the Vendée. He returned to Paris on his mother&#x27;s request &quot;some time before the battle of Quiberon&quot;, according to his memoirs, and was sent back to school in order to complete his education. Neither he nor his sister Hortense were present when their mother married Napoleon Bonaparte. 

After joining the 1st Hussar Regiment as an assistant sub-lieutenant on 30 June 1797, Eugène served as an aide-de-camp to his stepfather in the Italian campaign. After the Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797) he was sent on missions to the Ionian Islands and Rome. In 1798, he followed Napoleon in his campaign in Egypt and Syria, where he took part in the Siege of Jaffa and was wounded during the Siege of Acre.

Eugène returned to France with Napoleon in the autumn of 1799, helping to bring about the reconciliation of the general and his mother, who had become estranged due to their mutual extramarital affairs. During the Coup of 18 Brumaire, he accompanied Napoleon to Saint-Cloud, where they brought the Council of Five Hundred into submission. When Napoleon became First Consul following the coup, Eugène was appointed captain of the &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot; of the Consular Guard. He distinguished himself in the Guard&#x27;s cavalry charges at Battle of Marengo, and was promoted to &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot;. In 1803 he bought Hôtel Beauharnais.

After rising through the ranks under the Consulate, Eugène was promoted to brigade general soon after the establishment of the Empire in 1804. By a decree of 1 February 1805, Eugène was created Arch-Chancellor of State and made a prince of France.

==Viceroy of Italy==
As commander of the Imperial Guard (successor to the Consular Guard), Eugène preceded his stepfather to Milan ahead of Napoleon&#x27;s coronation as King of Italy on 26 May 1805. Napoleon had originally intended to place his brother Joseph on the Italian throne and then, after Joseph&#x27;s refusal, his nephew Napoléon Charles, the son of Louis Bonaparte and Eugène&#x27;s sister, Hortense. However, both Joseph and Louis refused, so Napoleon placed the Iron Crown upon his own head instead. During the coronation, Napoleon handed the royal ring and mantle to his stepson and on 7 June 1805 announced Eugène&#x27;s appointment as Viceroy of Italy to the Italian Legislative Assembly.

In 1805, the War of the Third Coalition was to test Eugène&#x27;s talents as an organizer, if not as a commander. While General André Masséna commanded the Army of Italy, Eugène raised a reserve army to guard the kingdom&#x27;s southern border, after Naples broke its neutrality agreement with France. After the French victory at Austerlitz, Napoleon sought to strengthen Bavaria&#x27;s alliance with France and arranged Eugène&#x27;s marriage to Princess Augusta of Bavaria, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, breaking her engagement to Charles, Hereditary Prince of Baden. On 12 January 1806, Eugène was officially adopted by Napoleon. Though excluded from succession to the French Empire, on 16 February 1806 he was declared heir presumptive to the Italian throne, in the absence of a second son of Napoleon.

Over the following years, Eugène dedicated himself to the management of the Kingdom of Italy, showing himself an astute politician and administrator. He oversaw military works (fortification of Mantua, expansion of the Rocca d&#x27;Anfo), public works (construction of roads, restoration of the Venetian Arsenal, draining of the marshes around Verona), and the promulgation of the Napoleonic civil, commercial, and penal codes. After the kingdom annexed the Marches from the dissolved Papal States, in April 1808, Eugène managed to keep relations with the Holy See from breaking down and rallied the populations of the annexed areas through economic benefits.

During the War of the Fifth Coalition, Eugène was put in command of the Army of Italy with some highly competent generals like Grenier, Charpentier, and the future marshal Étienne MacDonald accompanying him as advisers and officers. In April 1809, he fought and lost the Battle of Sacile against the Austrian army of Archduke John, but Eugène&#x27;s troops won the rematch at the Battle of the Piave in May and the Battle of Raab in June. After the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon recalled the Army of Italy to Austria. After joining the main army on the island of Lobau in the Danube, Eugène took part in the Battle of Wagram.

Napoleon considered making Eugène regent of France during the invasion of Russia but ultimately decided against this. During the campaign, Eugène again commanded the Army of Italy (IV Corps), with a total force of 80,000 men. He fought at the battles of Ostrovno, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Borodino, Maloyaroslavets, Krasnoi, and the Berezina. After Napoleon and then Joachim Murat had left the retreating army in December 1812, Eugène took command of the remnants of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; at Poznań. He led the retreat to Leipzig from January to May 1813, then served under Napoleon at the Battle of Lützen. Eugène then returned to Italy, where he set about reorganizing his troops and preparing the defence against the Austrian Empire.

Despite the defection of Murat&#x27;s Kingdom of Naples in January 1814, and pressure from his Bavarian father-in-law, Eugène refused to defect to the Coalition, while also rejecting calls to leave behind his kingdom and join Napoleon in the defence of France. During the Italian Campaign of 1813-1814, he commanded a series of engagements in the Po Valley in order to slow down the enemy advance, which were in effect a series of organized retreats up to the river Adige. Despite some success against the Austrians at the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814, and successive victories against the Neapolitan Army, he was beaten at the rivers Taro and Nure. On 16 April, five days after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication of both the French and Italian thrones, Eugène signed the with the Austrian commander Heinrich von Bellegarde, bringing an end to hostilities. His attempt to be crowned King of Italy failed after an insurrection in Milan on 20 April, and Eugène finally relinquished control of the kingdom in the Convention of Mantua on 23 April.

==Later life==
After the fall of the Kingdom of Italy, Eugène retired to Munich in June 1814 at the behest of his father-in-law. He soon returned to Paris on the death of his mother, where he was honourably received by Louis XVIII and Alexander I of Russia. He immediately renounced his political activity and returned to his wife&#x27;s family in Bavaria. Accordingly, he remained neutral during Napoleon&#x27;s return to power in the Hundred Days.

As Duke of Leuchtenberg, Eugène lived his last years in Munich managing his estates and expanding his art collection. At the same time, he provided assistance for proscripts under the Bourbon Restoration, such as Antoine Marie Chamans de Lavalette, and lobbied for the alleviation of the harsh treatment imposed on Napoleon in his captivity in Saint-Helena. In 1822, Eugène&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. After suffering two attacks of apoplexy in 1823, he died on 21 February 1824 in Munich, aged 42.

==Marriage and issue==
On 14 January 1806, two days after his adoption by Napoleon, Eugène married Princess Augusta Amalia Ludovika Georgia of Bavaria (1788–1851), eldest daughter of Napoleon&#x27;s ally, King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. Although a diplomatic marriage, this union would turn out to be a happy one. On 14 November 1817, his father-in-law made him Duke of Leuchtenberg and Prince of Eichstätt, with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

Eugène and Augusta had seven children:
* Princess Joséphine Maximiliane Eugénie Napoléonne de Beauharnais (1807–1876); became the Queen Consort to King Oscar I of Sweden, himself the son of Napoleon&#x27;s old love, Désirée Clary.
* Princess Eugénie Hortense Auguste de Beauharnais (1808–1847); married Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen.
* Prince Auguste Charles Eugène Napoléon de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg (1810–1835); married Queen Maria II of Portugal. There was no issue with this marriage.
* Princess Amélie Auguste Eugénie Napoléone de Beauharnais (31 July 1812 – 26 January 1873); was the second wife of Pedro I of Brazil (father of Maria II of Portugal) and became Empress of Brazil.
* Princess Theodelinde Louise Eugénie Auguste Napoléone de Beauharnais (1814–1857); married Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach.
* Princess Carolina Clotilde de Beauharnais (1816)
* Prince Maximilian Josèphe Eugène Auguste Napoléon de Beauharnais (1817–1852); married Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna of Russia, eldest daughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, and received the title of &quot;Prince Romanovsky&quot;, addressed as &quot;His Imperial Highness&quot;, in 1852.

==Roles and titles==
On 20 December 1807, he was given the title of &quot;Prince de Venise&quot; (&quot;Prince of Venice&quot;), a title created on 30 March 1806, when the Venetian Province taken from Austria in 1805 was united to Bonaparte&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy.

In 1810, Napoleon used his influence over Karl von Dalberg, Archbishop of Regensburg and Grand Duke of Frankfurt, to name Eugène as constitutional heir of the grand duchy. Von Dalberg abdicated on 26 October 1813 due to Frankfurt&#x27;s imminent conquest by the allied armies, and Eugène became nominal grand duke until Frankfurt was occupied by the allies in December of that same year.

A further imperial sinecure was &quot;Archichancelier d&#x27;État de l&#x27;Empire de France&quot; (&quot;Archchancellor of State of the Empire of France&quot;).

His name is inscribed on Column 24 of the Southern Pillar of the Arc du Triomphe, reading .

<text>Pippin or Pepin is a given name and surname. It is a masculine given name of Frankish origin with uncertain meaning. The name was borne by various members of the Carolingian family that ruled the Austrasian Empire in the Middle Ages, in what is now France and the western parts of Germany; most notably Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks and father of Charlemagne. Other variations of the name include Pipin, Pépin (French), Pippen, Pepijn (Dutch), Peppino or Pepino (Italian), and Pepe (Spanish). 

== Origin ==
Wider use of the first name Pepin and its derivatives stem from the Carolingian kings. There are various explanations of the meaning of the name:

* Derived from the Frankish word &quot;bib&quot; meaning &quot;to tremble&quot; (compare modern Dutch &quot;bibberen&quot;, meaning to tremble or shiver), thus it could mean &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;.
* Dutch sources suggest that the name Pepijn is an infantile corruption of Wilbert or Wilbrecht meaning &quot;will&quot; and &quot;bright&quot;, where Wilbert gets shortened into Wilbo which morphed into Pippo and finally into Pepin.
* Late-formed examples of the English surname may alternatively be from Old French &quot;pepin or pipin&quot; ‘seed of a fruit’, and thus a metonymic occupational name for a gardener or grower of fruit trees.
* In Spanish and Italian the names Pepe, Pepin and Peppino are a shortening or nickname for José, Jusepe or Giuseppe, which all are names for Joseph. The Frankish name probably comes from a different stem as the historical figures in these languages are called Pipino, not Peppe or Peppino.

<text>Lycoris (formerly Redmond Linux Corporation) was an American independent software distributor headquartered in Maple Valley, Washington. 

== Background ==

The company was founded in 2000 as Redmond Linux by Joseph Cheek, an entrepreneur who had previously worked for Linuxcare, with the intent to make free software easy enough for anyone to use. In late 2001, it merged with embedded systems company DeepLinux to become Redmond Linux Corporation. The company&#x27;s first product was Redmond Linux Personal, a modified version of Linux. 

The company was renamed to Lycoris in January 2002 and its assets were acquired by Mandriva on June 15, 2005.

== Lycoris Desktop/LX ==
As Lycoris, the company&#x27;s flagship product was Lycoris Desktop/LX, a Linux distribution. The distribution&#x27;s installer was originally based on Caldera International&#x27;s OpenLinux Workstation 3.1 distribution with the rest of the distribution built from the kernel up. The desktop and applications shared a high similarity to Microsoft&#x27;s Windows XP, including the background image that was shipped with the software.

<text>The Hôtel des Invalides (; ), commonly called  (; ), is a complex of buildings in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France, containing museums and monuments, all relating to the military history of France, as well as a hospital and an Old Soldiers&#x27; retirement home, the building&#x27;s original purpose. The buildings house the Musée de l&#x27;Armée, the museum of the Army of France, the Musée des Plans-Reliefs, and the Musée d&#x27;Histoire Contemporaine. The complex also includes the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, the national cathedral of the French military. It is adjacent to the Royal Chapel known as the , the tallest church building in Paris at a height of 107 meters. The latter has been converted into a shrine to some of France&#x27;s leading military figures, most notably the tomb of Napoleon.

==History==

Louis XIV initiated the project by an order dated 24 November 1670 to create a home and hospital for aged and disabled () soldiers, the veterans of his many military campaigns. The initial architect of was Libéral Bruant. The selected site was in the then suburban plain of Grenelle (&quot;plaine de Grenelle&quot;). By the time the enlarged project was completed in 1676, the façade fronting the Seine measured in width, and the complex had fifteen courtyards, the largest being the cour d&#x27;honneur designed for military parades.
The church-and-chapel complex of the Invalides was designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart in 1676, taking inspiration from his great-uncle François Mansart&#x27;s design for a to be built behind the chancel of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the French monarch&#x27;s necropolis since ancient times. Several projects were submitted in the mid-1660s by both Mansart and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was residing in Paris at the time. Mansart&#x27;s second project is very close to Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s concept of the Royal Chapel or Dome Church at , both in terms of its architecture and of its relationship with the adjacent church. Architectural historian Allan Braham has hypothesized that the domed chapel was initially intended to be a new burial place for the Bourbon Dynasty, but that project was not implemented. Instead, the massive building was designated as the private chapel of the monarch, which was attached to the Cathedral attended by the veterans. The Dôme des Invalides remains as one of the prime exemplars of French Baroque architecture, at high, and also as an iconic symbol of France&#x27;s absolute monarchy.

The interior of the dome was painted by Le Brun&#x27;s disciple Charles de La Fosse with a Baroque illusionistic ceiling painting. The painting was completed in 1705.

Meanwhile, Hardouin-Mansart assisted the aged Bruant with the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, Paris, which was finished to Bruant&#x27;s design after the latter died in 1697. Daily attendance of the veterans in the church services was required. Shortly after the veterans&#x27; chapel was started, Louis XIV commissioned Mansart to construct a separate private royal chapel, now named its most striking feature. The Dome chapel was finished in 1706.
Because of its location and significance, the Invalides served as the scene for several key events in French history. On 14 July 1789, it was stormed by Parisian rioters who seized the cannons and muskets stored in its cellars to use against the Bastille later the same day. Napoleon was entombed under the Dome of the Invalides with a grand ceremony in 1840. The separation between the two churches was reinforced in the 19th century with the erection of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb, the creation of the two separate altars, and the construction of a glass wall between the two chapels.

The building retained its primary function as a retirement home and hospital for military veterans (&quot;invalides&quot;) until the early twentieth century. In 1872, the musée d&#x27;artillerie (Artillery Museum) was located within the building to be joined by the musée historique des armées (Historical Museum of the Armies) in 1896. The two institutions were merged to form the present musée de l&#x27;armée in 1905. At the same time, the veterans in residence were dispersed to smaller centres outside Paris. The reason was that adopting a mainly conscript army after 1872 meant a substantial reduction in the number of veterans having the twenty or more years of military service formerly required to enter the Hôpital des Invalides. The building accordingly became too large for its original purpose. The modern complex does, however, still include the facilities detailed below for about a hundred elderly or incapacitated former soldiers.

When the Army Museum at was founded in 1905, the veterans&#x27; chapel was placed under its administrative control. It is now the cathedral of the Diocese of the French Armed Forces, officially known as Cathédrale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides.

===2024 Olympic venue===

The Esplanade des Invalides, the expansive green space in front of the historic Hôtel des Invalides, was a key venue for multiple sports during the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. It hosted archery, para-archery, road cycling, and marathon events, with the Invalides buildings providing a unique backdrop for athletes to compete.

==Architecture==
=== North Front and entrance ===

Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s Dome chapel is large enough to dominate the long façade yet harmonizes with Bruant&#x27;s door under an arched pediment on the north front of Les Invalides. To the north, the courtyard (cour d&#x27;honneur) is extended by a wide public esplanade (&quot;Esplanade des Invalides&quot;) where the embassies of Austria and Finland are neighbors of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all forming one of the grand open spaces in the heart of Paris. At its far end, the Pont Alexandre III links this grand urbanistic axis with the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais. The Pont des Invalides is next, downstream the Seine river.

===The Dome des Invalides===

The Dome is the tallest and most famous of the buildings of Les Invalides. Designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, it takes the form of a Greek cross, on a square plan. Each of the facades is composed of two orders superimposed. The porch is topped by triangular fronton. It is crowned by a dome 90 meters, high, surmounted by lantern bringing the height to 107 meters (351 feet), making it taller than Notre Dame de Paris and the tallest of all Paris church domes.

The dome is actually composed of two domes superimposed. The lower dome is largely open at the base, allowed the visitors below to see the art painted on the dome above by Charles de La Fosse. The windows are masked by the lower dome, which permits natural lighting and gives the impression that viewers are actually seeing the sky, a popular Baroque affect.

The interior of the dome is divided into two separate churches; beneath the dome is the chapel that was used, on rare occasions, by the royal family. Attached to there dome is a separate church, the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, Paris, which was used by the veterans who lived at Les Invalides. They were required to attend daily services in the church.

The painting inside the dome by Charles de la Fosse depicts Saint Louis presenting his sword to Christ and the angels. In the center of the composition, God and the Virgin are surrounded by angel musicians. Saint Louis carries the symbols of royalty; a crown, a garden with flour-des-lys emblems, and a royal mantle. To the right of Christ are placed the symbols of the passion and the suffering of Christ; the cross, nails, a lance, and the crown of thorns.

Charles de la Fosse (1636-1716), a student of Le Brun, was one of the leading painters of the Academy, whose work is also found in the Palace of Versailles. Jules Hardouin Mansard, in charge of all the decoration of the dome, asked La Fosse to decorate the cupola and the pendentives with paintings of the four Evangelists. In the same period, he decorated the salons of Diane and Apollo at the Palace of Versailles.

=== Tomb of Napoleon ===

The Tomb of Napoleon is found within the Church of the Dome. It was created after his remains we returned to France from Saint Helena in 1840. It was prepared by King Louis Philippe I and his Prime Minister, Adolphe Thiers, but it was not completed and inaugurated until
1861. The chief architect was Louis Visconti, who died before the tomb was completed. The sarcophagus made of purple quartzite, on a base of green granite, is placed in an open crypt, The crypt is surrounded by a circular gallery supported by twelve pillars, with relief panel and sculpture celebrating Napoleon&#x27;s accomplishments, represented by figures of Atlantes. (See also Napoleon&#x27;s tomb)

=== Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides ===
In 1957, the position of vicar was created to oversee the spiritual education of the army. In 1986 a position of the Bishop of the armies was established and placed at the church, which gave the church the title of cathedral.

The church is located directly behind the Dome des Invalides. It was originally the church that was used by the army veterans who lived at Les Invalides. They were required to attend daily services in the cathedral. In the original church, the dome, where the royal family worshipped, served as the choir, while the present Cathedral was the nave for the veterans.

One unusual feature of the church is the display of captured enemy flags taken over the years by the French Army.

The cathedral has a particularly fine organ, made between 1679 and 1687, with a vert elaborate case with sculpture designed by architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart.

=== The Courtyard of Honor ===
The organ of the cathedral is particularly notable. It was made by the organ-builder of the King, Alexandre Thierry, between 1679 and 1687, and has undergone several restorations. The elabroate buffet with sculpture was made in 1683. It was specially designed for the church by the architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart.

== The French Army Museum ==
The Army Museum (Musée de l&#x27;Armée) was created in 1905 with the merger of the Musée d&#x27;Artillerie and the Musée Historique de l&#x27;Armée. The museum&#x27;s seven main spaces and departments contain collections that display military equipment span the from the Middle antiquity through the 20th century.

== The Museum of Relief Maps ==
The Musee des Plans-Reliefs displays a collection of military models. It was begun in 1668 the Minister of War of Louis XIV ordered that three-dimensional models be made of fortified cities and strategic places in France. The models were originally held in the Louvre. The collection was enlarged through the 18th centuries, and some models of German fortifications were added. 
The total collection made between 1668 and 1870 has about 150 models. The museum currently displays some twenty-eight models, depicting fortified cities of the French coast.

== Plan of Les Invalides ==

Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s Dome chapel is large enough to dominate the long façade yet harmonizes with Bruant&#x27;s door under an arched pediment on the north front of Les Invalides. To the north, the courtyard (cour d&#x27;honneur) is extended by a wide public esplanade (&quot;Esplanade des Invalides&quot;) where the embassies of Austria and Finland are neighbors of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all forming one of the grand open spaces in the heart of Paris. At its far end, the Pont Alexandre III links this grand urbanistic axis with the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais. The Pont des Invalides is next, downstream the Seine river.

The buildings still comprise the Institution Nationale des Invalides, a national institution for disabled war veterans. The institution comprises:
* a retirement home
* a medical and surgical centre
* a centre for external medical consultations.

==Burials==

The Dome chapel became a military necropolis when Napoleon in September 1800 designated it for the relocation of the tomb of Louis XIV&#x27;s celebrated general Turenne, followed in 1807–1808 by Vauban. In 1835, the underground gallery below the church received the remains of 14 victims of the Giuseppe Marco Fieschi&#x27;s failed assassination attempt on Louis-Philippe I. The significant development came with the building&#x27;s designation to become Napoleon&#x27;s tomb by a law of 10 June 1840, as part of the political project of the orchestrated by king Louis-Philippe I and his minister Adolphe Thiers (the reference to Napoleon&#x27;s or &quot;ashes&quot; is actually to his mortal remains, as he had not been cremated). The creation of the crypt and of Napoleon&#x27;s massive sarcophagus took twenty years to complete and was finished in 1861. By then, it was emperor Napoleon III who was in power and oversaw the ceremony of the transfer of the remains of his uncle from a chapel of the church to the crypt beneath the dome.

===Inside the &quot;Église du Dôme des Invalides&quot;===
The most notable tomb at Les Invalides is that of Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), designed by Louis Visconti with sculptures by James Pradier, Pierre-Charles Simart and Francisque Joseph Duret. Napoleon was initially interred on Saint Helena, but King Louis Philippe arranged for his remains to be brought to France in 1840, an event known as &quot;le retour des cendres&quot;. Napoleon&#x27;s remains were kept in the Saint Jerome (southwestern) chapel of the Dome church for more than two decades until his final resting place, a tomb made of red quartzite and resting on a green granite base, was finished in 1861.

Other military figures and members of Napoleon&#x27;s family were also buried at the Dome church by year of burial there:

<doc id="62634" wikidata="Q1234661" url="?curid=62634" title="Shelob">
<text>Shelob is a fictional monster in the form of a giant spider from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Her lair lies in Cirith Ungol (&quot;the pass of the spider&quot;) leading into Mordor. The creature Gollum deliberately leads the Hobbit protagonist Frodo there in hopes of recovering the One Ring by letting Shelob attack Frodo. The plan is foiled when Samwise Gamgee temporarily blinds Shelob with the Phial of Galadriel, and then severely wounds her with Frodo&#x27;s Elvish sword, Sting.

Some scholars have stated that Shelob is in the literary tradition of female monsters. Others have interpreted her as symbolising a sexual threat, with multiple sexual allusions. Scholars have noted her opposition to the Elves, and in particular her adversary, Galadriel, whose light helps the hobbits to defeat her darkness.

Shelob&#x27;s physical appearance in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy was based on the New Zealand tunnel-web spider.

==Fictional history==
Shelob is described in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as an &quot;evil thing in spider-form...[the] last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world&quot;, living high in the Ephel Dúath mountains on the borders of Mordor. Although she resided in Mordor and was unrepentantly evil, she was independent of Sauron and his influence. Her exact size is not stated, but she is significantly larger than her descendants, the Great Spiders of Mirkwood, and her hobbit opponents. She has a powerful bite to inject her venom and paralyse or kill her victims. Her hide is tough enough to resist sword-strokes, and the strings of her webs are likewise resilient to ordinary blades, though the magical Sting manages to cut them. Her main weak point is her eyes, which can be easily harmed or blinded.

She is introduced as both evil and ancient: &quot;But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness&quot;. Her descendants include the Giant Spiders of Mirkwood defeated by Bilbo Baggins in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Shelob&#x27;s lair was Torech Ungol, below Cirith Ungol (&quot;Pass of the Spider&quot;), along the path that the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee took into Mordor, where Shelob had encountered Gollum during his previous trip to Mordor, and he apparently worshipped her. The Orcs of the Tower of Cirith Ungol called her &quot;Shelob the Great&quot; and &quot;Her Ladyship&quot;, and referred to Gollum as &quot;Her Sneak&quot;. Sauron was aware of her existence, but left her alone as a useful guard on the pass, and occasionally fed prisoners to her. In the story, Gollum deliberately led Frodo and Sam into her lair, planning to recover the One Ring once she had consumed the hobbits. She cornered them; but Frodo used the Phial of Galadriel&#x27;s light to drive her off, and used Sting to cut the webs blocking the tunnel. Gollum waylaid the pair and tried to strangle Sam, while Shelob paralysed Frodo; but Sam fought off Gollum and then wielded Sting against Shelob. Seeking to crush Sam, she instead impaled herself upon Sting; and, being evil, was nearly blinded by the Phial of Galadriel, containing pure light from the Silmarils; whereupon she fled. Her eventual fate, Tolkien mentions in passing, &quot;this tale does not tell.&quot; Thinking Frodo dead, Sam took the Ring from his friend and left his body behind in a bid to finish the quest himself, but discovered by listening to a pair of Orcs that Frodo was alive but senseless, under a minor influence of venom.

== Name ==

As Tolkien admitted in a letter to his son, Shelob &quot;is of course only &#x27;she + lob, &quot;lob&quot; being an archaic English word for spider, influenced by Old English &quot;loppe&quot; or &quot;spider&quot;. The word is not related to &quot;cob&quot; nor &quot;cobweb&quot;. Old English &quot;attercoppe&quot; (meaning &quot;spider&quot;) is derived from &quot;atter&quot; meaning &quot;poison&quot; and &quot;coppe&quot; meaning &quot;head&quot;. Tolkien used &quot;attercop&quot; as well as &quot;cob&quot; and &quot;lob&quot; in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, where Bilbo Baggins sings songs taunting the giant spiders in Mirkwood: &quot;Attercop, Attercop, Old Tomnoddy&quot; and &quot;Lazy Lob and Crazy Cob&quot;.

==Analysis==
=== Darkness opposed to the light ===

The critic Joyce Tally Lionarons writes that Tolkien constructs the Elves and the spiders such as Shelob as polar opposites, the Elves good and bright, the spiders evil and dark. Milbank writes more specifically that the ancient Shelob&#x27;s adversary is another ancient female character, the elf-queen Galadriel. Galadriel both chooses not to be &quot;&quot; by rejecting Frodo&#x27;s offer of the One Ring, and gives Frodo her light (the Phial of Galadriel) which enables the hobbits to defeat Shelob.

Patrick Grant, a scholar of Renaissance literature, saw Shelob and Galadriel&#x27;s character pairing, one of several such relationships between characters in the novel, as fitting the opposition of Jungian archetypes. Frodo&#x27;s anima is the Elf-queen Galadriel, who is opposed by the evil giant female spider Shelob. Frodo&#x27;s Shadow is the male Hobbit Gollum. All of these, along with oppositions between other characters in the story, create an image of the self.

=== Insatiable evil ===

Jane Chance compares Shelob with the wizard Saruman, stating that both are &quot;monsters&quot; that live in &quot;towers&quot;; they have similarly structured books in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, one ending in a military attack on Saruman&#x27;s tower, Orthanc; the other, in the hobbits&#x27; venturing into Shelob&#x27;s lair in Cirith Ungol. On the other hand, she writes, while Saruman&#x27;s evil is in his mind, Shelob&#x27;s is in her body.

Chance stresses Shelob&#x27;s &quot;gluttony&quot;, one of the traditional seven deadly sins, consisting of an &quot;insatiable appetite&quot;; her laziness, since the Orcs bring her food; and her &quot;lechery&quot; with many bastard offspring. Chance compares Shelob with the guardian of the gateway to Hell, noting that in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Satan mated with his daughter, Sin, their offspring being Death, constantly lustful for his mother: but Tolkien in one place describes Shelob as Sauron&#x27;s cat rather than his daughter. The scholar of literature George H. Thomson similarly compares Shelob to Milton&#x27;s Sin and Death, noting that they &quot;serve neither God nor Satan but look solely to their own interests&quot;, as Shelob does; she is &quot;the Death and Chaos that would overcome all&quot;.

=== Sexual monster ===

The Tolkien scholar Carol Leibiger writes that Shelob is presented as a disgusting female monster in the story. The Anglican priest and scholar of religion Alison Milbank adds that Shelob is undeniably sexual: &quot;Tolkien offers a most convincing Freudian &quot;vagina dentata&quot; (toothed vagina) in the ancient and disgustingly gustatory spider Shelob.&quot; Milbank states that Shelob symbolises &quot;an ancient maternal power that swallows up masculine identity and autonomy&quot;, threatening a &quot;castrating hold [which] is precisely what the sexual fetishist fears, and seeks to control&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance mentions &quot;Sam&#x27;s penetration of her belly with his sword&quot;, noting that this may be an appropriate and symbolic way of ending her production of &quot;bastards&quot;.

The scholar of children&#x27;s literature Zoë Jaques writes that Shelob is the &quot;embodiment of monstrous maternity&quot;; Sam&#x27;s battle with Shelob could be interpreted as a &quot;masculine rite of passage&quot; where a smaller, weaker male penetrates and escapes the vast female body and her malicious intent. The Tolkien scholar Brenda Partridge described the hobbits&#x27; protracted struggle with Shelob as rife with sexual symbolism. She writes that Tolkien derived Shelob from multiple myths: Sigurd killing Fafnir the dragon; Theseus killing the Minotaur; Arachne and the spider; and Milton&#x27;s Sin in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The result is to depict the woman as a threat, with implicit overtones of sexuality.

Not all commentators have agreed with the sexual associations detected by scholars such as Partridge. The Tolkien scholar Daniel Timmons wrote in &quot;Mythlore&quot; in 2001: &quot;The obsession of reading the Shelob episode as a sexually violent encounter, rather than as an archetypal struggle between human and monster, likely reveals more about the decadent social attitudes of the critics, rather than those of Tolkien&quot;. Timmons accepted the possibility of a &quot;subtext of the fear of female sexual appeal&quot;, and agreed that the text might &quot;function in the literary tradition of clashes between man and female monsters, with the attendant sexual innuendos&quot;, but called it &quot;disingenuous or perverse&quot; to assert that this was the &quot;main or dominant impression&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In the 1981 BBC Radio adaption of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Shelob is portrayed by BBC Radiophonic Workshop member Jenny Lee.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, Shelob&#x27;s appearance is delayed until the third movie, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. Her design is based on the New Zealand tunnel-web spider, which Jackson hates.

Shelob is a major character in the video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;, where she serves as both the narrator and an ally to player character Talion. In the game, Shelob shape-shifts to assume the form of an attractive woman. Following criticism of this decision, the creative director Michael de Plater explained that Gollum and Shelob were &quot;the unsung heroes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;: Shelob senses Frodo&#x27;s weakness and makes a pact with Gollum to hasten him to Mount Doom and destroy the ring. De Plater envisioned Shelob as a dark counterpart to Galadriel, noting how both manipulate lesser beings, but that Shelob is more honest.

<text>Year 343 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Corvus and Arvina (or, less frequently, year 411 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 343 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* The King of Persia, Artaxerxes III, personally leads the Persian forces invading Egypt. The Persians are keen to access Egypt&#x27;s gold and corn supplies. The town of Pelusium in the Nile Delta puts up resistance, but Pharaoh Nectanebo II is forced to retreat to Memphis. As the situation deteriorates, Nectanebo II leaves for exile in Nubia. His departure marks the end of the 30th Dynasty, the last native house to rule Egypt.
* With Nectanebo II&#x27;s flight, all organised resistance to the Persians collapses, and Egypt is once again reduced to a satrapy of the Persian Empire. A Persian satrap is put in place in Egypt. The walls of the country&#x27;s cities are destroyed and its temples are plundered. Artaxerxes and his commander-in-chief, General Bagoas, leave Egypt loaded with treasure.

==== Greece ====
* The Athenian statesman Demosthenes has Aeschines indicted for treason. However, Aeschines drags up the inappropriate past of one of Demosthenes&#x27; associates, Timarchus and is acquitted by a narrow margin.
* King Philip II of Macedon again marches against Cersobleptes, King of Thrace, defeats him in several battles, and reduces him to the condition of being a tributary.
* Phalaikos unsuccessfully lays siege to Kydonia on the island of Crete.

==== Italy ====
* The native Italian tribes, the Lucanians and Bruttians, press down upon the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia, including Tarentum. Responding to calls for help from these former Greek colonies, King Archidamus III of Sparta sets sail with a band of mercenaries for Italy.
* After his surrender to the Corinthian general Timoleon, who takes over as ruler of Syracuse, the former tyrant, Dionysius II, is allowed to retire to Corinth to live in exile, although he dies within the year. The Syracusan constitution is changed by Timoleon with the new constitution designed to have safeguards against tyranny. Timoleon invites new settlers from Greece to come to Sicily.

==== Roman Republic ====
* First Samnite War began when Rome fought the confederated Samnites over disputed territory in the Middle Liris Valley. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Philetaerus, founder of the Attalid dynasty of Pergamum in Anatolia (approximate date) (d. 263 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Dionysius II, tyrant of Syracuse (b. c. 397 BC)

<text>The Lidice massacre () was the complete destruction of the village of Lidice in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, which is now a part of the Czech Republic, in June 1942 on orders from Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and acting &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; Kurt Daluege, successor to Reinhard Heydrich. It has gained historical attention as one of the most documented instances of German war crimes during the Second World War, particularly given the deliberate killing of children.

In reprisal for the assassination of Reich Protector Heydrich in the late spring of 1942, all 173 men from the village who were over 15 years of age were killed on 10 June 1942. A further 11 men from the village who were not present at the time were later arrested and executed soon afterwards, along with several others who were already under arrest. Out of a total 503 inhabitants, 307 women and children were sent to a makeshift detention center in a Kladno school. Of these, 184 women and 88 children were deported to concentration camps; 7 children who were considered racially suitable and thus eligible for Germanisation were handed over to SS families, and the rest were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp, where they were gassed to death.

The Associated Press, quoting German radio transmissions which it received in New York, said: &quot;All male grownups of the town were shot, while the women were placed in a concentration camp, and the children were entrusted to appropriate educational institutions.&quot; Approximately 340 people from Lidice were murdered in the German reprisal (192 men, 60 women and 88 children). After the war ended, only 143 women and 17 children returned.

Nazi propaganda openly and proudly announced the events at Lidice in direct contrast to the disinformation and secrecy involved with other crimes against civilian populations, with intense outrage occurring among Allied nations and particularly Anglosphere countries. The history has been depicted in multiple forms of media since the end of the conflict. Examples include the internationally known drama film &quot;Operation Daybreak&quot; and the composer Bohuslav Martinů composed the orchestral work &quot;Memorial to Lidice&quot;.

==Background==

===Assassination of Reinhard Heydrich===

From 27 September 1941, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich had been acting as &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; of the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. This area of the former state of Czechoslovakia had been occupied by Nazi Germany since 5 April 1939.

On the morning of 27 May 1942, Heydrich was being driven from his country villa at Panenské Břežany to his office at Prague Castle. When he reached the Kobylisy area of Prague, his car was attacked (on behalf of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile) by the Slovak and Czech soldiers Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. These men, who had been part of a team trained in Great Britain, had parachuted into Bohemia in December 1941 as part of Operation Anthropoid.

After Gabčík&#x27;s Sten gun jammed, Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; Klein, to stop the car. When Heydrich stood up to shoot Gabčík, Kubiš threw a modified anti-tank grenade at Heydrich&#x27;s car. The resulting explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš. Heydrich sent Klein to chase Gabčík on foot and, in an exchange of fire, Gabčík shot Klein in the leg below the knee. Kubiš and Gabčík managed to escape the scene. A Czech woman went to Heydrich&#x27;s aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed on his stomach in the back of the van and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. A splenectomy was performed, and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided. Himmler ordered Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich&#x27;s recovery appeared to progress well. Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor Theodor Morell suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug sulfonamide, but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion. On 4 June Heydrich died from septicaemia caused by pieces of horse hair from the upholstery and his clothing entering his body when the bomb exploded.

===Reprisals===
Late in the afternoon of 27 May, SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Karl Hermann Frank proclaimed a state of emergency and placed a curfew in Prague. Anyone who helped the attackers was to be executed along with their families. A search involving 21,000 men began and 36,000 houses were checked. By 4 June, 157 people had been executed as a result of the reprisals but the assassins had not been found and no information was forthcoming.

The eulogies at Heydrich&#x27;s funeral in Berlin were not yet over when, on 9 June, the decision was made to &quot;make up for his death&quot;. Frank, Secretary of State for the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, reported from Berlin that the &quot;Führer&quot; had commanded the following concerning any village found to have harbored Heydrich&#x27;s killers:

#Execute all men
#Transport all women to a concentration camp
#Gather the children suitable for Germanisation, then place them in SS families in the Reich and bring the rest of the children up in other ways
#Burn down the village and level it entirely

==Massacre==

===Men===
Horst Böhme, the SiPo chief for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately acted on the orders. Members of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; and SD (&quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;) surrounded the village of Lidice, blocking all avenues of escape. The Nazi regime chose this village because its residents were suspected of harbouring local resistance partisans and were associated with aiding Operation Anthropoid team members.
All men of the village were rounded up and taken to the farm of the Horák family on the edge of the village. Mattresses were taken from neighbouring houses where they were stood up against the wall of the Horáks&#x27; barn to prevent ricochets. The shooting of the men commenced at about 7:00 am. At first the men were shot in groups of five, but Böhme thought the executions were proceeding too slowly and ordered that ten men be shot at a time. The dead were left lying where they fell. This continued until the afternoon hours when there were 173 dead. Another 11 men who were not in the village that day were arrested and murdered soon afterwards as were eight men and seven women already under arrest because they had relations serving with the Czechoslovak armies in exile in the United Kingdom. Only three male inhabitants of the village survived the massacre, two of whom were in the Czechoslovak Air Force and stationed in England at the time. The only adult man from Lidice actually in Czechoslovakia who survived this atrocity was František Saidl (1887–1961), the former deputy-mayor of Lidice who had been arrested at the end of 1938 because on 19 December 1938 he accidentally killed his son Eduard Saidl. He was imprisoned for four years and had no idea about this massacre. He found out when he returned home on 23 December 1942. Upon discovering the massacre, he was so distraught he turned himself in to SS officers in the nearby town of Kladno, confessed to being from Lidice, and even said he approved of the assassination of Heydrich. Despite confirming his identity, the SS officers simply laughed at him and turned him away, and he went on to survive the war.

===Women and children===

A total of 203 women and 105 children were first taken to Lidice village school, then the nearby town of Kladno and detained in the grammar school for three days. The children were separated from their mothers and four pregnant women were sent to the same hospital where Heydrich died, forced to undergo abortions and then sent to different concentration camps. On 12 June 1942, 184 women of Lidice were loaded on trucks, driven to Kladno railway station and forced into a special passenger train guarded by an escort. On the morning of 14 June, the train halted on a railway siding at the concentration camp at Ravensbrück. The camp authorities tried to keep the Lidice women isolated, but were prevented from doing so by other inmates. The women were forced to work in leather processing, road building, textile and ammunition factories.

Eighty-eight Lidice children were transported to the area of the former textile factory in Gneisenau Street in Łódź. Their arrival was announced by a telegram from Horst Böhme&#x27;s Prague office which ended with: &quot;the children are only bringing what they wear. No special care is desirable.&quot; The care was minimal and they suffered from a lack of hygiene and from illnesses. By order of the camp management, no medical care was given to the children. Shortly after their arrival in Łódź, officials from the Central Race and Settlement branch chose seven children for Germanisation. The few children considered racially suitable for Germanisation were handed over to SS families.

The furor over Lidice caused some hesitation over the fate of the remaining children but in late June Adolf Eichmann ordered the massacre of the remainder of the children. However, Eichmann was not convicted of this crime at his trial in Jerusalem, as the judges deemed that &quot;... it has not been proven to us beyond reasonable doubt, according to the evidence before us, that they were murdered.&quot; On 2 July, all of the remaining 82 Lidice children were handed over to the Łódź Gestapo office, who sent them to the Chełmno extermination camp away, where they were gassed to death in Magirus gas vans. Out of the 105 Lidice children, 82 were murdered in Chełmno, six were murdered in the German Lebensborn orphanages and 17 returned home.

===Lidice===

The village was set on fire and the remains of the buildings destroyed with explosives. All the animals in the village—pets and beasts of burden—were slaughtered as well. Even those buried in the town cemetery were not spared; their remains were dug up, looted for gold fillings and jewellery, and destroyed. A 100-strong German work party was then sent in to remove all visible remains of the village, re-route the stream running through it and the roads in and out. They then covered the entire area the village had occupied with topsoil and planted crops, and set up a barbed-wire fence around the site which had notices reading, in both Czech and German, &quot;Anyone approaching this fence who does not halt when challenged will be shot&quot;. A film was made of the process by Franz Treml, a collaborator with German intelligence. Treml had run a Zeiss-Ikon shop in Lucerna Palace in Prague and after the Nazi occupation, he became a film adviser for the Nazi Party.

===Further reprisals===

The small Czech village of Ležáky was destroyed two weeks after Lidice, when Gestapo agents found a radio transmitter there that had belonged to an underground team who parachuted in with Kubiš and Gabčík. All 33 adults (both men and women) from the village were shot. The children were sent to concentration camps or &quot;Aryanised&quot;. The death toll resulting from the effort to avenge the death of Heydrich is estimated at over 1,300 people. This count includes relatives of the partisans, their supporters, Czech elites suspected of disloyalty and random victims like those from Lidice.

==Commemorations==

===International response===

Nazi propaganda had openly and proudly announced the events in Lidice, unlike other massacres in occupied Europe which were kept secret. The information was instantly picked up by Allied media. After the massacre Winston Churchill proposed destroying three German villages with incendiary bombing for every village destroyed in reprisals by the Wehrmacht. Anthony Eden, Leo Amery, and Ernest Bevin were supportive of the idea, but Archibald Sinclair, Clement Attlee, Herbert Morrison, and Stafford Cripps convinced him that it would waste resources and open the risk to similar Luftwaffe reprisals against British communities. In September 1942, coal miners in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in Great Britain led by Barnett Stross, a doctor, who in 1945 became a local MP, founded the organisation &quot;Lidice Shall Live&quot; to raise funds for the rebuilding of the village after the war.

Soon after the razing of the village, towns and quarters (neighbourhoods) in various countries were renamed, San Jerónimo Lídice in Mexico City, Barrio Obrero de Lídice (workers quarter of Lidice) and its hospital in Caracas, Venezuela, Lídice de Capira in Panama and towns in Brazil so that the name would live on in spite of Hitler&#x27;s intentions. A neighbourhood in Crest Hill, Illinois, U.S., was renamed from Stern Park to Lidice. There is a shrine at Lidice park on Prairie Avenue in Crest Hill; the original shrine was at the end of Kelly Avenue at Elsie Street. A square in the English city of Coventry, devastated by Luftwaffe bombing, is named after Lidice. An alley in a very crowded area of downtown Santiago, Chile, is named after Lidice and one of the buildings has a small plaque that explains its tragic story. A street in Sofia, Bulgaria, is named to commemorate the massacre and the Lidice Memorial in Phillips, Wisconsin, U.S., was built in memory of the village.

In the wake of the massacre, Humphrey Jennings directed &quot;The Silent Village&quot; (1943), using amateur actors from a Welsh mining village, Cwmgiedd, near the small South Wales town of Ystradgynlais. An American film was made in 1943 called &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot;, but it contained a number of inaccuracies in the story. A more accurate British film, &quot;Operation Daybreak&quot;, starring Timothy Bottoms as Kubiš, Martin Shaw as Čurda and Anthony Andrews as Gabčík, was released in 1975.

American poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a book-length verse play on the massacre, &quot;The Murder of Lidice&quot;, which was excerpted in the 17 October 1942, edition of &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, a larger version of which was published in the 19 October 1942 &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and published in full as a book later that year by Harper.

There is a memorial sculpture and small information panel commemorating the Lidice massacre, in Wallanlagen Park in Bremen, Germany.

===Local response and the new Lidice===
Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů composed his &quot;Memorial to Lidice&quot;, an 8-minute orchestral work, in 1943, as a response to the massacre. The piece quotes from the Czech &quot;St Wenceslas Chorale&quot; and in the climax of the piece, the opening notes (dot-dot-dot-dash = &quot;V&quot; in Morse code) of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony.
Women from Lidice who survived imprisonment at Ravensbrück returned after the Second World War and were rehoused in the new village of Lidice that was built overlooking the original site. The first part of the new village was completed in 1949. Two men from Lidice were in the United Kingdom serving in the Royal Air Force at the time of the massacre. After 1945 Pilot Officer Josef Horák and Flight Lieutenant Josef Stříbrný returned to Czechoslovakia to serve in the Czechoslovak Air Force.

After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état the new Communist Party government would not allow them to apply to be housed in the new Lidice, because they had served in the forces of one of the western powers. Horák and his family returned to Britain and the RAF; he died in a flying accident in December 1948.

A sculpture from the 1990s by Marie Uchytilová overlooks the site of the old village of Lidice. Entitled &quot;The Memorial to the Children Victims of the War&quot; it comprises 82 bronze statues of children (42 girls and 40 boys) aged 1 to 16, to honour the children who were murdered at Chełmno in the summer of 1942. A cross with a crown of thorns marks the mass grave of the Lidice men. Overlooking the site is a memorial area flanked by a museum and a small exhibition hall. The memorial area is linked to the new village by an avenue of linden trees. In 1955 a &quot;Rosarium&quot; of 29,000 rose bushes was created beside the avenue of lindens overlooking the site of the old village. In the 1990s the Rosarium was neglected but after 2001 a new Rosarium with 21,000 bushes was created.

In 2024 as the state of the monument was damaged by time and conditions, a public collection started raising funds to restore it. A surprise donation was made by an American donor that boosted the project as it received $165,000. As it turns out the donor was Donald R. Yadesky, a long-time supporter and member of the Friends of History Society.

<doc id="62638" wikidata="Q836897" url="?curid=62638" title="Oradour-sur-Glane massacre">
<text>On 10 June 1944, four days after D-Day, the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne in Nazi-occupied France was destroyed when 643 civilians, including non-combatant men, women, and children, were massacred by a German &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; company. The execution was retribution in the form of collective punishment for Resistance activity in the area, including the capture and subsequent execution of a close friend of Waffen-SS &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Diekmann, &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Helmut Kämpfe, who an informant incorrectly claimed had been burned alive in front of an audience. Kämpfe was a commander in the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;. 

The Germans murdered everyone they found in the village at the time, as well as people brought in from the surrounding area. The death toll includes people who were merely passing by in the village at the time of the SS company&#x27;s arrival. Men were brought into barns and sheds where they were shot in the legs and doused with petroleum before the barns were set on fire. Women and children were herded into a church that was set on fire; those who tried to escape through the windows were machine gunned. Extensive looting took place.

All in all, 643 people are recorded to have been murdered. The death toll includes 17 Spanish citizens, 8 Italians (a woman with 7 of her 9 children), and 3 Poles.

Six people escaped the massacre. The last living survivor, Robert Hébras, known for his activism for reconciliation between France, Germany, and Austria, died on 11 February 2023, aged 97. He was 18 years old at the time of the massacre.

The village was never rebuilt. A completely new village was built nearby after the war. President Charles de Gaulle ordered that the ruins of the old village be maintained as a permanent memorial and museum.

In 1983 SS-Untersturmfuhrer Heinz Barth became the first senior commander to face trial for the massacre, claiming before a judge that he was shocked that there were any survivors and that the decision was made to wipe the village from the face of the Earth. But there were survivors that were in attendance to see Barth sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Background==

In February 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot; was stationed in the Southern French town of Valence-d&#x27;Agen, north of Toulouse, waiting to be resupplied with new equipment and fresh troops. Following the Normandy landings in June 1944, the division was ordered north to help stop the Allied advance. One of its units was the 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment &quot;Der Führer&quot;. Its staff included regimental commander &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Sylvester Stadler, &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Diekmann commanding the 1st Battalion and &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Otto Weidinger, Stadler&#x27;s designated successor who was with the regiment for familiarisation. Command passed to Weidinger on 14 June.

Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, Diekmann informed Weidinger that he had been approached by two members of the &quot;Milice&quot;, a paramilitary force of the Vichy Regime. They claimed that a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officer was being held prisoner by the French Resistance in Oradour-sur-Vayres, a nearby village. The captured officer was claimed to be &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Helmut Kämpfe, commander of the 2nd SS Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion (also part of the &quot;Das Reich&quot; division). Kämpfe was captured by the Maquis du Limousin the day before while traveling in a German army vehicle marked as an ambulance protected by the Geneva Convention.

==Massacre==
On 10 June, Diekmann&#x27;s battalion sealed off Oradour-sur-Glane and ordered everyone within to assemble in the village square to have their identity papers examined. This included six non-residents who happened to be bicycling through the village when the SS unit arrived. The women and children were locked in the church, and the village was looted. The men were led to six barns and sheds, where machine guns were already in place. According to a survivor&#x27;s account, the SS men then began shooting, aiming for the victims&#x27; legs. When they were unable to move, the SS men covered them with fuel and set the barns on fire. Only six men managed to escape. One of them was later seen walking down a road and was shot dead. In all, 190 of the men died.

==Burning of women and children in the church==
The SS men next proceeded to the church and placed an incendiary device beside it. When it was ignited, women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows, only to be met with machine-gun fire. 247 women and 205 children died in the attack. The only survivor was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She escaped through a rear sacristy window, followed by a young woman and child. All three were shot, two of them fatally. Rouffanche crawled to some pea bushes and remained hidden overnight until she was found and rescued the next morning. About twenty villagers had fled Oradour-sur-Glane as soon as the SS unit had appeared. That night, the village was partially razed.

Several days later, the survivors were allowed to bury the 643 dead inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane who had been killed in just a few hours. Adolf Diekmann said the atrocity was in retaliation for the partisan activity in nearby Tulle and the kidnapping and murder of SS commander Helmut Kämpfe, who was burned alive in a field ambulance with other German soldiers.

Amongst the men of the town killed were three priests who worked in the parish. It was also reported that the SS troops desecrated the church, including deliberately scattering Communion hosts before they forced the women and children into it. The Bishop of Limoges visited the village in the days after the massacre, one of the first public figures to do so, and his account of what he witnessed is one of the earliest available. Amongst those who went to bury the dead and document the event by taking photographs were some local seminarians.

===Murphy report===

Raymond J. Murphy, a 20-year-old American B-17 navigator shot down over Avord, France in late April 1944, witnessed the aftermath of the massacre. After being hidden by the French Resistance, Murphy was flown to England on 6 August, and in debriefing filled in a questionnaire on 7 August and made several drafts of a formal report. The version finally submitted on 15 August has a handwritten addendum:
Murphy&#x27;s report was made public in 2011 after a Freedom of Information Act request by his grandson, an attorney in the United States Department of Justice National Security Division. It is the only account to mention crucifying a baby. Shane Harris concludes that the addendum is a true statement by Murphy and that the town, not named in Murphy&#x27;s report, is very likely Oradour-sur-Glane.

==German response==
Protests at Diekmann&#x27;s unilateral action followed, both from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, General Walter Gleiniger, German commander in Limoges, as well as the Vichy Government. Even Stadler felt Diekmann had far exceeded his orders and began an investigation. However, Diekmann was killed in action shortly afterwards during the Battle of Normandy; many of the 3rd Company, which had conducted the massacre, were also killed in action. The investigation was then suspended.

==Postwar trials==
On 12 January 1953, a military tribunal in Bordeaux heard the charges against the surviving 65 of the 200 or so SS men who had been involved. Only 21 of them were present, as many were in West and East Germany, which would not extradite them. Seven of those present for the charges were German citizens, but 14 were Alsatians, French nationals whose home region had been occupied by Germany in 1940 and later integrated into the German Reich. All but one of the Alsatians claimed to have been forced to join the Waffen-SS. Such forced conscripts from Alsace and Lorraine called themselves the &quot;malgré-nous&quot;, meaning &quot;against our will&quot;.

On 11 February, 19 of the 20 defendants were convicted. Five received terms of imprisonment and two were executed. Continuing uproar in Alsace (including demands for autonomy) pressed the French parliament to pass an amnesty law for all the &quot;malgré-nous&quot; on 19 February. The convicted Alsatian former SS men were released shortly afterwards, which caused bitter protests in the Limousin region.

By 1958 the remaining German defendants had been released. General Heinz Lammerding of the Das Reich division, who had given the orders for retaliation against the Resistance, died in 1971, following a successful entrepreneurial career. At the time of the trial, he lived in Düsseldorf, in the former British occupation zone of West Germany, and the French government never obtained his extradition from West Germany.

The last trial of a Waffen-SS member who had been involved took place in 1983. Former &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Heinz Barth was tracked down in East Germany. Barth had participated in the massacre as a platoon leader in the &quot;&quot;Der Führer&quot; regiment, commanding 45 SS men. He was one of several charged with giving orders to shoot 20 men in a garage. Barth was sentenced to life imprisonment by the First Senate of the City Court of Berlin. He was released from prison in the reunified Germany in 1997 and died in August 2007.

On 8 January 2014, Werner Christukat, an 88-year-old former member of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the &quot;Der Führer&quot;&quot; regiment was charged, by the state court in Cologne, with 25 charges of murder and hundreds of counts of accessory to murder in connection with the massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane. The suspect, who was identified only as Werner C., had until 31 March 2014 to respond to the charges. If the case went to trial, it could have possibly been held in a juvenile court because the suspect was only 19 at the time it occurred. According to his attorney, Rainer Pohlen, the suspect acknowledged being at the village but denied being involved in any killings. On 9 December 2014, the court dropped the case, citing a lack of any witness statements or reliable documentary evidence able to disprove the suspect&#x27;s contention that he was not a part of the massacre. Christukat died in 2020.

==Memorial==
After the war, General Charles de Gaulle decided the village should never be rebuilt, but would remain a memorial to the cruelty of the Nazi occupation. The new village of Oradour-sur-Glane (population 2,375 in 2012), northwest of the site of the massacre, was built after the war. The ruins of the original village remain as a memorial to the dead and to represent similar sites and events.

In 1999 French president Jacques Chirac dedicated a memorial museum, the &quot;Centre de la mémoire d&#x27;Oradour&quot;, near the entrance to the &quot;Village Martyr&quot; (&quot;martyred village&quot;). Its museum includes items recovered from the burned-out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive, glasses melted from the intense heat, and various personal items.On 6 June 2004, at the commemorative ceremony of the Normandy invasion in Caen, German chancellor Gerhard Schröder pledged that Germany would not forget the Nazi atrocities and specifically mentioned Oradour-sur-Glane.

On 4 September 2013, German president Joachim Gauck and French president François Hollande visited the ghost village of Oradour-sur-Glane. A joint news conference broadcast by the two leaders followed their tour of the site. This was the first time a German president had come to the site of one of the biggest World War II massacres on French soil.

On 28 April 2017, French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron visited Oradour-sur-Glane and met with the only remaining survivor of the massacre, Robert Hébras. Hébras was 18 at the time of the massacre and died at age 97 in 2023.

==In popular culture==
Television
* The story of Oradour-sur-Glane was featured in the 1973–74 British documentary television series &quot;The World at War&quot;, narrated by Laurence Olivier. The first and final episodes (1 and 26, entitled &quot;A New Germany&quot; and &quot;Remember&quot; respectively) show helicopter views of the destroyed village, interspersed with pictures of the victims that appear on their graves.
* The massacre is referenced in the 2010 series &quot;World War II in Colour&quot; in the episode &quot;Overlord&quot;, which aired on 7 January 2010. It was also featured in part 2 of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Death Army&quot;, which aired on 27 November 2015, and showed both images from the time along with the ruins as they are today.

Film
* The 1963 Czechoslovak film &quot;Ikarie XB-1&quot; references the massacre, with a character referring to a crew of humans from the 20th century as “&quot;human trash, that left Auschwitz, Oradour, Hiroshima behind them&quot;.”
* The 1975 French film &quot;Le vieux fusil&quot;, is based on these facts.
* The 1989 British film &quot;Souvenir&quot;, is based on the massacre. In the film, an ex-German soldier returns as an American to Oradour-sur-Glane where he participated in atrocities committed by the Nazis, during which his then French lover was murdered. The film is based on the book The Pork Butcher by David Hughes published in 1984 .
* A feature film, &quot;Une Vie avec Oradour&quot;, was released in September 2011 in France.

Literature
* In the 1947 Russian novel &quot;The Storm&quot; by Stalin Prize-winner Ilya Ehrenburg, there is a fictionalized detailed description of the massacre (part vi, chapter a), citing the actual place and the actual SS unit responsible. The novel was published in English in 1948 by the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow, and in 1949 by Gaer Associates of New York.
* In 1984, David Hughes published The Pork Butcher, a novel based on the massacre of the inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane and the subsequent memorialisation of the razed village. The book was made into a film titled Souvenir in 1989.
* In &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot; (1998) by Ian Rankin, Detective Inspector John Rebus investigates a suspected war criminal accused of leading the massacre of the fictional village of Villefranche d&#x27;Albarede, based on Oradour-sur-Glane.
* The poet Gillian Clarke, National Poet of Wales, commemorates the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane in two poems from her 2009 collection &quot;A Recipe for Water&quot;, &quot;Oradour-sur-Glane&quot; and &quot;Singer&quot;.
* In 2013, Helen Watts published &quot;One Day in Oradour&quot;, a short novel based on the events of 1944. Some names of the characters and locations have been changed, and some characters are composites of several individuals.
* In 2015, Ethan Mordden published &quot;One Day in France&quot;, a short novel based on the events of 1944. Covering a twenty-four-hour period and moving back and forth between Oradour and nearby Limoges, the story fits invented characters into the historical record.
* The plot of &quot;The Alice Network&quot;, a 2017 historical novel by American author Kate Quinn, incorporates a reference to the massacre. Real-life survivor Marguerite Rouffanche appears as a minor character.

Music
* Silent Planet&#x27;s 2014 song &quot;Tiny Hands (Au Revoir)&quot; describes the massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane through the eyes of Madame Marguerite Rouffanche, the sole survivor of the church massacre.

Musical
* In 2015, the German musical &quot;Mademoiselle Marie&quot; by Fritz Stiegler (script) and Matthias Lange (music) covered the hostile sentiments of Oradour descendants to Germans in a post-war love story of 1955. Visitors from Oradour to an outdoor performance in front of Cadolzburg Castle (Bavaria) praised it as &quot;a message of reconciliation and tolerance&quot;. In 2017, a French audience in the new village of Oradour-sur-Glane enthusiastically applauded performances by the same (mostly) amateur troupe, which received praise as an act of international understanding.

<text>Year 450 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Second year of the decemviri (or, less frequently, year 304 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 450 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Athenian general Cimon sails to Cyprus with two hundred triremes of the Delian League. From there, he sends sixty ships to Egypt to help the Egyptians under Amyrtaeus, who are fighting the Persians in the Nile Delta. Cimon uses the remaining ships to aid an uprising of the Cypriot Greek city-states against Persian control of the island. He lays siege to the Persian stronghold of Citium on the southern west coast of Cyprus. However, the siege fails and Cyprus remains under Phoenician (and Persian) control.
* During the siege Cimon dies and command of the fleet is given to Anaxicrates, who leaves Citium to engage the Phoenician fleet in the Battle of Salamis in Cyprus. The Greek fleet is victorious against the Persians and their allies and then returns to Athens.
* The Athenians reduce the tribute due from their subject city-states (i.e. members of the Delian League), and each city is allowed to issue its own coinage.
* 5,000 talents are transferred to the treasury of the Delian League in Athens.

==== Macedonia ====
* Perdiccas II succeeds Alexander I as king of Macedonia (approximate date).

==== Roman Republic ====
* The success of the first Decemvirate prompts the appointment of a second Decemvirate which also includes plebeians amongst its members. This second decemviri adds two more headings to their predecessor&#x27;s ten, completing the Law of the Twelve Tables (Lex Duodecim Tabularum), which will form the centrepiece of Roman law for the next several centuries. Nevertheless, this Decemvirate&#x27;s rule becomes increasingly violent and tyrannical.

==== Sicily ====
* After minor preliminary successes (including the capture of Inessa from its Greek colonists), Ducetius, a Hellenised leader of the Siculi, an ancient people of Sicily, is decisively defeated by the combined forces of Syracuse and Acragas. Ducetius flees to exile in Corinth.

=== By topic ===

==== Arts ====
* The Severe (Early Classical) period of sculpture ends in Ancient Greece and is succeeded by the Mature Classical period (approximate date).
* Polykleitos of Argos develops a set of rules (&quot;The Canon&quot;) for constructing the ideal human figure (approximate date).
* Polygnotos of Thasos ceases his work (approximate date).
* The old bouleuterion, the west side of the agora in Athens, is built (approximate date).
* Polykleitos starts making the bronze statue &quot;Achilles&quot; (also known as &quot;The Spear Bearer&quot; or &quot;Doryphoros&quot;), which he finishes about ten years later. A Roman copy of the original bronze is now kept in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, Italy (approximate date).
* The grave stela from Paros, &quot;Little girl with a bird&quot;, is made. It is now kept at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (approximate date).
* The statue &quot;Woman and maid&quot; in the style of Achilles Painter, white-ground and black-figure decoration on a lekythos, with additional painting in tempera, starts being made (finished about ten years later). It is now kept at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (approximate date).
* Myron makes a bronze statue called &quot;The Discus Thrower&quot; (Discobolus). A Roman copy is now kept at Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome (approximate date).
* The Corinthian order makes its first appearance in Greek architecture (approximate date).
* The red-figure decorations &quot;A Painter&quot;, &quot;Assistants Crowned by Athena&quot; and &quot;Victories&quot; are made on a hydria in Athens. They are now kept in a private collection (approximate date).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Alcibiades, Athenian general and politician (d. 404 BC)
* Aristophanes, Greek playwright (approximate year)

== Deaths ==
* Cimon, Athenian statesman and general (b. c. 510 BC)
* Alexander I, king of Macedonia (approximate date)

<text>In vector calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a space, most commonly Euclidean space formula_1. A vector field on a plane can be visualized as a collection of arrows with given magnitudes and directions, each attached to a point on the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout three dimensional space, such as the wind, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from one point to another point.

The elements of differential and integral calculus extend naturally to vector fields. When a vector field represents force, the line integral of a vector field represents the work done by a force moving along a path, and under this interpretation conservation of energy is exhibited as a special case of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Vector fields can usefully be thought of as representing the velocity of a moving flow in space, and this physical intuition leads to notions such as the divergence (which represents the rate of change of volume of a flow) and curl (which represents the rotation of a flow).

A vector field is a special case of a &quot;vector-valued function&quot;, whose domain&#x27;s dimension has no relation to the dimension of its range; for example, the position vector of a space curve is defined only for smaller subset of the ambient space.
Likewise, n coordinates, a vector field on a domain in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_1 can be represented as a vector-valued function that associates an &quot;n&quot;-tuple of real numbers to each point of the domain. This representation of a vector field depends on the coordinate system, and there is a well-defined transformation law (&quot;covariance and contravariance of vectors&quot;) in passing from one coordinate system to the other.

Vector fields are often discussed on open subsets of Euclidean space, but also make sense on other subsets such as surfaces, where they associate an arrow tangent to the surface at each point (a tangent vector).
More generally, vector fields are defined on differentiable manifolds, which are spaces that look like Euclidean space on small scales, but may have more complicated structure on larger scales. In this setting, a vector field gives a tangent vector at each point of the manifold (that is, a section of the tangent bundle to the manifold). Vector fields are one kind of tensor field.

==Definition==

===Vector fields on subsets of Euclidean space===
Given a subset of , a vector field is represented by a vector-valued function in standard Cartesian coordinates . If each component of is continuous, then is a continuous vector field. It is common to focus on smooth vector fields, meaning that each component is a smooth function (differentiable any number of times). A vector field can be visualized as assigning a vector to individual points within an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space.

One standard notation is to write formula_3 for the unit vectors in the coordinate directions. In these terms, every smooth vector field formula_4 on an open subset formula_5 of formula_6 can be written as
:formula_7
for some smooth functions formula_8 on formula_5. The reason for this notation is that a vector field determines a linear map from the space of smooth functions to itself, formula_10, given by differentiating in the direction of the vector field.

Example: The vector field formula_11 describes a counterclockwise rotation around the origin in formula_12. To show that the function formula_13 is rotationally invariant, compute:
:formula_14

Given vector fields , defined on and a smooth function defined on , the operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition,
formula_15
formula_16
make the smooth vector fields into a module over the ring of smooth functions, where multiplication of functions is defined pointwise.

===Coordinate transformation law===
In physics, a vector is additionally distinguished by how its coordinates change when one measures the same vector with respect to a different background coordinate system. The transformation properties of vectors distinguish a vector as a geometrically distinct entity from a simple list of scalars, or from a covector.

Thus, suppose that is a choice of Cartesian coordinates, in terms of which the components of the vector are
formula_17
and suppose that (&quot;y&quot;1...,&quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) are &quot;n&quot; functions of the &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; defining a different coordinate system. Then the components of the vector &quot;V&quot; in the new coordinates are required to satisfy the transformation law
Such a transformation law is called contravariant. A similar transformation law characterizes vector fields in physics: specifically, a vector field is a specification of &quot;n&quot; functions in each coordinate system subject to the transformation law () relating the different coordinate systems.

Vector fields are thus contrasted with scalar fields, which associate a number or &quot;scalar&quot; to every point in space, and are also contrasted with simple lists of scalar fields, which do not transform under coordinate changes.

===Vector fields on manifolds===

Given a differentiable manifold formula_18, a vector field on formula_18 is an assignment of a tangent vector to each point in formula_18. More precisely, a vector field formula_21 is a mapping from formula_18 into the tangent bundle formula_23 so that formula_24 is the identity mapping
where formula_25 denotes the projection from formula_23 to formula_18. In other words, a vector field is a section of the tangent bundle.

An alternative definition: A smooth vector field formula_28 on a manifold formula_18 is a linear map formula_30 such that formula_28 is a derivation: formula_32 for all formula_33.

If the manifold formula_18 is smooth or analytic—that is, the change of coordinates is smooth (analytic)—then one can make sense of the notion of smooth (analytic) vector fields. The collection of all smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold formula_18 is often denoted by formula_36 or formula_37 (especially when thinking of vector fields as sections); the collection of all smooth vector fields is also denoted by formula_38 (a fraktur &quot;X&quot;).

==Examples==
* A vector field for the movement of air on Earth will associate for every point on the surface of the Earth a vector with the wind speed and direction for that point. This can be drawn using arrows to represent the wind; the length (magnitude) of the arrow will be an indication of the wind speed. A &quot;high&quot; on the usual barometric pressure map would then act as a source (arrows pointing away), and a &quot;low&quot; would be a sink (arrows pointing towards), since air tends to move from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.
* Velocity field of a moving fluid. In this case, a velocity vector is associated to each point in the fluid.
* Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines are 3 types of lines that can be made from (time-dependent) vector fields. They are:
** streaklines: the line produced by particles passing through a specific fixed point over various times
** pathlines: showing the path that a given particle (of zero mass) would follow.
** streamlines (or fieldlines): the path of a particle influenced by the instantaneous field (i.e., the path of a particle if the field is held fixed).
* Magnetic fields. The fieldlines can be revealed using small iron filings.
* Maxwell&#x27;s equations allow us to use a given set of initial and boundary conditions to deduce, for every point in Euclidean space, a magnitude and direction for the force experienced by a charged test particle at that point; the resulting vector field is the electric field.
* A gravitational field generated by any massive object is also a vector field. For example, the gravitational field vectors for a spherically symmetric body would all point towards the sphere&#x27;s center with the magnitude of the vectors reducing as radial distance from the body increases.

===Gradient field in Euclidean spaces===

Vector fields can be constructed out of scalar fields using the gradient operator (denoted by the del: ∇).

A vector field &quot;V&quot; defined on an open set &quot;S&quot; is called a gradient field or a conservative field if there exists a real-valued function (a scalar field) &quot;f&quot; on &quot;S&quot; such that
formula_39

The associated flow is called the , and is used in the method of gradient descent.

The path integral along any closed curve &quot;γ&quot; (&quot;γ&quot;(0) = &quot;γ&quot;(1)) in a conservative field is zero:
formula_40

===Central field in euclidean spaces===
A -vector field over is called a central field if
formula_41
where is the orthogonal group. We say central fields are invariant under orthogonal transformations around 0.

The point 0 is called the center of the field.

Since orthogonal transformations are actually rotations and reflections, the invariance conditions mean that vectors of a central field are always directed towards, or away from, 0; this is an alternate (and simpler) definition. A central field is always a gradient field, since defining it on one semiaxis and integrating gives an antigradient.

==Operations on vector fields==

===Line integral===

A common technique in physics is to integrate a vector field along a curve, also called determining its line integral. Intuitively this is summing up all vector components in line with the tangents to the curve, expressed as their scalar products. For example, given a particle in a force field (e.g. gravitation), where each vector at some point in space represents the force acting there on the particle, the line integral along a certain path is the work done on the particle, when it travels along this path. Intuitively, it is the sum of the scalar products of the force vector and the small tangent vector in each point along the curve.

The line integral is constructed analogously to the Riemann integral and it exists if the curve is rectifiable (has finite length) and the vector field is continuous.

Given a vector field and a curve , parametrized by in (where and are real numbers), the line integral is defined as
formula_42

To show vector field topology one can use line integral convolution.

===Divergence===

The divergence of a vector field on Euclidean space is a function (or scalar field). In three-dimensions, the divergence is defined by
formula_43

with the obvious generalization to arbitrary dimensions. The divergence at a point represents the degree to which a small volume around the point is a source or a sink for the vector flow, a result which is made precise by the divergence theorem.

The divergence can also be defined on a Riemannian manifold, that is, a manifold with a Riemannian metric that measures the length of vectors.

===Curl in three dimensions===

The curl is an operation which takes a vector field and produces another vector field. The curl is defined only in three dimensions, but some properties of the curl can be captured in higher dimensions with the exterior derivative. In three dimensions, it is defined by
formula_44

The curl measures the density of the angular momentum of the vector flow at a point, that is, the amount to which the flow circulates around a fixed axis. This intuitive description is made precise by Stokes&#x27; theorem.

===Index of a vector field===
The index of a vector field is an integer that helps describe its behaviour around an isolated zero (i.e., an isolated singularity of the field). In the plane, the index takes the value −1 at a saddle singularity but +1 at a source or sink singularity.

Let &quot;n be&quot; the dimension of the manifold on which the vector field is defined. Take a closed surface (homeomorphic to the (n-1)-sphere) S around the zero, so that no other zeros lie in the interior of S. A map from this sphere to a unit sphere of dimension &quot;n&quot; − 1 can be constructed by dividing each vector on this sphere by its length to form a unit length vector, which is a point on the unit sphere S&quot;n&quot;−1. This defines a continuous map from S to S&quot;n&quot;−1. The index of the vector field at the point is the degree of this map. It can be shown that this integer does not depend on the choice of S, and therefore depends only on the vector field itself.

The index is not defined at any non-singular point (i.e., a point where the vector is non-zero). It is equal to +1 around a source, and more generally equal to (−1)&quot;k&quot; around a saddle that has &quot;k&quot; contracting dimensions and &quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot; expanding dimensions.

The index of the vector field as a whole is defined when it has just finitely many zeroes. In this case, all zeroes are isolated, and the index of the vector field is defined to be the sum of the indices at all zeroes.

For an ordinary (2-dimensional) sphere in three-dimensional space, it can be shown that the index of any vector field on the sphere must be 2. This shows that every such vector field must have a zero. This implies the hairy ball theorem.

For a vector field on a compact manifold with finitely many zeroes, the Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that the vector field’s index is the manifold’s Euler characteristic.

==Physical intuition==
Michael Faraday, in his concept of &quot;lines of force,&quot; emphasized that the field &quot;itself&quot; should be an object of study, which it has become throughout physics in the form of field theory.

In addition to the magnetic field, other phenomena that were modeled by Faraday include the electrical field and light field.

In recent decades many phenomenological formulations of irreversible dynamics and evolution equations in physics, from the mechanics of complex fluids and solids to chemical kinetics and quantum thermodynamics, have converged towards the geometric idea of &quot;steepest entropy ascent&quot; or &quot;gradient flow&quot; as a consistent universal modeling framework that guarantees compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics and extends well-known near-equilibrium results such as Onsager reciprocity to the far-nonequilibrium realm.

==Flow curves==

Consider the flow of a fluid through a region of space. At any given time, any point of the fluid has a particular velocity associated with it; thus there is a vector field associated to any flow. The converse is also true: it is possible to associate a flow to a vector field having that vector field as its velocity.

Given a vector field formula_4 defined on formula_5, one defines curves formula_47 on formula_5 such that for each formula_49 in an interval formula_50,
formula_51

By the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, if formula_4 is Lipschitz continuous there is a &quot;unique&quot; formula_53-curve formula_54 for each point formula_55 in formula_5 so that, for some formula_57,
formula_58

The curves formula_54 are called integral curves or trajectories (or less commonly, flow lines) of the vector field formula_4 and partition formula_5 into equivalence classes. It is not always possible to extend the interval formula_62 to the whole real number line. The flow may for example reach the edge of formula_5 in a finite time.

In two or three dimensions one can visualize the vector field as giving rise to a flow on formula_5. If we drop a particle into this flow at a point formula_25 it will move along the curve formula_66 in the flow depending on the initial point formula_25. If formula_25 is a stationary point of formula_4 (i.e., the vector field is equal to the zero vector at the point formula_25), then the particle will remain at formula_25.

Typical applications are pathline in fluid, geodesic flow, and one-parameter subgroups and the exponential map in Lie groups.

=== Complete vector fields ===
By definition, a vector field on formula_18 is called complete if each of its flow curves exists for all time. In particular, compactly supported vector fields on a manifold are complete. If formula_28 is a complete vector field on formula_18, then the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the flow along formula_28 exists for all time; it is described by a smooth mapping
:formula_76
On a compact manifold without boundary, every smooth vector field is complete. An example of an incomplete vector field formula_4 on the real line formula_78 is given by formula_79. For, the differential equation formula_80, with initial condition formula_81, has as its unique solution formula_82 if formula_83 (and formula_84 for all formula_85 if formula_86). Hence for formula_83, formula_88 is undefined at formula_89 so cannot be defined for all values of formula_49.

===The Lie bracket===
The flows associated to two vector fields need not commute with each other. Their failure to commute is described by the Lie bracket of two vector fields, which is again a vector field. The Lie bracket has a simple definition in terms of the action of vector fields on smooth functions formula_91:
:formula_92

==&quot;f&quot;-relatedness==
Given a smooth function between manifolds, formula_93, the derivative is an induced map on tangent bundles, formula_94. Given vector fields formula_95 and formula_96, we say that formula_97 is formula_91-related to formula_4 if the equation formula_100 holds.

If formula_101 is formula_91-related to formula_103, formula_104, then the Lie bracket formula_105 is formula_91-related to formula_107.

==Generalizations==
Replacing vectors by &quot;p&quot;-vectors (&quot;p&quot;th exterior power of vectors) yields &quot;p&quot;-vector fields; taking the dual space and exterior powers yields differential &quot;k&quot;-forms, and combining these yields general tensor fields.

Algebraically, vector fields can be characterized as derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on the manifold, which leads to defining a vector field on a commutative algebra as a derivation on the algebra, which is developed in the theory of differential calculus over commutative algebras.

<text>Bag End is the underground dwelling of the Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo Baggins in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novels &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. From there, both Bilbo and Frodo set out on their adventures, and both return there, for a while. As such, Bag End represents the familiar, safe, comfortable place which is the antithesis of the dangerous places that they visit. It forms one end of the main story arcs in the novels, and since the Hobbits return there, it also forms an end point in the story circle in each case. 

Tolkien described himself as a Hobbit in all but size. Scholars have noted that Bag End is a vision of Tolkien&#x27;s ideal home, and effectively an expression of character. Peter Jackson built an elaborate Hobbiton film set including a detailed Bag End in New Zealand for his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series.

== Description ==

=== J. R. R. Tolkien ===

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; begins with &quot;among the most famous first lines in literature&quot;:

The protagonists of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, lived at Bag End, a luxurious &quot;smial&quot; or Hobbit-burrow, dug into The Hill on the north side of the town of Hobbiton in the Shire&#x27;s Westfarthing. Tolkien made drawings of Bag End and Hobbiton. His watercolour &quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water&quot; shows the exterior and the surrounding countryside. Tolkien made several pencil and ink sketches for these subjects, only gradually settling on Bag End&#x27;s final location and architecture.

Another of Tolkien&#x27;s drawings, &quot;The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire&quot;, depicts the interior, complete with 20th century fittings such as a wall clock and barometer. Another clock is mentioned in chapter 2 of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The barometer is mentioned in Tolkien&#x27;s drafts of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.&#x27;

=== Peter Jackson ===

Peter Jackson had an elaborate Hobbiton film set built on the Alexander sheep farm at Matamata in New Zealand for his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series. It included a water-mill, the Green Dragon Inn, and several Hobbit-holes as well as Bag End in a small hill, with garden. Jackson said of the set, &quot;It felt as if you could open the circular green door of Bag End and find Bilbo Baggins inside.&quot;

Chad Chisholm and colleagues, reviewing Jackson&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; for &quot;Mallorn&quot;, write that Jackson humorously has the &quot;rough and ready&quot; Dwarves &quot;bursting into Bilbo&#x27;s neat little home and cleaning out his pantry&quot;, providing &quot;a sort of constant comic relief to the dangers in the dark&quot;.

== Analysis ==

=== Real-world origins ===

&quot;Bag End&quot; was the real name of the Tudor home, dated to 1413, of Tolkien&#x27;s aunt Jane Neave in the village of Dormston, Worcestershire.
The scholar of literature and film Steven Woodward and the architectural historian Kostis Kourelis suggest that Tolkien may have based his Hobbit-holes on Iceland&#x27;s turf houses, such as those at Keldur.

=== Character from architecture ===

Tolkien stated &quot;I am in fact a Hobbit&quot;, and scholars agree that he was in many ways like his Hobbits, enjoying good food, gardening, smoking a pipe, and living in a familiar and comfortable home. Tolkien makes Bag End a place where, in the Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger&#x27;s words, &quot;most readers feel severely tempted to put on their imaginary slippers and settle down to a piece of cake and some tea.&quot; Honegger argues that places have a critical role in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the function of the safe Hobbit-hole is to establish the character of the &quot;&quot;hol-bytlan&quot; (hole-dwellers), in the first place stationary beings who have a deep-rooted aversion against travelling outside the Shire.&quot; For them, Honegger writes, &quot;Travelling abroad belongs to the same class as adventures&quot;, quoting Bilbo&#x27;s remark in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: &quot;Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!&quot;

Joseph Wright&#x27;s 1898–1905 &quot;The English Dialect Dictionary&quot; has an entry for &quot;hobman&quot;, one of many possible sources of the word &quot;hobbit&quot;, which states that &quot;Each elf-man or hobman had his habitation, to which he gave his name&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Michael Livingston comments that from this it is easy &quot;to recall the man-like, elf-friend, hole-dwelling hobbit Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, hired by the not-too-dissimilar dwarves to commit thievery&quot;.

The scholar of literature Johanna Brooke writes in the &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot; that the character of Bilbo Baggins can be inferred from the architecture of Bag End, just as that of Hobbits in general can be deduced from their preference for living in holes. She suggests that Bag End is an Arts and Crafts building, fitting into the ideas of the designer William Morris and others in the period between 1880 and 1920. Features such as Bag End&#x27;s panelled walls, tiles, and carpet could all, Brooke writes, have been manufactured by Morris &amp; Co., while the prosperous Hobbit-hole clearly indicates that Bilbo is middle-class. Its position at the top of The Hill &quot;demonstrates a physical and social elevation above other hole-owners&quot;, since as Tolkien wrote in the Prologue to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels...were not everywhere to be found&quot;. 

Brooke notes Tolkien&#x27;s statement that &quot;only the richest and poorest&quot; in fact were able to continue the traditional Hobbit-practice of living in holes: the poor might have, as Tolkien said, &quot;burrows of the most primitive kind... with only one window or none&quot;. Bag End is sharply contrasted with such a burrow, its best rooms being provided with &quot;deep-set round windows&quot;. Brooke comments that Tolkien has shown this in &quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water&quot;, where Bag End has several windows while the Hobbit-holes further down (of Bagshot Row) have fewer. Other signifiers of wealth and class include such Victorian era comforts as a dining-room, multiple pantries, and wardrobes. Such things could indicate, Brooke writes, that Bag End&#x27;s owner is &quot;indulgent, overly-luxurious, too comfortable, a tad vain even&quot;, though against this, the hanging-space for many hats and coats suggests that welcoming guests is important to him. Brooke quotes Morris&#x27;s remark that &quot;the working man cannot afford to live in anything that an architect could design; moderate-sized rabbit-warrens [are] for rich middle-class men&quot;, stating that with its mention of rabbit warrens, this &quot;aptly suits Bag End&quot;.

The cartographer Karen Wynn Fonstad created a plan of Bag End, showing her vision of its comfortable layout with many cellars and pantries, complete with multiple fireplaces and chimneys, based on the clues given by Tolkien in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Her plan makes Bag End some long and up to wide, cut into the Hill. Honegger writes that Fonstad&#x27;s work has contributed substantially to giving Middle-earth an &quot;independent existence&quot;.

=== Only one outlet ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the name Bag End is a direct translation of the French &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; (&quot;bottom of [a] bag&quot;), something that he calls &quot;a silly phrase... a piece of &#x27;French-oriented snobbery&#x27;, used in England to mean a dead end, a road with only one outlet&quot;; he notes that the French say &quot;impasse&quot; for the same thing. The journeys of Bilbo and Frodo have been interpreted as just such confined roads, as they both start and end in Bag End. According to Don D. Elgin, Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;A Walking Song&quot;, which appears repeatedly in differing forms in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as the quest progresses, is &quot;a song about the roads that go ever on until they return to at last to the familiar things they have always known.&quot; As such, it forms one end of the main story arcs in both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and since the Hobbits return there, it also forms an end point in the story circle in each case.

=== The most desirable residence ===
The journalist Matthew Dennison compares Lobelia Sackville-Baggins&#x27;s desire to move into Bag End to the similarly-named aristocrat Vita Sackville-West&#x27;s passionate attachment to her family home, Knole House, which she was unable to inherit. Sackville-West became famous as a novelist and poet, and by the time &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was published, as &quot;The Observer&quot;″s gardening columnist. Dennison notes that &quot;Lobelia&quot; is a garden flower, and that readers in the 1950s would immediately have linked the character to the famous gardener. 

Shippey argues that the Bagginses and the Sackville-Bagginses are &quot;connected opposites&quot;, since the opposite of a bourgeois is a burglar, a person who breaks into bourgeois houses, and in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; Bilbo is asked to become a burglar, to break into the lair of Smaug the dragon. He observes that the name Sackville-Baggins, for the snobbish branch of the Baggins family, is a philological joke, as &quot;Sac[k]-ville&quot; can be translated as the French form of the humble &quot;Bag Town&quot;, another attempt to reinforce the family&#x27;s bourgeois status by &quot;Frenchify[ing]&quot; their surname.

=== Contrasts with faraway places ===

The historian Joseph Loconte wrote that Tolkien had set up a contrast between Frodo&#x27;s light and serene Bag End and the corrupted wizard Saruman&#x27;s dark and industrially destructive Isengard. Loconte likens this to the contrast in Tolkien&#x27;s fellow-Inkling C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1950 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; between the delightful but humble home of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, and the icy opulence of the palace of the White Witch. In Loconte&#x27;s view, both authors &quot;reintroduce[d] into the popular imagination a Christian vision of hope in a world tortured by doubt and disillusionment&quot;.

Honegger points out a quite different contrast, between Bag End as depicted in Tolkien&#x27;s drawing &quot;The Hall at Bag End&quot;, &quot;the homely yet narrowly limited space of a hobbit-hole with the similarly neat and defined landscape of the Shire in the background,&quot; with his &quot;The Forest of Lothlórien in Spring&quot;, which shows &quot;no particular place, but an airy glade in a forest filled with sunlight, evoking a feeling of sheltered openness.&quot; If the Shire is a &quot;secluded [and] remote &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; idyll&quot;, then, Honegger suggests, Lothlórien is a &quot;transcendental [or] idealised idyll&quot;. Further, the comfortable Hobbit-holes of the Shire stand in contrast to the untamed nature of the Old Forest, the idyllic Rivendell, and even to what had been the &quot;promised land&quot; of the Dwarves, Moria. The same applies, Honegger argues, to time: where Bag End and the Shire are anachronistically in the present, the Old Forest, Rivendell, and Lothlórien represent journeys back into the past.

=== Strangeness ===

Bag End receives strange visitors – Gandalf and the Dwarves, making it seem a &quot;queer place&quot;, in the character Ted Sandyman&#x27;s words, &quot;and its folk are queerer&quot;. Bilbo and Frodo come to be seen as strange also. Bilbo is &quot;very rich and very peculiar&quot;, not least because he seems not to grow old, but also because he went on a journey outside the Shire, and returned changed. David LaFontaine writes in &quot;The Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide&quot; that Bilbo is a &quot;confirmed bachelor&quot; who is never &quot;linked romantically&quot; with any woman, and who lives alone in the &quot;luxurious, lovely environment&quot;, Bag End, &quot;illustrating the hobbit&#x27;s artistic sensibility&quot;. LaFontaine comments that Tolkien admires Bilbo&#x27;s &quot;unconventional lifestyle ... almost to the point of envy.&quot; To LaFontaine, Tolkien&#x27;s account of Bilbo&#x27;s &quot;queerness&quot; is to be interpreted as a portrait of a homosexual man.

== Parody ==

The 1969 parody novel &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, written by the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; founders Henry Beard and Douglas Kenney, mocks Frodo&#x27;s homecoming from his dangerous quest to Bag End with the words &quot;he walked directly to his cozy fire and slumped in the chair. He began to muse upon the years of delicious boredom that lay ahead. Perhaps he would take up Scrabble&quot;.

<text>Asure Software, Inc. is a software company. Prior to September 13, 2007, the company was known as Forgent Networks. After rebranding as Asure Software, the company expanded into offering human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, time &amp; attendance, talent management, human resource management, benefits administration and insurance services.

It also had a software division, NetSimplicity, which specialized in room scheduling and fixed assets&#x27; management software., which was spun off in 2019.

==Patents and litigation==

===JPEG===
In 2002, while known as Forgent, the company claimed that through its subsidiary, Compression Labs, it owned the patent rights on the JPEG image compression standard, which is widely used on the World Wide Web. Its claim arose from a patent that had been filed on October 27, 1986, and granted on October 6, 1987: by Wen-Hsiung Chen and Daniel J. Klenke. While Forgent did not own Compression Labs at the time, Chen later sold the company to Forgent before joining Cisco.

Critics claim that the legal principle of laches, hence not asserting one&#x27;s rights in a timely manner, invalidates Forgent&#x27;s claims on the patent. They also noted the similarity to Unisys&#x27; attempts to assert rights over the GIF image compression standard via LZW patent enforcement. The JPEG committee responded to Forgent&#x27;s claims, stating that it believes prior art exists that would invalidate Forgent&#x27;s claims, and launched a search for prior art evidence. The 1992 JPEG specification cited two earlier research papers written by Wen-Hsiung Chen, published in 1977 and 1984. JPEG representative Richard Clark also claimed that Chen sat in one of the JPEG committees, but Forgent denied this claim.

In April 2004, Forgent stated that 30 companies had already paid US$90 million in royalties. On April 23, lawsuits were filed against 31 companies, including Adobe Systems, Apple Computer and IBM, for infringement of their patent. On September 26, 2005, Axis Communications, one of the defendants, announced a settlement with Compression Labs Inc.; the terms were not disclosed. As of late October 2005, six companies were known to have licensed the patent from Forgent including Adobe, Macromedia, Axis, Color Dreams, and Research In Motion.

On May 25, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the broadest part of Forgent&#x27;s claims, stating prior art submitted by the Public Patent Foundation invalidated those claims. PubPat&#x27;s Executive Director, Dan Ravicher, says that the submitters knew about the prior art but failed to tell the USPTO about it. On August 11, 2006, Forgent received notice from the NASDAQ stock market regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which can lead to delisting, before coming back into compliance in January 2007.

The company issued a press release on November 1, 2006, stating that they settled their remaining claims against roughly 60 companies for a total of $8 million which was paid by, among other companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.

===Digital video recorders===
Forgent Networks shifted its focus to a computer controlled video system, allowing playback during recording. While the patent was filed in 1991, the first litigation was initiated in 2005. On May 21, 2007, U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas ruled in favor of EchoStar Communications Corporation, on grounds that the Forgent patent is invalid.

===Asure Software===
After Forgent Networks acquired iEmployee and changed its name to Asure Software, the website of the combined company no longer listed information related to the two patents - &#x27;672 and &#x27;746, unlike the old Forgent Networks website.

===Proxy Fight===
In 2008, the company was the target of a proxy fight launched by Pinnacle Fund (&quot;Pinnacle&quot;) and Red Oak Partners, managed by David Sandberg. After negotiations, a slate of 5 new directors was elected on August 28, 2009 to replace the previous board. 

==Acquisitions==
On September 13, 2007, Forgent acquired iEmployee.

On October 3, 2011, Asure Software announced that it had acquired ADI Time, a vendor of cloud computing time and attendance software and labor management services. On March 21, 2016, it announced the acquisition of Mangrove Employer Services, which developed human resource management software; it began massive layoffs of previous Mangrove employees in June 2016.

In May 2017, Asure acquired the Tampa-based company Compass HRM Inc. In May 2017, it acquired iSystems LLC, creators of the Evolution payroll service-bureau software. In January 2018 it acquired Sheakley PaySystems in a move to acquire their clients in the Midwest.

In April 2018, Asure acquired Austin HR, an Austin based HR Consulting &amp; Payroll &amp; Benefit Administration company. On December 2, 2019, Asure Software announced that it completed the sale of its Workspace Management Business to FM:Systems.

<doc id="62645" wikidata="Q1353312" url="?curid=62645" title="Risc PC">
<text>Risc PC was a range of personal computers launched in 1994 by Acorn, replacing the Archimedes series. The machines use the Acorn developed ARM CPU and were thereby not IBM PC-compatible. 

At launch, the original Risc PC 600 model was fitted as standard with an ARM 610, a 32-bit RISC CPU with 4KB of cache and clocked at 30MHz. CPU technology advanced rapidly in this period though and within only two years a DEC StrongARM could be installed at 233MHz which was around 8 times faster.

The machines were supplied with the RISC OS operating system which has a windowed cooperative multi-tasking design. Unusually for a PC of the period the O/S was stored in ROM, which enabled a relatively fast boot time. In addition Acorn sold a Virtual PC package that permitted x86 applications to be run in a virtual machine, they also supported the development of an ARM Linux distribution, from 1996.

In contrast to most contemporary IBM clones, the machines supported multiple processors as a standard feature. Secondary (or &quot;guest&quot;) CPUs did not need to be ARM based and could be an entirely different architecture. It was possible to add an x86 CPU which enabled use of operating systems including DOS and Windows 95. Cards could often be added to other machines of the era to run DOS software but more usually these would implement the majority of an IBM PC clone on the card. The Risc PC required only the addition of the relevant CPU with some interface logic.

Alternate operating systems ran concurrently with RISC OS in a window. Applications from both operating systems could run at the same time in a similar fashion to a virtual machine with data shared between them. While now a ubiquitous technology, this was a less common feature in 1994 and more usually only one operating system would run at once on a single PC.

The Risc PC had a novel case design where additional chassis, known as &quot;slices&quot;, could be stacked on top of each other, expanding the height of the machine. Up to six additional slices could be stacked, each containing additional drives or expansion cards (known as &quot;podules&quot;). At the time the IBM clone industry was standardised around the PCI bus, but Acorn used its own bus implementation that was not compatible and required its own unique expansion cards. The machines did use the then industry standard IDE or SCSI drives found in contemporary PCs. 

Acorn discontinued production of the Risc PC in 1998 after a corporate reorganisation but Castle Technology continued manufacturing the machines until 2003 and subsequently then produced their own similar designs. RISC OS is still available after becoming an open source product.

== Technical specifications ==

== Use ==
The Risc PC was used by music composers and scorewriters to run the Sibelius scorewriting software.

Between 1994 and 2008, the Risc PC and A7000+ were used in television for broadcast automation, programmed by the UK company OmniBus Systems: once considered &quot;the world leader in television station automation&quot; and at one point automating &quot;every national news programme on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom&quot;. The Risc PC, in the form of the OmniBus Workstation, and a customised version of the A7000+ built into a 19-inch rack mount unit, known as the OmniBus Interface Unit, were used to control/automate multiple television broadcast devices from other manufacturers in a way that was unusual at the time. In 2002, OmniBus products were &quot;in constant use worldwide at nearly 100 broadcasters&quot; including the BBC and ITN.

== Timeline ==
* 1994 – Risc PC 600 launched, featuring a 30 MHz ARM610 CPU.
* 1995 – 40 MHz ARM710 CPU upgrade and Risc PC 700 model launched.
* 1996 – 200 MHz StrongARM CPU upgrade released, offering a five-fold increase in raw processing power compared to the ARM7 used in the previous high-end machines.
* 1997 – Acorn launch Acorn J233 StrongARM Risc PC, featuring an uprated 233 MHz model of StrongARM and including Browser and Java software.
* 1998 – Castle Technology acquire the rights to continue to market and produce the Risc PC during the breakup of Acorn Computers.
* 2000 – In May, Castle Technology reveal the Kinetic Risc PC range which included a faster processor card with onboard memory.
* 2001 – Viewfinder Podule, AGP adapter allows the use of IBM PC clone AGP graphics cards (e.g. a range of ATI Rage and Radeon).
* 2003 – Castle Technology announce the end of production and sale of the Risc PC.

== Risc PC 2 ==

Acorn set about designing the Risc PC 2, later renamed to Phoebe 2100 a design with a 64 MHz front-side bus, PCI slots, and a yellow NLX form-factor case. Slated for release in late 1998, the project was abandoned just before completion, when Acorn&#x27;s Workstation Division was closed. Only two prototypes were ever built, and one was publicly displayed for historical interest at the RISC OS 2001 show in Berkshire, England. The remaining cases were bought by CTA Direct who sold them off to the public.

== After Acorn ==
In 2003 it was confirmed that no more Risc PCs would be produced. However RISC OS computers based on other ARM processors machines have been manufactured by companies since this date.

* Castle Technology – Iyonix PC based on the Intel XScale ARM processor and PCI bus
* Advantage Six – A9home based on the Samsung S3C2440 ARM processor
* RiscStation – R7500 based on the ARM7500-FE processor

Significantly better performance has been reached on the aged Risc PC design by using the newer 203 (and later 236) MHz StrongARM CPU, using third-party video cards, overclocking, and having specially-designed CPU cards with RAM located upon them to sidestep the speed bottleneck of the slow system bus.

== Limitations ==
The 16 MHz front-side bus is usually recognised as being the most significant fault of the computer; and the arrival of the (five times faster) StrongARM processor in 1996 meant that the Risc PC had a CPU significantly faster than the computer had been designed for. Acorn had originally expected ARM CPUs to progress from the 30 MHz ARM6 to the 40 MHz ARM7, and then onto the ARM8 cores, which at the time were clocked at around 50–80 MHz. In 2000, Castle released &quot;Kinetic&quot;, a new StrongARM processor board with its own onboard memory slots augmenting main memory, reducing the need to negotiate the slow front-side bus for memory accesses.

The podule bus on the Risc PC can achieve a maximum data throughput of approximately 6100 KByte/s. It is 32-bit and Risc PC predecessors have a 16-bit bus. For comparison, the PCI bus, which was available in systems at the time of the Risc PC&#x27;s introduction, is over 20 times faster. The transfer of 650 MB would take 2 minutes via podule, compared to 5 seconds via PCI.

<text>All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well is a play by William Shakespeare, published in the First Folio in 1623, where it is listed among the comedies. There is a debate about the date of its composition, with possible dates ranging from 1598 to 1608.

The play is considered one of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;problem plays&quot;, a play that poses complex ethical dilemmas that require more than typically simple solutions.

==Synopsis==

Helena, the low-born ward of a French-Spanish countess, is in love with the countess&#x27;s son Bertram, who is indifferent to her. Bertram goes to Paris to replace his late father as attendant to the ailing King of France. Helena, the daughter of a recently deceased physician, follows Bertram, ostensibly to offer the King her services as a healer. The King is skeptical, and she guarantees the cure with her life: if he dies, she will be put to death, but if he lives, she may choose a husband from the court.

The King is cured and Helena chooses Bertram, who rejects her, owing to her poverty and low status. The King forces him to marry her, but after the ceremony Bertram immediately goes to war in Italy without so much as a goodbye kiss. He says that he will only marry her after she has carried his child and got his family ring from him. Helena returns home to the countess, who is horrified at what her son has done, and claims Helena as her child in Bertram&#x27;s place.

In Italy, Bertram is a successful warrior and becomes infatuated with Diana, the virgin daughter of an impoverished local noblewoman. Helena follows Bertram to Italy, befriends Diana, and arranges to take Diana&#x27;s place in bed with him. Diana obtains Bertram&#x27;s ring in exchange for one of Helena&#x27;s. In this way Helena, without Bertram&#x27;s knowledge, consummates their marriage and is given his ring.

Helena fakes her own death. Bertram, thinking he is free of her, comes home. He tries to marry a French lord&#x27;s daughter with whom he had previously fallen in love, but Diana shows up and breaks up the engagement. Helena appears and explains the ring swap, announcing that she has fulfilled Bertram&#x27;s challenge; Bertram, impressed by all she has done to win him, swears his love to her. Thus all ends well.

There is a subplot about Parolles, a disloyal friend of Bertram&#x27;s. Helena, Lafew, the Countess, her fool Lavatch and the two Lords Dumaine have all realised that Parolles is a boastful coward, but Bertram still takes him to war with him. The two Lords convince Parolles to cross into enemy territory to fetch a drum lost in battle. While he is on his way, they pose as enemy soldiers, kidnap him, blindfold him, and, with Bertram observing, get him both to betray his friends and to surrender a letter warning Diana about Bertram&#x27;s lascivious character.

==Sources==

The play is based on the tale of Giletta di Narbona (tale nine of day three) of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;. F. E. Halliday speculated that Shakespeare may have read a French translation of the tale in William Painter&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot;.

==Analysis and criticism==

There is no evidence that &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; was popular in Shakespeare&#x27;s time and it has remained one of his lesser-known plays ever since, in part due to its unorthodox mixture of fairy tale logic, gender role reversals and cynical realism. Helena&#x27;s love for the seemingly unlovable Bertram is difficult to explain on the page, but in performance, it can be made acceptable by casting an extremely attractive actor and emphasising the possibility of a homosexual relationship between Bertram and the &quot;clothes horse&quot; fop Parolles: &quot;A filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl&quot; (Act III, scene 5). This interpretation also assists at the point in the final scene when Bertram suddenly switches from hatred to love in just one line. This is considered a particular problem for actors trained to admire psychological realism. Some alternative readings emphasise the &quot;if&quot; in his equivocal promise: &quot;If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I&#x27;ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.&quot; Here, there has been no change of heart at all. Productions like London&#x27;s National Theatre in 2009 have Bertram make his promise seemingly normally, but then end the play hand in hand with Helena, staring out at the audience with a look of &quot;aghast bewilderment&quot; suggesting he relented only to save face in front of the King. A 2018 interpretation by director Caroline Byrne at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, effects Bertram&#x27;s reconciliation with Helena by having him make good his vow (Act 2 Scene 2) of taking her as his wife only when she bears his child; as well as Bertram&#x27;s ring, Helena brings their infant child to their final confrontation before the king.
Many critics consider the truncated ending a drawback, with Bertram&#x27;s conversion so sudden. Speculative explanations have been given for this. There is (as always) possibly missing text. Some suggest that Bertram&#x27;s conversion is meant to be sudden and magical in keeping with the play&#x27;s &#x27;clever wench performing tasks to win an unwilling higher-born husband&#x27; theme. Some think that Bertram is not meant to be contemptible but merely a callow youth learning valuable lessons about values. Andrew Hadfield of the University of Sussex argues that contemporary audiences would readily have recognised Bertram&#x27;s enforced marriage as a metaphor for the new requirement (1606) for Catholics to swear an Oath of Allegiance to Protestant King James.

Many directors have taken the view that when Shakespeare wrote a comedy, he intended there to be a happy ending, and accordingly that the concluding scene should be staged as such. Elijah Moshinsky in his BBC Television Shakespeare version in 1981 had his Bertram (Ian Charleson) give Helena a tender kiss and speak wonderingly. Despite his outrageous actions, Bertram can come across as beguiling; the 1967 RSC performance with Ian Richardson as Bertram by various accounts (&quot;The New Cambridge Shakespeare&quot;, 2003 etc.) managed to make Bertram sympathetic, even charming. Charleson&#x27;s Bertram was cold and egotistical but still attractive.

One character who has been admired is the Countess of Roussillon, whom Shaw thought &quot;the most beautiful old woman&#x27;s part ever written&quot;. Modern productions are often promoted as vehicles for great mature actresses; recent examples have starred Judi Dench and Peggy Ashcroft, who delivered a performance of &quot;entranc[ing]...worldly wisdom and compassion&quot; in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s sympathetic, &quot;Chekhovian&quot; staging at Stratford in 1982. In the BBC Television Shakespeare production she was played by Celia Johnson, dressed and posed as Rembrandt&#x27;s portrait of Margaretha de Geer.

It has recently been argued that Thomas Middleton either collaborated with Shakespeare on the play or revised it at a later time, but the proposed revisions are not universally accepted.

==Performance history==

No records of early performances of &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; have been found. In 1741, the work was played at Goodman&#x27;s Fields, with a later transfer to Drury Lane. Rehearsals at Drury Lane started in October 1741 but William Milward (1702–1742), playing the king, fell ill, and the opening was delayed until 22 January. Peg Woffington, playing Helena, fainted on the first night and her part was read. Milward fell ill again on 2 February and died on 6 February. This, together with unsubstantiated tales of more illnesses befalling other actresses during the run, gave the play an &quot;unlucky&quot; reputation, similar to that attached to &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which may have curtailed the number of revivals.

Henry Woodward (1714–1777) popularised the part of Parolles in the era of David Garrick. Sporadic performances followed in the ensuing decades, with an operatic version at Covent Garden in 1832.

The play, with plot elements drawn from romance and the ribald tale, depends on gender role conventions, both as expressed (Bertram) and challenged (Helena). With evolving conventions of gender roles, Victorian objections centred on the character of Helena, who was variously deemed predatory, immodest and both &quot;really despicable&quot; and a &quot;doormat&quot; by Ellen Terry, who also—and rather contradictorily—accused her of &quot;hunt[ing] men down in the most undignified way&quot;. Terry&#x27;s friend George Bernard Shaw greatly admired Helena&#x27;s character, comparing her with the New Woman figures such as Nora in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. The editor of the Arden Shakespeare volume summed up 19th-century repugnance: &quot;everyone who reads this play is at first shocked and perplexed by the revolting idea that underlies the plot.&quot;

In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term &quot;problem play&quot; to include the unpopular work, grouping it with &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;.

<doc id="62653" wikidata="Q45301" url="?curid=62653" title="Trabzon">
<text>Trabzon, historically known as Trebizond, is a city on the Black Sea coast of northeastern Turkey and the capital of Trabzon Province. The city was founded in 756 BC as &quot;Trapezous&quot; by colonists from Miletus. It was included into the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great and was later part of the independent Kingdom of Pontus that challenged Rome until 68 BC. Thenceforth part of the Roman and later Byzantine Empire, the city was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond, one of the successor states of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In 1461 it came under Ottoman rule. During the early modern period, Trabzon, because of the importance of its port, again became a focal point of trade to Persia and the Caucasus. Today Trabzon is the second largest city and port on the Black Sea coast of Turkey with a population of almost 300,000.

==Name==
The Turkish name of the city is Trabzon. The first recorded name of the city is the Greek (&#x27;), referencing the table-like central hill between the Zağnos (İskeleboz) and Kuzgun streams on which it was founded (&#x27; meant &quot;table&quot; in Ancient Greek; note the table on the coin in the figure). In Latin, Trabzon is called &#x27;, which is a latinization of its ancient Greek name. Both in Pontic Greek and Modern Greek, it is called (&#x27;). In Ottoman Turkish and Persian, it is written as . During Ottoman times, &quot;Tara Bozan&quot; was also used. In Laz it is known as (&quot;T&#x27;amt&#x27;ra&quot;) or &quot;T&#x27;rap&#x27;uzani&quot;, in Georgian it is (&quot;T&#x27;rap&#x27;izoni&quot;) and in Armenian it is (&quot;Trapizon&quot;). The 19th-century Armenian travelling priest Byjiskian called the city by other, native names, including &quot;Hurşidabat&quot; and &quot;Ozinis&quot;. Western geographers and writers used many spelling variations of the name throughout the Middle Ages. These versions of the name, which have incidentally been used in English literature as well, include: &quot;Trebizonde&quot; (Fr.), &quot;Trapezunt&quot; (German), &quot;Trebisonda&quot; (Sp.), &quot;Trapesunta&quot; (It.), &quot;Trapisonda&quot;, &quot;Tribisonde&quot;, &quot;Terabesoun&quot;, &quot;Trabesun&quot;, &quot;Trabuzan&quot;, &quot;Trabizond&quot; and &quot;Tarabossan&quot;.

In Spanish the name was known from chivalric romances and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.
Because of its similarity to and , acquired the meaning &quot;hullabaloo, imbroglio&quot;.

==History==

===Iron Age and Classical Antiquity===

Before the city was founded as a Greek colony the area was dominated by Colchians (west Georgian) and Chaldian (Anatolian) tribes. The Hayasa, who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian Hittites in the 14th century BC, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the Macrones and the Chalybes as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the Laz, who were part of the monarchy of the Colchis, together with other related Georgian peoples.

The city was founded in classical antiquity in 756 BC as Tραπεζούς (&quot;Trapezous&quot;), by Milesian traders from Sinope. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian &quot;emporia&quot; or trading colonies along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included Abydos and Cyzicus in the Dardanelles, and nearby Kerasous. Like most Greek colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony, Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested to have occurred in the city already in the 4th century BC, according to a silver drachma coin from Trapezus in the British Museum, London. Cyrus the Great added the city to the Achaemenid Empire, and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a satrapy).
Trebizond&#x27;s trade partners included the Mossynoeci. When Xenophon and the Ten Thousand mercenaries were fighting their way out of Persia, the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, &quot;Anabasis&quot;, 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon&#x27;s force resolved this in the rebels&#x27; favor, and so in Trebizond&#x27;s interest.

Up until the conquests of Alexander the Great the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of Mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god Mithra. In the 2nd century BC, the city with its natural harbours was added to the Kingdom of Pontus by Pharnaces I. Mithridates VI Eupator made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.

After the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BC, the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the Roman province of Galatia two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the &quot;Classis Pontica&quot;. The city received the status of civitas libera, extending its judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trebizond gained importance for its access to roads leading over the Zigana Pass to the Armenian frontier or the upper Euphrates valley. New roads were constructed from Persia and Mesopotamia under the rule of Vespasian. In the next century, the emperor Hadrian commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor. The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border (limes). A mithraeum now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (&quot;Kızlar Manastırı&quot;) in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.

Septimius Severus punished Trebizond for having supported his rival Pescennius Niger during the Year of the Five Emperors. In 257 the city was pillaged by the Goths, despite reportedly being defended by &quot;10,000 above its usual garrison&quot; and two bands of walls. Trebizond was subsequently rebuilt, pillaged again, by the Persians, in 258, and then rebuilt once more. It did not soon recover. Only in the reign of Diocletian does an inscription allude to the restoration of the city; Ammianus Marcellinus had nothing to say of Trebizond except that it was &quot;not an obscure town.&quot; 

Christianity had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of Eugenius and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila. Eugenius had destroyed the statue of Mithras which overlooked the city from Mount Minthrion (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established Vazelon Monastery in 270 AD and Sumela Monastery in 386 AD. As early as the First Council of Nicea, Trebizond had its own bishop. Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the Metropolitan Bishop of Poti. Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Lazica.

===Byzantine period===

By the time of Justinian, the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general Belisarius &quot;long adorned the church of St. Basil.&quot; An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls at Justinian&#x27;s expense following an earthquake. At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a quadrivium curriculum. The university drew students not just from the Byzantine Empire, but from Armenia as well.

The city regained importance when it became the seat of the theme of Chaldia. Trebizond also benefited when the trade route regained importance in the 8th to 10th centuries; 10th-century Muslim authors note that Trebizond was frequented by Muslim merchants, as the main source transshipping Byzantine silks into eastern Muslim countries. According to the 10th century Arab geographer Abul Feda it was regarded as being largely a Lazian port. The Italian maritime republics such as the Republic of Venice and in particular the Republic of Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries, using Trebizond as an important seaport for trading goods between Europe and Asia. Some of the Silk Road caravans carrying goods from Asia stopped at the port of Trebizond, where the European merchants purchased these goods and carried them to the port cities of Europe with ships. This trade provided a source of revenue to the state in the form of custom duties, or &quot;kommerkiaroi&quot;, levied on the goods sold in Trebizond. The Greeks protected the coastal and inland trade routes with a vast network of garrison forts.

Following the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Trebizond came under Seljuk rule. This rule proved transient when an expert soldier and local aristocrat, Theodore Gabras took control of the city from the Turkish invaders, and regarded Trebizond, in the words of Anna Comnena, &quot;as a prize which had fallen to his own lot&quot; and ruled it as his own kingdom. Supporting Comnena&#x27;s assertion, Simon Bendall has identified a group of rare coins he believes was minted by Gabras and his successors. Although he was killed by the Turks in 1098, other members of his family continued his de facto independent rule into the next century.

===Empire of Trebizond===
The Empire of Trebizond was formed after Georgian expedition in Chaldia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Located at the far northeastern corner of Anatolia, it was the longest surviving of the Byzantine successor states. Byzantine authors, such as Pachymeres, and to some extent Trapezuntines such as Lazaropoulos and Bessarion, regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a Lazian border state. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Lascaris and later with the Palaiologos, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.


Geographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of little more than a narrow strip along the southern coast of the Black Sea, and not much further inland than the Pontic Mountains. However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trebizond. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification &quot;Leonkastron&quot;, just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306. The Venetians likewise built a trading outpost in the city, a few hundred meters to the west of the Genoese. In between these two Italian colonies settled many other European traders, and it thus became known as the &quot;European Quarter&quot;. Small groups of Italians continued to live in the city until the early decades of the 20th century. One of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was Marco Polo, who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown Venice with a ship; passing by Constantinople (Istanbul) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261.
Together with Persian goods, Italian traders brought stories about the city to Western Europe. Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Miguel de Cervantes and François Rabelais gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city. Next to literature, the legendary history of the city – and that of the Pontus in general – also influenced the creation of paintings, theatre plays and operas in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.

The city also played a role in the early Renaissance; the western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond&#x27;s political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially Alexios II of Trebizond and his grandson Alexios III were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university Gregory Choniades opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Abd al-Rahman al-Khazini from Tabriz, which he translated into Greek. These works later found their way to western Europe, together with the astrolabe. The observatory Choniades built would become known for its accurate solar eclipse predictions, but was probably used mostly for astrological purposes for the emperor and/or the church. Scientists and philosophers of Trebizond were among the first western thinkers to compare contemporaneous theories with classical Greek texts. Basilios Bessarion and George of Trebizond travelled to Italy and taught and published works on Plato and Aristotle, starting a fierce debate and literary tradition that continues to this day on the topic of national identity and global citizenship. They were so influential that Bessarion was considered for the position of Pope, and George could survive as an academic even after being defamed for his heavy criticism of Plato.

The Black Death arrived at the city in September 1347, probably via Kaffa. At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the Trapezuntine Civil War.

In 1340, Tur Ali Beg, an early ancestor of the Aq Qoyunlu, raided Trebizond. In 1348, he besieged Trebizond, however he failed and lifted the siege. Later on, Alexios III of Trebizond gave his sister to Kutlu Beg son of Tur Ali Beg, and established a kinship with them.

Constantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, who also conquered Trebizond eight years later, in 1461.

Its demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of Greek Orthodox inhabitants, usually referred to as Pontic Greeks, continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand Greek Muslims still live in the area, mostly in the Çaykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city and possibly a few Crypto-Christians in the Tonya/Gümüşhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.

===Ottoman era===
The last Emperor of Trebizond, David, surrendered the city to Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Following this takeover, Mehmed II sent many Turkish settlers into the area, but the old ethnic Greek, Laz and Armenian communities remained. According to the Ottoman tax books (&quot;tahrir defterleri&quot;), the total population of taxable adult males (only those with a household) in the city was 1,473 in the year 1523.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern Times page 27/28&quot;&gt;&quot;The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times&quot;, Richard G. Hovannisian, page 27/28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of the city was much higher. Approximately 85% of the population was Christian, and 15% Muslim. Thirteen percent of the adult males belonged to the Armenian community, while the vast majority of Christians were Greeks. However, a significant portion of the local Christians were Islamized by the end of the 17th century - especially those outside the city - according to a research by Prof. Halil İnalcık on the Ottoman tax books (&quot;tahrir defterleri&quot;). Between 1461 and 1598 Trabzon remained the administrative center of the wider region; first as &#x27;sanjac center&#x27; of Rum Eyalet, later of Erzincan-Bayburt eyalet, Anadolu Eyalet, and Erzurum Eyalet.

In 1598 it became the capital of its own province - the Eyalet of Trebizond - which in 1867 became the Vilayet of Trebizond. During the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, his son Prince Selim (later Sultan Selim I) was the Sanjak-bey of Trabzon, and Selim I&#x27;s son Suleiman the Magnificent was born in Trabzon in 1494. The Ottoman government often appointed local Chepni Turks and Laz beys as the regional beylerbey. It is also recorded that some Bosniaks were appointed by the Sublime Porte as the regional beylerbeys in Trabzon. The Eyalet of Trabzon had always sent troops for the Ottoman campaigns in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Trebizond had a wealthy merchant class during the late Ottoman period, and the local Christian minority had a substantial influence in terms of culture, economy and politics. A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trebizond even became the main port for Persian exports. The opening of the Suez Canal greatly diminished the international trading position of the city, but did not halt the economic development of the region. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. As the population of the province greatly expanded due to increased living standards, many families and young men - mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims - chose to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the cities which had been newly established there. Among these migrants were the grandparents of Bob Dylan and Greek politicians and artists. Many Christian and Muslim families from Trabzon also moved to Constantinople, where they established businesses or sought employment - such as the grandfather of Ahmet Ertegün. These migrants were active in a wide range of trades including baking, confection, tailoring, carpentry, education, advocacy, politics and administration. The influence of this diaspora has since continued, and can still be seen in the many restaurants and shops in cities around the Black Sea in the 21st century such as in Istanbul, Odesa and Mariupol. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the Circassian genocide.

Next to Constantinople, Smyrna (now İzmir) and Salonika (now Thessaloniki), Trebizond was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892. Hundreds of schools were constructed in the province during the first half of the 19th century, giving the region one of the highest literacy rates of the empire. First, the Greek community set up their schools, but soon the Muslim and Armenian communities followed. International schools were also established in the city; An American school, five French schools, a Persian school and a number of Italian schools were opened in the second half of the 19th century. The city got a post office in 1845. New churches and mosques were built in the second half of the 19th century, as well as the first theater, public and private printing houses, multiple photo studios and banks. The oldest known photographs of the city center date from the 1860s and depict one of the last camel trains from Persia.

Between one and two thousand Armenians are believed to have been killed in the Trebizond vilayet during the Hamidian massacres of 1895. While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France. The large Greek population of the city was not affected by the massacre. Ivan Aivazovsky made the painting &quot;Massacre of the Armenians in Trebizond 1895&quot; based on the events. Due to the high number of Western Europeans in the city, news from the region was being reported on in many European newspapers. These western newspapers were in turn also very popular among the residents of the city.

===Modern era===
In 1901 the harbour was equipped with cranes by Stothert &amp; Pitt of Bath in England. In 1912 the Sümer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The start of the First World War brought an abrupt end to the relatively peaceful and prosperous period the city had seen during the previous century. First Trebizond would lose many of its young male citizens at the Battle of Sarikamish in the winter of 1914–15, while during those same months the Russian navy bombarded the city a total of five times, taking 1300 lives. Especially the port quarter Çömlekçi and surrounding neighborhoods were targeted.

In July 1915 most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of Gümüşhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the Armenian genocide were reportedly taken out to sea in boats which were then capsized. In some areas of Trebizond province - such as the Karadere river valley in modern-day Araklı, 25 kilometers east of the city - the local Muslim population tried to protect the Christian Armenians.

The coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier became the site of key battles between the Ottoman and Russian armies during the Trebizond Campaign, as part of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I. The Russian army landed at Atina, east of Rize on March 4, 1916. Lazistan Sanjak fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and Çaykara some 50 km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west. The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop Chrysantos Philippidis. 

Chrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the Russian Caucasus Army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich. There was also a massacre of Armenians and Greeks in Trabzon just before the Russian takeover of the city. 

In early 1917 Chrysantos tried to broker a peace between the Russians and the Ottomans, to no avail. During the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting and looting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. Governor Chrysantos was able to calm the Russian soldiers down, and the Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern Anatolia. In March and April of 1918 the city hosted the Trebizond Peace Conference, where the Ottomans agreed to give up their military gains in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the eastern borders of the empire in Anatolia by the Transcaucasian Seim (a short-lived transcaucasian government). 

In December 1918 Trabzon deputy governor Hafız Mehmet gave a speech at the Ottoman parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trebizond province Cemal Azmi – a non-native appointee who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion – for orchestrating the Armenian genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trebizond in early 1919 (see Trebizond during the Armenian genocide). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.

During the Turkish War of Independence several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond province rebelled against the new army of Mustafa Kemal (notably in Bafra and Santa), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Chrysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trebizond opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the Erzurum Congress. 

The governor and mayor of Trebizond were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects, and the government of Trabzon thus refused arms to Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s henchman Topal Osman, who was responsible for mass murders in the western Pontus which were part of the Greek genocide. Osman was forced out of the city by armed Turkish port-workers. Governor Chrysantos travelled to the Paris Peace Conference, where he proposed the establishment of the Republic of Pontus, which would protect its different ethnic groups. For this he was condemned to death by the Turkish Nationalist forces, and he could not return to his post in Trebizond. Instead, the city was to be handed to &#x27;Wilsonian Armenia&#x27;, which likewise never materialized. Following the war, the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and replaced with the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). As part of this new treaty, Trebizond became part of the new Turkish Republic. The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trebizond only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual forced population exchange. This exchange included well over 100,000 Greeks from Trebizond and the vicinity, who moved to Greece (founding the new towns of Nea Trapezounta, Pieria and Nea Trapezounta, Grevena amongst others). 

During the war Trebizond parliamentarian Ali Şükrü Bey had been one of the leading figures of the first Turkish opposition party. In his newspaper &quot;Tan&quot;, Şükrü and colleagues publicized critiques of the Kemalist government, such as towards the violence perpetrated against Greeks during the population exchange. Şükrü argued that recognition of ethnic diversity was not a threat to the Turkish nation.

Topal Osman&#x27;s men would eventually murder parliamentarian Şükrü for his criticism of the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal in March 1923. Topal Osman was later sentenced to death and killed while resisting arrest. After pressure from the opposition, his headless body was hanged by his foot in front of the Turkish parliament. Ali Şükrü Bey, who had studied in Deniz Harp Okulu (Turkish Naval Academy) and worked as a journalist in the United Kingdom, is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman. Three years later Trabzon deputy Hafız Mehmet – who had testified to his knowledge of, and opposition to, the Armenian Ggenocide – was also executed, for his alleged involvement in the İzmir plot to assassinate Mustafa Kemal. The literal decapitation of the Turkish political opposition – which was in large part based in the Trabzon region – decreased the city&#x27;s national influence, and led to a long-standing animosity between the Kemalists and the population of Trabzon. A political and cultural divide between the Eastern Black Sea Region and the rest of Anatolia continued to exist throughout the 20th century, and still influences Turkish politics today. Even in the 21st century, politicians who hail from Trabzon are often faced with xenophobic attacks from both nationalist and conservative circles.

During World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, tobacco and hazelnuts, could not be sold and living standards degraded.

As a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.

Trabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its anchovies called &quot;hamsi&quot;, which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include hazelnuts and tea.

The city still has a sizable community of Greek-speaking Muslims, most of whom are originally from the vicinities of Tonya, Sürmene and Çaykara. However, the variety of the Pontic Greek language - known as &quot;Romeika&quot; in the local vernacular, &quot;Pontiaka&quot; in Greek, and &quot;Rumca&quot; in Turkish - is spoken mostly by the older generations.

==Geography==

Trabzon Province has a total area of and is bordered by the provinces of Rize, Giresun, and Gümüşhane. The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The Pontic Mountains pass through the Trabzon Province.

Trabzon used to be an important reference point for navigators in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions. The popular expression &quot;perdere la Trebisonda&quot; (losing Trebizond) is still commonly used in the Italian language to describe situations in which the sense of direction is lost. The Italian maritime republics such as Venice and in particular Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries.

Trabzon has four lakes: Uzungöl, Çakırgöl, Sera, and Haldizen Lakes. There are several streams, but no rivers in Trabzon.

===Climate===
Trabzon has a climate typical of the eastern Black Sea region, a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa,&quot; Trewartha&quot;: Cf&quot;) near the coast. A very small percentage of the province can be classified as subtropical, however, as slightly elevated rural areas near the coast are oceanic (&quot;Cfb/Do&quot;), the mountainous offshores are humid continental (&quot;Dfb/Dc&quot;) and subarctic (&quot;Dfc/Eo&quot;); and tundra (&quot;ET/Ft&quot;) can be found in the peaks of the Pontic Alps. Furthermore, during the time the Köppen climate classification was created, the city center had a borderline oceanic-humid subtropical climate, falling just under the threshold for the hottest month of the year, yet climate change and the city&#x27;s urban heat island contributed to its reclassification as humid subtropical in recent decades. This and the fact that the subtropical microclimate zone along the shore occupies a very narrow band due to the continuous parallel mountain range starting right at the coast is why local authorities still classify the city as oceanic, as this climate subtype is better representative of the entire coastal region of the province.

Summers are warm, the average maximum temperature is around in August, while winters are generally cool, the lowest average minimum temperature is almost in February. Precipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a microclimatic condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is somewhat common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows (this is due to the &quot;lake-effect snow&quot;).

The water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is generally mild, and fluctuates between and throughout the year.

==Economy==
As of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered &quot;the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports&quot; by the British. It traded as far as Tabriz and Mosul. As of 1911, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey signed an agreement to develop a harbor at the port. When the Russians occupied Trabzon, a mole was built. They built a breakwater and were responsible for creating an extended pier, making loading and unloading easier. In 1920, Trabzon produced linen cloth, silver filagree, tanning and small amounts of cotton, silk and wool. Tobacco and hazelnuts were exported. The tobacco produced in Trabzon was called &quot;Trebizond-Platana&quot;. It was described as having &quot;large leaves and a bright colour.&quot; Trabzon was known for producing poor quality cereals, mostly for local use.

Trabzon produced a white green bean, which was sold in Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province. Poultry farming was also popular in Trabzon. Sericulture was seen in the area before 1914. The area produced copper, silver, zinc, iron and manganese. Copper was kept for local use by coppersmiths. During the Balkan Wars production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.

Trabzon Airport opened in 1957.

==People==
=== History ===
Trebizond was an overwhelmingly Christian and Greek city at the time of its fall to the Ottomans in 1461. The Greek Christians slowly lost their majority through the end of that century. Initially, the Muslims were mainly immigrants from Anatolia with a minority of local converts, but this quickly changed with the emergence of an active missionary spirit in the 16th century, as mosques and dervish lodges were built in predominantly Christian neighborhoods.
Laz people also live in Trabzon. Numerous villages inside and out of Trabzon of the Laz date back as early as the period of Queen Tamar&#x27;s rule (Georgian: თამარი, also transliterated as T&#x27;amar or Thamar; c. 1160 – 18 January 1213) in the newly unified Kingdom of Georgia. During the Queen&#x27;s rule, sizeable groups of immigrating Georgians moved to Trabzon where they continue to preserve their native tongue. There was an Armenian community in Trebizond as early as the 7th century.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, numerous Armenian families migrated there from Ani. Robert W. Edwards published part of an early 15th-century diary from the Castilian ambassador who visited Trabzon and compared the churches of the Greek and Armenian communities. It was stated by the ambassador that the Armenians, who were not well-liked by the Greeks, had a population large enough to support a resident bishop. According to Ronald C. Jennings, in the early 16th century, Armenians made up approximately 13 percent of the city&#x27;s population. At present, Trabzon does not have an Armenian-speaking community.

The Chepni people, a tribe of Oghuz Turks who played an important role in the history of the eastern Black Sea area in the 13th and 14th centuries, live in the Şalpazarı (Ağasar valley) region of the Trabzon Province. Very little has been written on the Turkification of the area. There are no historical records of any considerable Turkish-speaking groups in the Trabzon area until the late 15th century, with the exception of the Chepnis. The original Greek (and in some regions Armenian) speakers imposed features from their mother language into the Turkish spoken in the region. Heath W. Lowry&#x27;s work with Halil İnalcık on Ottoman tax books (&quot;Tahrir Defteri&quot;) provides detailed demographic statistics for the city of Trabzon and its surrounding areas during the Ottoman period.

It is possible that the majority of the population of Trabzon and Rize (another ancient Greek colony in the Pontus region) — except up to the time of the Chepni Turk immigration waves — consisted of indigenous Caucasian tribes (the Colchians and the Laz) who had been partly Hellenized religiously and linguistically. Michael Meeker stresses the cultural resemblances (e.g. in village structure, house types, and pastoral techniques) between the Eastern Black Sea coast and the areas in the Caucasus proper.

=== Urbanization ===
==Main sights==
Trabzon has a number of tourist attractions, some of them dating back to the times of the ancient empires that once existed in the region. In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the &quot;Meydan&quot;, a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.

* The Hagia Sophia (formerly , now a mosque), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town&#x27;s most important tourist attraction.
* Trabzon Castle ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone. The outside wall of the castle now serves as the back wall of a military building.
* The &quot;Atatürk Köşkü&quot; is a villa built in 1890 by a local Greek merchant. In 1924 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey.
* Boztepe Park is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.
* Uzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.
* Trabzon Museum is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.
* Trabzon&#x27;s Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kunduracılar Street from the Meydan (town square).
* Saint Anne Church, Trabzon, is located in the city centre of Trabzon, and one of the oldest in the city.
* Kostaki Mansion is located to the north of Zeytinlik, near Uzun Sokak.
* Uzungöl Dursun Ali İnan Museum An ethnographic museum in Uzungol that tells the history of Trabzon and the region.

Other sites of the city include: Fatih Mosque (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), Yeni Cuma Mosque (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), Nakip Mosque (originally the Agios Andreas Church), Hüsnü Köktuğ Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), İskender Pasha Mosque, Semerciler Mosque, Çarşı Mosque, Gülbahar Hatun Mosque and Türbe (commissioned by Sultan Selim I), and Kalepark (originally Leonkastron).

Within Trabzon Province, the main attractions are the Sümela Monastery (i. e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumelá) and the Uzungöl lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about south of the city. Uzungöl is known for its natural environment and scenery. Other sites of interest in the broader region include:
* Kaymaklı Monastery, a formerly Armenian Monastery of the All-Saviour (arm. Ամենափրկիչ Վանք, Amenaprgič Vank);
* Kızlar Monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (the God-veiled Virgin);

* Vazelon Monastery of Agios Savvas (Maşatlık);
* Cave churches of Agia Anna (Little Ayvasıl), Sotha (St. John), Agios Theodoros, Agios Konstantinos, Agios Christophoros, Agia Kyriakí, Agios Michail, and Panagia Tzita churches.

==Culture==
Folk dancing is still very much in evidence in the Black Sea Region. The &quot;Horon&quot; is a famous dance that is indigenous to the city and its surrounding area. It is performed by men, women, the young and elderly alike; in festivities, local weddings and harvest times. While similar to Russian Cossack dances in terms of vividness, the Trabzon folk dance is probably indigenous to the eastern Black Sea region, which has an impressive variety of folk music.

The people of Trabzon have a reputation for being religiously conservative and nationalist. Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atatürk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of Giresun because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.

Outside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality, and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.

The people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region &quot;Karadeniz fıkraları&quot; (Black Sea jokes). The character &quot;Temel&quot;, a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.

The city&#x27;s profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by Dame Rose Macaulay&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Towers of Trebizond&quot; (1956), which is still in print.

==Education==
Karadeniz Technical University in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the Black Sea and East Anatolian regions, as well as students from the Turkic states in Central Asia.

Historically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers&#x27; college operated known as Phrontisterion of Trapezous, which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region. The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school &quot;Anadolu Lisesi&quot;.

==Cuisine==

Trabzon&#x27;s regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially &quot;hamsi&quot; (fresh European Anchovy similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the &quot;Akçaabat köfte&quot; (spicy lamb meatball from the Akçaabat district), &quot;Karadeniz pidesi&quot; (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), &quot;kuymak&quot; (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), &quot;Vakfıkebir ekmeği&quot; (large country-style bread), &quot;Tonya tereyağı&quot; (Tonya butter), &quot;tava mısır ekmeği&quot; (deep-dish corn bread) and &quot;kara lahana çorbası&quot; (bean and cabbage soup). &quot;Taflan kavurması&quot; is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the world&#x27;s largest producer of cherry and hazelnut; and a large production area of tea; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.

==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city&#x27;s top sports club, Trabzonspor, was until 2010 the only Turkish football club outside İstanbul to win the Süper Lig (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor&#x27;s first championship title in the 1975–76 season) won only by the &quot;Big Three&quot; clubs of Istanbul, namely Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, and Beşiktaş. Due to Trabzonspor&#x27;s success, the decades-old term &quot;Big Three&quot; which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the &quot;Big Four&quot;.
Trabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the European Cups, managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as Barcelona, Inter, Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Olympique Lyonnais. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include Şenol Güneş, Lars Olsen, and Shota Arveladze. In the 2021–2022 season, Trabzonspor left their Istanbul competition far behind, securing an early championship and ending a 38-year dry streak. Hundreds of thousands Trabzonite expatriates and fans from around the globe made their way to the city to participate in one of the first mass gatherings in the country for nearly two years, marking the end of the Corona pandemic. Officially the pandemic-measures had not been fully lifted, which led to some criticism towards the city&#x27;s municipal government for allowing the festivities to continue for hours into the night, long past curfew.

Trabzon hosted the first edition of the Black Sea Games in July 2007 and the 2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival.

<doc id="62654" wikidata="Q332387" url="?curid=62654" title="The Taming of the Shrew">
<text>The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1590 and 1592. The play begins with a framing device, often referred to as the induction, in which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a nobleman himself. The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly&#x27;s diversion.

The main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio and Katherina, the headstrong, obdurate shrew. Initially, Katherina is an unwilling participant in the relationship; however, Petruchio &quot;tames&quot; her with various psychological and physical torments, such as keeping her from eating and drinking, until she becomes a desirable, compliant, and obedient bride. The subplot features a competition between the suitors of Katherina&#x27;s younger sister, Bianca, who is seen as the &quot;ideal&quot; woman. The question of whether the play is misogynistic has become the subject of considerable controversy.

&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; has been adapted numerous times for stage, screen, opera, ballet, and musical theatre, perhaps the most famous adaptations being Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;; &quot;McLintock!&quot;, a 1963 American Western comedy film, starring John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara; and the 1967 film of the play, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The 1999 high-school comedy film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; and the 2003 romantic comedy &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot; are also loosely based on the play.

== Synopsis ==

Prior to the first act, an induction frames the play as a &quot;kind of history&quot; played in front of a befuddled drunkard named Christopher Sly who is tricked into believing that he is a lord. The play is performed in order to distract Sly from his &quot;wife,&quot; who is actually Bartholomew, a servant, dressed as a woman.

In the play performed for Sly, the &quot;shrew&quot; is Katherina, the elder daughter of Baptista Minola, a lord in Padua. Numerous men, including Tranio, deem Katherina an unworthy option for marriage because of her notorious assertiveness and willfulness. On the other hand, men such as Hortensio and Gremio are eager to marry her younger sister Bianca. However, Baptista has sworn Bianca is not allowed to marry until Katherina is wed; this motivates Bianca&#x27;s suitors to work together to find Katherina a husband so that they may compete for Bianca. The plot thickens when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to attend university, falls in love with Bianca. Overhearing Baptista say that he is on the lookout for tutors for his daughters, Lucentio devises a plan in which he disguises himself as a Latin tutor named Cambio in order to woo Bianca behind Baptista&#x27;s back and meanwhile has his servant Tranio pretend to be him.

In the meantime, Petruchio, accompanied by his servant Grumio, arrives in Padua from Verona. He explains to Hortensio, an old friend of his, that since his father&#x27;s death, he has set out to enjoy life and wed. Hearing this, Hortensio recruits Petruchio as a suitor for Katherina. He also has Petruchio present him (Hortensio) to Baptista disguised as a music tutor named Litio. Thus, Lucentio and Hortensio attempt to woo Bianca while pretending to be the tutors Cambio and Litio respectively.

To counter Katherina&#x27;s shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends that any harsh things she says or does are actually kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing that he is the only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the ceremony, Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio&#x27;s father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e., Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides that they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio&#x27;s father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attention, thus removing Lucentio&#x27;s remaining rival.
In Verona, Petruchio begins the &quot;taming&quot; of his new wife. She is refused food and clothing because nothing – according to Petruchio – is good enough for her; he claims that perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn&#x27;t fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything that she says, forcing her to agree with everything that he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca&#x27;s wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims &quot;if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me&quot; (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her that he is a man.

Back in Padua, Lucentio and Tranio convince a passing pedant to pretend to be Vincentio and confirm the dowry for Bianca. The man does so, and Baptista is happy for Bianca to wed Lucentio (still Tranio in disguise). Bianca, aware of the deception, then secretly elopes with the real Lucentio to get married. However, when Vincentio reaches Padua, he encounters the pedant, who claims to be Lucentio&#x27;s father. Tranio (still disguised as Lucentio) appears, and the pedant acknowledges him to be his son Lucentio. In all the confusion, the real Vincentio is set to be arrested, when the real Lucentio appears with his newly betrothed Bianca, revealing all to a bewildered Baptista and Vincentio. Lucentio explains everything, and all is forgiven by the two fathers.

Meanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow. In the final scene of the play, there are three newly married couples; Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio is married to a shrew, a good-natured quarrel breaks out amongst the three men about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby each will send a servant to call for his wife, and whichever comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only one of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. She then hauls the other two wives into the room, giving a speech on why wives should always obey their husbands. The play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio marvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.

== Sources ==
Although there is no direct literary source for the induction, the tale of a commoner being duped into believing he is a lord is one found in many literary traditions. Such a story is recorded in &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; where Harun al-Rashid plays the same trick on a man he finds sleeping in an alley. Another is found in &quot;De Rebus Burgundicis&quot; (1584) by the Dutch historian Pontus de Huyter, where Philip, Duke of Burgundy, after attending his sister&#x27;s wedding in Portugal, finds a drunken &quot;artisan&quot; whom he entertains with a &quot;pleasant Comedie.&quot; &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; was not translated into English until the mid-18th century, although Shakespeare may have known it by word of mouth. He could also have known the Duke of Burgundy story because although &quot;De Rebus&quot; was not translated into French until 1600 and not into English until 1607, there is evidence the story existed in English in a jest book (now lost) by Richard Edwardes, written in 1570.

Regarding the Petruchio/Katherina story, there are a variety of possible influences, but no one specific source. The basic elements of the narrative are present in tale 35 of the fourteenth-century Spanish book &quot;Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio&quot; by Don Juan Manuel, which tells of a young man who marries a &quot;very strong and fiery woman.&quot; The text had been translated into English by the sixteenth century, but there is no evidence that Shakespeare drew on it. The story of a headstrong woman tamed by a man was well known, and found in numerous traditions. For example, according to &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer, Noah&#x27;s wife was such a woman (&#x27;&quot;Hastow nought herd,&quot; quod Nicholas, &quot;also/The sorwe of Noë with his felaschippe/That he had or he gat his wyf to schipe&quot;&#x27;; &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot;, l. 352–354), and it was common for her to be depicted in this manner in mystery plays. Historically, another such woman was Xanthippe, Socrates&#x27; wife, who is mentioned by Petruchio himself (1.2.70). Such characters also occur throughout medieval literature, in popular farces both before and during Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime and in folklore.

In 1890, Alfred Tolman conjectured a possible literary source for the wager scene may have been William Caxton&#x27;s 1484 translation of Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry&#x27;s &quot;Livre pour l&#x27;enseignement de ses filles du Chevalier de La Tour Landry&quot; (1372). Written for his daughters as a guide on how to behave appropriately, de la Tour Landry includes &quot;a treatise on the domestic education of women&quot; which features an anecdote in which three merchants make a wager as to which of their wives will prove the most obedient when called upon to jump into a basin of water. The episode sees the first two wives refuse to obey (as in the play), it ends at a banquet (as does the play) and it features a speech regarding the &quot;correct&quot; way for a husband to discipline his wife. In 1959, John W. Shroeder conjectured that &quot;Chevalier de La Tour Landry&quot;″s depiction of the Queen Vastis story may also have been an influence on Shakespeare.

In 1964, Richard Hosley suggested the main source for the play may have been the anonymous ballad &quot;A merry jeste of a shrewde and curst Wyfe, lapped in Morrelles Skin, for her good behauyour&quot;. The ballad tells the story of a marriage in which the husband must tame his headstrong wife. Like &quot;Shrew&quot;, the story features a family with two sisters, the younger of whom is seen as mild and desirable. However, in &quot;Merry Jest&quot;, the older sister is obdurate not because it is simply her nature, but because she has been raised by her shrewish mother to seek mastery over men. Ultimately, the couple returns to the family house, where the now-tamed woman lectures her sister on the merits of being an obedient wife. The taming in this version is much more physical than in Shakespeare; the shrew is beaten with birch rods until she bleeds and is then wrapped in the salted flesh of a plough horse (the Morrelle of the title). &quot;Merry Jest&quot; was not unknown to earlier editors of the play, and had been dismissed as a source by A.R. Frey, W.C. Hazlitt, R. Warwick Bond and Frederick S. Boas. Modern editors also express doubt as to Hosley&#x27;s argument.
In 1966, Jan Harold Brunvand argued that the main source for the play was not literary, but the oral folktale tradition. He argued the Petruchio/Katherina story represents an example of Type 901 (&#x27;Shrew-taming Complex&#x27;) in the Aarne–Thompson classification system. Brunvand discovered 383 oral examples of Type 901 spread over thirty European countries, but he could find only 35 literary examples, leading him to conclude that &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s taming plot, which has not been traced successfully in its entirety to any known printed version, must have come ultimately from oral tradition.&quot; Most contemporary critics accept Brunvand&#x27;s findings.

A source for Shakespeare&#x27;s subplot was first identified by Alfred Tolman in 1890 as Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;I Suppositi&quot;, which was published in 1551. George Gascoigne&#x27;s English prose translation &quot;Supposes&quot; was performed in 1566 and printed in 1573. In &quot;I Suppositi&quot;, Erostrato (the equivalent of Lucentio) falls in love with Polynesta (Bianca), daughter of Damon (Baptista). Erostrato disguises himself as Dulipo (Tranio), a servant, whilst the real Dulipo pretends to be Erostrato. Having done this, Erostrato is hired as a tutor for Polynesta. Meanwhile, Dulipo pretends to formally woo Polynesta so as to frustrate the wooing of the aged Cleander (Gremio). Dulipo outbids Cleander, but he promises far more than he can deliver, so he and Erostrato dupe a travelling gentleman from Siena into pretending to be Erostrato&#x27;s father, Philogano (Vincentio). However, when Polynesta is found to be pregnant, Damon has Dulipo imprisoned (the real father is Erostrato). Soon thereafter, the real Philogano arrives, and all comes to a head. Erostrato reveals himself, and begs clemency for Dulipo. Damon realises that Polynesta is truly in love with Erostrato, and so forgives the subterfuge. Having been released from jail, Dulipo then discovers he is Cleander&#x27;s son. An additional minor source is &quot;Mostellaria&quot; by Plautus, from which Shakespeare probably took the names of Tranio and Grumio.

== Date and text ==
=== Date ===
Efforts to date the play&#x27;s composition are complicated by its uncertain relationship with another Elizabethan play entitled &quot;A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called the taming of a Shrew&quot;, which has an almost identical plot but different wording and character names. &quot;The Shrew&quot;″s exact relationship with &quot;A Shrew&quot; is unknown. Different theories suggest &quot;A Shrew&quot; could be a reported text of a performance of &quot;The Shrew&quot;, a source for &quot;The Shrew&quot;, an early draft (possibly reported) of &quot;The Shrew&quot;, or an adaptation of &quot;The Shrew&quot;. &quot;A Shrew&quot; was entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register on 2 May 1594, suggesting that whatever the relationship between the two plays, &quot;The Shrew&quot; was most likely written somewhere between 1590 (roughly when Shakespeare arrived in London) and 1594 (registration of &quot;A Shrew&quot;).

Some writers suggest, that it is possible to narrow the date further. A &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for &quot;A Shrew&quot; could be August 1592, as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions &quot;Simon,&quot; which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell, who was buried on 21 August 1592. Furthermore, &quot;The Shrew&quot; seems to have been written earlier than 1593, as Anthony Chute&#x27;s &quot;Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore&#x27;s wife&quot; (published in June 1593) contains the line &quot;He calls his Kate, and she must come and kiss him.&quot; This must refer to &quot;The Shrew&quot;, as there is no corresponding &quot;kissing scene&quot; in &quot;A Shrew&quot;. There are also verbal similarities between both &quot;Shrew&quot; plays and the anonymous play &quot;A Knack To Know A Knave&quot; (first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592). &quot;Knack&quot; features several passages common to both &quot;A Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but it also borrows several passages unique to &quot;The Shrew&quot;. This suggests &quot;The Shrew&quot; was on stage prior to June 1592.

In his 1982 edition of the play for The Oxford Shakespeare, H.J. Oliver suggests the play was composed no later than 1592. He bases this on the title page of &quot;A Shrew&quot;, which mentions the play had been performed &quot;sundry times&quot; by Pembroke&#x27;s Men. When the London theatres were closed on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of plague, Pembroke&#x27;s Men went on a regional tour to Bath and Ludlow. The tour was a financial failure, and the company returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. Over the next three years, four plays with their name on the title page were published; Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; (published in quarto in July 1593), and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (published in quarto in 1594), &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York&quot; (published in octavo in 1595) and &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot; (published in quarto in May 1594). Oliver says it is a &quot;natural assumption&quot; that these publications were sold by members of Pembroke&#x27;s Men who were broke after the failed tour. Oliver assumes that &quot;A Shrew&quot; is a reported version of &quot;The Shrew&quot;, which means &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been in their possession when they began their tour in June, as they didn&#x27;t perform it upon returning to London in September, nor would they have taken possession of any new material at that time.

Ann Thompson considers &quot;A Shrew&quot; to be a reported text in her 1984 and 2003 editions of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. She focuses on the closure of the theatres on 23 June 1592, arguing that the play must have been written prior to June 1592 for it to have given rise to &quot;A Shrew&quot;. She cites the reference to &quot;Simon&quot; in &quot;A Shrew&quot;, Anthony Chute&#x27;s allusion to &quot;The Shrew&quot; in &quot;Beauty Dishonoured&quot; and the verbal similarities between &quot;The Shrew&quot; and &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot; as supporting a date of composition prior to June 1592. Stephen Roy Miller, in his 1998 edition of &quot;A Shrew&quot; for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, agrees with the date of late 1591/early 1592, as he believes &quot;The Shrew&quot; preceded &quot;A Shrew&quot; (although he rejects the reported text theory in favour of an adaptation/rewrite theory). In &quot;William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion&quot; Gary Taylor argues for a date of composition around 1590–1591, noting much of the same evidence cited by other scholars but acknowledging the difficulty of dating the play with certainty.

Keir Elam, however, has argued for a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of 1591 for &quot;The Shrew&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s probable use of two sources published that year: Abraham Ortelius&#x27; map of Italy in the fourth edition of &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;, and John Florio&#x27;s &quot;Second Fruits&quot;. Firstly, Shakespeare errs in putting Padua in Lombardy instead of Veneto, probably because he used Ortelius&#x27; map of Italy as a source, which has &quot;Lombardy&quot; written across the entirety of northern Italy. Secondly, Elam suggests that Shakespeare derived his Italian idioms and some of the dialogue from Florio&#x27;s &quot;Second Fruits&quot;, a bilingual introduction to Italian language and culture. Elam argues that Lucentio&#x27;s opening dialogue,

is an example of Shakespeare&#x27;s borrowing from Florio&#x27;s dialogue between Peter and Stephan, who have just arrived in the north:

Elam&#x27;s arguments suggest &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been written no earlier than 1591, which places the date of composition around 1591–1592.

=== Text ===

The 1594 quarto of &quot;A Shrew&quot; was printed by Peter Short for Cuthbert Burbie. It was republished in 1596 (again by Short for Burbie), and 1607 by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling. &quot;The Shrew&quot; was not published until the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623. The only quarto version of &quot;The Shrew&quot; was printed by William Stansby for John Smethwick in 1631 as &quot;A Wittie and Pleasant comedie called The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, based on the 1623 folio text. W.W. Greg has demonstrated that &quot;A Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Shrew&quot; were treated as the same text for the purposes of copyright, i.e. ownership of one constituted ownership of the other, and when Smethwick purchased the rights from Ling in 1609 to print the play in the &quot;First Folio&quot;, Ling actually transferred the rights for &quot;A Shrew&quot;, not &quot;The Shrew&quot;. This has led Darren Freebury-Jones to contend that Shakespeare&#x27;s play was originally titled &quot;A Shrew&quot; but that the Folio compilers altered the title to distinguish it from what he sees as an adaptation.

== Analysis and criticism ==

=== Critical history ===

==== The relationship with &quot;A Shrew&quot; ====
One of the most fundamental critical debates surrounding &quot;The Shrew&quot; is its relationship with &quot;A Shrew&quot;. There are five main theories as to the nature of this relationship:
# The two plays are unrelated other than the fact that they are both based on another play which is now lost. This is the &quot;Ur-Shrew&quot; theory (in reference to &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;).
# &quot;A Shrew&quot; is a reconstructed version of &quot;The Shrew&quot;; i.e. a bad quarto, an attempt by actors to reconstruct the original play from memory.
# Shakespeare used the previously existing &quot;A Shrew&quot;, which he did not write, as a source for &quot;The Shrew&quot;.
# Both versions were legitimately written by Shakespeare himself; i.e. &quot;A Shrew&quot; is an early draft of &quot;The Shrew&quot;.
# &quot;A Shrew&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Shrew&quot; by someone other than Shakespeare.

The exact relationship between &quot;The Shrew&quot; and &quot;A Shrew&quot; is uncertain, but many scholars consider &quot;The Shrew&quot; the original, with &quot;A Shrew&quot; derived from it; as H.J. Oliver suggests, there are &quot;passages in [&quot;A Shrew&quot;] [...] that make sense only if one knows the [Follio] version from which they must have been derived.&quot;

The debate regarding the relationship between the two plays began in 1725, when Alexander Pope incorporated extracts from &quot;A Shrew&quot; into &quot;The Shrew&quot; in his edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. In &quot;The Shrew&quot;, the Christopher Sly framework is only featured twice; at the opening of the play, and at the end of Act 1, Scene 1. However, in &quot;A Shrew&quot;, the Sly framework reappears a further five times, including a scene which comes after the final scene of the Petruchio/Katherina story. Pope added most of the Sly framework to &quot;The Shrew&quot;, even though he acknowledged in his preface that he did not believe Shakespeare had written &quot;A Shrew&quot;. Subsequent editors followed suit, adding some or all of the Sly framework to their versions of &quot;The Shrew&quot;; Lewis Theobald (1733), Thomas Hanmer (1744), William Warburton (1747), Samuel Johnson and George Steevens (1765) and Edward Capell (1768). In his 1790 edition of &quot;The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare&quot;, however, Edmond Malone removed all &quot;A Shrew&quot; extracts and returned the text to the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot; version. By the end of the eighteenth century, the predominant theory had come to be that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was a non-Shakespearean source for &quot;The Shrew&quot;, and hence to include extracts from it was to graft non-authorial material onto the play.

This theory prevailed until 1850 when Samuel Hickson compared the texts of &quot;The Shrew&quot; and &quot;A Shrew&quot;, concluding &quot;The Shrew&quot; was the original, and &quot;A Shrew&quot; was derived from it. By comparing seven passages which are similar in both plays, he concluded &quot;the original conception is invariably to be found&quot; in &quot;The Shrew&quot;. His explanation was that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was written by Christopher Marlowe, with &quot;The Shrew&quot; as his template. He reached this conclusion primarily because &quot;A Shrew&quot; features numerous lines almost identical to lines in Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot;.

In 1926, building on Hickson&#x27;s research, Peter Alexander first suggested the bad quarto theory. Alexander agreed with Hickson that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was derived from &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but he did not agree that Marlowe wrote &quot;A Shrew&quot;. Instead, he labelled &quot;A Shrew&quot; a bad quarto. His main argument was that, primarily in the subplot of &quot;A Shrew&quot;, characters act without motivation, whereas such motivation is present in &quot;The Shrew&quot;. Alexander believed this represents an example of a &quot;reporter&quot; forgetting details and becoming confused, which also explains why lines from other plays are used from time to time; to cover gaps which the reporter knows have been left. He also argued the subplot in &quot;The Shrew&quot; was closer to the plot of &quot;I Suppositi&quot;/&quot;Supposes&quot; than the subplot in &quot;A Shrew&quot;, which he felt indicated the subplot in &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been based directly on the source, whereas the subplot in &quot;A Shrew&quot; was a step removed. In their 1928 edition of the play for the New Shakespeare, Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson supported Alexander&#x27;s argument. However, there has always been critical resistance to the theory.

An early scholar to find fault with Alexander&#x27;s reasoning was E.K. Chambers, who reasserted the source theory. Chambers, who supported Alexander&#x27;s bad quarto theory regarding &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster&quot; and &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke&quot;, argued &quot;A Shrew&quot; did not fit the pattern of a bad quarto; &quot;I am quite unable to believe that &quot;A Shrew&quot; had any such origin. Its textual relation to &quot;The Shrew&quot; does not bear any analogy to that of other &#x27;bad Quartos&#x27; to the legitimate texts from which they were memorised. The nomenclature, which at least a memoriser can recall, is entirely different. The verbal parallels are limited to stray phrases, most frequent in the main plot, for which I believe Shakespeare picked them up from &quot;A Shrew&quot;.&quot; He explained the relationship between &quot;I Suppositi&quot;/&quot;Supposes&quot; and the subplots by arguing the subplot in &quot;The Shrew&quot; was based upon both the subplot in &quot;A Shrew&quot; and the original version of the story in Ariosto/Gascoigne.

In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum made a similar argument. In an article listing over twenty examples of bad quartos, Kirschbaum did not include &quot;A Shrew&quot;, which he felt was too different from &quot;The Shrew&quot; to come under the bad quarto banner; &quot;despite protestations to the contrary, &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot; does not stand in relation to &quot;The Shrew&quot; as &quot;The True Tragedie&quot;, for example, stands in relation to &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;.&quot; Writing in 1998, Stephen Roy Miller offers much the same opinion; &quot;the relation of the early quarto to the &quot;Folio&quot; text is unlike other early quartos because the texts vary much more in plotting and dialogue [...] the differences between the texts are substantial and coherent enough to establish that there was deliberate revision in producing one text out of the other; hence &quot;A Shrew&quot; is not merely a poor report (or &#x27;bad quarto&#x27;) of &quot;The Shrew&quot;.&quot; Character names are changed, basic plot points are altered (Kate has two sisters for example, not one), the play is set in Athens instead of Padua, the Sly framework forms a complete narrative, and entire speeches are completely different, all of which suggests to Miller that the author of &quot;A Shrew&quot; thought they were working on something different from Shakespeare&#x27;s play, not attempting to transcribe it for resale; &quot;underpinning the notion of a &#x27;Shakespearean bad quarto&#x27; is the assumption that the motive of whoever compiled that text was to produce, differentially, a verbal replica of what appeared on stage.&quot; Miller believes that Chambers and Kirschbaum successfully illustrate &quot;A Shrew&quot; does not fulfil this rubric.

Alexander&#x27;s theory continued to be challenged as the years went on. In 1942, R.A. Houk developed what came to be dubbed the &quot;Ur-Shrew&quot; theory; both &quot;A Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Shrew&quot; were based upon a third play, now lost. In 1943, G.I. Duthie refined Houk&#x27;s suggestion by arguing &quot;A Shrew&quot; was a memorial reconstruction of &quot;Ur-Shrew&quot;, a now lost early draft of &quot;The Shrew&quot;; &quot;&quot;A Shrew&quot; is substantially a memorially constructed text and is dependent upon an early &quot;Shrew&quot; play, now lost. &quot;The Shrew&quot; is a reworking of this lost play.&quot; Hickson, who believed Marlowe to have written &quot;A Shrew&quot;, had hinted at this theory in 1850; &quot;though I do not believe Shakspeare&#x27;s play to contain a line of any other writer, I think it extremely probable that we have it only in a revised form, and that, consequently, the play which Marlowe imitated might not necessarily have been that fund of life and humour that we find it now.&quot; Hickson is here arguing that Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;A Shrew&quot; is not based upon the version of &quot;The Shrew&quot; found in the &quot;First Folio&quot;, but on another version of the play. Duthie argues this other version was a Shakespearean early draft of &quot;The Shrew&quot;; &quot;A Shrew&quot; constitutes a reported text of a now lost early draft.

Alexander returned to the debate in 1969, re-presenting his bad quarto theory. In particular, he concentrated on the various complications and inconsistencies in the subplot of &quot;A Shrew&quot;, which had been used by Houk and Duthie as evidence for an &quot;Ur-Shrew&quot;, to argue that the reporter of &quot;A Shrew&quot; attempted to recreate the complex subplot from &quot;The Shrew&quot; but got confused; &quot;the compiler of &quot;A Shrew&quot; while trying to follow the subplot of &quot;The Shrew&quot; gave it up as too complicated to reproduce, and fell back on love scenes in which he substituted for the maneuvers of the disguised Lucentio and Hortensio extracts from &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;Faustus&quot;, with which the lovers woo their ladies.&quot;

After little further discussion of the issue in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the publication of three scholarly editions of &quot;The Shrew&quot;, all of which re-addressed the question of the relationship between the two plays; Brian Morris&#x27; 1981 edition for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, H.J. Oliver&#x27;s 1982 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare and Ann Thompson&#x27;s 1984 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. Morris summarised the scholarly position in 1981 as one in which no clear-cut answers could be found; &quot;unless new, external evidence comes to light, the relationship between &quot;The Shrew&quot; and &quot;A Shrew&quot; can never be decided beyond a peradventure. It will always be a balance of probabilities, shifting as new arguments and opinions are added to the scales. Nevertheless, in the present century, the movement has unquestionably been towards an acceptance of the Bad Quarto theory, and this can now be accepted as at least the current orthodoxy.&quot; Morris himself, and Thompson, supported the bad quarto theory, with Oliver tentatively arguing for Duthie&#x27;s bad quarto/early draft/&quot;Ur-Shrew&quot; theory.

Perhaps the most extensive examination of the question came in 1998 in Stephen Roy Miller&#x27;s edition of &quot;A Shrew&quot; for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series. Miller agrees with most modern scholars that &quot;A Shrew&quot; is derived from &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but he does not believe it to be a bad quarto. Instead, he argues it is an adaptation by someone other than Shakespeare. Miller believes Alexander&#x27;s suggestion in 1969 that the reporter became confused is unlikely, and instead suggests an adapter at work; &quot;the most economic explanation of indebtedness is that whoever compiled &quot;A Shrew&quot; borrowed the lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Shrew&quot;, or a version of it, and adapted them.&quot; Part of Miller&#x27;s evidence relates to Gremio, who has no counterpart in &quot;A Shrew&quot;. In &quot;The Shrew&quot;, after the wedding, Gremio expresses doubts as to whether or not Petruchio will be able to tame Katherina. In &quot;A Shrew&quot;, these lines are extended and split between Polidor (the equivalent of Hortensio) and Phylema (Bianca). As Gremio &quot;does&quot; have a counterpart in &quot;I Suppositi&quot;, Miller concludes that &quot;to argue the priority of &quot;A Shrew&quot; in this case would mean arguing that Shakespeare took the negative hints from the speeches of Polidor and Phylema and gave them to a character he resurrected from &quot;Supposes&quot;. This is a less economical argument than to suggest that the compiler of &quot;A Shrew&quot;, dismissing Gremio, simply shared his doubts among the characters available.&quot; He argues there is even evidence in the play that the compiler knew he was working within a specific literary tradition; &quot;as with his partial change of character names, the compiler seems to wish to produce dialogue much like his models, but not the same. For him, adaptation includes exact quotation, imitation and incorporation of his own additions. This seems to define his personal style, and his aim seems to be to produce his own version, presumably intended that it should be tuned more towards the popular era than &quot;The Shrew&quot;.&quot;

As had Alexander, Houk and Duthie, Miller believes the key to the debate is to be found in the subplot, as it is here where the two plays differ most. He points out that the subplot in &quot;The Shrew&quot; is based on &quot;the classical style of Latin comedy with an intricate plot involving deception, often kept in motion by a comic servant.&quot; The subplot in &quot;A Shrew&quot;, however, which features an extra sister and addresses the issue of marrying above and below one&#x27;s class, &quot;has many elements more associated with the romantic style of comedy popular in London in the 1590s.&quot; Miller cites plays such as Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay&quot; and &quot;Fair Em&quot; as evidence of the popularity of such plays. He points to the fact that in &quot;The Shrew&quot;, there are only eleven lines of romance between Lucentio and Bianca, but in &quot;A Shrew&quot;, there is an entire scene between Kate&#x27;s two sisters and their lovers. This, he argues, is evidence of an adaptation rather than a faulty report;

Miller believes the compiler &quot;appears to have wished to make the play shorter, more of a romantic comedy full of wooing and glamorous rhetoric, and to add more obvious, broad comedy.&quot;

==== Hortensio problem ====
H.J. Oliver argues the version of the play in the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot; was likely copied not from a prompt book or transcript, but from the author&#x27;s own foul papers, which he believes showed signs of revision by Shakespeare. These revisions, Oliver says, relate primarily to the character of Hortensio, and suggest that in an original version of the play, now lost, Hortensio was not a suitor to Bianca, but simply an old friend of Petruchio. When Shakespeare rewrote the play so that Hortensio became a suitor in disguise (Litio), many of his lines were either omitted or given to Tranio (disguised as Lucentio).

Oliver cites several scenes in the play where Hortensio (or his absence) causes problems. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, Tranio (as Lucentio) and Gremio bid for Bianca, but Hortensio, who everyone is aware is also a suitor, is never mentioned. In Act 3, Scene 1, Lucentio (as Cambio) tells Bianca &quot;we might beguile the old Pantalowne&quot; (l.36), yet says nothing of Hortensio&#x27;s attempts to woo her, instead implying his only rival is Gremio. In Act 3, Scene 2, Tranio suddenly becomes an old friend of Petruchio, knowing his mannerisms and explaining his tardiness prior to the wedding. However, up to this point, Petruchio&#x27;s only acquaintance in Padua has been Hortensio. In Act 4, Scene 3, Hortensio tells Vincentio that Lucentio has married Bianca. However, as far as Hortensio should be concerned, Lucentio has denounced Bianca, because in Act 4, Scene 2, Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) agreed with Hortensio that neither of them would pursue Bianca, and as such, his knowledge of the marriage of who he supposes to be Lucentio and Bianca makes little sense. From this, Oliver concludes that an original version of the play existed in which Hortensio was simply a friend of Petruchio&#x27;s, and had no involvement in the Bianca subplot, but wishing to complicate things, Shakespeare rewrote the play, introducing the Litio disguise, and giving some of Hortensio&#x27;s discarded lines to Tranio, but not fully correcting everything to fit the presence of a new suitor.

This is important in Duthie&#x27;s theory of an &quot;Ur-Shrew&quot; insofar as he argues it is the original version of &quot;The Shrew&quot; upon which &quot;A Shrew&quot; is based, not the version which appears in the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;. As Oliver argues, &quot;&quot;A Shrew&quot; is a report of an earlier, Shakespearian, form of &quot;The Shrew&quot; in which Hortensio was not disguised as Litio.&quot; Oliver suggests that when Pembroke&#x27;s Men left London in June 1592, they had in their possession a now-lost early draft of the play. Upon returning to London, they published &quot;A Shrew&quot; in 1594, sometime after which Shakespeare rewrote his original play into the form seen in the &quot;First Folio&quot;.

Duthie&#x27;s arguments were never fully accepted at the time, as critics tended to look at the relationship between the two plays as an either-or situation; &quot;A Shrew&quot; is &quot;either&quot; a reported text &quot;or&quot; an early draft. In more recent scholarship, however, the possibility that a text could be both has been shown to be critically viable. For example, in his 2003 Oxford Shakespeare edition of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, Roger Warren makes the same argument for &quot;The First Part of the Contention&quot;. Randall Martin reaches the same conclusion regarding &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke&quot; in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This lends support to the theory that &quot;A Shrew&quot; could be both a reported text and an early draft.

==== Sexism controversy ====
&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; has been the subject of critical controversy. Dana Aspinall writes &quot;Since its first appearance, some time between 1588 and 1594, &quot;Shrew&quot; has elicited a panoply of heartily supportive, ethically uneasy, or altogether disgusted responses to its rough-and-tumble treatment of the &#x27;taming&#x27; of the &#x27;curst shrew&#x27; Katherina, and obviously, of all potentially unruly wives.&quot; Phyllis Rackin argues that &quot;seen in the context of current anxieties, desires and beliefs, Shakespeare&#x27;s play seems to prefigure the most oppressive modern assumptions about women and to validate those assumptions as timeless truths.&quot; Stevie Davies says that responses to &quot;Shrew&quot; have been &quot;dominated by feelings of unease and embarrassment, accompanied by the desire to prove that Shakespeare cannot have meant what he seems to be saying; and that therefore he cannot really be saying it.&quot; Philippa Kelly asks:

Some scholars argue that even in Shakespeare&#x27;s day the play must have been controversial, due to the changing nature of gender politics. Marjorie Garber, for example, suggests Shakespeare created the Induction so the audience would not react badly to the misogyny in the Petruchio/Katherina story; he was, in effect, defending himself against charges of sexism. G.R. Hibbard argues that during the period in which the play was written, arranged marriages were beginning to give way to newer, more romantically informed unions, and thus people&#x27;s views on women&#x27;s position in society, and their relationships with men, were in a state of flux. As such, audiences may not have been as predisposed to tolerate the harsh treatment of Katherina as is often thought.
Evidence of at least some initial societal discomfort with &quot;The Shrew&quot; is, perhaps, to be found in the fact that John Fletcher, Shakespeare&#x27;s successor as house playwright for the King&#x27;s Men, wrote &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Prize, or The Tamer Tamed&quot; as a sequel to Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Written &quot;c.&quot;1611, the play tells the story of Petruchio&#x27;s remarriage after Katherina&#x27;s death. In a mirror of the original, his new wife attempts (successfully) to tame him – thus the tamer becomes the tamed. Although Fletcher&#x27;s sequel is often downplayed as merely a farce, some critics acknowledge the more serious implications of such a reaction. Lynda Boose, for example, writes, &quot;Fletcher&#x27;s response may in itself reflect the kind of discomfort that &quot;Shrew&quot; has characteristically provoked in men and why its many revisions since 1594 have repeatedly contrived ways of softening the edges.&quot;

With the rise of the feminist movement in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, &quot;Kate&#x27;s taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s words &#x27;altogether disgusting to modern sensibility&#x27;.&quot; Addressing the relationship between &quot;A Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Shrew&quot; from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to be what it seems. She argues &quot;A Shrew&quot; is an earlier version of &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was written by Shakespeare. She believes one of the reasons for this is because &quot;A Shrew&quot; &quot;hedges the play&#x27;s patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in&quot; &quot;The Shrew&quot;. She calls &quot;A Shrew&quot; a more &quot;progressive&quot; text than &quot;The Shrew&quot;, and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that &quot;A Shrew&quot; is Shakespearean because &quot;the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in &quot;The Shrew&quot;.&quot; She also points out that if &quot;A Shrew&quot; is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare &quot;may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials&quot;, something which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.

However, others see the play as preceding 20th century feminist condemnation of patriarchal domination, and as an argument for the liberation of women. For example, Conall Morrison, director of the RSC 2008 production, wrote:

Philippa Kelly makes this point:

Jonathan Miller, director of the 1980 &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; adaptation, and several theatrical productions, argues that although the play is not misogynistic, neither is it a feminist treatise:

==== Induction ====
An element in the debate regarding the play&#x27;s misogyny, or lack thereof, is the Induction, and how it relates to the Katherina/Petruchio story. According to H.J. Oliver, &quot;it has become orthodoxy to claim to find in the Induction the same &#x27;theme&#x27; as is to be found in both the Bianca and the Katherine-Petruchio plots of the main play, and to take it for granted that identity of theme is a merit and &#x27;justifies&#x27; the introduction of Sly.&quot; For example, Geoffrey Bullough argues the three plots &quot;are all linked in idea because all contain discussion of the relations of the sexes in marriage.&quot; Richard Hosley suggests the three plots form a unified whole insofar as they all deal with &quot;assumptions about identity and assumptions about personality.&quot; Oliver, however, argues that &quot;the Sly Induction does not so much announce the theme of the enclosed stories as establish their &quot;tone&quot;.&quot;

This is important in terms of determining the seriousness of Katherina&#x27;s final speech. Marjorie Garber writes of the Induction, &quot;the frame performs the important task of distancing the later action, and of insuring a lightness of tone – significant in light of the real abuse to which Kate is subjected by Petruchio.&quot; Oliver argues that Induction is used to remove the audience from the world of the enclosed plot – to place the Sly story on the same level of reality as the audience, and the Katherina/Petruchio story on a different level of reality. This, he argues, is done to ensure the audience does not take the play literally, that it sees the Katherina/Petruchio story as a farce:

Oliver argues that &quot;the main purpose of the Induction was to set the tone for the play within the play – in particular, to present the story of Kate and her sister as none-too-serious comedy put on to divert a drunken tinker&quot;. He suggests that if the Induction is removed from a production of the play (as it very often is), a fundamental part of the structure has been lost. Speaking of Jonathan Miller&#x27;s &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; adaptation of 1980, which omitted the Induction, Stanley Wells wrote &quot;to omit the Christopher Sly episodes is to suppress one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most volatile lesser characters, to jettison most of the play&#x27;s best poetry, and to strip it of an entire dramatic dimension.&quot;

Regarding the importance of the Induction, Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen argue that &quot;the Sly framework establishes a self-referential theatricality in which the status of the shrew-play &quot;as&quot; a play is enforced.&quot; Graham Holderness argues &quot;the play in its received entirety does not propose any simple or unitary view of sexual politics: it contains a crudely reactionary dogma of masculine supremacy, but it also works on that ideology to force its expression into self-contradiction. The means by which this self-interrogation is accomplished is that complex theatrical device of the Sly-framework [...] without the metadramatic potentialities of the Sly-framework, any production of &quot;Shrew&quot; is thrown much more passively at the mercy of the director&#x27;s artistic and political ideology.&quot; Coppélia Kahn suggests &quot;the transformation of Christopher Sly from drunken lout to noble lord, a transformation only temporary and skin-deep, suggests that Kate&#x27;s switch from independence may also be deceptive and prepares us for the irony of the &quot;dénouement&quot;.&quot; The Induction serves to undercut charges of misogyny – the play within the play is a farce, it is not supposed to be taken seriously by the audience, as it is not taken seriously by Sly. As such, questions of the seriousness of what happens within it are rendered irrelevant.

=== Language ===
Language itself is a major theme in the play, especially in the taming process, where mastery of language becomes paramount. Katherina is initially described as a shrew because of her harsh language to those around her. Karen Newman points out, &quot;from the outset of the play, Katherine&#x27;s threat to male authority is posed through language: it is perceived by others as such and is linked to a claim larger than shrewishness–witchcraft–through the constant allusions to Katherine&#x27;s kinship with the devil.&quot; For example, after Katherina rebukes Hortensio and Gremio in Act 1, Scene 1, Hortensio replies with &quot;From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!&quot; (l.66). Even Katherina&#x27;s own father refers to her as &quot;thou hilding of a devilish spirit&quot; (2.1.26). Petruchio, however, attempts to tame her – and thus her language – with rhetoric that specifically undermines her tempestuous nature;

Here Petruchio is specifically attacking the very function of Katherina&#x27;s language, vowing that no matter what she says, he will purposely misinterpret it, thus undermining the basis of the linguistic sign, and disrupting the relationship between signifier and signified. In this sense, Margaret Jane Kidnie argues this scene demonstrates the &quot;slipperiness of language.&quot;

Apart from undermining her language, Petruchio also uses language to objectify her. For example, in Act 3, Scene 2, Petruchio explains to all present that Katherina is now literally his property:

In discussing Petruchio&#x27;s objectification of Katherina, Tita French Baumlin focuses on his puns on her name. By referring to her as a &quot;cake&quot; and a &quot;cat&quot; (2.1.185–195), he objectifies her in a more subtle manner than saying she belongs to him. A further aspect of Petruchio&#x27;s taming rhetoric is the repeated comparison of Katherina to animals. In particular, he is prone to comparing her to a hawk (2.1.8 and 4.1.177–183), often employing an overarching hunting metaphor; &quot;My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,/And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged&quot; (4.1.177–178). Katherina, however, appropriates this method herself, leading to a trading of insults rife with animal imagery in Act 2, Scene 1 (ll.207–232), where she compares Petruchio to a turtle and a crab.

Language itself has thus become a battleground. However, it is Petruchio who seemingly emerges as the victor. In his house, after Petruchio has dismissed the haberdasher, Katherina exclaims

Katherina is here declaring her independence of language; no matter what Petruchio may do, she will always be free to speak her mind. However, only one hundred lines later, the following exchange occurs;

Kidnie says of this scene, &quot;the language game has suddenly changed and the stakes have been raised. Whereas before he seemed to mishear or misunderstand her words, Petruchio now overtly tests his wife&#x27;s subjection by demanding that she concede to his views even when they are demonstrably unreasonable. The lesson is that Petruchio has the absolute authority to rename their world.&quot; Katherina is free to say whatever she wishes, as long she agrees with Petruchio. His apparent victory in the &#x27;language game&#x27; is seen in Act 4, Scene 5, when Katherina is made to switch the words &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;sun&quot;, and she concedes that she will agree with whatever Petruchio says, no matter how absurd:

Of this scene, Kidnie argues &quot;what he &#x27;says&#x27; must take priority over what Katherina &#x27;knows&#x27;.&quot; From this point, Katherina&#x27;s language changes from her earlier vernacular; instead of defying Petruchio and his words, she has apparently succumbed to his rhetoric and accepted that she will use &quot;his&quot; language instead of her own – both Katherina and her language have, seemingly, been tamed.

The important role of language, however, is not confined to the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches to blank verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting them aside from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience to the fact that they are now in an entirely different &quot;milieu&quot;.

== Themes ==

=== Female submissiveness ===
In productions of the play, it is often the interpretation of Katherina&#x27;s final speech (the longest speech in the play) that defines the tone of the entire production, such is the importance of this speech and what it says, or seems to say, about female submission:

Traditionally, many critics have taken the speech literally. Writing in 1943, for example, G.I. Duthie argued &quot;what Shakespeare emphasises here is the foolishness of trying to destroy order.&quot; However, in a modern western society, holding relatively egalitarian views on gender, such an interpretation presents a dilemma, as according to said interpretation the play seemingly celebrates female subjugation.

Critically, four main theories have emerged in response to Katherina&#x27;s speech;

# It is sincere; Petruchio has successfully tamed her.
# It is sincere, but not because Petruchio has tamed her. Instead, she has fallen in love with him and accepted her role as his wife.
# It is ironic; she is being sarcastic, pretending to have been tamed when in reality she has completely duped Petruchio into thinking he has tamed her.
# It should not be read seriously or ironically; it is part of the farcical nature of the play-within-the-play.

George Bernard Shaw wrote in 1897 that &quot;no man with any decency of feeling can sit it out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamed of the lord-of-creation moral implied in the wager and the speech put into the woman&#x27;s own mouth.&quot; Katherina is seen as having been successfully tamed, and having come to accept her newly submissive role to such an extent that she advocates that role for others, the final speech rationalises, according to Duthie, in both a political and sociological sense, the submission of wives to husbands.

Actress Meryl Streep, who played Katherina in 1978 at the Shakespeare in the Park festival, says of the play, &quot;really what matters is that they have an incredible passion and love; it&#x27;s not something that Katherina admits to right away, but it does provide the source of her change.&quot; Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage in the process of Katherina&#x27;s change of heart towards Petruchio; &quot;if we can appreciate the liberal element in Kate&#x27;s last speech – the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if from a dream, liberated into the bonds of love.&quot;

Perhaps the most common interpretation in the modern era is that the speech is ironic; Katherina has not been tamed at all, she has merely duped Petruchio into thinking she has. Two especially well-known examples of this interpretation are seen in the two major feature film adaptations of the play; Sam Taylor&#x27;s 1929 version and Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1967 version. In Taylor&#x27;s film, Katherina, played by Mary Pickford, winks at Bianca during the speech, indicating she does not mean a word of what she is saying. In Zeffirelli&#x27;s film, Katherina, played by Elizabeth Taylor, delivers the speech as though it were her own idea, and the submission aspect is reversed by her ending the speech and leaving the room, causing Petruchio to have to run after her. Phyllis Rackin is an example of a scholar who reads the speech ironically, especially in how it deals with gender. She points out that several lines in the speech focus on the woman&#x27;s body, but in the Elizabethan theatre, the role would have been played by a young boy, thus rendering any evocation of the female form as ironic. Reading the play as a satire of gender roles, she sees the speech as the culmination of this process. Along similar lines, Philippa Kelly says &quot;the body of the boy actor in Shakespeare&#x27;s time would have created a sexual indeterminacy that would have undermined the patriarchal narrative, so that the taming is only &quot;apparently&quot; so. And in declaring women&#x27;s passivity so extensively and performing it centre-stage, Kate might be seen to take on a kind of agency that rebukes the feminine codes of silence and obedience which she so expressly advocates.&quot; Similarly, Coppélia Kahn argues the speech is really about how little Katherina has been tamed; &quot;she steals the scene from her husband, who has held the stage throughout the play, and reveals that he has failed to tame her in the sense he set out to. He has gained her outward compliance in the form of a public display, while her spirit remains mischievously free.&quot;

In relation to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed by an adult male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio&#x27;s home, and she is able to lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.

The fourth school of thought is that the play is a farce, and hence the speech should not be read seriously or ironically. For example, Robert B. Heilman argues that &quot;the whole wager scene falls essentially within the realm of farce: the responses are largely mechanical, as is their symmetry. Kate&#x27;s final long speech on the obligations and fitting style of wives we can think of as a more or less automatic statement – that is, the kind appropriate to farce – of a generally held doctrine.&quot; He further makes his case by positing:

Another way in which to read the speech (and the play) as farcical is to focus on the Induction. H.J. Oliver, for example, emphasising the importance of the Induction, writes &quot;the play within the play has been presented only after all the preliminaries have encouraged us to take it as a farce. We have been warned.&quot; Of Katherina&#x27;s speech, he argues:

Emma Smith suggests a possible fifth interpretation: Petruchio and Kate have colluded together to plot this set-piece speech, &quot;a speech learned off pat&quot;, to demonstrate that Kate is the most obedient of the three wives and so allow Petruchio to win the wager.

=== Gender politics ===
The issue of gender politics is an important theme in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. In a letter to the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, George Bernard Shaw famously called the play &quot;one vile insult to womanhood and manhood from the first word to the last.&quot; A critic, Emily Detmer, points out that in the late 16th and early 17th century, laws curtailing husbands&#x27; use of violence in disciplining their wives were becoming more commonplace; &quot;the same culture that still &quot;felt good&quot; about dunking scolds, whipping whores, or burning witches was becoming increasingly sensitive about husbands beating their wives.&quot; Detmer argues:

Petruchio&#x27;s answer is to psychologically tame Katherina, a method not frowned upon by society; &quot;the play signals a shift towards a &quot;modern&quot; way of managing the subordination of wives by legitimatising domination as long as it is not physical.&quot; Detmer argues &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;shrew&quot; is tamed in a manner that would have made the wife-beating reformers proud; Petruchio&#x27;s taming &quot;policy&quot; dramatises how abstention from physical violence works better. The play encourages its audience not only to pay close attention to Petruchio&#x27;s method but also to judge and enjoy the method&#x27;s permissibility because of the absence of blows and the harmonious outcome.&quot;

However, Detmer is critical of scholars who defend Shakespeare for depicting male dominance in a less brutal fashion than many of his contemporaries. For example, although not specifically mentioned by Detmer, Michael West writes &quot;the play&#x27;s attitude was characteristically Elizabethan and was expressed more humanly by Shakespeare than by some of his sources.&quot; Detmer goes on to read the play in light of modern psychological theories regarding women&#x27;s responses to domestic violence, and argues that Katherina develops Stockholm syndrome:

In a Marxist reading of the play, Natasha Korda argues that, although Petruchio is not characterised as a violent man, he still embodies sixteenth-century notions regarding the subjugation and objectification of women. Shrew-taming stories existed prior to Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and in such stories, &quot;the object of the tale was simply to put the shrew to work, to restore her (frequently through some gruesome form of punishment) to her proper productive place within the household economy.&quot; Petruchio does not do this, but Korda argues he still works to curtail the activities of the woman; &quot;Kate [is] not a reluctant producer, but rather an avid and sophisticated consumer of market goods [...] Petruchio&#x27;s taming strategy is accordingly aimed not at his wife&#x27;s productive capacity – not once does he ask Kate to brew, bake, wash, card, or spin – but at her consumption. He seeks to educate her in her role as a consumer.&quot; She believes that even though Petruchio does not use force to tame Katherina, his actions are still an endorsement of patriarchy; he makes her his property and tames her into accepting a patriarchal economic worldview. Vital in this reading is Katherina&#x27;s final speech, which Korda argues &quot;inaugurates a new gendered division of labour, according to which husbands &quot;labour both by sea and land&quot; while their wives luxuriate at home [...] In erasing the status of housework as work, separate-sphere ideology renders the housewife perpetually indebted to her husband [...] &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; marks the emergence of the ideological separation of feminine and masculine spheres of labour.&quot;

In a theology-based reading of how gender politics are handled in the play, David Beauregard reads the relationship between Katherina and Petruchio in traditional Aristotelian terms. Petruchio, as the architect of virtue (&quot;Politics&quot;, 1.13), brings Kate into harmony with her nature by developing her &quot;new-built virtue and obedience&quot;, (5.2.118), and she, in turn, brings to Petruchio in her person all the Aristotelian components of happiness – wealth and good fortune, virtue, friendship and love, the promise of domestic peace and quiet (&quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, 1.7–8). The virtue of obedience at the center of Kate&#x27;s final speech is not what Aristotle describes as the despotic rule of master over slave, but rather the statesman&#x27;s rule over a free and equal person (&quot;Politics&quot;, 1.3, 12–13). Recognising the evil of despotic domination, the play holds up in inverse form Kate&#x27;s shrewishness, the feminine form of the will to dominance, as an evil that obstructs natural fulfillment and destroys marital happiness.

=== Cruelty ===

Another theme in the play is cruelty. Alexander Leggatt states:

Ann Thompson argues that &quot;the fact that in the folktale versions the shrew-taming story always comes to its climax when the husbands wager on their wives&#x27; obedience must have been partly responsible for the large number of references to sporting, gaming and gambling throughout the play. These metaphors can help to make Petruchio&#x27;s cruelty acceptable by making it seem limited and conventionalised.&quot; Marvin Bennet Krims argues that &quot;the play leans heavily on representations of cruelty for its comedic effect.&quot; He believes cruelty permeates the entire play, including the Induction, arguing the Sly frame, with the Lord&#x27;s spiteful practical joke, prepares the audience for a play willing to treat cruelty as a comedic matter. He suggests that cruelty is a more important theme than gender, arguing that &quot;the aggression represented in &quot;Taming&quot; can be read as having less to do with gender and more to do with hate, with the text thereby becoming a comic representation of the general problem of human cruelty and victimisation.&quot;

Director Michael Bogdanov, who directed the play in 1978, considers that &quot;Shakespeare was a feminist&quot;:

=== Money ===
The motivation of money is another theme. When speaking of whether or not someone may ever want to marry Katherina, Hortensio says &quot;Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults and money enough&quot; (1.1.125–128). In the scene that follows Petruchio says:

A few lines later Grumio says, &quot;Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne&#x27;re a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal&quot; (1.2.77–80). Furthermore, Petruchio is encouraged to woo Katherina by Gremio, Tranio (as Lucentio), and Hortensio, who vow to pay him if he wins her, on top of Baptista&#x27;s dowry (&quot;After my death, the one half of my lands, and in possession, twenty thousand crowns&quot;). Later, Petruchio does not agree with Baptista on the subject of love in this exchange:

Gremio and Tranio literally bid for Bianca. As Baptista says, Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both/That can assure my daughter greatest dower/Shall have my Bianca&#x27;s love&quot; (2.1.344–346).

=== Plays ===
=== Opera ===
The first opera based on the play was Ferdinando Bertoni&#x27;s opera buffa &quot;Il duca di Atene&quot; (1780), with libretto by Carlo Francesco Badini.

Frederic Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Catherine and Petruchio&quot; (1828) is an adaptation of Garrick, with an overture taken from Gioachino Rossini, songs derived from numerous Shakespeare plays and sonnets, and music by John Braham and Thomas Simpson Cooke. Starring Fanny Ayton and James William Wallack, the opera premiered at Drury Lane, but it was not successful, and closed after only a few performances. Hermann Goetz&#x27; &quot;Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung&quot; (1874), with libretto by Joseph Viktor Widmann, is a comic opera, which focuses on the Bianca subplot, and cuts back the taming story. It was first performed at the original National Theatre Mannheim. John Kendrick Bangs&#x27; &quot;Katherine: A Travesty&quot; (1888) is a Gilbert and Sullivan-style parody operetta which premiered in the Metropolitan Opera. Spyridon Samaras&#x27; &quot;La furia domata: commedia musicale in tre atti&quot; (1895) is a now lost lyric comedy with libretto by Enrico Annibale Butti and Giulio Macchi, which premiered at the Teatro Lirico. Ruperto Chapí&#x27;s &quot;Las bravías&quot; (1896), with a libretto by José López Silva and Carlos Fernández Shaw, is a one-act &quot;género chico&quot; &quot;zarzuela&quot; clearly based on the story, but with names changed and the location altered to Madrid: it was a major success in Spain, with over 200 performances in 1896 alone, and continues to be performed regularly.

Johan Wagenaar&#x27;s &quot;De getemde feeks&quot; (1909) is the second of three overtures Wagenaar wrote based on Shakespeare, the others being &quot;Koning Jan&quot; (1891) and &quot;Driekoningenavond&quot; (1928). Another overture inspired by the play is Alfred Reynolds&#x27; &quot;The Taming of the Shrew Overture&quot; (1927). Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s verismo opera &quot;Sly, ovvero la leggenda del dormiente risvegliato&quot; (1927) focuses on the Induction, with libretto by Giovacchino Forzano. A tragedy, the opera depicts Sly as a hard-drinking and debt-ridden poet who sings in a London pub. When he is tricked into believing that he is a lord, his life improves, but upon learning it is a ruse, he mistakenly concludes the woman he loves (Dolly) only told him she loved him as part of the ruse. In despair, he kills himself by cutting his wrists, with Dolly arriving too late to save him. Starring Aureliano Pertile and Mercedes Llopart, it was first performed at La Scala in Milan. Rudolf Karel&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; is an unfinished opera upon which he worked between 1942 and 1944. Philip Greeley Clapp&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1948) was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera. Vittorio Giannini&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1953) is an opera buffa, with libretto by Giannini and Dorothy Fee. It was first performed at the Cincinnati Music Hall, starring Dorothy Short and Robert Kircher. Vissarion Shebalin&#x27;s &quot;Ukroshchenye stroptivoy&quot; (1957), with libretto by Abram Akimovich Gozenpud, was Shebalin&#x27;s last opera and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece throughout Russia. Dominick Argento&#x27;s &quot;Christopher Sly&quot; (1962), with libretto by John Manlove, is a comic opera in two scenes and an interlude, first performed in the University of Minnesota. Sly is duped by a Lord into believing that he himself is a lord. However, he soon becomes aware of the ruse, and when left alone, he flees with the Lord&#x27;s valuables and his two mistresses.

The earliest known musical adaptation of the play was a ballad opera based on Charles Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Cobler of Preston&quot;. Called &quot;The Cobler of Preston&#x27;s Opera&quot;, the piece was anonymously written, although William Dunkin is thought by some scholars as a likely candidate. Rehearsals for the premiere began in Smock Alley in October 1731, but sometime in November or December, the show was cancelled. It was instead performed by a group of children (including an eleven-year-old Peg Woffington) in January 1732 at Signora Violante&#x27;s New Booth in Dame Street. It was subsequently published in March.

James Worsdale&#x27;s &quot;A Cure for a Scold&quot; is also a ballad opera. First performed at Drury Lane in 1735, starring Kitty Clive and Charles Macklin, &quot;A Cure for a Scold&quot; was an adaptation of Lacy&#x27;s &quot;Sauny the Scot&quot; rather than Shakespeare&#x27;s original &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Petruchio was renamed Manly, and Katherina was renamed Margaret (nicknamed Peg). At the end, there is no wager. Instead, Peg pretends she is dying, and as Petruchio runs for a doctor, she reveals she is fine, and declares &quot;you have taught me what &#x27;tis to be a Wife, and I shall make it my Study to be obliging and obedient,&quot; to which Manly replies &quot;My best Peg, we will exchange Kindness, and be each others Servants.&quot; After the play has finished, the actress playing Peg steps forward and speaks directly to the audience as herself; &quot;Well, I must own, it wounds me to the Heart/To play, unwomanly, so mean a Part./What – to submit, so tamely – so contented,/Thank Heav&#x27;n! I&#x27;m not the Thing I represented.&quot;

Cole Porter&#x27;s musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;. The music and lyrics are by Porter and the book is by Samuel and Bella Spewack. It is at least partially based on the 1935/1936 Theatre Guild production of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, which starred husband and wife Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, whose backstage fights became legendary. The musical tells the story of a husband and wife acting duo (Fred and Lilli) attempting to stage &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, but whose backstage fights keep getting in the way. The musical opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre in 1948, running for a total of 1,077 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson with choreography by Hanya Holm, it starred Patricia Morison and Alfred Drake. The production moved to the West End in 1951, directed by Samuel Spewack with choreography again by Holm, and starring Patricia Morison and Bill Johnson. It ran for 501 performances. As well as being a box office hit, the musical was also a critical success, winning five Tony Awards; Best Authors (Musical), Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Musical and Best Producers (Musical). The play has since been revived numerous times in various countries. Its 1999 revival at the Martin Beck Theatre, directed by Michael Blakemore and starring Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell, was especially successful, winning another five Tonys; Best Actor (Musical), Best Costume Design, Best Director (Musical), Best Orchestrations, and Best Revival (Musical).

The first ballet version of the play was Maurice Béjart&#x27;s &quot;La mégère apprivoisée&quot;. Using the music of Alessandro Scarlatti, it was originally performed by the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra de Paris in 1954. The best known ballet adaptation is John Cranko&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, first performed by the Stuttgart Ballet at the Staatsoper Stuttgart in 1969. Another ballet adaptation is Louis Falco&#x27;s &quot;Kate&#x27;s Rag&quot;, first performed by the Louis Falco Dance Company at the Akademie der Künste in 1980. In 1988, Aleksandre Machavariani composed a ballet suite, but it was not performed until 2009, when his son, conductor Vakhtang Machavariani, gave a concert at the Georgian National Music Center featuring music by Modest Mussorgsky, Sergei Prokofiev and some of his father&#x27;s pieces.

In 1924, extracts from the play were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the eight episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. Extracts were also broadcast in 1925 as part of &quot;Shakespeare: Scene and Story&quot;, with Edna Godfrey-Turner and William Macready, and in 1926 as part of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Heroines&quot;, with Madge Titheradge and Edmund Willard. In 1927, a forty-three-minute truncation of the play was broadcast on BBC National Programme, with Barbara Couper and Ian Fleming. In 1932, National Programme aired another truncated version, this one running eighty-five minutes, and again starring Couper, with Francis James as Petruchio. In 1935, Peter Creswell directed a broadcast of the relatively complete text (only the Bianca subplot was trimmed) on National Programme, starring Mary Hinton and Godfrey Tearle. This was the first non-theatrical version of the play to feature Sly, who was played by Stuart Robertson. In 1941, Creswell directed another adaptation for BBC Home Service, again starring Tearle, with Fay Compton as Katherina. In 1947, BBC Light Programme aired extracts for their &quot;Theatre Programme&quot; from John Burrell&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival production, with Patricia Burke and Trevor Howard. In 1954, the full-length play aired on BBC Home Service, directed by Peter Watts, starring Mary Wimbush and Joseph O&#x27;Conor, with Norman Shelley as Sly. BBC Radio 4 aired another full-length broadcast (without the Induction) in 1973 as part of their &quot;Monday Night Theatre&quot; series, directed by Ian Cotterell, starring Fenella Fielding and Paul Daneman. In 1989, BBC Radio 3 aired the full play, directed by Jeremy Mortimer, starring Cheryl Campbell and Bob Peck, with William Simons as Sly. In 2000, BBC Radio 3 aired another full-length production (without the Induction) as part of their &quot;Shakespeare for the New Millennium&quot; series, directed by Melanie Harris, and starring Ruth Mitchell and Gerard McSorley.

In the United States, the first major radio production was in July 1937 on NBC Blue Network, when John Barrymore adapted the play into a forty-five-minute piece, starring Elaine Barrie and Barrymore himself. In August of the same year, CBS Radio aired a sixty-minute adaptation directed by Brewster Mason, starring Frieda Inescort and Edward G. Robinson. The adaptation was written by Gilbert Seldes, who employed a narrator (Godfrey Tearle) to fill in gaps in the story, tell the audience about the clothes worn by the characters and offer opinions as to the direction of the plot. For example, Act 4, Scene 5 ends with the narrator musing &quot;We know that Katherina obeys her husband, but has her spirit been really tamed I wonder?&quot; In 1940, a thirty-minute musical version of the play written by Joseph Gottlieb and Irvin Graham aired on CBS as part of their &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot; series, starring Nan Sunderland and Carleton Young. In 1941, NBC Blue Network aired a sixty-minute adaptation as part of their &quot;Great Plays&quot; series, written by Ranald MacDougall, directed by Charles Warburton, and starring Grace Coppin and Herbert Rudley. In 1949, ABC Radio aired an adaptation directed by Homer Fickett, starring Joyce Redman and Burgess Meredith. In 1953, NBC broadcast William Dawkins&#x27; production live from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The cast list for this production has been lost, but it is known to have featured George Peppard. In 1960, NBC aired a sixty-minute version adapted by Carl Ritchie from Robert Loper&#x27;s stage production for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, starring Ann Hackney and Gerard Larson.

<text>The Chesapeake Peninsula, more frequently referenced today as the Delmarva Peninsula, or simply Delmarva — called as such in abbreviation of the contemporary U.S. states whose borders overlay it: &quot; Delaware&quot;,&quot; Maryland&quot;, and&quot; Virginia &quot; — is a peninsula on the East Coast of the United States, occupied by the majority of the state of Delaware and parts of the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Eastern Shore of Virginia. 

The peninsula is long. In width, it ranges from near its center, to at the isthmus on its northern edge, to less near its southern tip of Cape Charles. It is bordered by the Chesapeake Bay on the west, Pocomoke Sound on the southwest, and the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.

The population of the twelve counties entirely on the peninsula totals 818,014 people as of the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
In older sources, the peninsula between Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay was variously known as the Delaware and Chesapeake Peninsula or simply the Chesapeake Peninsula.

The toponym &quot;Delmarva&quot; is a clipped compound of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia (official abbreviation &quot;VA&quot;), which in turn was modeled after Delmar, a border town named after Delaware and Maryland. While Delmar was founded and named in 1859, the earliest uses of the name Delmarva occurred several years later (for example on February 10, 1877, in &quot;The Middletown Transcript&quot; newspaper in Middletown, Delaware) and appear to have been commercial and booster-driven; for example, the &quot;Delmarva Heat, Light, and Refrigerating Corp.&quot; of Chincoteague, Virginia, was in existence by 1913—but general use of the term did not occur until the 1920s.

==Geography==
At the northern point of the peninsula there is a geographic fall line that separates the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont from the unconsolidated sediments of the Coastal Plain. This line passes through Newark, Delaware, and Wilmington, Delaware, and Elkton, Maryland. The northern isthmus of the peninsula is transected by the sea-level Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Several bridges cross the canal, and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel join the peninsula to mainland Maryland and Virginia, respectively. Another point of access is Lewes, Delaware, reachable by the Cape May–Lewes Ferry from Cape May, New Jersey.

Dover, Delaware, is the peninsula&#x27;s largest city by population. The main commercial areas are Dover in the north and Salisbury, Maryland, near its center. Including all offshore islands, the largest of which is Kent Island in Maryland, the total land area south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is . At the 2000 census the total population was 681,030, giving an average population density of .

Cape Charles forms the southern tip of the peninsula in Virginia.

The entire Delmarva Peninsula falls within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, a flat and sandy area with very few or no hills; the highest point in the peninsula is only above sea level. The fall line, found in the region southwest of Wilmington, Delaware, and just north of the northern edge of the Delmarva Peninsula, is a geographic borderland where the Piedmont region transitions into the coastal plain. Its Atlantic Ocean coast is formed by the Virginia Barrier Islands in the south and Cape Henlopen in the north, encompassing Ocean City, Maryland, and the Delaware Beaches from Fenwick Island to Lewes.
The peninsula has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. According to the Trewartha climate classification, the northern half has a temperate or oceanic climate (&quot;Do&quot;).

==Culture==
The culture of Delmarva is starkly different from the rest of the Mid-Atlantic region and is much like that of the Southern United States. While the northern portion of Delmarva, such as the Wilmington metro area, is similar to the urban regions of Philadelphia, the Maryland, Virginia, and &quot;Slower Lower&quot; Delaware counties are more conservative than their &quot;mainland&quot; counties. It has been suggested that Delmarva residents have a variation of Southern American English which is particularly prevalent in rural areas.

Delmarva is driven by agriculture and commercial fishing. Most of the land is rural, with a few large population centers, though tourism has been an important part of the region.

Delmarva has longstanding Catholic roots, but now Protestants are more numerous, with Methodism being particularly strongly represented. Numerous Catholic churches dating to the 17th century are still operating, such as Old Bohemia Church, which is dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier in Cecil County, Maryland. There are several historically significant Episcopalian churches, such as Old Trinity Church in southern Dorchester County and Christ Church in Cambridge, Maryland.

==Political divisions==

The border between Maryland and Delaware, which resulted from the 80-year-long Penn–Calvert Boundary Dispute, consists of the east–west Transpeninsular Line and the perpendicular north–south portion of the Mason–Dixon line extending north to just beyond its tangential intersection with the Twelve-Mile Circle which forms Delaware&#x27;s border with Pennsylvania. The border between Maryland and Virginia on the peninsula follows the Pocomoke River from the Chesapeake to a series of straight surveyed lines connecting the Pocomoke to the Atlantic Ocean.

All three counties in Delaware, New Castle (partially), Kent, and Sussex, are located on the peninsula. Of the 23 counties in Maryland, nine are on the Eastern Shore: Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Wicomico, Somerset, and Worcester, as well as a portion of Cecil County. Two Virginia counties are on the peninsula: Accomack and Northampton.

The following is a list of some of the notable cities and towns on the peninsula.
* Cambridge, Maryland, is the county seat of Dorchester County and a busy port on the Choptank River.
* Centreville, Maryland, is the county seat of Queen Anne&#x27;s County.
* Chestertown, Maryland, is the county seat of Kent County, MD and the home of Washington College.
* Chincoteague, Virginia, is noted for its wild ponies and its beaches, administered by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service through Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge; the Atlantic Ocean side of the wildlife refuge is administered by the National Park Service as the southern portion of Assateague Island National Seashore.
* Crisfield, Maryland, is a notable source of seafood.
* Delmar, Maryland, part of the Salisbury Urbanized Area, lies across the Maryland-Delaware border from its twin, Delmar, Delaware, on the Transpeninsular Line.
* Dover, Delaware, is the Delaware state capital and the peninsula&#x27;s largest city in terms of population. It is also the county seat of Kent County, DE and is home to Delaware State University. 
* Easton, Maryland, is the county seat of Talbot County.
* Georgetown, Delaware, is the county seat of Sussex County. Return Day, a tradition dating back to the Colonial era, is held in Georgetown two days after Election Day.
* Lewes, Delaware, is the site of the first European colonization in Delaware, is nicknamed &quot;the first town in the first state&quot;, and is a port city for the Cape May–Lewes Ferry.
* Ocean City, Maryland, is a popular beach and resort town.
* Princess Anne, Maryland, is the county seat of Somerset County and the home of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
* Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, &quot;the Nation&#x27;s Summer Capital&quot;, has a sixteenfold increase in population from winter to summer.
* St. Michaels, Maryland, is a popular tourist destination.
* Salisbury, Maryland, is the county seat of Wicomico County, the second largest city in the peninsula and the lower peninsula&#x27;s only urbanized area. It is known as the &quot;Crossroads of Delmarva&quot;. It is home to the Salisbury–Ocean City–Wicomico Regional Airport, the only airport on the peninsula with scheduled commercial flights. The city is also home to Salisbury University, a Maryland state university. 
* Seaford, Delaware, the &quot;Nylon Capital of the World&quot;, is the largest city in Sussex County.

At its southern tip, the Delmarva Peninsula is connected to Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads, Virginia, via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel which opened in 1964. The bridge tunnel is owned and administered by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District.

===Proposed state===
At various times in history, residents of the Delmarva Peninsula have proposed that its Maryland and Virginia portions secede from their respective states, merging with Kent County and Sussex County, Delaware, to create the state of Delmarva. A Delmarva State Party with this aim was founded in 1992. A combined population with the Eastern Shores of Maryland and Virginia, with the aforementioned two Delaware counties, would be about 750,000, or 921,739 in 2020, roughly the population of South Dakota. Including New Castle County, Delaware, the combined population would be 1,492,458 in 2020, roughly the population of Hawaii or New Hampshire.

Legislative attempts to break away the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and join them with Delaware were made several times. In November 1776, delegates from the Eastern Shore attempted to insert a clause into the Maryland Declaration of Rights that would allow the shore counties to secede from Maryland, with the clause being defeated 30–17. In 1833, the secession movement came close to succeeding: a Delaware resolution proposing the Eastern Shore of Maryland be absorbed into Delaware passed the Delaware Senate and Delaware House of Representatives, then passed the Maryland House of Delegates with a 40–24 vote, but failed to be voted out of committee by the Maryland Senate. The following year, a Caroline County representative proposed allowing the Eastern Shore to secede via referendum, but the Maryland House of Delegates voted 60–5 to indefinitely postpone the measure, and that proposal was never taken up again. In 1851, Dorchester County delegate and future Maryland Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks proposed an amendment that would give the Eastern Shore the right to vote itself into Delaware, but the amendment failed 51–27.

==History==

=== Pre-colonization ===
Some studies have shown that Native Americans inhabited the peninsula from about 10,000 BC to 8000 BC – since the last ice age.

Recent research indicates that Paleoamericans inhabited Maryland during the pre-Clovis period (before 13,000 BP). Miles Point, Oyster Cove, and Cator&#x27;s Cove archaeological sites on the coastal plain of the Delmarva Peninsula help to document a pre-Clovis presence in the Middle Atlantic region. Thus, these sites suggest a human presence in the Middle Atlantic region during the Last Glacial Maximum.

In 1970 a stone tool (a biface) said to resemble Solutrean stone tools was dredged up by the trawler &quot;Cinmar&quot; off the east coast of Virginia in an area that would have been dry land prior to the rising sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch. The tool was allegedly found in the same dredge load that contained a mastodon&#x27;s remains. The mastodon tusks were later determined to be 22,000 years old. However, studies conducted on nearby Parsons Island demonstrate that the stratigraphy of the region is disturbed. In addition several archaeological sites on the Delmarva peninsula with suggestive (but not definitive) dating between 16,000 and 18,000 years have been discovered by Darrin Lowery of the University of Delaware. These factors led Stanford and Bradley to reiterate in 2014 their academic advocacy of pre-Clovis peoples in North America and their possible link to paleolithic Europeans.

====Lifestyles====
Native settlements relocated as natural conditions dictated. They set up villages – scattered groups of thatch houses and cultivated gardens – where conditions favored farming. In the spring they planted crops, which the women and children tended while the men hunted and fished. In the fall they harvested crops, storing food in baskets or underground pits. During the harsh winter, whole communities would move to hunting areas, seeking the deer, rabbit and other game that kept them alive until the spring fishing season. When the farmland around their villages became less productive – the inhabitants did not practice crop rotation – the native people would abandon the site and move to another location.

====Populations====
The primary Indigenous peoples of the ocean side of the lower peninsula prior to the arrival of Europeans were the Assateague, including the Assateague, Transquakin, Choptico, Moteawaughkin, Quequashkecaquick, Hatsawap, Wachetak, Marauqhquaick, and Manaskson. Their territories and populations ranged from Cape Charles, Virginia, to the Indian River inlet in Delaware.

The upper peninsula and the Chesapeake shore was the home of Nanticoke-speaking people such as the Nentigo and Choptank. The Assateague and Nentigo made a number of treaties with the colony of Maryland, but the land was gradually taken and those treaties dissolved for the use of the colonists, and the native peoples of the peninsula assimilated into other Algonquian tribes as far north as Ontario.

Currently, the peninsula is within the traditional territory of the Piscataway, Nentego, and Lenape peoples.

===Colonization===
In 1566, an expedition sent from Spanish Florida by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés reached the Delmarva Peninsula. The expedition consisted of two Dominican friars, thirty soldiers and an indigenous Virginia boy, Don Luis, in an effort to set up a Spanish colony in the Chesapeake. At the time, the Spanish believed the Chesapeake to be an opening to the fabled Northwest Passage. However, a storm thwarted their attempts at establishing a colony. The land that is currently Delaware was first colonized by the Dutch West India Company in 1631 as Zwaanendael. That colony lasted one year before a dispute with local Indians led to its destruction. In 1638, New Sweden was established which colonized the northern part of the state, together with the Delaware Valley. Eventually, the Dutch, who had maintained that their claim to Delaware arose from the colony of 1631, recaptured Delaware and incorporated the colony into the Colony of New Netherland.

However, shortly thereafter Delaware came under British control in 1664. James I of England had granted Virginia 400 miles of Atlantic coast centered on Cape Comfort, extending west to the Pacific Ocean to a company of colonists in a series of charters from 1606 to 1611. This included a piece of the peninsula. The land was transferred from the Duke of York to William Penn in 1682 and was governed with Pennsylvania. The exact border was determined by the Chancery Court in 1735. In 1776, the counties of Kent, New Castle, and Sussex declared their independence from Pennsylvania and entered the United States as the state of Delaware.

In the 1632 Charter of Maryland, King Charles I of England granted &quot;all that Part of the Peninsula, or Chersonese, lying in the Parts of America, between the Ocean on the East and the Bay of Chesapeake on the West, divided from the Residue thereof by a Right Line drawn from the Promontory, or Head-Land, called Watkin&#x27;s Point, situate upon the Bay aforesaid, near the river Wigloo, on the West, unto the main Ocean on the East; and between that Boundary on the South, unto that Part of the Bay of Delaware on the North, which lieth under the Fortieth Degree of North Latitude from the Equinoctial, where New England is terminated&quot; to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, as the colony of Maryland. This would have included all of present-day Delaware; however, a clause in the charter granted only that part of the peninsula that had not already been colonized by Europeans by 1632. Over a century later, it was decided in the case of &quot;Penn v Lord Baltimore&quot; that, because the Dutch had colonized Zwaanendael in 1631, the portion of Maryland&#x27;s charter granting Delaware to Maryland was void.

==Economy==
The peninsula was the premier location for truck farming of vegetables during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Though it has been largely eclipsed by California&#x27;s production, the area still produces significant quantities of tomatoes, green beans, corn, soybeans—Queen Anne&#x27;s County is the largest producer of soy beans in Maryland—and other popular vegetables.

The Eastern Shore is also known for its poultry farms, the most well-known of which is Perdue Farms, founded in Salisbury. The Delaware is a rare breed of chicken created on the peninsula.

Tourism is a major contributor to the peninsula&#x27;s economy with the beaches at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Ocean City, Maryland, Assateague Island National Seashore, Maryland, and Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, being popular tourist destinations.

Salisbury University also adds to the economic activity of the Delmarva, with an estimated $480 million in contribution impact. The University is the largest four year comprehensive on the Eastern Shore, and serves as the largest employer other than Perdue supporting an estimated 3,200 jobs.

===Media===
The area is served by four television markets. Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, Caroline and Talbot Counties in Maryland are primarily served by the Baltimore, Maryland, designated market area and stations WBAL-TV, WJZ-TV, WMAR-TV and WBFF-TV. New Castle and Kent Counties in Delaware are served by the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, designated market area and stations WPVI-TV, WCAU-TV, KYW-TV and WTXF-TV. Sussex, Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset Counties are served by the Salisbury, Maryland, designated market area, the only based on the peninsula. These stations are WBOC-TV, WMDT-TV, and WRDE-LD. Accomack and Northampton Counties are primarily served by the Norfolk/Virginia Beach designated market area and stations WAVY-TV, WVEC-TV and WTKR-TV.

==Transportation==
The peninsula has minor airports with few commercial carriers, as it is overshadowed by proximate major airports in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Its airports include Wilmington Airport southwest of Wilmington, Delaware, Salisbury Regional Airport to the southeast of Salisbury, Maryland, and Dover Air Force Base to the southeast of Dover, Delaware.

Major north–south highways include U.S. 9, U.S. 13, U.S. 50 and U.S. 301. Highways U.S. 50 and U.S. 301 run over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on the western side of the peninsula. U.S. 13 at the southern limit of the peninsula connects through the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel to the main part of Virginia.

Until 1957, the Pennsylvania Railroad provided service to the peninsula. It ran the &quot;Del-Mar-Va Express&quot; day train from New York City, through Wilmington, Dover, Delmar, Salisbury, and Pocomoke City to the Cape Charles, Virginia, ferry docks and it ran the &quot;Cavalier&quot; counterpart night train. At that point, ferries ran to Norfolk, Virginia. In earlier decades branches ran to Centreville, Maryland; Oxford, Maryland; Cambridge, Maryland; Georgetown and Lewes, Delaware; and to Franklin City, Virginia. Today, the Delmarva Central Railroad provides freight and tanker transportation on the peninsula.

<text>Year 333 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Dictatorship of Rufinus (or, less frequently, year 421 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 333 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="62661" wikidata="Q1182643" url="?curid=62661" title="Defensive programming">
<text>Defensive programming is a form of defensive design intended to develop programs that are capable of detecting potential security abnormalities and make predetermined responses. It ensures the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances. Defensive programming practices are often used where high availability, safety, or security is needed.

Defensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:
* General quality – reducing the number of software bugs and problems.
* Making the source code comprehensible – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit.
* Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.

Overly defensive programming, however, may safeguard against errors that will never be encountered, thus incurring run-time and maintenance costs.

== Secure programming ==
Secure programming is the subset of defensive programming concerned with computer security. Security is the concern, not necessarily safety or availability (the software may be allowed to fail in certain ways). As with all kinds of defensive programming, avoiding bugs is a primary objective; however, the motivation is not as much to reduce the likelihood of failure in normal operation (as if safety were the concern), but to reduce the attack surface – the programmer must assume that the software might be misused actively to reveal bugs, and that bugs could be exploited maliciously.

int risky_programming(char *input) {
 char str[1000]; 
 // ...
 strcpy(str, input); // Copy input.
 // ...
The function will result in undefined behavior when the input is over 1000 characters. Some programmers may not feel that this is a problem, supposing that no user will enter such a long input. This particular bug demonstrates a vulnerability which enables buffer overflow exploits. Here is a solution to this example:

int secure_programming(char *input) {
 char str[1000+1]; // One more for the null character.

 // Copy input without exceeding the length of the destination.
 strncpy(str, input, sizeof(str));

 // If strlen(input) &gt;= sizeof(str) then strncpy won&#x27;t null terminate. 
 // We counter this by always setting the last character in the buffer to NUL,
 // effectively cropping the string to the maximum length we can handle.
 // One can also decide to explicitly abort the program if strlen(input) is 
 // too long.
 str[sizeof(str) - 1] = &#x27;\0&#x27;;
}

== Offensive programming ==
Offensive programming is a category of defensive programming, with the added emphasis that certain errors should &quot;not&quot; be handled defensively. In this practice, only errors from outside the program&#x27;s control are to be handled (such as user input); the software itself, as well as data from within the program&#x27;s line of defense, are to be trusted in this methodology.

=== Trusting internal data validity ===

;Overly defensive programming

const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum traffic_light_color c) {
 switch (c) {
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED: return &quot;red&quot;;
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return &quot;yellow&quot;;
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN: return &quot;green&quot;;
 return &quot;black&quot;; // To be handled as a dead traffic light.


;Offensive programming

const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum traffic_light_color c) {
 switch (c) {
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED: return &quot;red&quot;;
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return &quot;yellow&quot;;
 case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN: return &quot;green&quot;;
 assert(0); // Assert that this section is unreachable.


=== Trusting software components ===

;Overly defensive programming

if (is_legacy_compatible(user_config)) {
 // Strategy: Don&#x27;t trust that the new code behaves the same
 old_code(user_config);
} else {
 // Fallback: Don&#x27;t trust that the new code handles the same cases
 if (new_code(user_config) != OK) {
 old_code(user_config);
}
;Offensive programming

// Expect that the new code has no new bugs
if (new_code(user_config) != OK) {
 // Loudly report and abruptly terminate program to get proper attention
 report_error(&quot;Something went very wrong&quot;);
 exit(-1);


== Techniques ==
Here are some defensive programming techniques:

=== Intelligent source code reuse ===
If existing code is tested and known to work, reusing it may reduce the chance of bugs being introduced.

However, reusing code is not &quot;always&quot; good practice. Reuse of existing code, especially when widely distributed, can allow for exploits to be created that target a wider audience than would otherwise be possible and brings with it all the security and vulnerabilities of the reused code.

When considering using existing source code, a quick review of the modules(sub-sections such as classes or functions) will help eliminate or make the developer aware of any potential vulnerabilities and ensure it is suitable to use in the project. 

==== Legacy problems ====
Before reusing old source code, libraries, APIs, configurations and so forth, it must be considered if the old work is valid for reuse, or if it is likely to be prone to legacy problems.

Legacy problems are problems inherent when old designs are expected to work with today&#x27;s requirements, especially when the old designs were not developed or tested with those requirements in mind.

Many software products have experienced problems with old legacy source code; for example:
* Legacy code may not have been designed under a defensive programming initiative, and might therefore be of much lower quality than newly designed source code.
* Legacy code may have been written and tested under conditions which no longer apply. The old quality assurance tests may have no validity any more.
** Example 1: legacy code may have been designed for ASCII input but now the input is UTF-8.
** Example 2: legacy code may have been compiled and tested on 32-bit architectures, but when compiled on 64-bit architectures, new arithmetic problems may occur (e.g., invalid signedness tests, invalid type casts, etc.).
** Example 3: legacy code may have been targeted for offline machines, but becomes vulnerable once network connectivity is added.
* Legacy code is not written with new problems in mind. For example, source code written in 1990 is likely to be prone to many code injection vulnerabilities, because most such problems were not widely understood at that time.

Notable examples of the legacy problem:
* BIND 9, presented by Paul Vixie and David Conrad as &quot;BINDv9 is a complete rewrite&quot;, &quot;Security was a key consideration in design&quot;, naming security, robustness, scalability and new protocols as key concerns for rewriting old legacy code.
* Microsoft Windows suffered from &quot;the&quot; Windows Metafile vulnerability and other exploits related to the WMF format. Microsoft Security Response Center describes the WMF-features as &quot;Around 1990, WMF support was added... This was a different time in the security landscape... were all completely trusted&quot;, not being developed under the security initiatives at Microsoft.
* Oracle is combating legacy problems, such as old source code written without addressing concerns of SQL injection and privilege escalation, resulting in many security vulnerabilities which have taken time to fix and also generated incomplete fixes. This has given rise to heavy criticism from security experts such as David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo. An additional criticism is that default installations (largely a legacy from old versions) are not aligned with their own security recommendations, such as Oracle Database Security Checklist, which is hard to amend as many applications require the less secure legacy settings to function correctly.

=== Canonicalization ===
Malicious users are likely to invent new kinds of representations of incorrect data. For example, if a program attempts to reject accessing the file &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, a cracker might pass another variant of this file name, like &quot;/etc/./passwd&quot;. Canonicalization libraries can be employed to avoid bugs due to non-canonical input.

=== Low tolerance against &quot;potential&quot; bugs ===
Assume that code constructs that appear to be problem prone (similar to known vulnerabilities, etc.) are bugs and potential security flaws. The basic rule of thumb is: &quot;I&#x27;m not aware of all types of security exploits. I must protect against those I &quot;do&quot; know of and then I must be proactive!&quot;.

===Other ways of securing code===
* One of the most common problems is unchecked use of constant-size or pre-allocated structures for dynamic-size data such as inputs to the program (the buffer overflow problem). This is especially common for string data in C. C library functions like codice_1 should never be used since the maximum size of the input buffer is not passed as an argument. C library functions like codice_2 can be used safely, but require the programmer to take care with the selection of safe format strings, by sanitizing it before using it.
* Encrypt/authenticate all important data transmitted over networks. Do not attempt to implement your own encryption scheme, use a proven one instead. Message checking with a hash or similar technology will also help secure data sent over a network.

====The three rules of data security====
* All data is important until proven otherwise.
* All data is tainted until proven otherwise.
* All code is insecure until proven otherwise.
** You cannot prove the security of any code in userland, or, more commonly known as: &quot;never trust the client&quot;.
These three rules about data security describe how to handle any data, internally or externally sourced:

All data is important until proven otherwise - means that all data must be verified as garbage before being destroyed.

All data is tainted until proven otherwise - means that all data must be handled in a way that does not expose the rest of the runtime environment without verifying integrity.

All code is insecure until proven otherwise - while a slight misnomer, does a good job reminding us to never assume our code is secure as bugs or undefined behavior may expose the project or system to attacks such as common SQL injection attacks.

====More Information====
* If data is to be checked for correctness, verify that it is correct, not that it is incorrect. 
* Design by contract
* Assertions (also called assertive programming)
* Prefer exceptions to return codes
** Generally speaking, it is preferable to throw exception messages that enforce part of your API contract and guide the developer instead of returning error code values that do not point to where the exception occurred or what the program stack looked liked, Better logging and exception handling will increase robustness and security of your software, while minimizing developer stress.

<doc id="62663" wikidata="Q748450" url="?curid=62663" title="Gríma Wormtongue">
<text>Gríma, called (the) Wormtongue, is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He serves as a secondary antagonist there; his role is expanded in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. He is introduced in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as the chief advisor to King Théoden of Rohan and henchman of Saruman. 

To some psychologists, Wormtongue serves as an archetypal sycophant. Tolkien scholars note that Tolkien based Wormtongue on the untrustworthy character Unferth in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He is presumptive, behaving as if he already rules Rohan, and exemplifies lechery, as correctly guessed by Gandalf; he hopes to become rich, and to take Éowyn as the woman he desires. 

The name &quot;&quot; derives from the Old English or Icelandic word meaning &quot;mask&quot;, &quot;helmet&quot;, or &quot;spectre&quot;.

==Appearances==

===&quot;The Two Towers&quot;===

Gríma, son of Gálmód, is at first a faithful servant, but he falls in league with the traitorous wizard Saruman, and from then on works to weaken King Théoden of Rohan and his kingdom through lies and persuasion, in his position as chief advisor to the King.

Tolkien describes him as &quot;a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face, and heavy lidded eyes&quot;, and a &quot;long pale tongue&quot;. Gríma is widely disliked in Edoras; everyone except Théoden calls him &quot;Wormtongue&quot;. In Old English &quot;wyrm&quot; means &quot;serpent, snake, dragon&quot;, and Gandalf repeatedly compares him to a snake:

Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king&#x27;s niece, as a reward for his services. Her brother Éomer accuses him of &quot;watching her under his lids and haunting her steps&quot;. His schemes are foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinces the king that he is not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Théoden&#x27;s restoration, &quot;many things which men had missed&quot; are found locked in Gríma&#x27;s trunk, including the king&#x27;s sword, Herugrim. Théoden decides to go forth to battle at the Fords of Isen, and Gríma is given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile. Choosing the latter, he goes to Saruman at Orthanc. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gríma mistakenly throws the &quot;palantír&quot; of Orthanc at the Men of Rohan accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permits its capture by Peregrin Took.

===&quot;The Return of the King&quot;===

Gríma accompanies Saruman to the Shire, where Saruman seeks revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the Hobbits. During this time, Saruman shortens Gríma&#x27;s nickname to &quot;Worm&quot; in order to demean him. When Saruman is overthrown by a hobbit rebellion and ordered to leave, Frodo Baggins implores Gríma not to follow him, and even offers him food, shelter, and forgiveness. Saruman counters by revealing to the Hobbits that Gríma had murdered and possibly eaten Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gríma kills Saruman by splitting his throat, and is in turn shot by Hobbit archers.

===&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;===

Gríma plays a major role in the back-story to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, prior to his first appearance in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. In &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, Tolkien writes that Gríma is captured by the Nazgûl in the fields of the Rohirrim, while on his way to Isengard to inform Saruman of Gandalf&#x27;s arrival at Edoras. He divulges what he knows of Saruman&#x27;s plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gríma is set free, and the Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version in the same chapter, this role is given to the &quot;squint-eyed southerner&quot; that the hobbits encounter at Bree. Tolkien further suggests that Gríma may have given Théoden &quot;subtle poisons&quot; that cause him to age at an accelerated pace.

==Interpretations==

To the psychologists Deborah and Mark Parker, Wormtongue serves as an archetypal sycophant, flatterer, liar, and manipulator. 

Tolkien scholars have noted that Wormtongue&#x27;s interaction with Gandalf in Meduseld has an Old English counterpart in the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;: the account is closely based on the hero Beowulf&#x27;s dealings with Unferth in Heorot, where Unferth is King Hrothgar&#x27;s &quot;ambiguous&quot; spokesman; Unferth is thoroughly discredited by Beowulf, as Wormtongue is by Gandalf.

The critic Charles W. Nelson describes Wormtongue&#x27;s attitude as an example of presumption, behaving &quot;as if he were already on the throne&quot; of Rohan. Nelson notes that Richard Purtill suggests that Tolkien is intentionally embodying the seven deadly sins in his characters. He quotes from one of Tolkien&#x27;s letters to this effect: &quot;the encouragement of good morals in this real world, by the ancient device of exemplifying them in unfamiliar embodiments, that may tend to &#x27;bring them home.&#x27;&quot; Clark writes that Dwarves exemplify greed, Men pride, Elves envy, Ents sloth, Hobbits gluttony, Orcs anger, and Wormtongue lechery. That lechery is, Nelson notes, correctly guessed by Gandalf: that he would gain a large share in Meduseld&#x27;s treasure, and Éowyn&#x27;s hand in marriage, &quot;on whose person Grima had long cast lecherous eyes and lascivious looks&quot;, and indeed in Éomer&#x27;s words that Grima had &quot;haunted her steps&quot;.

Colleen Donnelly writes that Wormtongue and Gollum are both distorted characters, and both end up disloyal to their masters. Donnelly notes that they are both &quot;eaten up by desire&quot;, but comments that where Wormtongue is irredeemably full of treason against his lord, King Théoden of Rohan, Gollum remains open to kindness and can still intend to do good and honest service. Both characters end up unintentionally doing good through what seems to be an evil act: Wormtongue slits his master Saruman&#x27;s throat, helping to end the harm being done to the hobbits&#x27; home, the Shire; while Gollum, desperate to get the One Ring, bites it off his master Frodo&#x27;s finger and falls to his death, with the Ring, into the fires of Mount Doom, thus destroying the Ring and ending the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s evil reign.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon.
In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films, Wormtongue was played by Brad Dourif, described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;unnerving presence&quot; and in &quot;The Independent&quot; as a &quot;snivelling sidekick urging his master on to acts of increasing depravity&quot;. According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character.

&quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; episode with the deaths of both Saruman and Wormtongue does not appear in the film version; the deaths were moved to an earlier scene, &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot;. The cut scene can be found on the Extended Edition DVD of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

<doc id="62665" wikidata="Q157491" url="?curid=62665" title="Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma">
<text>Marie Louise (12 December 1791 – 17 December 1847) was Duchess of Parma from 11 April 1814 until her death in 1847. She was Napoleon&#x27;s second wife and as such Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on 2 April 1810 until his abdication on 6 April 1814.

As the eldest child of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily, Marie Louise grew up during a period marked by ongoing and unceasing conflict between Austria and revolutionary France. A series of military defeats at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte had inflicted a heavy human toll on Austria and led Francis to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire. The end of the War of the Fifth Coalition resulted in the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise in 1810, which ushered in a brief period of peace and friendship between Austria and the French Empire. Marie Louise agreed to the marriage despite being raised to despise France. She bore Napoleon a son, styled the King of Rome at birth, who briefly succeeded him as Napoleon II. Marie Louise&#x27;s son was later titled Duke of Reichstadt.

Napoleon&#x27;s fortunes changed dramatically in 1812 after his failed invasion of Russia. The European powers, including Austria, resumed hostilities towards France in the War of the Sixth Coalition, which ended with the abdication of Napoleon and his exile to Elba. The 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau gave the Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla to Marie Louise, who ruled the duchies until her death.

Marie Louise married morganatically twice after Napoleon&#x27;s death in 1821. Her second husband was Count Adam Albert von Neipperg (married 1821), an equerry she met in 1814. She and Neipperg had three children: Albertine, William Albert, and Mathilde. Neipperg died in 1829. Marie Louise married Count Charles-René de Bombelles, her chamberlain, in 1834. She died in Parma in 1847.

==Early life==
Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria (who was given the Latin baptismal name of &quot;Maria Ludovica Leopoldina Francisca Theresa Josepha Lucia&quot;) was born at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on 12 December 1791 to Archduke Francis of Austria and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was named after her grandmother, Marie Louise, Holy Roman Empress. Her father became Holy Roman Emperor a year later as Francis II. Marie Louise was a great-granddaughter of Empress Maria Theresa through both her parents, as they were double first cousins. She was also a maternal granddaughter of Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s favorite sister.

Marie Louise&#x27;s formative years were during a period of conflict between France and her family. She was brought up to detest France and French ideas. Her upbringing was supervised by her French imperial governess Victoire de Folliot de Crenneville. Marie Louise was influenced by her grandmother Maria Carolina, who despised the French Revolution which ultimately caused the death of her sister, Marie Antoinette. Maria Carolina&#x27;s Kingdom of Naples had also come into direct conflict with French forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The War of the Third Coalition brought Austria to the brink of ruin, which increased Marie Louise&#x27;s resentment towards Napoleon. The Imperial family was forced to flee Vienna in 1805. Marie Louise took refuge in Hungary and later Galicia before returning to Vienna in 1806. Her father relinquished the title of Holy Roman Emperor but remained Emperor of Austria.

To make her more marriageable, her parents had her tutored in many languages. In addition to her native German, she became fluent in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.

In 1807, when Marie Louise was 15, her mother died after suffering a miscarriage. Less than a year later, Emperor Francis married his first cousin Maria Ludovika Beatrix of Austria-Este, who was four years older than Marie Louise. Nonetheless, Maria Ludovika Beatrix took on a maternal role towards her stepdaughter. She was also bitter towards the French, who had deprived her father of the Duchy of Modena.

Another war broke out between France and Austria in 1809, which resulted in defeat for the Austrians again. The Imperial family had to flee Vienna again before the city surrendered on 12 May. Their journey was hampered by bad weather, and they arrived in Buda &quot;wet through, and nearly worn out with fatigue&quot;.

==Marriage proposal==
After escaping an assassination attempt in Vienna, while negotiating the Treaty of Schönbrunn on 12 October 1809, Emperor Napoleon decided that he needed an heir to cement his relatively young Empire. He also sought the validation and legitimization of his Empire by marrying a member of one of the leading royal families of Europe. He began proceedings to divorce Joséphine de Beauharnais, and per his family&#x27;s wishes, he began searching for a new empress. His wish to marry Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia, the youngest sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, caused alarm in Austria, where they were afraid of being sandwiched between two great powers allied with each other. At the persuasion of Prince Metternich, a marriage between Napoleon and Marie Louise was suggested by Emperor Francis to the Count of Narbonne but no official overture was made by the Austrians. Though officials in Paris and Austria were beginning to accept the possibility of the union, Marie Louise was kept uninformed of developments.

Frustrated by the Russians delaying the marriage negotiations, Napoleon rescinded his proposal in late January 1810 and began negotiations to marry Marie Louise with the Austrian ambassador, the Prince of Schwarzenberg. Schwarzenberg signed the marriage contract on 7 February. Marie Louise was informed of the marriage by Metternich. When asked for consent, she replied: &quot;I wish only what my duty commands me to wish.&quot;

==Wedding==

Marie Louise was married by proxy to Napoleon on 11 March 1810 at the Augustinian Church, Vienna. Napoleon was represented by Archduke Charles, the bride&#x27;s uncle. According to the French ambassador, the marriage &quot;was celebrated with a magnificence that it would be hard to surpass, by the side of which even the brilliant festivities that have preceded it are not to be mentioned&quot;. She became Empress of the French and Queen of Italy.

Marie Louise departed Vienna on 13 March, probably expecting never to return. Upon arriving in France she was placed in the custody of Napoleon&#x27;s sister, who had her put through a symbolic old ritual. Tradition dictated that a royal bride coming to France must keep nothing of her homeland, especially her clothes. Accordingly, Marie Louise was stripped of her dress, corset, stockings, and chemise, leaving her completely naked. Napoleon&#x27;s sister then made the nude Marie take a bath. She was then redressed in French bridal clothes. Marie Antoinette had been put through a similar ritual when she arrived in France in 1770. She met Napoleon for the first time on 27 March in Compiègne, remarking to him: &quot;You are much better-looking than your portrait.&quot;

The civil wedding was held at the Saint James Church on 1 April 1810. The next day, Napoleon and Marie Louise made the journey to Paris in the coronation coach. The Imperial Guard cavalry led the procession, followed by the herald-at-arms and then the carriages. The Marshals of France rode on each side, near the doors of the carriages. The procession arrived at the Tuileries Palace, and the Imperial couple made their way to the Salon Carré chapel (in the Louvre) for the religious wedding ceremony. The ceremony was conducted by Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Grand Almoner of France and Napoleon&#x27;s uncle. A Bridal March was composed for the occasion by Ferdinando Paer, and a cantata by Johann Nepomuk Hummel.

Elaborate celebrations continued to be held in May and June 1810. These included a ball, a masque, a sea-battle on the Seine, and a display of fireworks created by Claude-Fortuné Ruggieri, for 4,000 people.

By this marriage, Napoleon became the great-nephew-in-law of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.

==Marriage to Napoleon==
===Life as empress===
Marie Louise was excited as Napoleon’s wife and settled in quickly in the French court. She developed a close friendship with her &quot;Première dame d&#x27;honneur&quot;, the Duchess of Montebello, while most of the daily affairs were handled by her &quot;Dame d&#x27;atour&quot; Jeanne Charlotte du Luçay. Napoleon initially remarked that he had &quot;married a womb&quot; to an aide, but their relationship soon grew. He &quot;spared no pains&quot; to please her and claimed at one point to prefer Marie Louise to his first wife Joséphine; while he had loved Joséphine, and though he claimed Joséphine remained his greatest friend even after their amicable divorce, and that he still would choose her, whereas with Marie Louise, there was &quot;Never a lie, never a debt&quot; — presumably a reference to Joséphine&#x27;s rumoured extramarital affairs and reputation as a spendthrift. Marie Louise wrote to her father: &quot;I assure you, dear papa, that people have done great injustice to the Emperor. The better one knows him, the better one appreciates and loves him.&quot; However, the marriage was not without tension; Napoleon sometimes remarked to aides that Marie Louise was too shy and timid, compared to the outgoing and passionate Josephine, with whom he remained in close contact, upsetting Marie Louise.

The excitement surrounding the wedding ushered in a period of peace and friendship between France and Austria, who had been largely at war for the last two decades. The people of Vienna, who hated Napoleon only months before, were suddenly in full praise of the French Emperor. Flattering letters were sent between Napoleon and Emperor Francis, Empress Maria Ludovika Beatrix and Archduke Charles during the wedding festivities.

During public occasions, Marie Louise spoke little due to reserve and timidity, which some observers mistook for haughtiness. She was regarded as a quiet woman and never interfered in politics. Privately, she was polite and gentle.

Napoleon arranged for Marie Louise to participate in some carefully selected charity assignments, most notably the Société de Charité Maternelle, for which he made her Honorary President.

===Birth of first child===

Marie Louise became pregnant by July 1810 and gave birth to a son on 20 March 1811. The boy, Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte, was given the title &quot;King of Rome&quot;, in accordance with the practice where the heir apparent to the Holy Roman Empire was called the King of the Romans. Napoleon was delighted that his wife survived the ordeal and said: &quot;I had rather never have any more children than see her suffer so much again.&quot;

Marie Louise was devoted to her son; she had him brought to her every morning and visited him in his apartment in the course of the day.

===Resumption of war===
In May 1812, a month before the French invasion of Russia, Marie Louise accompanied Napoleon to Dresden, where she met her father and stepmother. Emperor Francis told Napoleon he could count on Austria for the &quot;triumph of the common cause&quot;, a reference to the impending war. A minor rivalry began to develop between Marie Louise and the Empress of Austria, who was jealous at being upstaged in appearance by her stepdaughter. It was also in Dresden where she met Count Adam Albert von Neipperg for the first time. Napoleon left Dresden on 29 May to take charge of his army.

Marie Louise then travelled to Prague, where she spent a few weeks with the Austrian Imperial family, before returning to Saint Cloud on 18 July. She kept in touch with Napoleon throughout the war. The invasion of Russia ended disastrously for France. More than half of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was destroyed by the Russian Winter and guerrilla attacks. After the failed Malet coup of October 1812, Napoleon hastened his return to France and reunited with his wife on the night of 18 December.

===Collapse of the Empire===

The weakened French position triggered the Sixth Coalition. Prussia allied with Russia and declared war on France (the United Kingdom was already at war with France), but Austria stayed out due to relations between the Imperial families. On 30 March, Marie Louise was appointed Regent as Napoleon set off for battle in Germany. The regency was only &quot;de jure&quot;, as all decisions were still taken by Napoleon and implemented by his most senior officials, including Lebrun, Joseph Bonaparte, Talleyrand and Savary. Marie Louise tried unsuccessfully to get her father to ally with France. Austria too joined the opposition to France. She maintained a correspondence with Napoleon, informing him of increasing demands for peace in Paris and the provinces. Napoleon was decisively defeated in Leipzig on 19 October and returned to Saint Cloud on 9 November.

On 23 January 1814, Marie Louise was appointed Regent for the second time. On 25 January, at 03:00 in the morning, Napoleon embraced Marie Louise and his son for the last time. He left to lead a hastily formed army to stave off the Allied invasion from the north.

As the Allies neared Paris, Marie Louise was reluctant to leave. She felt that as the daughter of the sovereign of Austria, one of the allied members, she would be treated with respect by Allied forces, with the possibility of her son succeeding the throne should Napoleon be deposed. She was also afraid that her departure would strengthen the royalist supporters of the Bourbons. Marie Louise was finally persuaded to leave by Henri Clarke, who received the order from Napoleon: &quot;I would prefer to know that they [the Empress and the King of Rome] are both at the bottom of the Seine rather than in the hands of the foreigners.&quot; On 29 March, the court left Paris. The Allies entered the city the following day.

Marie Louise and the court moved to Blois, which was safe from the Allies. She did not expect her father to dethrone Napoleon and deprive her son of the crown of France. On 3 April, the Senate, at the instigation of Talleyrand, announced the deposition of the Emperor. Marie Louise was unaware of this until 7 April, and was astonished to discover the turn of events. She wanted to return to Paris, but was dissuaded from doing so by physician Jean-Nicolas Corvisart and the Duchess of Montebello.

===Exile of Napoleon===
Napoleon abdicated the throne on 11 April 1814 in Fontainebleau. The Treaty of Fontainebleau exiled him to Elba, allowed Marie Louise to retain her imperial rank and style and made her ruler of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, with her son as heir. This arrangement was later revised at the Congress of Vienna.

Marie Louise was strongly dissuaded from rejoining her husband by her advisors, who fed her accounts that Napoleon was distraught with grief over the death of Joséphine. On 16 April, her father arrived at Blois to meet her. At the advice of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise departed Rambouillet with her son for Vienna on 23 April. At Vienna, she stayed at Schönbrunn, where she received frequent visits from her sisters, but rarely from her father and stepmother. She met her grandmother, Maria Carolina, who disapproved of her deserting her husband. Distressed at being seen as a heartless wife and indifferent mother, she wrote on 9 August 1814: &quot;I am in a very unhappy and critical position; I must be very prudent in my conduct. There are moments when that thought so distracts me that I think that the best thing I could do would be to die.&quot;

==Congress of Vienna and relationship with Neipperg==
In the summer of 1814, Emperor Francis sent Count Adam Albert von Neipperg to accompany Marie Louise to the spa town of Aix-les-Bains to prevent her from joining Napoleon on Elba. Neipperg was a confidant of Metternich and an enemy of Napoleon. Marie Louise fell in love with Neipperg. They became lovers. He became her chamberlain, and her advocate at the Congress of Vienna. News of the relationship was not received well by the French and the Austrian public.

When Napoleon escaped in March 1815 and reinstated his rule, the Allies once again declared war. Marie Louise was asked by her stepmother to join in the processions to pray for the success of the Austrian armies but rejected the insulting invitation. She passed a message to Napoleon&#x27;s private secretary, Claude-François de Méneval, who was about to return to France: &quot;I hope he will understand the misery of my position ... I shall never assent to a divorce, but I flatter myself that he will not oppose an amicable separation, and that he will not bear any ill feeling towards me ... This separation has become imperative; it will in no way affect the feelings of esteem and gratitude that I preserve.&quot; Napoleon was defeated for the last time at the Battle of Waterloo and was exiled to Saint Helena from October 1815. Napoleon made no further attempt to contact her personally.

The Congress of Vienna recognised Marie Louise as ruler of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, but prevented her from bringing her son to Italy. It also made her Duchess of Parma for her life only, as the Allies did not want a descendant of Napoleon to have a hereditary claim over Parma. After her death, the duchy was to revert to the Bourbons.

==Duchess of Parma==
Marie Louise departed for Parma on 7 March 1816, accompanied by Neipperg. She entered the duchy on 18 April. She wrote to her father: &quot;People welcomed me with such enthusiasm that I had tears in my eyes.&quot; She largely left the running of day-to-day affairs to Neipperg, who received instructions from Metternich. In December 1816, Marie Louise removed the incumbent Grand Chamberlain (prime minister) and installed Neipperg.

She and Neipperg had three children:
* Albertine, Countess of Montenuovo (1817–1867), married Luigi Sanvitale, Count of Fontanellato
* William Albert, Count of Montenuovo, later created Prince of Montenuovo (1819–1895), married Countess Juliana Batthyány von Németújvár

Napoleon died on 5 May 1821. On 8 August, Marie Louise married Neipperg morganatically. Neipperg died of heart problems on 22 February 1829, devastating Marie Louise. She was banned by Austria from mourning in public. To replace Neipperg, Austria appointed Josef von Werklein as Grand Chamberlain.

Marie Louise&#x27;s son by Napoleon, then known as &quot;Franz&quot;, was given the title &quot;Duke of Reichstadt&quot; in 1818. Franz lived at the Austrian court, where he was shown great affection by his grandfather, but was constantly undermined by Austrian ministers and nationalists, who did their best to sideline him to become an irrelevance. There were fears that he might be smuggled over to France to regain the throne, as he could be easily disguised as a girl. 
Franz grew resentful at his Austrian relatives and his mother for their lack of support, and began identifying as Napoleon II and surrounding himself with French courtiers. The relationship with his mother broke down when he became aware that his mother had borne two illegitimate children to Neipperg prior to their marriage; this occurred to such an extent that he once remarked &quot;If Josephine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried at Saint Helena, and I should not be at Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved; Josephine was.&quot; However, before anything could become of Napoleon II, he died at the age of 21 in Vienna in 1832, after suffering from tuberculosis.

1831 saw the outbreak of the Carbonari-led uprisings in Italy. In Parma, protesters gathered in the streets to denounce Grand Chamberlain Werklein. Marie Louise did not know what to do and wanted to leave the city, but was prevented from doing so by the protesters, who saw her as someone who would listen to their demands. She managed to leave Parma between 14 and 15 February, and the rebels formed a provisional government, led by Count Filippo Luigi Linati. At Piacenza, she wrote to her father, asking him to replace Werklein. Francis sent in Austrian troops, which crushed the rebellion. To avoid further turmoil, Marie Louise granted amnesty to the dissidents on 29 September.

To replace Werklein, in 1833, Metternich sent Charles-René de Bombelles, a French émigré nobleman who had served in the Austrian army against Napoleon. Bombelles was an excellent Grand Chamberlain, who thoroughly reformed the finances of the duchy. A middle-aged widower, he also developed a close personal relationship with Marie Louise. Six months after his arrival, on 17 February 1834, she married him, again morganatically.

==Death==
Marie Louise fell ill on 9 December 1847. Her condition worsened for the next few days. On 17 December, she passed out after vomiting and never woke up again. She died in the evening. The cause of death was determined to be pleurisy.

Her body was transferred back to Vienna and buried at the Imperial Crypt.

== Arms ==
Her arms as Duchess of Parma are used as the logo of the perfume company Acqua di Parma. This is in homage to the role she played in helping to develop the perfume and glass industry of Parma.

<doc id="62666" wikidata="Q159778" url="?curid=62666" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">
<text>Michelle Marie Pfeiffer ( ; born April 29, 1958) is an American actress. She was one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood during the 1980s and 1990s, and her performances have earned her numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a British Academy Film Award, as well as nominations for three Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Pfeiffer began her acting career with minor television and film appearances, and secured her first lead role in &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982). Her breakthrough role as Elvira Hancock in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983) propelled her into mainstream success, which continued with performances in &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987) and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988). Pfeiffer received her first of six consecutive Golden Globe Award nominations for &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988). Her roles in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; (1989) garnered her two consecutive Academy Award nominations, for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress respectively, and she won a Golden Globe Award for the latter.

Cemented as one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1990s, Pfeiffer starred in &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990) and &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1991). In 1992, she played Catwoman in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and received her third Academy Award nomination for &quot;Love Field&quot;, which she followed up with performances in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993) and &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994). She also produced several of her own features through her company Via Rosa Productions, including &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; (1995). Reducing her workload to prioritize her family, Pfeiffer acted sporadically throughout the 2000s, starring in &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000), &quot;White Oleander&quot; (2002), &quot;Hairspray&quot;, and &quot;Stardust&quot; (both 2007).

Following another hiatus, Pfeiffer returned to prominence in 2017 with performances in &quot;Where Is Kyra?&quot;, &quot;Mother!&quot;, and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, and received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for playing Ruth Madoff in &quot;The Wizard of Lies&quot;. In 2020, she received her eighth Golden Globe Award nomination for &quot;French Exit&quot;. Pfeiffer has played Janet van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2018, beginning with &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot;.

==Early life==
Michelle Marie Pfeiffer was born on April 29, 1958, in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Donna Jean (née Taverna), a housewife, and Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor. She has an older brother, Rick, and two younger sisters, Dedee and Lori. Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German-Italian descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. The family moved to Midway City, another Orange County community around seven miles (11 km) away, where Pfeiffer spent her early years.

Pfeiffer attended Fountain Valley High School, graduating in 1976. She worked as a check-out girl at Vons supermarket, and attended Golden West College where she was a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. After a short stint training to be a court stenographer, she pursued an acting career. Pfeiffer won the Miss Orange County beauty pageant in 1978 and finished sixth in the Miss California contest the same year. After her appearances in these pageants, Pfeiffer acquired an agent and began to audition for television and film roles.

==Career==
===Late 1970s and 1980s===
Pfeiffer made her acting debut in 1978, in a one-episode appearance of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Other roles on television series followed, including &quot;Delta House&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Enos&quot; and &quot;B.A.D. Cats&quot;, as well as in the made-for-CBS film &quot;The Solitary Man&quot; (1979). Pfeiffer transitioned to film with the comedy &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; (1980), with Tony Danza, appearing as high school sweethearts. She subsequently played supporting roles in &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (1980) with Susannah York and &quot;Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen&quot; (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap, and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, before appearing in three 1981 television movies – &quot;Callie and Son&quot;, with Lindsay Wagner, &quot;The Children Nobody Wanted&quot; and &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;.

Pfeiffer obtained her first starring film role as the female lead in &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), the sequel to the smash-hit musical film &quot;Grease&quot; (1978). With only a few television roles and small film appearances, the 23-year-old Pfeiffer was an unknown actress when she attended the casting call audition for the role, but according to director Patricia Birch, she won the part because she &quot;has a quirky quality you don&#x27;t expect&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial failure but Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance was noted as a standout. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked: &quot;[A]lthough she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable than anyone else in the cast.&quot; Despite escaping the critical mauling, her agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that &quot;she couldn&#x27;t get any jobs. Nobody wanted to hire her.&quot; On her early screen roles, she asserted: &quot;I needed to learn how to act ... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and cashing in on my looks.&quot;

Director Brian De Palma, having seen &quot;Grease 2&quot;, refused to audition Pfeiffer for &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), but relented at the insistence of Martin Bregman, the film&#x27;s producer. She was cast as cocaine-addicted trophy wife Elvira Hancock. The film was considered excessively violent by most critics, but became a commercial hit and gained a large cult following in subsequent years. Pfeiffer received positive reviews for her supporting turn; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;most of the large cast is fine: Michelle Pfeiffer is better ...&quot; while Dominick Dunne, in an article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; titled &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot;, wrote, &quot;[s]he is on the verge of stardom. In the parlance of the industry, she is hot.&quot;

Following &quot;Scarface&quot;, she played Diana in John Landis&#x27; comedy &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1985), with Jeff Goldblum; Isabeau d&#x27;Anjou in Richard Donner&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; (1985), with Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick; Faith Healy in Alan Alda&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; (1986), with Michael Caine; and Brenda Landers in a segment of the 1950s sci-fi parody &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot; (1987), all of which, despite achieving only modest commercial success, helped to establish her as an actress. She finally scored a major box-office hit as Sukie Ridgemont in the 1987 adaptation of John Updike&#x27;s novel &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, with Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Susan Sarandon. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $63.7 million domestically, equivalent to $ million in dollars, becoming one of her earliest critical and commercial successes. Praising their comedic timing, Roger Ebert wrote that Pfeiffer and her female co-stars each &quot;have a delicious good time with their roles&quot;, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Sheila Benson said Pfeiffer makes her character &quot;a warm, irresistible character.&quot;

Pfeiffer was cast against type, as a murdered gangster&#x27;s widow, in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s mafia comedy &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988), with Matthew Modine, Dean Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl. For the role of Angela de Marco, she donned a curly brunette wig and a Brooklyn accent, and received her first Golden Globe Award nomination as Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, beginning a six-year streak of consecutive Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes. Pfeiffer then appeared as chic restaurateuse Jo Ann Vallenari in &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988) with Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell, but experienced creative and personal differences with director Robert Towne, who later described her as the &quot;most difficult&quot; actress he has ever worked with.

At Demme&#x27;s personal recommendation, Pfeiffer joined the cast of Stephen Frears&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), with Glenn Close and John Malkovich, playing Madame Marie de Tourvel, the virtuous victim of seduction. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; saw Pfeiffer&#x27;s role as &quot;the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it&#x27;s used makes it seem an aspect of her spirituality.&quot; She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Pfeiffer then accepted the role of Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; (1989), which also starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys. She underwent intense voice training for the role for four months, and performed all of her character&#x27;s vocals. The film was a modest success, grossing $18.4 million in the US and Canada (equivalent to $ million in dollars ). Her portrayal of Susie, however, drew unanimous acclaim from critics. Critic Roger Ebert compared her to Rita Hayworth in &quot;Gilda&quot; and to Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, adding that the film was &quot;one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star&quot;. During the 1989–1990 awards season, Pfeiffer won as Best Actress at the Golden Globes, the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the Chicago Film Critics Association. Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance as Susie is considered to be the most critically acclaimed of her career. The scene in which her character seductively performs &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; atop a grand piano is considered to be a memorable scene in modern cinema.

===1990s===

In 1990, Pfeiffer formed her own film production company, Via Rosa Productions, with business partner Kate Guinzburg, whom she had met on the set of &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; (1986). The company was under a picture deal with Touchstone Pictures, a film label of The Walt Disney Studios. That year, Pfeiffer began earning $1 million per film, and took on the part of the Soviet book editor Katya Orlova in the film adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Russia House&quot;, with Sean Connery, a role that required her to adopt a Russian accent. For her efforts, she was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Pfeiffer then landed the role of damaged waitress Frankie in Garry Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1991), a film adaptation of Terrence McNally&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;Scarface&quot; co-star, Al Pacino. The casting was seen as controversial by many, as Pfeiffer was considered far too beautiful to play an &quot;ordinary&quot; waitress; Kathy Bates, the original Frankie on Broadway, also expressed disappointment over the producers&#x27; choice. Pfeiffer herself stated that she took the role because it &quot;wasn&#x27;t what people would expect of [her]&quot;. Pfeiffer was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance.

Pfeiffer took on the role of Selina Kyle–Catwoman in Tim Burton&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), opposite Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito, after Annette Bening dropped out because of her pregnancy. For the role, she trained in martial arts and kickboxing. Pfeiffer received unanimous critical acclaim for her portrayal, which is often referred to as the greatest performance of Catwoman of all time by critics and fans. &quot;Premiere&quot; retrospectively stated: &quot;Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era, Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise. Her stitched-together, black patent leather costume, based on a sketch of Burton&#x27;s, remains the character&#x27;s most iconic look. And Michelle Pfeiffer overcomes &quot;Batman Returns&quot;″ heavy-handed feminist dialogue to deliver a growling, fierce performance.&quot; &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was a big box office success, grossing over US$267 million worldwide.

The first film her company produced was the independent drama &quot;Love Field&quot;, which was released in 1992. Reviewers embraced the film and &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Pfeiffer was &quot;again demonstrating that she is as subtle and surprising as she is beautiful&quot;. For her portrayal of an eccentric Dallas, Texas housewife, she earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe for Best Actress – Drama and won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), a film adaptation of Edith Wharton&#x27;s 1920 novel, Pfeiffer starred with Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder, portraying a Countess in upper-class New York City in the 1870s. For her role, she received the Elvira Notari Prize at the Venice Film Festival, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture. That year, she was awarded the Women in Film Los Angeles&#x27; Crystal Award.

Following the formation of her producing company, Via Rosa Productions, Pfeiffer saw a professional expansion as a producer. While she continued to act steadily throughout the decade, she and her producing partner Guinzburg experienced a winning streak of producing back to back films next under their header. She starred with Jack Nicholson in the 1994 horror film &quot;Wolf&quot;, portraying the sardonic and willful interest of a writer who becomes a wolf-man at night after being bitten by a creature. The film was released to a mixed critical reception; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Ms. Pfeiffer&#x27;s role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling.&quot; &quot;Wolf&quot; was a commercial success, grossing US$65 million (equivalent to $ million in ) at the domestic box office and US$131 million worldwide (equivalent to $ million).

Pfeiffer&#x27;s next role was that of high school teacher and former United States Marine LouAnne Johnson in the drama &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; (1995), co-produced by her company. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; by Coolio, featuring L.V.; the song won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, and the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. While &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; received negative reviews, it was a box office success, grossing US$179.5 million around the globe. In 1996, Pfeiffer portrayed Sally Atwater in the romantic drama &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;, with Robert Redford, took on the titular role in the drama &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot;, which was adapted by her husband David Kelley from Michael Brady&#x27;s play of the same name, and served as an executive producer and starred as the divorced single mother architect Melanie Parker in the romantic comedy &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, with George Clooney.

Subsequent performances included Rose Cook Lewis in the film adaptation of Jane Smiley&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; (1997) with Jessica Lange and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Beth Cappadora in &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; (1998) about a married couple who found their son who was kidnapped nine years ago; Titania the Queen of the Fairies in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1999) with Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett and Stanley Tucci; and Katie Jordan in Rob Reiner&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;The Story of Us&quot; (1999) with Bruce Willis. &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; and &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; were also produced by Via Rosa Productions. Pfeiffer voiced Tzipporah, a shepherdess who becomes the wife of Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), in DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), a musical adaptation based on the Book of Exodus. She also recorded the film&#x27;s theme song &quot;When You Believe&quot;, for which songwriter Stephen Schwartz won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was released to critical and commercial success, but Kenneth Turan found the film&#x27;s modernization of Pfeiffer&#x27;s character into a &quot;feisty protofeminist&quot; to be problematic.

===2000s===
Pfeiffer began to dissolve her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and moved into semi-retirement to spend more quality time with her children and family. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called &quot;Original Sin&quot; (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.

In &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000), a Hitchcockian thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis, Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office, and went on to gross US$291 million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama &quot;I Am Sam&quot; (2001), with Sean Penn. Despite grossing $97.8 million worldwide, the film was unfavourably reviewed by critics; &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote: &quot;Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland clichés that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;SF Gate&quot; observed: &quot;In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It&#x27;s hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material.&quot;

Pfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist, named Ingrid Magnussen, in the drama &quot;White Oleander&quot; (2002), with Alison Lohman (in her film début), Renée Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was a critical and commercial success in its arthouse release. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described her as &quot;incandescent&quot;, bringing &quot;power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator&quot; in a &quot;riveting, impeccable performance&quot;. She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.

In 2003, Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in &quot;&quot;, an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character&#x27;s villainies. Initially the character was &quot;too sexual&quot;, then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him &quot;You know, you really can fire me,&quot; but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. During this time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.

Pfeiffer returned to cinemas in 2007 with villainous roles in two summer blockbusters, &quot;Hairspray&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot;, which was hailed as a successful comeback by the media. In the former, a film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, she starred alongside John Travolta, Christopher Walken and Queen Latifah as Velma Von Tussle, the racist manager of a television station. Although a fan of Pfeiffer&#x27;s work in the musicals &quot;Grease 2&quot; and &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, director Adam Shankman cast Pfeiffer largely based on her performance in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, claiming she was his first and only choice for Velma. Although she had fun with the part, Pfeiffer described Velma as the most difficult role she had played at the time, because of her character&#x27;s racism; but she was drawn to the film&#x27;s important message of anti-bigotry, accepting that &quot;in order to do a movie about racism, somebody has got to be the racist&quot;. Released to widely positive reviews, &quot;Hairspray&quot; grossed $202.5 million worldwide. Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance was also critically acclaimed, with film critic David Edelstein of NPR calling her &quot;sublime&quot;. The cast of &quot;Hairspray&quot; was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture, and won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast, the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Ensemble of the Year, and the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Ensemble Cast. In the fantasy adventure &quot;Stardust&quot;, Pfeiffer plays Lamia, an ancient witch who hunts a fallen star (Claire Danes) in search of eternal youth. The film received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office, earning $135.5 million globally. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Stephen Holden described Pfeiffer as &quot;as deliciously evil a witch as the movies have ever invented&quot;, writing that she &quot;goes for broke with the relish of a star who figures she has nothing to lose.&quot;

Pfeiffer starred in Amy Heckerling&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;I Could Never Be Your Woman&quot; (2007), with Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan, portraying Rosie, a 40-year-old divorced mother working as a scriptwriter and producer for a television show who falls in love with a much younger man (Rudd). Her reported salary was US$1 million, with an advance on 15 percent of the gross. However, the film was only distributed on home video markets domestically. Reviews for &quot;I Could Never Be Your Woman&quot; were moderately positive, with critic James Berardinelli finding Pfeiffer and Rudd to &quot;have adequate chemistry to pull off the romance,&quot; in what he described as an &quot;enjoyable romantic comedy that has enough going for it to make it worth a recommendation.&quot; Pfeiffer starred in &quot;Personal Effects&quot;, with Ashton Kutcher, playing two grieving people coping with the pain and frustration of their loss whose bond spawns an unlikely romance. The drama premiered at Iowa City&#x27;s Englert Theatre in December 2008.

Her next film, an adaptation of Colette&#x27;s &quot;Chéri&quot;, reunited her with the director (Stephen Frears) and screenwriter (Christopher Hampton) of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988). Pfeiffer played the role of aging retired courtesan Léa de Lonval, with Rupert Friend in the title role, with Kathy Bates as his mother. &quot;Chéri&quot; premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, where it received a nomination for the Golden Bear award. &quot;The Times&quot; of London reviewed the film favorably, describing Hampton&#x27;s screenplay as a &quot;steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one-liners&quot; and Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance as &quot;magnetic and subtle, her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache&quot;. Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt&quot;. Kenneth Turan in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the &quot;wordless scenes that catch Léa unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world. It&#x27;s the kind of refined, delicate acting Pfeiffer does so well, and it&#x27;s a further reminder of how much we&#x27;ve missed her since she&#x27;s been away.&quot;

===2010s===
Following a two-year sabbatical from acting, Pfeiffer made part of a large ensemble cast in Garry Marshall&#x27;s ensemble romantic comedy &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (2011), her second collaboration with Marshall after &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;. The film, also starring Halle Berry, Jessica Biel, Robert De Niro, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Sofía Vergara, among many others, saw her take on the supporting role of Ingrid Withers, an overwhelmed secretary befriending a deliveryman (Efron). While the film was panned by critics, it made US$142 million worldwide. In 2012, she appeared with Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks in the drama &quot;People Like Us&quot;, as the mother of a struggling New York City corporate trader (Pine). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found her to be &quot;luminous&quot; in the film, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, positively pointing out Pfeiffer and Banks, noted that their performances &quot;partly compensate for the holes in a story whose timing is hard to swallow&quot;. &quot;People Like Us&quot; debuted to US$4.26 million, described as &quot;meager&quot; by Box Office Mojo, and only made US$12 million in North America.

Pfieffer reunited with Tim Burton, her &quot;Batman Returns&quot; director, in &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012), based on the gothic television soap opera of the same name. In the film, co-starring Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chloë Grace Moretz, she played Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the matriarch of the Collins family. Critical response towards the film was mixed, but writers acclaimed the actors&#x27; performances—most notably Depp and Pfeiffer&#x27;s. &quot;IGN&quot; found her to be &quot;commanding&quot; in her role and felt that the main characters were &quot;played by one of Burton&#x27;s best ensemble casts yet&quot;. While &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; grossed a modest US$79.7 million in North America, it ultimately made US$245.5 million globally. In Luc Besson&#x27;s mob-comedy &quot;The Family&quot; (2013), co-starring Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, Dianna Agron and John D&#x27;Leo, she played the &quot;tough mother&quot; in a Mafia family wanting to change their lives under the witness protection program. Although reviews for the film were mixed, &quot;THV11&quot; said on the cast&#x27;s portrayals: &quot;The core actors of &quot;The Family&quot; were really solid, and the whole film comes together to make a solid movie.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; felt that &quot;De Niro, Pfieffer and Jones all brought 100% to their roles.&quot; The film grossed US$78.4 million worldwide.

Pfeiffer stated that her lack of acting throughout the 2000s was due to several reasons, including family matters and her approach to choosing roles. She stated she was intending to &quot;work a lot&quot; once her children left for college, mentioning that she felt her best performance was &quot;still in her&quot;, saying how that&#x27;s what she felt kept her going.

In the independent drama &quot;Where Is Kyra?&quot;, Pfeiffer starred as a sensitive and fragile woman who loses her mother and &quot;faces a crisis in which she must find a means for survival, all the while hiding her struggles from her new lover&quot;. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2017, and received a limited release on April 6, 2018, to critical acclaim; Her role as &quot;Kyra&quot; was called the &quot;performance of her life&quot; by &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Bilge Ebiri, and &quot;the performance of her career&quot;, by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Pfeiffer landed the role of Ruth Madoff for the HBO Films drama &quot;The Wizard of Lies&quot;, based on the book of the same name. The film, directed by Barry Levinson, reunites her with actor Robert De Niro, who played her husband, disgraced financier Bernard Madoff. &quot;The Wizard of Lies&quot; premiered on HBO on May 20, 2017, garnering favorable reviews from critics and an audience of 1.5 million viewers, HBO&#x27;s largest premiere viewership for a film in four years. &quot;Tolucan Times&quot; remarked that Pfeiffer &quot;steals the show as Madoff&#x27;s wife, Ruth, and is a remarkable lookalike&quot;, while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserted: &quot;As Ruth, Pfeiffer convincingly portrays a pampered woman left with utterly nothing —she&#x27;s lost her homes, status and, most important, her relationship with her sons.&quot; She received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Movie, in addition to a Golden Globe Award nomination.

In Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s psychological horror film &quot;Mother!&quot; (2017), Pfeiffer portrayed one of the mysterious guests who interrupt the tranquil life of a couple, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. Although &quot;Mother!&quot; divided critics and audiences, reviewers praised Pfeiffer unanimously, some of whom found her performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. &quot;Vulture&quot; remarked: &quot;Out of the main actors, it&#x27;s Pfeiffer who is able to root the character in meaning — she bracingly marries the exploration of Biblical creation, mythological overtones, and hellish domestic commentary. There&#x27;s a gravity to Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance that allows her to succeed where the other main actors fail, save for brief spurts — she straddles the boundaries between embodying a symbol and granting the character enough interiority to feel like a flesh and blood woman, too.&quot;

Pfeiffer played a widowed socialite in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017), the fourth screen adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1934 novel of the same name. Featuring an ensemble cast, the mystery film follows world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) attempting to solve a murder, while stranded with several suspects on the Orient Express during the 1930s. She also recorded the original song &quot;Never Forget&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The film grossed US$351.7 million worldwide and received decent reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, but criticism for not adding anything new to previous adaptations. Although some critics found its large cast underused, Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance was praised, with Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; saying she delivered the film&#x27;s best performance. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Anthony Lane found that only Pfeiffer appears to be enjoying their material, while Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; credited the film with reminding audiences that she is one of the industry&#x27;s best actresses. David Edelstein of &quot;Vulture&quot; described the actress as &quot;a hoot and a half ... stealing every scene&quot;.

Pfeiffer debuted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Janet van Dyne, the original Wasp, in the &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015) sequel &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018). Variety&quot;&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman described her performance as &quot;lovely&quot; and &quot;wistful&quot;, while Josh Spiegel of /Film believed the film suffers from a lack of the actress. In 2019, Pfeiffer briefly reprised the role in &quot;&quot;, and starred alongside Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning in the dark fantasy sequel &quot;&quot;, playing the villainous Queen Ingrith. Despite the film earning mixed reviews, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;&#x27;s Laura DeMarco felt that both Jolie and Pfeiffer &quot;clearly relish their roles.&quot;

===2020s===
Pfeiffer headlined the dark comedy &quot;French Exit&quot; (2020), based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Patrick deWitt, directed by Azazel Jacobs. In the film, which co-stars Lucas Hedges and Tracy Letts, Pfeiffer played a widow who moves to Paris, France, with her son (Hedges) and cat, who happens to be her reincarnated husband (Letts). The film premiered at the New York Film Festival, to a positive reception. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that she gave a performance &quot;for which she&#x27;ll be remembered.&quot; Pfeiffer received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.

Pfeiffer portrayed former First Lady Betty Ford in the anthology drama television series &quot;The First Lady&quot;, which premiered on Showtime in April 2022. The following year, she reprised the role of Janet van Dyne in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;. Manohla Dargis declared her the film&#x27;s M.V.P.

Pfeiffer is attached to star alongside Annette Bening in the psychological thriller, &quot;Turn of Mind&quot;, set to be directed by Gideon Raff. In 2022, she was cast in &quot;Wild Four O&#x27;Clocks&quot;, penned and directed by Peter Craig, and produced by Marc Platt and Adam Siegel.

On March 18, 2024, it was announced that Pfeiffer had been cast in the Amazon MGM holiday comedy &quot;Oh. What. Fun.&quot; On August 8, 2024, it was announced that she would star in, as well as executive produce, the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; spin-off &quot;The Madison&quot;. On September 23, 2024, it was announced that Pfeiffer would star alongside Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning in the Apple TV+ television series, &quot;Margo&#x27;s Got Money Troubles&quot;, in 2025.

== Acting style and reception ==
Pfeiffer said she sometimes feels fraudulent as an untrained actor due to her lack of conventional schooling. She credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor and their character would behave during the same scene. Essayist Angelica Jade Bastién said Pfeiffer&#x27;s talent disproves any argument that untrained actors are lesser than their trained peers. Several film critics have described her as &quot;a character actress in a screen siren&#x27;s body&quot;, with Bastién profiling her as &quot;a character actress reluctantly placed in Hollywood’s lineage of blonde bombshells&quot;. Journalist James Kaplan reported that some critics feel Pfeiffer has undersold herself by choosing character roles instead of capitalizing on her beauty. In 1993, film critic Ty Burr argued that her &quot;unshowy performances work because they don’t call attention to themselves&quot;, although her attractiveness prevents her from being seriously considered &quot;one of today’s best screen actresses&quot;. Pfeiffer claims she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them compelling. Although she prefers acting in dramas over comedies, she does not have a favorite genre to perform in.

During the 1980s, Pfeiffer typically played smart, funny, and independent women, and pursued a wider range of roles in the 1990s. Early in her career, she mostly played relatable working class women, aside from the occasional upper class character. She has admitted she enjoys playing imperfect, evil, and &quot;slightly trashy&quot; women. In a 2021 profile, journalist Lynn Hirschberg said Pfeiffer excels in emotionally conflicted roles, while Adam Platt of &quot;New Woman&quot; and journalist Bilge Ebiri agreed that she often plays emotionally detached women. &quot;Backstage&quot; contributor Manuel Betancourt observed parallels between Pfeiffer&#x27;s characters and her own determination to subvert expectations, with the actress confirming that she searches new projects for relatability. However, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; senior editor Adam Rathe finds Pfeiffer dissimilar to most of her characters. Known to be highly selective about potential projects, IndieWire contributor Kate Erbland believes Pfeiffer carefully chooses unconventional roles to avoid being typecast. Pfeiffer&#x27;s colleagues have described her as extremely committed, competent, and prepared, although she refuses to watch her own performances.

Pfeiffer has been called one of the greatest actresses of her generation. However, she has also been described as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most underrated, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; saying she &quot;is too seldom ranked among the best of her generation&quot;. In 2009, journalist Brian D. Johnson argued that Pfeiffer had yet to demonstrate her true range, believing she could potentially be as revered as Meryl Streep if afforded the same acting opportunities, while film critic Mick LaSalle remarked that Pfeiffer&#x27;s humility sometimes causes the public to overlook her as one of the industry&#x27;s finest actresses. Pfeiffer is particularly renowned for her versatility, having accrued a filmography that spans period, romance, fantasy, musical, comedy, and drama. By 2016, &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Charles Taylor declared that no actor of the previous decade had rivaled Pfeiffer&#x27;s versatility. Summarizing her career as eclectic, Erbland believes she has rarely repeated acting choices, with the actress confirming she had always aspired to play the widest possible range of characters, even when her options were limited.

Pfeiffer was one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1980s and 1990s, typically earning $9–$10 million per film during the latter decade. Aside from &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, few of her films during the 1980s were major box office successes. In 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Bernard Weinraub said Pfeiffer belongs to a group of respected actresses who are &quot;not considered a big box-office draw&quot;. However, several critics reported that her performances were consistently acclaimed, despite some mediocre films and box office returns. Regardless, Pfeiffer was the sixth highest-grossing domestic box office star of 1990, and one of the few actresses whose salary corresponded with their box office appeal as of 1996, according to UPI. In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked her the 67th greatest movie star of all time. By 1999, &quot;Variety&quot; named Pfeiffer &quot;the female movie star most likely to improve a film&#x27;s box-office appeal&quot;. In 2004, &quot;People&quot; ranked her among The 100 Greatest Movie Stars of Our Time, naming her 20th in the &quot;icons&quot; category.

Pfeiffer was awarded a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007.

==Public image==
Pfeiffer has been described as one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful and talented actresses. After being typecast in early roles based on her appearance, she initially struggled to convince directors to take her seriously as an actor, and thus sought out more challenging opportunities. Journalists Candice Russell of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; and Rachel Syme of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; observed that, early in her career, critics regularly undermined Pfeiffer&#x27;s work by focusing on her appearance instead of her acting.

Pfeiffer was considered one of the leading sex symbols of the 1980s and 1990s, and several publications dubbed her one of the era&#x27;s &quot;It girls&quot;. In 1990, Pfeiffer appeared on the inaugural cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot; issue. She has been featured in the &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; issue a record-breaking six times throughout the decade (from 1990 to 1993, and in 1996 and 1999). In 2004, the magazine named her one of the most beautiful women of all time. In 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; featured her among the &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women in Film&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; listed Pfeiffer as one of the 21 most beautiful American actresses of all time. &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; ranked Pfeiffer 45th and 67th on their all-time hottest women and sex symbol rankings, respectively. Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, at times mocking her trademark features. At least two of her films, &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007) and &quot;Chéri&quot; (2009), explore beautiful, youth-obsessed women struggling to accept aging, themes Pfeiffer personally identified with. According to several plastic surgeons, she possesses some of the most requested celebrity features among clients. In 2001, plastic surgeon Stephen R. Marquardt declared Pfeiffer the most beautiful face in Hollywood. Nicknamed the &quot;golden ratio&quot;, Marquardt claims Pfeiffer&#x27;s face adheres to a mathematical formula in which he determined a person&#x27;s ideal mouth is 1.618 times as wide as their nose. Several outlets have commented on Pfeiffer&#x27;s perceived ability to physically age slowly.

Famously private like the characters she plays, Matthew Jacobs of &quot;HuffPost Canada&quot; crowned Pfeiffer Hollywood&#x27;s foremost &quot;movie star who doesn&#x27;t walk around feeling like a movie star&quot;, which he believes allows her to play authentic characters without letting her fame compromise her talent. Analyzing her public profile for the repertory cinema Metograph, Luke Goodsell said few stars of the 1990s were as elusive as Pfeiffer, writing, &quot;Though a sex symbol, she was never a femme fatale like Sharon Stone; she could play quirky and romantic, but she wasn’t an American sweetheart like Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan; a serious talent, she was rarely considered in the company of Meryl Streep or Jodie Foster&quot;. Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking giving press interviews. Describing herself as &quot;the worst interviewee that ever was&quot;, she believes it is not an actor&#x27;s responsibility to promote a film project. Film critic Michael Sragow observed that the actress can at times appear &quot;flustered or elusive&quot; during interviews. Journalist Timothy Egan once likened profiling Pfeiffer to covering geology, which she outgrew by 1995. Vikram Murthi of &quot;The Nation&quot; believes Pfeiffer&#x27;s aversion to publicity &quot;has lent her an air of gravitas, of someone who directs a spotlight rather than chases after it&quot;.

Media commentators noted that Pfeiffer had unexpectedly become a &quot;pop-music muse&quot; in 2014; her name is mentioned in two of the year&#x27;s most popular songs: &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, and &quot;Riptide&quot; by Vance Joy. Joy was particularly inspired by Pfeiffer&#x27;s transformation from Selina Kyle into Catwoman in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, whereas Ronson cited &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as his favorite Pfeiffer film. In 2021, singer-songwriter Ethel Cain released her debut single &quot;Michelle Pfeiffer&quot;, which the artist named after the actress because &quot;I&#x27;ve always ... thought she was a picture perfect bombshell&quot;. Australian cricketers speak of &quot;getting a Michelle&quot; when they take five wickets in an innings. In cricketing parlance, this is referred to as a &quot;five for&quot;, a near-homophone for &quot;Pfeiffer&quot;, which resulted in the nickname &quot;Michelle&quot;.

==Other ventures==
===Product and endorsements===
In 2005, Pfeiffer served as the face of Giorgio Armani&#x27;s spring campaign; the designer has often dressed her for public appearances.

In 2019, she launched a collection of fine fragrances called Henry Rose. It is the first fine fragrance line to be both Cradle to Cradle Certified and EWG Verified. On December 7, 2022, she promoted the line on The Tonight Show. It was even featured as one of the smells in the game called &quot;Sniff Cup Flip Cup&quot; she played against Jimmy Fallon.

In 2025, Pfeiffer fronted fashion house Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Summer 2025 collection.

===Philanthropy===
Having been a smoker for ten years (she quit in 1992), and having a niece who suffered from leukemia for ten years, Pfeiffer decided to support the American Cancer Society. She also supports the Humane Society. In 2016, she attended the Healthy Child Healthy World&#x27;s L.A. Gala for people who lead organizations for children&#x27;s environmental health. In December that year, Pfeiffer, who was vegan at the time, joined the board of directors for Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group based in Washington. D.C.

==Personal life==
Soon after coming to Hollywood at age 20, Pfeiffer was taken in by a seemingly friendly couple who ran a metaphysics and vegetarian cult. They helped her to cease drinking, smoking and doing drugs. Over time, they took control of her entire life. Much of her money went to the group. &quot;I was brainwashed,&quot; she said, &quot;I gave them an enormous amount of money.&quot;

At an acting class taught by Milton Katselas in Los Angeles, she met fellow budding actor Peter Horton, and they began dating. They married in Santa Monica in 1981, and it was on their honeymoon that she discovered she had won the lead role in &quot;Grease 2&quot;. Horton directed Pfeiffer in a 1985 ABC TV special, &quot;One Too Many&quot;, where she played the high school girlfriend of an alcoholic student (Val Kilmer); and in 1987, the real-life couple played an on-screen couple in the &#x27;Hospital&#x27; segment of John Landis&#x27;s comedy skit compilation &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot;.

In 1988, Pfeiffer had an affair with John Malkovich, her co-star in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, who at the time was married to Glenne Headly.

Pfeiffer and Horton decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later. Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than their marriage. Pfeiffer then had a three-year relationship with actor/producer Fisher Stevens, whom Pfeiffer met when she was starring as Olivia in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, where Stevens played Sir Andrew Aguecheek.

In 1993, Pfeiffer married television writer and producer David E. Kelley. She made a brief uncredited cameo appearance in one episode of Kelley&#x27;s television series &quot;Picket Fences&quot; and played the title character in &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot;, for which Kelley wrote the screenplay. She had entered into private adoption proceedings before she met Kelley, and in March 1993 adopted a newborn daughter, Claudia Rose, who was christened on Pfeiffer&#x27;s and Kelley&#x27;s wedding day. In 1994, Pfeiffer gave birth to a son, John Henry Kelley II, named for his grandfather and Pfeiffer&#x27;s father-in-law, United States Hockey Hall of Fame coach John Henry &quot;Jack&quot; Kelley.

Pfeiffer experimented with a plant-based diet for a few years but later added meat to her diet and advocated a &quot;paleoish&quot; diet.

<text>The Ring is a 2002 American supernatural horror film directed by Gore Verbinski from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger. Starring Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox and David Dorfman, the film follows Rachel Keller, a journalist who discovers a cursed videotape that causes its viewers to die seven days later. It is a remake of Hideo Nakata&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Ring&quot;, based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki.

&quot;The Ring&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on October 18, 2002, by DreamWorks Pictures. It was a box office success, grossing US$249 million internationally, becoming one of the highest-grossing horror remakes of all time. The film received positive reviews, with critics in particular praising the atmosphere and visuals, Bojan Bazelli&#x27;s cinematography, Verbinski&#x27;s direction and the performances of the cast (particularly Watts). At the 29th Saturn Awards, &quot;The Ring&quot; won in two categories: Best Horror Film and Best Actress (for Watts).

The film is the first installment of the American &quot;Ring&quot; series, and is followed by &quot;The Ring Two&quot; (2005) and &quot;Rings&quot; (2017). The success of &quot;The Ring&quot; inspired American remakes of several other Asian and Japanese horror films, including &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004) and &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005).

== Plot ==
Teenage girls Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a cursed videotape that causes whoever views it to die in one week. That night, Katie, who viewed it one week ago with her friends, is killed by an unseen force.

At Katie&#x27;s funeral, her mother asks her sister Rachel, a Seattle-based journalist, to investigate her daughter&#x27;s death. Rachel discovers that Katie&#x27;s friends all died in bizarre accidents at the same time as Katie&#x27;s death. Rachel visits Shelter Mountain Inn, where Katie and her friends saw the tape. She finds and views the tape; it contains strange and frightening imagery. She then receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers, &quot;Seven days&quot;. Though initially skeptical, Rachel quickly begins to experience supernatural occurrences linked to the tape.

Rachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-husband Noah. He views the tape and Rachel makes him a copy. She identifies a woman on the tape: horse breeder Anna Morgan, who committed suicide after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel and Noah&#x27;s 8-year-old son Aidan watches the tape. Aidan also possesses supernatural abilities, which he uses to help with Rachel&#x27;s investigation.

Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna&#x27;s widower Richard, while Noah travels to Gale Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna&#x27;s medical files. Rachel discovers that Anna had adopted a girl, Samara, who possessed the ability to psychically etch images onto objects and into people&#x27;s minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Noah finds a psychiatric file on Samara, which contains a missing video last seen by Richard.

Returning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds a fake birth certificate proving that Samara is not the biological child of Richard and Anna. She also discovers the missing video, where Samara apologizes for her actions but explains that &quot;they won&#x27;t stop&quot;. Richard insists that Samara is evil and commits suicide by electrocuting himself. Noah and Rachel find a loft in the barn, which the Morgans used to isolate Samara from themselves and the outside world. There is an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.

They return to Shelter Mountain Inn, led to a well beneath the floorboards. Rachel falls inside and experiences a vision of Anna dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for one week. Samara&#x27;s body surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued, they arrange a proper burial for Samara.

Back home, Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah&#x27;s week is up; Samara&#x27;s ghost crawls out of his TV screen and kills him. Rachel realizes that Samara’s apology was actually a confession and that she was only spared since she made a copy of the cursed video and passed it to Noah, fulfilling Samara&#x27;s goal of killing endlessly. She makes a copy on Aidan&#x27;s behalf and refuses to answer his question on what would happen to the person that watches it.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development and casting ===
&quot;The Ring&quot; went into production without a completed script. Ehren Kruger wrote three drafts of the screenplay before Scott Frank came on to do an uncredited re-write. Gore Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of &quot;Ring&quot; after Walter F. Parkes sent him a VHS copy of the Japanese film, which he described as &quot;intriguing&quot;, &quot;pulp&quot; and &quot;avant-garde&quot;.
The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for &quot;Ring&quot;) but his name is absent from the final print.

Several high-profile actresses were offered the lead role, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Connelly and Kate Beckinsale. Verbinski admitted to not wanting to cast &quot;big stars&quot; as he wanted his film to be &quot;discovered&quot; and described the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as &quot;inevitable&quot;, although he expressed desire for them to find the remake equally compelling. He also sought to retain the minimalism prevalent throughout &quot;Ring&quot; and set it in Seattle, due to its &quot;wet and isolated&quot; atmosphere.

=== Filming ===

&quot;The Ring&quot; was filmed in 2001, primarily in the State of Washington in numerous locations, including Seattle, Port Townsend, Whidbey Island, Bellingham, Monroe and Stanwood. The Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Newport, Oregon, was also used as a filming location, as well as Oregon&#x27;s Columbia River Gorge.

Chris Cooper played a murderer in two scenes meant to bookend the film, but was ultimately cut.

The film&#x27;s cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is noted for its soft lighting and grey blue-green color. Shot on film, the production is unusual for achieving its color correction in-camera using 81EF and one of two green filters, thereby committing to the film&#x27;s visual style early, rather than relying on digital grading during post-production. The soft lighting was achieved by &quot;diffusing the fill sources enough to match [the natural lighting]&quot; through the use of up to three layers of shades, HMIs and CTB, and set up to create as little shadow as possible to &quot;subconsciously alter the viewer&#x27;s sense of perception and add a heightened sense of ambiguity.&quot;

=== Title ===
As with the original Japanese film &quot;Ring&quot;, the title of &quot;The Ring&quot; can be interpreted as referring to the telephone call which warns those who watched the cursed tape that they will die in seven days, as well as to the view of the ring of light seen from the bottom of the well where Samara was left to die.

==Score==
The film features an original score composed by Hans Zimmer (who would later collaborate on Verbinski&#x27;s other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film&#x27;s original 2002 theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying &quot;The Ring&quot;″s 2005 sequel in an album that combined music from both the first and second film. The soundtrack contains a few themes associated with the characters, moods and locations, including multiple uses of the Dies irae theme. The score makes use of string instruments, pianos and synthesizers.

== Release and reception ==
=== Marketing ===
To advertise &quot;The Ring&quot;, many promotional websites were formed featuring characters and places in the film. The video from the cursed videotape was played in late-night programming over the summer of 2002 without any reference to the film. Physical VHS copies were also randomly distributed outside of movie theaters by placing the tapes on the windshields of people&#x27;s cars.

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Ring&quot; opened theatrically on October 18, 2002 in the United States, on 1,981 screens, and grossed $15,015,393 during its opening weekend. The film went on to become a sleeper hit, leading DreamWorks to expand its release to 700 additional theaters. It ultimately grossed $129,128,133 in the United States. In Japan, the film earned $8.3 million in the first two weeks of its release. Worldwide, &quot;The Ring&quot; grossed a total of $249,348,933.

=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;With little gore and a lot of creepy visuals, &quot;The Ring&quot; gets under your skin, thanks to director Gore Verbinski&#x27;s haunting sense of atmosphere and an impassioned performance from Naomi Watts&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave &quot;The Ring&quot; an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

On &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, Richard Roeper gave the film &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; and said it was very gripping and scary despite some minor unanswered questions. Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;Thumbs Down&quot; and felt it was boring and &quot;borderline ridiculous&quot;; he also disliked the extended, detailed ending. Jeremy Conrad from &quot;IGN&quot; praised &quot;The Ring&quot; for its atmospheric set up and cinematography, and said that &quot;there are disturbing images ... but the film doesn&#x27;t really rely on gore to deliver the scares&quot;. &quot;Film Threat&quot;″s Jim Agnew called it dark, disturbing and original.

Despite the praise given to the direction, some criticized the lack of character development. Jonathan Rosenaum from the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; said that the film was &quot;an utter waste of Watts ... perhaps because the script didn&#x27;t bother to give her a character&quot;, whereas William Arnold from the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; disagreed, claiming that she projects intelligence, determination and resourcefulness in the film. Several critics, like &quot;Miami Herald&quot;″s Rene Rodriguez and &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Claudia Puig, found themselves confused and thought &quot;for all the time [the film] spends explaining, it still doesn&#x27;t make much sense&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
== Legacy ==
The success of &quot;The Ring&quot; paved the way for American remakes of several other Asian and Japanese horror films, including &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004), &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005), &quot;Shutter&quot; and &quot;The Eye&quot; (both 2008).

&quot;The Ring&quot; ranked number 20 on the cable channel Bravo&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Bloody Disgusting ranked it sixth in their list of the &quot;Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade&quot;, with the article saying that &quot;&quot;The Ring&quot; was not only the first American &#x27;J-horror&#x27; remake out of the gate; it also still stands as the best&quot;.

== Sequels ==
A sequel, titled &quot;The Ring Two&quot;, was released on March 18, 2005. A short film, titled &quot;Rings&quot;, was also released in 2005, and is set between &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Ring Two&quot;. A third installment, also titled &quot;Rings&quot;, was released on February 3, 2017.
