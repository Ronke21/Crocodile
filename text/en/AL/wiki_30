<text>The IBM System/370 (S/370) is a range of IBM mainframe computers announced as the successors to the System/360 family on June 30, 1970. The series mostly maintains backward compatibility with the S/360, allowing an easy migration path for customers; this, plus improved performance, were the dominant themes of the product announcement.

Early 370 systems differed from the 360 largely in their internal circuitry, moving from the Solid Logic Technology hybrid integrated circuits containing separate transistors to more modern monolithic integrated circuits containing multiple transistors per integrated circuit, which IBM referred to as Monolithic System Technology, or MST. The higher density packaging allowed several formerly optional features from the 360 line to be included as standard features of the machines, floating-point support for instance. The 370 also added a small number of new instructions.

At the time of its introduction, the development of virtual memory systems had become a major theme in the computer market, and the 370 was considered highly controversial as it lacked this feature. This was addressed in 1972 with the System/370 Advanced Function and its associated dynamic address translation (DAT) hardware. All future machines in the lineup received this option, along with several new operating systems that supported it. Smaller additions were made throughout the lifetime of the line, which led to a profusion of models that were generally referred to by the processor number. One of the last major additions to the line in 1988 were the ESA/370 extensions that allowed a machine to have multiple virtual address spaces and easily switch among them.

The 370 was IBM&#x27;s primary large mainframe offering from the 1970s through the 1980s. In September 1990, the System/370 line was replaced with the System/390. The 390, which was based on a new ESA/390 model, expanded the multiple memory concept to include full hardware virtualization that allowed it to run multiple operating systems at the same time.

==Evolution==
The original System/370 line was announced on June 30, 1970, with first customer shipment of the Models 155 and 165 planned for February 1971 and April 1971 respectively. The 155 first shipped in January 1971. System/370 underwent several architectural improvements during its roughly 20-year lifetime.

===Initial models===
When the first System/370 machines, the Model 155 and the Model 165, were introduced, the System/370 architecture was described as an extension, but not a redesign, of IBM&#x27;s System/360 architecture which was introduced in 1964. The System/370 architecture incorporated only a small number of changes to the System/360 architecture. These changes included:
* 13 new instructions, among which were
:* MOVE LONG (MVCL);
:* COMPARE LOGICAL LONG (CLCL);
::: thereby permitting operations on up to 2^24-1 bytes (16 MB), vs. the 256-byte limits on the 360&#x27;s MVC and CLC;
:* SHIFT AND ROUND DECIMAL (SRP), which multiplied or divided a packed decimal value by a power of 10, rounding the result when dividing;

* optional 128-bit (hexadecimal) floating-point arithmetic, introduced in the System/360 Model 85
* a new higher-resolution time-of-day clock
* support for the block multiplexer channel introduced in the System/360 Model 85.
* All of the emulator features were designed to run under the control of the standard operating systems. IBM documented the S/370 emulator programs as integrated emulators.

These models had core memory and did not include support for virtual storage, as they lacked a DAT (Dynamic Address Translation) box

===Logic technology===
All models of the System/370 used IBM&#x27;s form of monolithic integrated circuits called MST (Monolithic System Technology) making them third generation computers. MST provided System/370 with four to eight times the circuit density and over ten times the reliability when compared to the previous second generation SLT technology of the System/360.

===Monolithic memory===
On September 23, 1970, IBM announced the Model 145, a third model of the System/370, which was the first model to feature semiconductor main memory made from monolithic integrated circuits and was scheduled for delivery in the late summer of 1971. All subsequent S/370 models used such memory.

===Virtual storage===
In 1972, a very significant change was made when support for virtual storage was introduced with IBM&#x27;s &quot;System/370 Advanced Function&quot; announcement. IBM had initially (and controversially) chosen to exclude virtual storage from the S/370 line. The August 2, 1972 announcement included:
* address relocation hardware on all S/370s except the original models 155 and 165
* the new S/370 models 158 and 168, with address relocation hardware
* four new operating systems: DOS/VS (DOS with virtual storage), OS/VS1 (OS/360 MFT with virtual storage), OS/VS2 (OS/360 MVT with virtual storage) Release 1, termed SVS (Single Virtual Storage), and Release 2, termed MVS (Multiple Virtual Storage) and planned to be available 20 months later (at the end of March 1974), and VM/370 – the re-implemented CP/CMS


Virtual storage had in fact been delivered on S/370 hardware before this announcement:
* In June 1971, on the S/370-145 (one of which had to be &quot;smuggled&quot; into Cambridge Scientific Center to prevent anybody noticing the arrival of an S/370 at that hotbed of virtual memory development – since this would have signaled that the S/370 was about to receive address relocation technology). The S/370-145 had an associative memory used by the microcode for the DOS compatibility feature from its first shipments in June 1971; the same hardware was used by the microcode for DAT. Although IBM famously chose to exclude virtual storage from the S/370 announcement, that decision was being reconsidered during the completion of the 145 engineering, partly because of virtual memory experience at CSC and elsewhere. The 145 microcode architecture simplified the addition of virtual storage, allowing this capability to be present in early 145s without the extensive hardware modifications needed in other models. However, IBM did not document the 145&#x27;s virtual storage capability, nor annotate the relevant bits in the control registers and PSW that were displayed on the operator control panel when selected using the roller switches. The Reference and Change bits of the Storage-protection Keys, however, were labeled on the rollers, a dead giveaway to anyone who had worked with the earlier 360/67. Existing S/370-145 customers were happy to learn that they did not have to purchase a hardware upgrade in order to run DOS/VS or OS/VS1 (or OS/VS2 Release 1 – which was possible, but not common because of the limited amount of main storage available on the S/370-145).

Shortly after the August 2, 1972 announcement, DAT box (address relocation hardware) upgrades for the S/370-155 and S/370-165 were quietly announced, but were available only for purchase by customers who already owned a Model 155 or 165. After installation, these models were known as the S/370-155-II and S/370-165-II. IBM wanted customers to upgrade their 155 and 165 systems to the widely sold S/370-158 and -168. These upgrades were surprisingly expensive ($200,000 and $400,000, respectively) and had long ship date lead times after being ordered by a customer; consequently, they were never popular with customers, the majority of whom leased their systems via a third-party leasing company. This led to the original S/370-155 and S/370-165 models being described as &quot;boat anchors&quot;. The upgrade, required to run OS/VS1 or OS/VS2, was not cost effective for most customers by the time IBM could actually deliver and install it, so many customers were stuck with these machines running MVT until their lease ended. It was not unusual for this to be another four, five or even six years for the more unfortunate ones, and turned out to be a significant factor in the slow adoption of OS/VS2 MVS, not only by customers in general, but for many internal IBM sites as well.

===Subsequent enhancements===
Later architectural changes primarily involved expansions in memory (central storage) – both physical memory and virtual address space – to enable larger workloads and meet client demands for more storage. This was the inevitable trend as Moore&#x27;s Law eroded the unit cost of memory. As with all IBM mainframe development, preserving backward compatibility was paramount.

* Operating system specific assist, Extended Control Program Support (ECPS). extended facility and extension features for OS/VS1, MVS and VM. Exploiting levels of these operating systems, e.g., MVS/System Extensions (MVS/SE), reduce path length for some frequent functions.

* The Dual Address Space (DAS) facility allows a privileged program to move data between two address spaces without the overhead of allocating a buffer in common storage, moving the data to the buffer, scheduling an SRB in the target address space, moving the data to their final destination and freeing the buffer. IBM introduced DAS in 1981 for the 3033, but later made it available for some 43xx, 3031 and 3032 processors. MVS/System Product (MVS/SP) Version 1 exploited DAS if it was available.
* In October 1981, the 3033 and 3081 processors added &quot;extended real addressing&quot;, which allowed 26-bit addressing for physical storage (but still imposed a 24-bit limit for any individual address space). This capability appeared later on other systems, such as the 4381 and 3090.
* The System/370 Extended Architecture (S/370-XA), first available in early 1983 on the 3081 and 3083 processors, provided a number of major enhancements, including expansion of virtual address spaces from 24-bits to 31-bits, expansion of real addresses from 24 or 26 bits to 31 bits, and a complete redesign of the I/O architecture.
* In February 1988, IBM announced the Enterprise Systems Architecture/370 (ESA/370) for enhanced (E) 3090 and 4381 models. It added sixteen 32-bit access registers, more addressing modes, and various facilities for working with multiple address spaces simultaneously.
* On September 5, 1990, IBM announced the Enterprise Systems Architecture/390 (ESA/390), upward compatible with ESA/370.

===Dual address space===
In 1981, IBM added the dual-address-space facility to System/370. This allows a program to have two address spaces; Control Register 1 contains the segment table origin (STO) for the primary address space and CR7 contains the STO for the secondary address space. The processor can run in primary-space mode or secondary-space mode. When in primary-space mode, instructions and data are fetched from the primary address space. When in secondary-space mode, operands whose addresses defined to be logical are fetched from the secondary address space; it is unpredictable whether instructions will be fetched from the primary or secondary address space, so code must be mapped into both address spaces in the same address ranges in both address spaces. The program can switch between primary-space and secondary-space mode with the SET ADDRESS SPACE CONTROL instruction; there are also MOVE TO PRIMARY and MOVE TO SECONDARY instructions that copy a range of bytes from an address range in one address space to an address range in the other address space.

Address spaces are identified by an address-space number (ASN). The ASN contains indices into a two-level table, structured similarly to a two-level page table, with entries containing a presence bit, various fields indicating permissions granted for access to the address space, the starting address and length of the segment table for the address space, and other information. The SET SECONDARY ASN instruction makes the address space identified by a given ASN value the current secondary address space.

===Extended real addressing===
The initial System/370 architecture has a 24-bit limit on physical addresses, limiting physical memory to 16 MB. Page table entries have 12 bits of page frame address with 4 KB pages and 13 bits of page frame address with 2 KB pages, so combining a 12-bit page frame address with a 12-bit offset within the page or a 13-bit page frame address with an 11-bit offset within the page produces a 24-bit physical address.

The extended real addressing feature in System/370 raises this limit to 26 bits, increasing the physical memory limit to 64 MB. Two reserved bits in the page table entry for 4 KB pages were used to extend the page frame address. The extended real addressing is only available with address translation enabled and with 4 KB pages.

==Series and models==

===Models sorted by date introduced (table)===
The following table summarizes the major S/370 series and models. The second column lists the principal architecture associated with each series. Many models implemented more than one architecture; thus, 308x processors initially shipped as S/370 architecture, but later offered XA; and many processors, such as the 4381, had microcode that allowed customer selection between S/370 or XA (later, ESA) operation.

Note also the confusing term &quot;System/370-compatible&quot;, which appeared in IBM source documents to describe certain products. Outside IBM, this term would more often describe systems from Amdahl Corporation, Hitachi, and others, that could run the same S/370 software. This choice of terminology by IBM may have been a deliberate attempt to ignore the existence of those plug compatible manufacturers (PCMs), because they competed aggressively against IBM hardware dominance.

===Models grouped by Model number (detailed)===
IBM used the name System/370 to announce the following eleven (three-digit) offerings:

====System/370 Model 115====
The IBM System/370 Model 115 was announced March 13, 1973 as &quot;an ideal System/370 entry system for users of IBM&#x27;s System/3, 1130 computing system and System/360 Models 20, 22 and 25.&quot;

It was delivered with &quot;a minimum of two (of IBM&#x27;s newly announced) directly attached IBM 3340 disk drives.&quot; Up to four 3340s could be attached.

The CPU could be configured with 65,536 (64K) or 98,304 (96K) bytes of main memory. An optional 360/20 emulator was available.

The 115 was withdrawn on March 9, 1981.

====System/370 Model 125====
The IBM System/370 Model 125 was announced Oct 4, 1972.

Two, three or four directly attached IBM 3333 disk storage units provided &quot;up to 400 million bytes online.&quot;

Main memory was either 98,304 (96K) or 131,072 (128K) bytes.

The 125 was withdrawn on March 9, 1981.

====System/370 Model 135====
The IBM System/370 Model 135 was announced Mar 8, 1971. Options for the 370/135 included a choice of four main memory sizes; IBM 1400 series (1401, 1440 and 1460) emulation was also offered.

A &quot;reading device located in the Model 135 console&quot; allowed updates and adding features to the Model 135&#x27;s microcode.

The 135 was withdrawn on October 16, 1979.

====System/370 Model 138====
The IBM System/370 Model 138 which was announced Jun 30, 1976 was offered with either 524,288 (512K) or 1,048,576 (1 MB) of memory. The latter was &quot;double the maximum capacity of the Model 135,&quot; which &quot;can be upgraded to the new computer&#x27;s internal performance levels at customer locations.&quot;

The 138 was withdrawn on November 1, 1983.

====System/370 Model 145====
The IBM System/370 Model 145 was announced Sep 23, 1970, three months after the 155 and 165 models. It first shipped in June 1971.

The first System/370 to use monolithic main memory, the Model 145 was offered in six memory sizes. A portion of the main memory, the &quot;Reloadable Control Storage&quot; (RCS) was loaded from a prewritten disk cartridge containing microcode to implement, for example, all needed instructions, I/O channels, and optional instructions to enable the system to emulate earlier IBM machines.

The 145 was withdrawn on October 16, 1979.

====System/370 Model 148====
The IBM System/370 Model 148 had the same announcement and withdrawal dates as the Model 138.

As with the option to field-upgrade a 135, a 370/145 could be field-upgraded &quot;at customer locations&quot; to 148-level performance. The upgraded 135 and 145 systems were &quot;designated the Models 135-3 and 145-3.&quot;

====System/370 Model 155====
The IBM System/370 Model 155 and the Model 165 were announced Jun 30, 1970, the first of the 370s introduced. Neither had a DAT box; they were limited to running the same non-virtual-memory operating systems available for the System/360. The 155 first shipped in January 1971.

The &quot;OS/DOS&quot; (DOS/360 programs under OS/360), &quot;1401/1440/1460 and 1410/7010&quot; and &quot;7070/7074&quot; compatibility features were included, and the supporting integrated emulator programs could operate concurrently with standard System/370 workloads.

In August 1972 IBM announced, as a field upgrade only, the IBM System/370 Model 155 II, which added a DAT box.

Both the 155 and the 165 were withdrawn on December 23, 1977.

====System/370 Model 158====
The IBM System/370 Model 158 and the 370/168 were announced Aug 2, 1972.

It included dynamic address translation (DAT) hardware, a prerequisite for the new virtual memory operating systems (DOS/VS, OS/VS1, OS/VS2).

A tightly coupled multiprocessor (MP) model was available, as was the ability to loosely couple this system to another 360 or 370 via an optional channel-to-channel adapter.

The 158 and 168 were withdrawn on September 15, 1980.

====System/370 Model 165====
The IBM System/370 Model 165 was described by IBM as &quot;more powerful&quot; compared to the &quot;medium-scale&quot; 370/155. It first shipped in April 1971.

Compatibility features included emulation for 7070/7074, 7080, and 709/7090/7094/7094 II.

Some have described the 360/85&#x27;s use of microcoded vs hardwired as a bridge to the 370/165.

In August 1972 IBM announced, as a field upgrade only, the IBM System/370 Model 165 II which added a DAT box.

The 165 was withdrawn on December 23, 1977.

====System/370 Model 168====
The IBM System/370 Model 168 included &quot;up to eight megabytes&quot; of main memory, double the maximum of 4 megabytes on the 
370/158.

It included dynamic address translation (DAT) hardware, a pre-requisite for the new virtual memory operating systems.

Although the 168 served as IBM&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot; system, a 1975 newsbrief said that IBM boosted the power of the 370/168 again &quot;in the wake of the Amdahl challenge... only 10 months after it introduced the improved 168-3 processor.&quot;

The 370/168 was not withdrawn until September 1980.

====System/370 Model 195====

The IBM System/370 Model 195 was announced Jun 30, 1970 and, at that time, it was &quot;IBM&#x27;s most powerful computing system.&quot;

Its introduction came about 14 months after the announcement of its direct predecessor, the 360/195. Both 195 machines were withdrawn Feb. 9, 1977.

====System/370-compatible====
Beginning in 1977, IBM began to introduce new systems, using the description &quot;A compatible member of the System/370 family.&quot;

=====IBM 303X=====
The first of the initial high end machines, IBM&#x27;s 3033, was announced March 25, 1977 and was delivered the following March, at which time a multiprocessor version of the 3033 was announced. IBM described it as &quot;The Big One.&quot;

IBM noted about the 3033, looking back, that &quot;When it was rolled out on March 25, 1977, the 3033 eclipsed the internal operating speed of the company&#x27;s previous flagship the System/370 Model 168-3 ...&quot;

The IBM 3031 and IBM 3032 were announced Oct. 7, 1977 and withdrawn Feb. 8, 1985.

=====IBM 308X=====
Three systems comprised the next series of high end machines, IBM&#x27;s 308X systems:
* The 3081 (announced Nov 12, 1980) had 2 CPUs
* The 3083 (announced Mar 31, 1982) had 1 CPU
* The 3084 (announced Sep 3, 1982) had 4 CPUs

Despite the numbering, the least powerful was the 3083, which could be field-upgraded to a 3081; the 3084 was the top of the line.

These models introduced IBM&#x27;s Extended Architecture&#x27;s 31-bit address capability and a set of backward compatible MVS/Extended Architecture (MVS/XA) software replacing previous products and part of OS/VS2 R3.8:
All three 308x systems were withdrawn on August 4, 1987.

=====IBM 3090=====
The next series of high-end machines, the IBM 3090, began with models 200 and 400. They were announced Feb. 12, 1985, and were configured with two or four CPUs respectively. IBM subsequently announced models 120, 150, 180, 300, 500 and 600 with lower, intermediate and higher capacities; the first digit of the model number gives the number of central processors.

Starting with the E models, and continuing with the J and S models, IBM offered Enterprise Systems Architecture/370 (ESA/370), Processor Resource/System Manager (PR/SM) and a set of backward compatible MVS/Enterprise System Architecture (MVS/ESA) software replacing previous products:

IBM&#x27;s offering of an optional vector facility (VF) extension for the 3090 came at a time when Vector processing/Array processing suggested names like Cray and Control Data Corporation (CDC).

The 200 and 400 were withdrawn on May 5, 1989.

=====IBM 4300=====
The first pair of IBM 4300 processors were Mid/Low end systems announced Jan 30, 1979 as &quot;compact (and).. compatible with System/370.&quot;

The 4331 was subsequently withdrawn on November 18, 1981, and the 4341 on February 11, 1986.

Other models were the 4321, 4361 and 4381.

The 4361 has &quot;Programmable Power-Off -- enables the user to turn off the processor under program control&quot;; &quot;Unit power off&quot; is (also) part of the 4381 feature list.

IBM offered many Model Groups and models of the 4300 family, ranging from the entry level 4331 to the 4381, described as &quot;one of the most powerful and versatile intermediate system processors ever produced by IBM.&quot;

The 4381 Model Group 3 was dual-CPU.

=====IBM 9370=====
This low-end system, announced October 7, 1986, was &quot;designed to satisfy the computing requirements of IBM customers who value System/370 affinity&quot; and &quot;small enough and quiet enough to operate in an office environment.&quot;

IBM also noted its sensitivity to &quot;entry software prices, substantial reductions in support and training requirements, and modest power consumption and maintenance costs.&quot;

Furthermore, it stated its awareness of the needs of small-to-medium size businesses to be able to respond, as &quot;computing requirements grow,&quot; adding that &quot;the IBM 9370 system can be easily expanded by adding additional features and racks to accommodate...&quot;

This came at a time when Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and its VAX systems were strong competitors in both hardware and software; the media of the day carried IBM&#x27;s alleged &quot;VAX Killer&quot; phrase, albeit often skeptically.

===Clones===
In the 360 era, a number of manufacturers had already standardized upon the IBM/360 instruction set and, to a degree, 360 architecture. Notable computer makers included Univac with the UNIVAC 9000 series, RCA with the RCA Spectra 70 series, English Electric with the English Electric System 4, and the Soviet ES EVM. These computers were not perfectly compatible, nor (except for the Russian efforts) were they intended to be.

That changed in the 1970s with the introduction of the IBM/370 and Gene Amdahl&#x27;s launch of his own company. About the same time, Japanese giants began eyeing the lucrative mainframe market both at home and abroad. One Japanese consortium focused upon IBM and two others from the BUNCH (Burroughs/Univac/NCR/Control Data/Honeywell) group of IBM&#x27;s competitors. The latter efforts were abandoned and eventually all Japanese efforts focused on the IBM mainframe lines.

Some of the era&#x27;s clones included:
==Architecture details==

IBM documentation numbers the bits from high order to low order; the most significant (leftmost) bit is designated as bit number 0.
S/370 also refers to a computer system architecture specification, and is a direct and mostly backward compatible evolution of the System/360 architecture from which it retains most aspects. This specification does not make any assumptions on the implementation itself, but rather describes the interfaces and the expected behavior of an implementation. The architecture describes mandatory interfaces that must be available on all implementations and optional interfaces which may or may not be implemented.

Some of the aspects of this architecture are:
* Big endian byte ordering
* One or more processors with:
** 16 32-bit General purpose registers
** 16 32-bit Control registers
** 4 64-bit Floating-point registers
** A 64-bit Program status word (PSW) which describes (among other things)
*** Interrupt masks
*** Privilege states
*** A condition code
*** A 24-bit instruction address
** Timing facilities (Time of day clock, interval timer, CPU timer and clock comparator)
** An interruption mechanism, maskable and unmaskable interruption classes and subclasses
** An instruction set. Each instruction is wholly described and also defines the conditions under which an exception is recognized in the form of program interruption.
* A memory (called storage) subsystem with:
** 8 bits per byte
** A special processor communication area starting at address 0
** Key controlled protection
** 24-bit addressing
* Manual control operations that provide:
** A bootstrap process (a process called Initial Program Load or IPL)
** Operator-initiated interrupts
** Resetting the system
** Basic debugging facilities
** Manual display and modifications of the system&#x27;s state (memory and processor)
* An Input/Output mechanismwhich does not describe the devices themselves

Some of the optional features are:
* A Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) mechanism that can be used to implement a virtual memory system
* Floating point instructions

IBM took great care to ensure that changes to the architecture would remain compatible for unprivileged (problem state) programs; some new interfaces did not break the initial interface contract for privileged (supervisor mode) programs. Some examples are
; ECPS:MVS
:A feature to enhance performance for the MVS/370 operating systems
;ECPS:VM
:A feature to enhance performance for the VM operating systems

Other changes were compatible only for unprivileged programs, although the changes for privileged programs were of limited scope and well defined. Some examples are:
;ECPS:VSE
:A feature to enhance performance for the DOS/VSE operating system.
;S/370-XA
:A feature to provide a new I/O interface and to support 31-bit virtual and physical addressing

Great care was taken in order to ensure that further modifications to the architecture would remain compatible, at least as far as non-privileged programs were concerned. This philosophy predates the definition of the S/370 architecture and started with the S/360 architecture. If certain rules are adhered to, a program written for this architecture will run with the intended results on the successors of this architecture.

Such an example is that the S/370 architecture specifies that the 64-bit PSW register bit number 32 has to be set to 0 and that doing otherwise leads to an exception. Subsequently, when the S/370-XA architecture was defined, it was stated that this bit would indicate whether the program was a program expecting a 24-bit address architecture or 31-bit address architecture. Thus, most programs that ran on the 24-bit architecture can still run on 31-bit systems; the 64-bit z/Architecture has an additional mode bit for 64-bit addresses, so that those programs, and programs that ran on the 31-bit architecture, can still run on 64-bit systems.

However, not all of the interfaces can remain compatible. Emphasis was put on having non control programs (called problem state programs) remain compatible. Thus, operating systems have to be ported to the new architecture because the control interfaces can (and were) redefined in an incompatible way. For example, the I/O interface was redesigned in S/370-XA making S/370 program issuing I/O operations unusable as-is.

==S/370 replacement==
IBM replaced the System/370 line with the System/390 in the 1990s, and similarly extended the architecture from ESA/370 to ESA/390. This was a minor architectural change, and was upwards compatible.

In 2000, the System/390 was replaced with the zSeries (now called IBM Z). The zSeries mainframes introduced the 64-bit z/Architecture, the most significant design improvement since the 31-bit transition. All have retained essential backward compatibility with the original S/360 architecture and instruction set.

==GCC and Linux on the S/370==
The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) had a back end for S/370, but it became obsolete over time and was finally replaced with the S/390 backend. Although the S/370 and S/390 instruction sets are essentially the same (and have been consistent since the introduction of the S/360), GCC operability on older systems has been abandoned. GCC currently works on machines that have the full instruction set of System/390 Generation 5 (G5), the hardware platform for the initial release of Linux/390. However, a separately maintained version of GCC 3.2.3 that works for the S/370 is available, known as GCCMVS.

==I/O evolutions==

===I/O evolution from original S/360 to S/370===
The block multiplexer channel, previously available only on the 360/85 and 360/195, was a standard part of the architecture. For compatibility it could operate as a selector channel. Block multiplexer channels were available in single byte (1.5 MB/s) and double byte (3.0 MB/s) versions.

===I/O evolution since original S/370===

As part of the DAT announcement, IBM upgraded channels to have Indirect Data Address Lists (IDALs). a form of I/O MMU.

Data streaming channels had a speed of 3.0 MB/s over a single byte interface, later upgraded to 4.5 MB/s.

Channel set switching allowed one processor in a multiprocessor configuration to take over the I/O workload from the other processor if it failed or was taken offline for maintenance. 
System/370-XA introduced a channel subsystem that performed I/O queuing previously done by the operating system.

The System/390 introduced the ESCON channel, an optical fiber, half-duplex, serial channel with a maximum distance of 43 kilometers. Originally operating at 10 Mbyte/s, it was subsequently increased to 17 Mbyte/s.

Subsequently, FICON became the standard IBM mainframe channel; FIbre CONnection (FICON) is the IBM proprietary name for the ANSI FC-SB-3 Single-Byte Command Code Sets-3 Mapping Protocol for Fibre Channel (FC) protocol used to map both IBM&#x27;s antecedent (either ESCON or parallel Bus and Tag) channel-to-control-unit cabling infrastructure and protocol onto standard FC services and infrastructure at data rates up to 16 Gigabits/sec at distances up to 100 km. Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) allows attaching SCSI devices using the same infrastructure as FICON.

<doc id="59786" wikidata="Q1641639" url="?curid=59786" title="Friday (novel)">
<text>Friday is a 1982 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It is the story of a female &quot;artificial person&quot;, the eponymous Friday, genetically engineered to be stronger, faster, smarter, and generally better than normal humans. Artificial humans are widely resented, and much of the story deals with Friday&#x27;s struggle both against prejudice and to conceal her enhanced attributes from other humans. The story is set in a Balkanized 21st century, in which the nations of the North American continent have been split up into a number of smaller states.

&quot;Friday&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983.

==Plot summary==
The book&#x27;s narrator is Friday Jones (often going under cover name Marjorie Baldwin and using both surnames somewhat interchangeably). Friday is a genetically engineered human (known as an Artificial Person or AP) in many ways mentally and physically superior to ordinary humans. There is great prejudice against APs so Friday conceals her nature.

Friday is employed as a highly self-sufficient &quot;combat courier in a quasi-military organization&quot;, traveling across the globe and to some of the near-Earth space colonies. She is returning from her latest mission when she is captured, tortured, raped and interrogated by an enemy group. She is rescued by her own people, who tell her that her highly critical mission was successful as her captors failed to find the data she was carrying in her body.

After recovering from the ordeal, Friday takes a vacation to New Zealand to visit her group family, composed of several husbands and wives and many children. In an argument over racism, Friday reveals to her family that she is an AP, and they promptly divorce her.

On the way back to her company&#x27;s headquarters, she meets and befriends a married couple, the Tormeys, and their extra-legal co-husband, Georges. Friday is their house-guest in British Canada (a country in the Balkanized North America) when a worldwide emergency known as Red Thursday occurs. Various groups claim credit for the assassinations and sabotage, but Friday later learns that it is the result of a struggle between rival factions within the ultra-powerful Shipstone corporation.

With British Canada under martial law, Friday kills a policeman who tries to arrest her and Georges as non-citizens to be interned. The two become fugitives, and Friday travels through the California Confederacy, the Lone Star Republic (where she parts from Georges), and the Chicago Imperium as she attempts to reach her headquarters. After several adventures, she abandons her attempt to make contact with her employer and then finds that the Tormeys are not at their home. An agent of her employer tracks her down and takes her to her employer&#x27;s safe house. However, Friday&#x27;s boss soon dies and the organization disbands, rendering her temporarily homeless and unemployed. Her boss has left her money in trust to be used only for the purpose of relocating to an off-Earth colony of her choosing.

Living in Las Vegas Free State, Friday is eventually recruited for a courier job which will incidentally allow her to visit and evaluate several of the colonies she is considering as future homes. However, on an interplanetary cruise ship for her mission, she learns that agents of her new employers are watching her, and that she is a virtual prisoner on the ship. Realizing that her mission is top secret and her employers misled her about it, she fears that they will kill her when it is over. While the ship is in orbit at a rustic colony world, she escapes with the Tormeys, who have been on the run since the policeman&#x27;s death and happened to be fleeing Earth on the same ship. She is helped and joined in her escape by two of the agents watching her, one of whom was in the group that raped her at the beginning of the story but is now repentant. After evading the ship&#x27;s crew and the remaining agents, Friday and her friends settle in the colony to lead a quiet life as a group family.

==Allusions and references to other works==
&quot;Friday&quot; is loosely tied to Heinlein&#x27;s 1949 novella &quot;Gulf&quot;, since the works share characters—&quot;Kettle Belly&quot; Baldwin is Friday&#x27;s boss, and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Greene are mentioned as two of Friday&#x27;s genetic progenitors. The motif of a secret superman society in &quot;Gulf&quot;, however, is not mentioned in &quot;Friday&quot;, where the heroine is an artificial person and is not part of a secret society; the principal reason to be secret about her artificial nature is to avoid discrimination. However, Baldwin&#x27;s bequest to finance her emigration to any planet excludes Olympia, where the &quot;supermen&quot; went at some time between the two stories.

The Shipstone, the extrasolar colonies Fiddler&#x27;s Green, Proxima and Botany Bay, and the start of the balkanization of North America are again mentioned in the 1985 &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;. It is stated that Roger and Edith Stone from &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; are now living in Fiddler&#x27;s Green. The colony name &quot;Botany Bay&quot; appears in Heinlein&#x27;s juvenile &quot;Time for the Stars&quot;. (There is a planet called &quot;Halcyon&quot; in &quot;Starman Jones&quot;, but it is in a different star system from the one in &quot;Friday&quot;.)

==Literary significance and reception==
The 1982 &quot;Library Journal&quot; review said that Heinlein &quot;returns to an earlier style of brisk adventure mixed with polemic in the saga of special courier Friday Jones.&quot;

Dave Pringle reviewed &quot;Friday&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;I was prepared to like this novel—advance notices and reviews have all trumpeted the fact that it is Heinlein&#x27;s best in many years—and indeed it moves well, but I found it left a curiously bad taste in my mouth.&quot;

John Clute in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; says of it (and the following &quot;&quot;): 
“Two late novels […] were hailed with some relief by Heinlein admirers despite not equalling the drive and clarity of his best work.”

Charles Stross has stated that his 2008 novel &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; is an homage to &quot;Friday&quot;.

Jo Walton wrote of &quot;Friday&quot; in 2009 as &quot;The worst book I love&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a book about passing, about what makes you human. ... What&#x27;s good about it now? The whole &#x27;passing&#x27; bit. The cloning, the attitudes to cloning, the worry about jobs. The economy. It has an interesting future world [...] and as always with Heinlein it&#x27;s immersive. [...] And it&#x27;s a fun read, even if it&#x27;s ultimately unsatisfying. What&#x27;s wrong with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a plot. [...] Heinlein&#x27;s ability to write a sentence that makes you want to read the next sentence remains unparalleled. But the book as a whole is almost like &quot;Dhalgren&quot;. Every sentence and every paragraph and page and chapter lead on to the next, but it&#x27;s just one thing after another, there&#x27;s no real connection going on. It has no plot, it&#x27;s a set of incidents that look as if they&#x27;re going somewhere and don&#x27;t ever resolve, just stop. [...] It sets things up that it never invokes, most notably Olympia and the connections back to the novella &#x27;Gulf.&#x27;&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Friday&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #39, and stated that &quot;&quot;Friday&quot; has a good future background, where all-powerful &#x27;corporate states&#x27; on the lines of IBM think nothing of nuking pockets of undue sales resistance; lots to annoy even the least committed feminist (being raped is fine, thinks heroine Friday—if only the guy doesn&#x27;t have bad breath); and a plotline with all the forceful thrust of overcooked spaghetti.&quot;

<text>A loanword (also a loan word, loan-word) is a word at least partly assimilated from one language (the donor language) into another language (the recipient or target language), through the process of borrowing. Borrowing is a metaphorical term that is well established in the linguistic field despite its acknowledged descriptive flaws: nothing is taken away from the donor language and there is no expectation of returning anything (i.e., the loanword).

Loanwords may be contrasted with calques, in which a word is borrowed into the recipient language by being directly translated from the donor language rather than being adopted in (an approximation of) its original form. They must also be distinguished from cognates, which are words in two or more related languages that are similar because they share an etymological origin in the ancestral language, rather than because one borrowed the word from the other.

== Examples and related terms ==
A loanword is distinguished from a calque (or loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose meaning or idiom is adopted from another language by word-for-word translation into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language. Loanwords, in contrast, are translated.

Examples of loanwords in the English language include &quot;café&quot; (from French , which means &quot;coffee&quot;), bazaar (from Persian , which means &quot;market&quot;), and kindergarten (from German , which literally means &quot;children&#x27;s garden&quot;). The word &quot;calque&quot; is a loanword, while the word &quot;loanword&quot; is a calque: &quot;calque&quot; comes from the French noun (&quot;tracing; imitation; close copy&quot;); while the word &quot;loanword&quot; and the phrase &quot;loan translation&quot; are translated from German nouns and ().

Loans of multi-word phrases, such as the English use of the French term &quot;déjà vu&quot;, are known as adoptions, adaptations, or lexical borrowings.

Although colloquial and informal register loanwords are typically spread by word-of-mouth, technical or academic loanwords tend to be first used in written language, often for scholarly, scientific, or literary purposes.

The terms substrate and superstrate are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).

A Wanderwort is a word that has been borrowed across a wide range of languages remote from its original source; an example is the word &quot;tea&quot;, which originated in Hokkien but has been borrowed into languages all over the world. For a sufficiently old Wanderwort, it may become difficult or impossible to determine in what language it actually originated.

Most of the technical vocabulary of classical music (such as concerto, allegro, tempo, aria, opera, and soprano) is borrowed from Italian, and that of ballet from French. Much of the terminology of the sport of fencing also comes from French. Many loanwords come from prepared food, drink, fruits, vegetables, seafood and more from languages around the world. In particular, many come from French cuisine (crêpe, Chantilly, crème brûlée), Italian (pasta, linguine, pizza, espresso), and Chinese (dim sum, chow mein, wonton).

==Linguistic classification==

Loanwords are adapted from one language to another in a variety of ways.
The studies by Werner Betz (1971, 1901), Einar Haugen (1958, also 1956), and Uriel Weinreich (1963) are regarded as the classical theoretical works on loan influence. The basic theoretical statements all take Betz&#x27;s nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz&#x27;s scheme by the type &quot;partial substitution&quot; and supplements the system with English terms. A schematic illustration of these classifications is given below.

The phrase &quot;foreign word&quot; used in the image below is a mistranslation of the German &quot;Fremdwort&quot;, which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation, spelling, inflection or gender have not been adapted to the new language such that they no longer seem foreign. Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. Basing such a separation mainly on spelling is (or, in fact, was) not common except amongst German linguists, and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been widely used for a long time.

According to the linguist Suzanne Kemmer, the expression &quot;foreign word&quot; can be defined as follows in English: &quot;[W]hen most speakers do not know the word and if they hear it think it is from another language, the word can be called a foreign word. There are many foreign words and phrases used in English such as bon vivant (French), mutatis mutandis (Latin), and Schadenfreude (German).&quot; This is not how the term is used in this illustration:

On the basis of an importation-substitution distinction, Haugen (1950: 214f.) distinguishes three basic groups of borrowings: &quot;(1) &quot;Loanwords&quot; show morphemic importation without substitution... (2) &quot;Loanblends&quot; show morphemic substitution as well as importation... (3) &quot;Loanshifts&quot; show morphemic substitution without importation&quot;. Haugen later refined (1956) his model in a review of Gneuss&#x27;s (1955) book on Old English loan coinages, whose classification, in turn, is the one by Betz (1949) again.

Weinreich (1953: 47ff.) differentiates between two mechanisms of lexical interference, namely those initiated by simple words and those initiated by compound words and phrases. Weinreich (1953: 47) defines &quot;simple words&quot; &quot;from the point of view of the bilinguals who perform the transfer, rather than that of the descriptive linguist. Accordingly, the category &#x27;simple&#x27; words also includes compounds that are transferred in unanalysed form&quot;. After this general classification, Weinreich then resorts to Betz&#x27;s (1949) terminology.

== In English ==
The English language has borrowed many words from other cultures or languages. For examples, see Lists of English words by country or language of origin and Anglicisation.

Some English loanwords remain relatively faithful to the original phonology even though a particular phoneme might not exist or have contrastive status in English. For example, the Hawaiian word &quot;aā&quot; is used by geologists to specify lava that is thick, chunky, and rough. The Hawaiian spelling indicates the two glottal stops in the word, but the English pronunciation, , contains at most one. The English spelling usually removes the ʻokina and macron diacritics.

Most English affixes, such as &quot;un-&quot;, &quot;-ing&quot;, and &quot;-ly&quot;, were used in Old English. However, a few English affixes are borrowed. For example, the verbal suffix &quot;-ize&quot; (American English) or &quot;ise&quot; (British English) comes from Greek -ιζειν (&quot;-izein&quot;) through Latin &quot;-izare&quot;.

Pronunciation often differs from the original language, occasionally dramatically, especially when dealing with place names. This often leads to divergence when many speakers anglicize pronunciations as other speakers try to maintain the way the name would sound in the original language, as in the pronunciation of Louisville.

==Languages other than English==
===Transmission in the Ottoman Empire===

During more than 600 years of the Ottoman Empire, the literary and administrative language of the empire was Turkish, with many Persian and Arabic loanwords, called Ottoman Turkish, considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many such words were adopted by other languages of the empire, such as Albanian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Hungarian, Ladino, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian. After the empire fell after World War I and the Republic of Turkey was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive language reform led by the newly founded Turkish Language Association, during which many adopted words were replaced with new formations derived from Turkic roots. That was part of the ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, which also included the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet.

Turkish also has taken many words from French, such as &quot;pantolon&quot; for &quot;trousers&quot; (from French &quot;pantalon&quot;) and &quot;komik&quot; for &quot;funny&quot; (from French &quot;comique&quot;), most of them pronounced very similarly.

Word usage in modern Turkey has acquired a political tinge: right-wing publications tend to use more Arabic-originated words, left-wing publications use more words adopted from Indo-European languages such as Persian and French, while centrist publications use more native Turkish root words.

===Dutch words in Indonesian===
Almost 350 years of Dutch presence in what is now Indonesia have left significant linguistic traces. Though very few Indonesians have a fluent knowledge of Dutch, the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life (e.g., &quot;&quot; from Dutch &quot;&quot; for (green) beans) and as well in administrative, scientific or technological terminology (e.g., &quot;&quot; from Dutch &quot;&quot; for office). The Professor of Indonesian Literature at Leiden University, and of Comparative Literature at UCR, argues that roughly 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words.

===Dutch words in Russian===
In the late 17th century, the Dutch Republic had a leading position in shipbuilding. Czar Peter the Great, eager to improve his navy, studied shipbuilding in Zaandam and Amsterdam. Many Dutch naval terms have been incorporated in the Russian vocabulary, such as (&quot;brámselʹ&quot;) from Dutch for the topgallant sail, (&quot;domkrát&quot;) from Dutch &quot;&quot; for jack, and (&quot;matrós&quot;) from Dutch &quot;&quot; for sailor.

===Romance languages===
A large percentage of the lexicon of Romance languages, themselves descended from Vulgar Latin, consists of loanwords (later ) from Latin. These words can be distinguished by lack of typical sound changes and other transformations found in descended words, or by meanings taken directly from Classical or Ecclesiastical Latin that did not evolve or change over time as expected; in addition, there are also semi-learned terms which were adapted partially to the Romance language&#x27;s character. Latin borrowings can be known by several names in Romance languages: in French, for example, they are usually referred to as , in Spanish as , and in Italian as .

Latin is usually the most common source of loanwords in these languages, such as in Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, etc., and in some cases the total number of loans may even outnumber inherited terms (although the learned borrowings are less often used in common speech, with the most common vocabulary being of inherited, orally transmitted origin from Vulgar Latin). This has led to many cases of etymological doublets in these languages.

For most Romance languages, these loans were initiated by scholars, clergy, or other learned people and occurred in medieval times, peaking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era- in Italian, the 14th century had the highest number of loans. In the case of Romanian, the language underwent a &quot;re-Latinization&quot; process later than the others (see Romanian lexis, ), in the 18th and 19th centuries, partially using French and Italian words (many of these themselves being earlier borrowings from Latin) as intermediaries, in an effort to modernize the language, often adding concepts that did not exist until then, or replacing words of other origins. These common borrowings and features also essentially serve to raise mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, particularly in academic/scholarly, literary, technical, and scientific domains. Many of these same words are also found in English (through its numerous borrowings from Latin and French) and other European languages.

In addition to Latin loanwords, many words of Ancient Greek origin were also borrowed into Romance languages, often in part through scholarly Latin intermediates, and these also often pertained to academic, scientific, literary, and technical topics. Furthermore, to a lesser extent, Romance languages borrowed from a variety of other languages; in particular English has become an important source in more recent times. The study of the origin of these words and their function and context within the language can illuminate some important aspects and characteristics of the language, and it can reveal insights on the phenomenon of lexical borrowing in linguistics as a method of enriching a language.

==Cultural aspects==
According to Hans Henrich Hock and Brian Joseph, &quot;languages and dialects ... do not exist in a vacuum&quot;: there is always linguistic contact between groups. The contact influences what loanwords are integrated into the lexicon and which certain words are chosen over others.

==Leaps in meaning==
In some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps, creating false friends. The English word &quot;Viking&quot; became Japanese (), meaning &quot;buffet&quot;, because the first restaurant in Japan to offer buffet-style meals, inspired by the Nordic smörgåsbord, was opened in 1958 by the Imperial Hotel under the name &quot;Viking&quot;. The German word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;tile&quot;, became the Dutch word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;stove&quot;, as a shortening of &quot;&quot;, from German &quot;&quot;, a cocklestove. The Indonesian word primarily means &quot;spandex clothing&quot;, &quot;inner bolero&quot;, or &quot;detachable sleeve&quot;, while its French etymon means &quot;cuff&quot;.

<text>Crystal gazing or crystallomancy is a method for seeing visions achieved through trance induction by means of gazing at a crystal. Traditionally, it has been seen as a form of divination or scrying, with visions of the future and of the divine, though research into the content of crystal-visions suggest the visions are related to the expectations and thoughts of the seer.

==Methods and materials==
The term crystal gazing denotes several different forms of a variety of objects, and there are several schools of thought as to the sources of the visions seen in the crystal gazing trance. Crystal gazing may be used by practitioners—sometimes called &quot;readers&quot; or &quot;seers&quot;—for a variety of purposes, including to predict distant or future events, to give character analyses, to tell fortunes, or to help a client make choices about current situations and problems.

With respect to the tool or object used to induce the crystal-gazer&#x27;s trance, this can be achieved with any shiny object, including a crystalline gemstone or a convex mirror—but in common practice, a crystal ball is most often used. The size of ball preferred varies greatly among those who practice crystallomancy. Some gazers use a &quot;palm ball&quot; of a few inches in diameter that is held in the hand; others prefer a larger ball mounted on a stand. The stereotypical image of a Romani woman wearing a headscarf and telling fortunes for her clients by means of a very large crystal ball is widely depicted in the media and can be found in hundreds of popular books, advertising pages, and films of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. The pervasiveness of this image may have led to the increased use of fairly large crystal balls by those who can afford them.

Books of instruction in the art of crystal gazing often suggest that the ball used should be perfectly spherical (that is, without a flat bottom) and should be supported in a wooden or metal stand. If made of glass (e.g. lead crystal), it should be free from air bubbles but may be colored. If carved from natural crystalline stone (such as quartz, beryl, calcite, obsidian, or amethyst), it may display the natural coloring and structure of the mineral from which it was fashioned. Some authors advise students to place a sigil, seal, or talismanic emblem beneath a clear sphere, but most do not. Most authors suggest that the work of crystal gazing should be undertaken in a dimly-lit and quiet room, so as to foster visions and more easily allow the onset of a trance state.

Some practitioners claim that crystal gazing engenders visionary experiences and preternatural and/or supernatural insight, while other practitioners and researchers assert that the visions arise from the subconscious mind of the crystal gazer. Some authors note that the two positions are not mutually incompatible, and that the possibility of showing the gazer&#x27;s subconscious mind does not preclude the possibility of seeing the future or other supernatural insight.

== Research ==

Crystal gazing has been an active topic of research. Organisations like the Society for Psychical Research has published research on the topic. While there is no doubt that many people see visions in crystal balls, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that visions have any clairvoyant content. The psychologists Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones in their book &quot;Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking&quot; (1989) have written:

The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote that crystal gazing allows a form of self-hypnosis with fantasies and memories from the unconscious of the subject appearing as visions in the crystal. Analysis of the content suggest they are a kind of hallucination that visualizes things in memory or of expectations, for example, a subject who was told to expect to see soldiers, saw exactly this when gazing in a crystal ball. The subject had previously experienced hallucinations when looking at reflective surfaces, something which tends to be true of most people who experience visions when gazing at crystals.

Researcher Edmund Parish believed that crystal-visions were experienced in a state of full consciousness while others think it requires a trance-like state.

==The C.G. act ==
Some stage magicians use a crystal ball as a prop and crystallomancy as a line of patter in the performance of mentalism effects. This type of presentation is sometimes referred to as a &quot;C.G. act&quot;—&quot;C.G.&quot; standing for &quot;crystal gazing&quot;. Perhaps the most famous expositor of the C.G. act during the 20th century was Alexander The Crystal Seer, billed as &quot;The Man Who Knows&quot;. Another stage magician and mentalist who was also a crystal gazer was Julius Zancig, but he did not perform a C.G. act in public—rather, he used the crystal ball in his work as a spiritual counsellor for private clients.

<text>Derek Antony Parfit (; 11 December 1942 – 2 January 2017) was a British philosopher who specialised in personal identity, rationality, and ethics. He is widely considered one of the most important and influential moral philosophers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Parfit rose to prominence in 1971 with the publication of his first paper, &quot;Personal Identity&quot;. His first book, &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; (1984), has been described as the most significant work of moral philosophy since the 1800s. His second book, &quot;On What Matters&quot; (2011), was widely circulated and discussed for many years before its publication.

For his entire academic career, Parfit worked at Oxford University, where he was an Emeritus Senior Research Fellow at All Souls College at the time of his death. He was also a visiting professor of philosophy at Harvard University, New York University, and Rutgers University. He was awarded the 2014 Rolf Schock Prize &quot;for his groundbreaking contributions concerning personal identity, regard for future generations, and analysis of the structure of moral theories.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Parfit was born in 1942 in Chengdu, China, the son of Jessie (née Browne) and Norman Parfit, medical doctors who had moved to Western China to teach preventive medicine in missionary hospitals. The family returned to the United Kingdom about a year after Parfit was born, settling in Oxford. Parfit was educated at the Dragon School and Eton College, where he was nearly always at the top of the regular rankings in every subject except maths. From an early age, he endeavoured to become a poet, but he gave up poetry towards the end of his adolescence.

He then studied modern history at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1964. In 1965–66, he was a Harkness Fellow at Columbia University and Harvard University. He abandoned historical studies for philosophy during the fellowship.

==Career==
Parfit returned to Oxford to become a fellow of All Souls College. He held this position until age 67, at which point the university&#x27;s policy mandates retirement. He remained a regular visiting professor at Harvard, New York University, and Rutgers.

==Ethics and rationality==
=== &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; ===
In &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;, Parfit suggested that nonreligious ethics is a young and fertile field of inquiry. He asked questions about which actions are right or wrong and shied away from meta-ethics, which focuses more on logic and language.

In Part I of &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; Parfit discussed self-defeating moral theories, namely the self-interest theory of rationality (&quot;S&quot;) and two ethical frameworks: common-sense morality and consequentialism. He posited that self-interest has been dominant in Western culture for over two millennia, often making bedfellows with religious doctrine, which united self-interest and morality. Because self-interest demands that we always make self-interest our supreme rational concern and instructs us to ensure that our whole life goes as well as possible, self-interest makes temporally neutral requirements. Thus it would be irrational to act in ways that we know we would prefer later to undo.

As an example, it would be irrational for fourteen-year-olds to listen to loud music or get arrested for vandalism if they knew such actions would detract significantly from their future well-being and goals (such as having good hearing, a good job, or an academic career in philosophy).

Most notably, the self-interest theory holds that it is irrational to commit any acts of self-denial or to act on desires that negatively affect our well-being. One may consider an aspiring author whose strongest desire is to write a masterpiece, but who, in doing so, suffers depression and lack of sleep. Parfit argues that it is plausible that we have such desires which conflict with our own well-being, and that it is not necessarily irrational to act to fulfill these desires.

Aside from the initial appeal to plausibility of desires that do not directly contribute to one&#x27;s life going well, Parfit contrived situations where self-interest is indirectly self-defeating—that is, it makes demands that it initially posits as irrational. It does not fail on its own terms, but it does recommend adoption of an alternative framework of rationality. For instance, it might be in my self-interest to become trustworthy to participate in mutually beneficial agreements, even though in maintaining the agreement I will be doing what will, other things being equal, be worse for me. In many cases self-interest instructs us precisely not to follow self-interest, thus fitting the definition of an indirectly self-defeating theory.

Parfit contended that to be indirectly individually self-defeating and directly collectively self-defeating is not fatally damaging for S. To further bury self-interest, he exploited its partial relativity, juxtaposing temporally neutral demands against agent-centred demands. The appeal to full relativity raises the question whether a theory can be consistently neutral in one sphere of actualisation but entirely partial in another. Stripped of its commonly accepted shrouds of plausibility that can be shown to be inconsistent, self-interest can be judged on its own merits. While Parfit did not offer an argument to dismiss S outright, his exposition lays self-interest bare and allows its own failings to show through. It is defensible, but the defender must bite so many bullets that they might lose their credibility in the process. Thus a new theory of rationality is necessary. Parfit offered the &quot;critical present aim theory&quot;, a broad catch-all that can be formulated to accommodate any competing theory. He constructed critical present aim to exclude self-interest as our overriding rational concern and to allow the time of action to become critically important. But he left open whether it should include &quot;to avoid acting wrongly&quot; as our highest concern. Such an inclusion would pave the way for ethics. Henry Sidgwick longed for the fusion of ethics and rationality, and while Parfit admitted that many would avoid acting irrationally more ardently than acting immorally, he could not construct an argument that adequately united the two.

Where self-interest puts too much emphasis on the separateness of persons, consequentialism fails to recognise the importance of bonds and emotional responses that come from allowing some people privileged positions in one&#x27;s life. If we were all pure do-gooders, perhaps following Sidgwick, that would not constitute the outcome that would maximise happiness. It would be better if a small percentage of the population were pure do-gooders, but others acted out of love, etc. Thus consequentialism too makes demands of agents that it initially deemed immoral; it fails not on its own terms, for it still demands the outcome that maximises total happiness, but does demand that each agent not always act as an impartial happiness promoter. Consequentialism thus needs to be revised as well.

Self-interest and consequentialism fail indirectly, while common-sense morality is directly collectively self-defeating. (So is self-interest, but self-interest is an &quot;individual&quot; theory.) Parfit showed, using interesting examples and borrowing from Nashian games, that it would often be better for us all if we did not put the welfare of our loved ones before all else. For example, we should care not only about our kids, but everyone&#x27;s kids.

=== &quot;On What Matters&quot; ===

In his second book, Parfit argues for moral realism, insisting that moral questions have true and false answers. Further, he suggests that three categories of ethical theory—Kantian deontology, consequentalism, and contractualism—converge on the same answers to moral questions.

In the conclusion of the third volume, published shortly after his death, Parfit writes that the affluent have strong moral obligations to the poor:

One thing that greatly matters is the failure of we rich people to prevent, as we so easily could, much of the suffering and many of the early deaths of the poorest people in the world. The money that we spend on an evening’s entertainment might instead save some poor person from death, blindness, or chronic and severe pain. If we believe that, in our treatment of these poorest people, we are not acting wrongly, we are like those who believed that they were justified in having slaves. Some of us ask how much of our wealth we rich people ought to give to these poorest people. But that question wrongly assumes that our wealth is ours to give. This wealth is legally ours. But these poorest people have much stronger moral claims to some of this wealth. We ought to transfer to these people [...] at least ten per cent of what we earn.He also concludes that responding to risks to humanity&#x27;s survival is what &quot;matters most&quot;, with humanity&#x27;s descendants or successors having the potential to spread through the galaxy and create unprecedented good over billions of years.

===Criticism===

In his book &quot;On Human Nature&quot;, Roger Scruton criticised Parfit&#x27;s use of moral dilemmas such as the trolley problem and lifeboat ethics to support his ethical views, writing, &quot;These &#x27;dilemmas&#x27; have the useful character of eliminating from the situation just about every morally relevant relationship and reducing the problem to one of arithmetic alone.&quot; Scruton believed that many of them are deceptive; for example, he does not believe one must be a consequentialist to believe that it is morally required to pull the switch in the trolley problem, as Parfit assumes. He instead suggests that more complex dilemmas, such as Anna Karenina&#x27;s choice to leave her husband and child for Vronsky, are needed to fully express the differences between opposing ethical theories, and suggests that deontology is free of the problems that (in Scruton&#x27;s view) beset Parfit&#x27;s theory.

==Personal identity==
Parfit was singular in his meticulously rigorous and almost mathematical investigations into personal identity. In some cases, he used examples seemingly inspired by &quot;Star Trek&quot; and other science fiction, such as the teletransporter, to explore our intuitions about our identity. He was a reductionist, believing that since there is no adequate criterion of personal identity, people do not exist apart from their components. Parfit argued that reality can be fully described impersonally: there need not be a determinate answer to the question &quot;Will I continue to exist?&quot; We could know all the facts about a person&#x27;s continued existence and not be able to say whether the person has survived. He concluded that we are mistaken in assuming that personal identity is what matters in survival; what matters is rather &quot;Relation R&quot;: psychological connectedness (namely, of memory and character) and continuity (overlapping chains of strong connectedness).

Following David Hume, Parfit argued that no unique entity, such as a self, unifies a person&#x27;s experiences and dispositions over time. Therefore personal identity is not &quot;what matters&quot; in survival.

A key Parfitian question is: given the choice between surviving without psychological continuity and connectedness (Relation R) and dying but preserving R through someone else&#x27;s future existence, which would you choose? Parfit argues the latter is preferable.

Parfit described his loss of belief in a separate self as liberating:

===Criticism of personal identity view===
Fellow reductionist Mark Johnston of Princeton rejects Parfit&#x27;s constitutive notion of identity with what he calls an &quot;Argument from Above&quot;. Johnston maintains, &quot;Even if the lower-level facts [that make up identity] do not in themselves matter, the higher-level fact may matter. If it does, the lower-level facts will have derived significance. They will matter, not in themselves, but because they constitute the higher level fact.&quot;

In this, Johnston moves to preserve the significance of personhood. Parfit&#x27;s explanation is that it is not personhood itself that matters, but rather the facts in which personhood consists that provide it with significance. To illustrate this difference between himself and Johnston, Parfit used an illustration of a brain-damaged patient who becomes irreversibly unconscious. The patient is certainly still alive even though that fact is separate from the fact that his heart is still beating and other organs are still functioning. But the fact that the patient is alive is not an independent or separately obtaining fact. The patient&#x27;s being alive, even though irreversibly unconscious, simply consists in the other facts. Parfit explains that from this so-called &quot;Argument from Below&quot; we can arbitrate the value of the heart and other organs still working without having to assign them derived significance, as Johnston&#x27;s perspective would dictate.

==Population ethics and future generations==

=== Non-identity problem ===
The non-identity problem arises from the observation that actions taken today can fundamentally alter which future people come into existence. In chapter 16 of &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;, Parfit posits that one&#x27;s existence is intimately related to the time and conditions of one&#x27;s conception. He calls this &quot;The Time-Dependence Claim&quot;: &quot;If any particular person had not been conceived when he was in fact conceived, it is in fact true that he would never have existed&quot;. Like the butterfly effect in chaos theory, small changes in initial conditions can have profound downstream effects on human reproduction. Actions may not just affect the welfare of future individuals, but also cause different individuals to be born. If the moral ramifications of potential policies are considered in person-affecting terms, there is no reason to prefer a sound policy over an unsound one, provided that its effects are not felt by the next few generations. Parfit eventually became convinced that personal identity is not relevant to ethics.

=== Mere addition paradox and repugnant conclusion ===
In part four of &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;, Parfit discusses possible futures for the world. He discusses possible futures and population growth in chapter 17, and argues that both average and total utilitarianism result in unwelcome conclusions when applied to population.

In the section titled &quot;Overpopulation&quot;, Parfit distinguishes between average utilitarianism and total utilitarianism. He formulates average utilitarianism in two ways. One is what Parfit calls the &quot;Impersonal Average Principle&quot;, which he formulates as &quot;If other things are equal, the best outcome is the one in which people&#x27;s lives go, on average, best.&quot; The other is what he calls the &quot;Hedonistic version&quot;; he formulates this as &quot;If other things are equal, the best outcome is the one in which there is the greatest average net sum of happiness, per life lived.&quot; Parfit then gives two formulations of the total utilitarianism view. The first formulation Parfit calls the &quot;Hedonistic version of the Impersonal Total Principle&quot;: &quot;If other things are equal, the best outcome is the one in which there would be the greatest quantity of happiness—the greatest net sum of happiness minus misery.&quot; He then describes the other formulation, the &quot;non-Hedonistic Impersonal Total Principle&quot;: &quot;If other things are equal, the best outcome is the one in which there would be the greatest quantity of whatever makes life worth living.&quot;
Applying total utilitarian standards (absolute total happiness) to possible population growth and welfare leads to what he calls the repugnant conclusion: &quot;For any possible population of at least ten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there must be some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if other things are equal, would be better, even though its members have lives that are barely worth living.&quot; Parfit illustrates this with a simple thought experiment: imagine a choice between two possible futures. In A, 10 billion people would live during the next generation, all with extremely happy lives, lives far happier than anyone&#x27;s today. In B, there are 20 billion people all living lives that, while slightly less happy than those in A, are still very happy. Under total utility maximisation we should prefer B to A. Therefore, through a regressive process of population increases and happiness decreases (in each pair of cases the happiness decrease is outweighed by the population increase) we are forced to prefer Z, a world of hundreds of billions of people all living lives barely worth living, to A. Even if we do not hold that coming to exist can benefit someone, we still must at least admit that Z is no worse than A.

Parfit and other philosophers have explored a number of potential ways to avoid this &quot;repugnant conclusion&quot;, many of which are discussed in &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;. Parfit himself spent significant time trying to find a coherent ethical theory that would avoid it. One potential objection challenges what life in the A-world would be like and whether life in the Z-world would differ very much from a normal privileged life. Another one proposes that movement from the A-world to the Z-world can be blocked by discontinuity. Negative utilitarians may reject the premise of maximizing happiness, emphasizing the converse, the minimization of suffering. Philosopher Larry Temkin challenges the assumption that the &quot;better than&quot; relation is transitive. Others proposed a minimal threshold of liberties and primary social goods to be distributed, or suggested to adopt a deontological approach that looks to values and their transmission through time. Michael Huemer and Torbjörn Tännsjö endorse the conclusion, considering that the repugnance comes from intuitions that should be revised. In 2021, a number of philosophers said that avoiding the repugnant conclusion was receiving excessive focus and should not be considered a necessary condition for an adequate theory of population ethics.

Against average utilitarianism, Parfit also argues that if all that matters is average happiness, then the best population could be arbitrarily small, for example containing only a few extremely happy individuals. Moreover, this would imply that adding people with lives worth living would make the world worse if these are less happy than the average.

==Personal life==

Parfit met Janet Radcliffe Richards in 1982, and they then began a relationship that lasted until his death. They married in 2010. Richards believes Parfit had Asperger syndrome.

Parfit supported effective altruism. He was a member of Giving What We Can and pledged to donate at least 10% of his income to effective charities.

Parfit was an avid photographer who regularly traveled to Venice and St. Petersburg to photograph architecture.

<text>A farm (also called an agricultural holding) is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialized units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fiber, biofuel, and other biobased products. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings, and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times, the term has been extended to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or at sea.

There are about 570 million farms in the world, most of which are small and family-operated. Small farms with a land area of fewer than 2 hectares operate on about 12% of the world&#x27;s agricultural land, and family farms comprise about 75% of the world&#x27;s agricultural land.

Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots, and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.

==Etymology==

The word in the sense of an agricultural land-holding derives from the verb &quot;to farm&quot; a revenue source, whether taxes, customs, rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land tenure of &quot;fee farm&quot;. The word is from the medieval Latin noun &quot;firma&quot;, also the source of the French word &quot;ferme&quot;, meaning a fixed agreement, contract, from the classical Latin adjective &quot;firmus&quot; meaning strong, stout, firm. As in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture, which was their principal revenue source, so to hold a manor by the tenure of &quot;fee farm&quot; became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself.

==History==

Farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history. The transition from hunter-gatherer to settled, agricultural societies is called the Neolithic Revolution and first began around 12,000 years ago, near the beginning of the geological epoch of the Holocene around 12,000 years ago. It was the world&#x27;s first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. Farming spread from the Middle East to Europe and by 4,000 BC people that lived in the central part of Europe were using oxen to pull plows and wagons. Subsequent step-changes in human farming practices were provoked by the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century, and the Green Revolution of the second half of the 20th century.

Farming originated independently in different parts of the world, as hunter-gatherer societies transitioned to food production rather than food capture. It may have started about 12,000 years ago with the domestication of livestock in the Fertile Crescent in western Asia, soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops. Modern units tend to specialize in the crops or livestock best suited to the region, with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing, with farm products being traded around the world.

==Types of farms==

A farm may be owned and operated by a single individual, family, community, corporation, or a company, may produce one or many types of produce, and can be a holding of any size from a fraction of a hectare to several thousand hectares.

A farm may operate under a monoculture system or with a variety of cereal or arable crops, which may be separate from or combined with raising livestock. Specialist farms are often denoted as such, thus a dairy farm, fish farm, poultry farm or mink farm.

Some farms may not use the word at all, hence vineyard (grapes), orchard (nuts and other fruit), market garden or &quot;truck farm&quot; (vegetables and flowers). Some farms may be denoted by their topographical location, such as a hill farm, while large estates growing cash crops such as cotton or coffee may be called plantations.

Many other terms are used to describe farms to denote their methods of production, as in collective, corporate, intensive, organic or vertical.

Where most of the income is from some other employment, and the farm is an expanded residence, the term hobby farm is common. This will allow sufficient size for recreational use but be very unlikely to produce sufficient income to be self-sustaining. Hobby farms are commonly around but may be much larger depending on land prices.

Other farms may primarily exist for research or education, such as an ant farm, and since farming is synonymous with mass production, the word &quot;farm&quot; may be used to describe wind power generation or puppy farm. 

=== Farm buildings ===

Farms have special buildings. Some buildings, such as barns, may hold animals. There may be separate buildings for chickens and pigs. On dairy farms, a milking parlor is an important building. It is where dairy cows are milked. The milk is kept in a milking parlor until a milk tanker comes to get it. There are also special buildings for keeping grain. A silo is a tall building where grains, such as wheat and oats are stored. Farmers also use small round metal buildings to store their grain. These buildings are called grain bins.

==Specialized farms==

===Dairy farm===
Dairy farming is a class of agriculture, where female cattle, goats, or other mammals are raised for their milk, which may be either processed on-site or transported to a dairy for processing and eventual retail sale There are many breeds of cattle that can be milked some of the best producing ones include Holstein, Norwegian Red, Kostroma, Brown Swiss, and more.

In most Western countries, a centralized dairy facility processes milk and dairy products, such as ice cream, yogurt, butter, and cheese. In the United States, these dairies are usually local companies, while in the southern hemisphere facilities may be run by very large nationwide or trans-national corporations (such as Fonterra).

Dairy farms generally sell male calves for veal meat, as dairy breeds are not normally satisfactory for commercial beef production. Many dairy farms also grow their own feed, typically including maize, alfalfa, and hay. This is fed directly to the cows, or stored as silage for use during the winter season. Additional dietary supplements are added to the feed to improve milk production. 

===Poultry farm===
Poultry farms are devoted to raising chickens (egg layers or broilers), turkeys, ducks, and other fowl, generally for meat or eggs.

===Pig farm===

A pig farm is one that specializes in raising pigs for bacon, ham, and other pork products. They may be free range, intensive, or both.

==Ownership==
Farm control and ownership have traditionally been a key indicator of status and power, especially in Medieval European agrarian societies. The distribution of farm ownership has historically been closely linked to a form of government. Medieval feudalism was essentially a system that centralized control of farmland, control of farm labor, and political power, while the early American democracy, in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights, was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership. However, the gradual modernization and mechanization of farming, which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements of farming, has led to increasingly large farms. This has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership.

===Forms of ownership===
In some societies (especially socialist and communist), collective farming is the norm, with either government ownership of the land or common ownership by a local group. Especially in societies without widespread industrialized farming, tenant farming and sharecropping are common; farmers either pay landowners for the right to use farmland or give up a portion of the crops.

=== Agribusiness ===
==Farms around the world==

===United States===

The land and buildings of a farm are called the &quot;farmstead&quot;.
Enterprises where livestock are raised on rangeland are called &quot;ranches&quot;. Where livestock are raised in confinement on feed produced elsewhere, the term &quot;feedlot&quot; is usually used.

In the US, in 1910 there were 6,406,000 farms and 10,174,000 family workers; In 2000 there were only 2,172,000 farms and 2,062,300 family workers. The share of U.S. farms operated by women has risen steadily over recent decades, from 5 percent in 1978 to 14 percent by 2007.In the United States, there are over three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers; 72% are foreign-born, 78% are male, they have an average age of 36 and average education of 8 years. Farmworkers make an average hourly rate of $9–10 per hour, compared to an average of over $18 per hour for nonfarm labor. Their average family income is under $20,000 and 23% live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level. One-half of all farmworker families earn less than $10,000 per year, which is significantly below the 2005 U.S. poverty level of $19,874 for a family of four.

In 2007, corn acres are expected to increase by 15% because of the high demand for ethanol, both in and outside of the U.S. Producers are expecting to plant 90.5 million acres (366,000 km2) of corn, making it the largest corn crop since 1944.

===Europe===
In the UK, &quot;farm&quot; as an agricultural unit, always denotes the area of pasture and other fields together with its farmhouse, farmyard and outbuildings. Large farms, or groups of farms under the same ownership, may be called an estate. Conversely, a small farm surrounding the owner&#x27;s dwelling is called a smallholding and is generally focused on self-sufficiency with only the surplus being sold.

In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units where industrial agriculture and mechanization brings large crop yields.

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the most important policies of the European Union and is helping in the change of farms from traditional family farms to larger production units. The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilizing markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60 per cent of the European Union&#x27;s annual budget, and as of 2013 accounts for around 34 per cent.

===Asia===
====Pakistan====

According to the World Bank, &quot;most empirical evidence indicates that land productivity on large farms in Pakistan is lower than that of small farms, holding other factors constant.&quot; Small farmers have &quot;higher net returns per hectare&quot; than large farms, according to farm
household income data.

====Nepal====
Nepal is an agricultural country and about 80% of the total population are engaged in farming. Rice is mainly produced in Nepal along with fruits like apples. Dairy farming and poultry farming are also growing in Nepal.

===Australia===

Farming is a significant economic sector in Australia. A farm is an area of land used for primary production which will include buildings.

According to the UN, &quot;green agriculture directs a greater share of total farming input expenditures towards the purchase of locally sourced input?(e.g. labour and organic fertilisers) and a local multiplier effect is expected to kick in. Overall, green farming practices tend to require more labour inputs than conventional farming (e.g. from comparable levels to as much as 30 percent more) (FAO 2007 and European Commission 2010), creating jobs in rural areas and a higher return on labour inputs.&quot;

Often very small farms used for intensive primary production are referred to by the specialization they are being used for, such as a dairy rather than a dairy farm, a piggery, a market garden, etc. This also applies to feedlots, which are specifically developed for a single purpose and are often not able to be used for more general purpose (mixed) farming practices.

In remote areas, farms can become quite large. As with &quot;estates&quot; in England, there is no defined size or method of operation at which a large farm becomes a station.

===Africa===

A farm in Africa includes various structures. Depending on climate-related areas primarily farming is the raising and breeding of grazing livestock, such as cattle, sheep, ostriches, horses or goats. Predominantly domestic animals are raised for their meat, milk, skin, leather or fiber wool). You might even come across silk farms.

Furthermore, there are plenty of hunting farms, guest farms and game farms. Arable] or irrigated land is often used for raising crops such as feed grains and hay for animal feeding.

On some farms (Astro Farm) star-gazing became very popular because of the excellent optical quality in the desert. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) which investigates cosmic gamma rays is situated on &quot;Farm Göllschau&quot; in Namibia.

==Farm equipment==

Farm equipment has evolved over the centuries from simple hand tools such as the hoe, through ox- or horse-drawn equipment such as the plough and harrow, to the modern highly technical machinery such as the tractor, baler and combine harvester replacing what was a highly labour-intensive occupation before the Industrial Revolution. Today much of the farm equipment used on both small and large farms is automated (e.g. using satellite guided farming).

As new types of high-tech farm equipment have become inaccessible to farmers that historically fixed their own equipment, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reports there is a growing backlash, due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it). This has encouraged groups such as Open Source Ecology and Farm Hack to begin to make open source hardware for agricultural machinery. In addition on a smaller scale Farmbot and the RepRap open source 3D printer community has begun to make open-source farm tools available of increasing levels of sophistication.

<doc id="59792" wikidata="Q5433088" url="?curid=59792" title="Family Court of Australia">
<text>The Family Court of Australia was a superior Australian federal court of record which deals with family law matters, such as divorce applications, parenting disputes, and the division of property when a couple separate. Together with the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, it covered family law matters in all states and territories of Australia except for Western Australia, which has a separate Family Court. Its core function was to determine cases with the most complex law, facts and parties, to cover specialised areas in family law, and to provide national coverage as the national appellate court for family law matters.

In 2021, the Morrison government introduced legislation merging the Family Court with the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to form the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, effective from 1 September 2021. Since the merger, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia is the only court which has jurisdiction to deal with purely family law related issues (except for Western Australia).

==Establishment==
The Family Court of Australia was established under Chapter 3 of the Australian Constitution, by the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot;, and commenced operations on 5 January 1976. It currently comprises a Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice, Appeal Division judges and other judges. In July 2008, there were 44 judges (5 of whom were also Judges of the Family Court of Western Australia), 2 judicial registrars and 1 senior registrar. In December 2017 the number of judges was down to 36, including 8 Judges of the Appeals Division. The Court maintains registries in all Australian states and territories except Western Australia.

The Court has had five Chief Justices to date, Elizabeth Evatt (1976–1988), Alastair Nicholson (1988–2004), Diana Bryant (2004–2017), John Pascoe (2017–2018) and Will Alstergren , the current Chief Justice who was appointed on 10 December 2018 (having served as Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia since September 2017 and continuing to hold that position). The position of Deputy Chief Justice was previously held by John Faulks until 30 October 2016, but has been filled by former Attorney-General Robert McClelland since 10 December 2018.

The 2008–09 federal budget provided for Family Court expenditure of $137m (including services provided free to the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court).

==Jurisdiction==

Commonwealth family law is dealt with by the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot;, the &quot;Family Law Regulations 1984&quot; and the &quot;Marriage Act 1961&quot;.

In 1986–87, the states agreed that children should be dealt with under the same legislation. The &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot; was amended in 1988 to reflect this agreement (although this did not happen in relation to Queensland until 1990). Western Australia, however, did not enter into the agreement and has maintained its own separate Family Court which deals with federal legislation (such as the Family Law Act) as well as state legislation such as the Family Court Act (WA).

The Court has jurisdiction over all marriage-related cases in all states and territories of Australia, except Western Australia which has its own family court. An avenue of appeal to the Family Court of Australia does however exist in relation to judgments in the Western Australian court.

Its jurisdiction covers applications for declarations of the validity or nullity of marriages, divorces, residence, contact, maintenance, child support and property issues. This jurisdiction, granted under the Family Law Act 1975, is a Commonwealth responsibility under the &quot;matrimonial causes&quot; head of power in Section 51(xxii) of the Australian Constitution. Prior to 1975, jurisdiction over family law matters was held and exercised largely by state Supreme Courts under the &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act&quot;.

===Difference between relationships===
The Commonwealth power to legislate for marriage and &quot;matrimonial causes&quot; is supported by sections 51(xxi) and (xxii) of the Constitution, whereas the power to legislate for de facto financial matters largely relies on referrals by States to the Commonwealth in accordance with section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution. A special cause was created called a &quot;de facto financial cause&quot;; see the &quot;Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008&quot; explanatory Memorandum.

However, the definitions of &quot;matrimonial cause&quot; and &quot;de facto financial cause&quot; differ in some respects, due to the different sources of Commonwealth power to legislate for these matters. Paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of &quot;de facto financial cause&quot;, in the Family Law Act 1975 therefore, limit the proceedings within each of those sections to proceedings taken once the relevant de facto relationship has broken down.

====Limited jurisdiction over de facto relationships====
Hence, from 1 March 2009 a new section in the Family Law Act 1975 has limited jurisdiction over de facto relationships that have a geographical connection with a participating State or Territory, sections 90RG,90SD and 90SK of the Family Law Act. Participating states and territories are: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, Christmas Island or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The states referred de facto matters under Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution.

====Children of de facto relationships====
The Family Court also has jurisdiction over the children of de facto couples and those that have never lived together. This jurisdiction was acquired by the Commonwealth through a referral of powers agreed between the Commonwealth and all states except Western Australia). The initial referral referred to custody and access in the breakdown of de facto relationships.

===Appeals from first-instance decisions===
Appeals from first-instance decisions of the Court are to Appeals Division, which includes the Full Court of the Family Court. From the Full Court, the only avenue of appeal is to the High Court of Australia, an action which requires the grant of special leave by the High Court.

==Relationship with Federal Circuit Court==

With the establishment of the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court in 1999 (now the Federal Circuit Court of Australia), the Family Court has concurrent jurisdiction in most areas, with the FCC. The FMC was initially given jurisdiction to hear applications for nullity and dissolution of marriage,
family law property disputes (where the property in dispute was worth less than $0.3m, or property disputes worth more than this if the parties consented), parenting orders providing for matters such as contact, maintenance and specific issues, and where the parties consented, parenting orders providing for the residence of a child. In December 2000, its jurisdiction was extended to encompass &quot;residence&quot;. The majority of proceedings under the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; are now filed in the FMC. In general practice, only the more complex and intractable family law cases are transferred from the Federal Circuit Court to the Family Court.

===Proposed changes===

In 2008, the federal Attorney-General announced a review of the delivery of family law services by the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court. A November 2008 report set out a possible framework of governance options to achieve a more integrated system of case management practices across the family law jurisdiction, with changes in judicial structures and reporting relationships. The report concluded that &quot;there exists a significant level of duplication of administrative structures and corporate services across the Family Court and the FMC and that the existing and proposed duplication is not financially sustainable&quot;.

According to the report, all review submissions, with the exception of that provided by the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court, &quot;considered that the most effective model for the delivery by the Courts of family law services would be a single family court, with two separate judicial divisions serviced by a single administration.&quot; The proposed model is similar to that of the Family Court of Western Australia, which the 
Law Council of Australia, in its submission, had noted as providing a useful model of the structure and functioning of an integrated Family Court. The Law Council stated that &quot;Chapter III courts exercising largely identical jurisdictions, with separate administrations and competing for funds and resources, is wholly unacceptable and that rationalisation and integration of the two federal courts exercising family law jurisdiction is urgently required.&quot;

In her written submission to the Attorney-General, the current Chief Justice, Diana Bryant, noted &quot;the budgetary pressures facing both existing Courts&quot;, and that as far as litigants and the public were concerned, there appeared to be significant duplication of resources and functions. She noted that &quot;there are at present two courts with concurrent jurisdiction doing first instance family law work with no legislative differentiation.&quot; Her submission favoured combining the current family law functions of the Federal Magistrates Court with the Family Court of Australia under a new Court, with a new name.

==Less adversarial trials==

In July 2006, under Division 12A of Part VII of the Family Law Act, the Court implemented its model for &quot;less adversarial trials&quot; – to be applied to all new child related proceedings in the Family Court, without the need for consent of the parties. According to the Court, the change from a traditional common law approach to a less adversarial trial &quot;has significant implications, not only for the conduct of family law litigation, but also for the conduct of litigation as a whole.&quot;

According to the Family Court, &quot;in a less adversarial trial:
* no affidavits are filed before the trial—parents only complete a questionnaire
* the judge, rather than the parties or their lawyers, decides how the trial is conducted
* the judge controls the case and keeps everyone concentrated on the major disagreements about their children&#x27;s best interests
* parents and carers can speak directly to the judge, not simply through their lawyers
* the judge identifies the issues to be decided and the evidence to be heard, and
* the judge is assisted by evidence from a family consultant.&quot;

==Miscellaneous==

When the Family Court was established, an attempt was made to make the court less formal and more &quot;family friendly&quot;, with a proposal that wigs should not be worn, although gowns would be retained. In 1987, the requirement to wear wigs were reinstated. Judges and judicial registrars of the Family Court of Australia wore a black silk gown, a bar jacket with either bands or a jabot and a bench wig. Now judges wear a black gown (with a red stripe on appeals and formal sittings).

<doc id="59794" wikidata="Q6878709" url="?curid=59794" title="Mission San Antonio de Padua">
<text>Mission San Antonio de Padua is a Spanish mission established by the Franciscan order in present-day Monterey County, California, near the present-day town of Jolon. Founded on July 14, 1771, it was the third mission founded in Alta California by Father Presidente Junípero Serra. The mission was the first use of fired tile roofing in Upper California. Today the mission is a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey and is no longer active in the mission work which it was set up to provide.

==History==

===Beginnings of the Mission===

Mission San Antonio de Padua was the third Mission to be founded in Alta California, and was located along the very earliest routing of the Camino Real. This mission was located on a site which was unfortunately somewhat remote from the more reliable water source of what later became known as the Salinas River. In that very early year of the missions, the later more favorable routing of the Camino Real, more closely aligning with the course of the Salinas River, had not yet been discovered or established.

Father Junipero Serra claimed the site on July 14, 1771, and dedicated the Mission to Saint Anthony of Padua. Saint Anthony was born in 1195 in Lisbon, Portugal and is the patron saint of the poor. Father Serra left Fathers Miguel Pieras and Buenaventura Sitjar behind to continue the building efforts, though the construction of the church proper did not actually begin until 1810.

In 1805, the native people at the mission, mostly Northern Salinan (Antoniano) but also some Yokuts and Esselen, had increased to 1,300. By 1810, only 178 Native Americans were living at the Mission, In 1834, after secularization there were 150 Mission Indians remaining. No town grew up around the mission, as was usual at other missions.

In 1845, Mexican Governor Pío Pico declared all mission buildings in Alta California for sale, but no one bid for Mission San Antonio. In 1863, after nearly 30 years, the Mission was returned to the Catholic Church. In 1894, roof tiles were salvaged from the property and installed on the Southern Pacific Railroad depot located in Burlingame, California, one of the first permanent structures constructed in the Mission Revival Style.

===Restoration===

The first attempt to rebuild the Mission came in 1903 when Andrew Garriga, the pastor of the King City and Gonzales parish, and the California Historical Landmarks League began holding outings at San Antonio. &quot;Preservation and restoration of Mission San Antonio began. The Native Sons of the Golden West donated $1,400. Tons of debris were removed from the interior of the chapel.the mission was restored 2 times. Breaches in the side wall were filled in.&quot;
Unfortunately, the earthquake of 1906 seriously damaged the building. In 1928, Franciscan friars held services at San Antonio de Padua. It took nearly 50 years to completely restore the Mission. The State of California is requiring a $12–15 million earthquake retrofit that must be completed by 2015, or the mission will be closed. As of 2011, there were 35 private families keeping the mission open. There is an active campaign to raise funds for the retrofit.

===Current use of the old San Antonio Mission===
Despite its being still referred to as a mission, the Mission San Antonio de Padua is no longer active in Catholic missions and has become more focused as a parish church, fundraiser location, and tourist attraction. In 2005, the Franciscan Friars turned over the mission&#x27;s caretaking and ownership to the Diocese of Monterey. Under the leadership of the Diocese of Monterey, Mission San Antonio de Padua transformed into a Catholic parish which also hosts group gatherings, gift shops and a museum with picnic grounds.

== Present day ==

Today, the nearest city is King City, nearly away; Jolon, a small town, is located six miles (10 km) from the Mission. Historians consider the Mission&#x27;s pastoral location in the valley of the San Antonio River along the Santa Lucia Mountains as an outstanding example of early mission life.

The mission is surrounded by the Fort Hunter Liggett Military Reservation, which was acquired by the U.S. Army from the Hearst family during World War II to train troops. Additional land was acquired from the Army in 1950 to increase the mission area to over . This fort is still actively training troops today.

Mission San Antonio de Padua is one of the designated tour sights of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.

As of 2013, Franciscan Friar Jeff Burns OFM, is in charge of the Mission.


==In popular culture==
* The 1965 horror film &quot;Incubus&quot; was partly filmed at the Mission. The writer and director, Leslie Stevens, concerned that the Mission authorities would not allow the film to be shot there because of the subject matter, concocted a cover story that the film was called &quot;Religious Leaders of Old Monterey&quot;, and presented a script that was about monks and farmers. He was helped in this deception by the fact that the film was shot entirely in Esperanto.
* The Mission was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;Road Trip&quot; Episode 147

<text>The Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) is an Act of the Parliament of Australia that regulates the structure of the Australian judicial system and confers jurisdiction on Australian federal courts. It is one of the oldest pieces of Australian federal legislation and has been amended over 70 times.

Amongst other things, the Act regulates the exercise of the jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia, confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Australia, provides for the right of barristers and solicitors to practice in federal courts, and establishes the Australian Government Solicitor.

==The Act==
Section 78B of the Act requires Australian courts to ensure that the parties have given notice to the attorneys-general of Australia and of each state before proceeding with any case involving a &quot;matter arising under the Constitution.&quot; Each of these governments may then intervene in the case under section 78A of the Act.

Section 78 and 79 of the Act govern the application of state law by Australian federal courts. The two sections borrow verbiage from the American Rules of Decision Act.

<text>Mission San Gabriel Arcángel () is a Californian mission and historic landmark in San Gabriel, California. It was founded by the Spanish Empire on &quot;The Feast of the Birth of Mary,&quot; September 8, 1771, as the fourth of what would become twenty-one Spanish missions in California. San Gabriel Arcángel was named after the Archangel Gabriel and often referred to as the &quot;Godmother of the Pueblo of Los Angeles.&quot;

The mission was designed by Antonio Cruzado, who gave the building its capped buttresses and the tall narrow windows, which are unique among the missions of the California chain. It was completed in 1805. A large stone cross stands in the center of the &quot;Campo Santo&quot; (cemetery), first consecrated in 1778 and then again on January 29, 1939. It serves as the final resting place for some 6,000 neophytes.

According to Spanish legend, the founding expedition was confronted by a large group of native Tongva peoples whose intention was to drive the strangers away. One of the priests laid a painting of &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot; on the ground for all to see, whereupon the natives, designated by the settlers as the &quot;Gabrieleños&quot;, immediately made peace with the missionaries, because they were so moved by the painting&#x27;s beauty. Today the 300-year-old work hangs in front of and slightly to the left of the old high altar and reredos in the Mission&#x27;s sanctuary. Resistance to the mission by the Tongva was recorded and how much the neophytes embraced Catholicism remains a subject of debate among scholars.

==History==
In August 1771, the Portolà expedition, which consisted of &quot;ten Spanish soldiers and two Franciscan priests, encountered armed Tongva Indians on the banks of the Santa Ana River.&quot; One month later, Mission San Gabriel was founded on September 8, 1771, by Fray Ángel Fernández de la Somera and Fray Pedro Benito Cambón. The planned site for the Mission was along the banks of the &quot;Río de los Temblores&quot; (the River of the Earthquakes—the Santa Ana River). The priests chose an alternate site on a fertile plain located directly alongside the Río Hondo in the Whittier Narrows. The site of the &quot;Misión Vieja&quot; (or &quot;Old Mission&quot;) is located near the intersection of San Gabriel Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue.

The mission was built and run using what has been described as slave labor from nearby Tongva villages, such as Yaanga and was built on the site of the village of Toviscanga. When the nearby Pueblo de los Ángeles was built in 1781, the mission competed with the emerging pueblo for control of Indigenous labor.

The expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza visited the mission in January and February 1776, having previous been there in 1774. In 1776, a flash flood destroyed much of the crops and ruined the original Mission complex, which was subsequently relocated five miles closer to the mountains in present-day San Gabriel (the Tongva settlement of Toviscanga or &#x27;Iisanchanga). The Tongva village of Shevaanga was also located &quot;close to the second location of Mission San Gabriel&quot; after the original site was abandoned due to the flooding.

On December 8, 1812 (the &quot;Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin&quot;), a series of massive earthquakes shook Southern California. The 1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake caused the three-bell &quot;campanario&quot;, located adjacent to the chapel&#x27;s east façade, to collapse. A larger, six-bell structure was subsequently constructed at the far end of the &quot;Capilla&quot;. While no pictorial record exists to document what the original structure looked like, architectural historian Rexford Newcomb deduced the design and published a depiction in his 1916 work &quot;The Franciscan Mission Architecture of Alta (upper) California&quot;.

Over 25,000 baptisms were conducted at San Gabriel between 1771 and 1834, making it the most prolific in the chain of missions. Tongva people from nearby settlements like Akuranga village were affected by the practices of Franciscan missionaries, who attempted to &quot;eradicate what they perceived as ills within Tongva society&quot; through &quot;religious indoctrination, labor, restructuring of gender structures, and violence,&quot; which took place at and around the Mission. A missionary during this period reported that three out of four children died at Mission San Gabriel before reaching the age of 2. Nearly 6,000 Tongva lie buried in the grounds of the San Gabriel Mission. 

There were reports throughout this period of Indigenous peoples fleeing the conditions at the Mission. For example, in 1808, the missionaries sent Spanish soldier José Palomares after some neophytes who had fled the mission. Escapees traveled as far as the Serrano village of Wá’peat to escape the Mission. Palomares observed the escapees at the village and attempted to negotiate with the chief of the village for their return. However, the chief refused.
Although San Gabriel once furnished food and supplies to settlements and other missions throughout California, a majority of the Mission structures fell into ruins after it was secularized in November 1834. The once-extensive vineyards were falling to decay, with fences broken down and animals roaming freely through it. During part of the 1850s, squatters set upon the mission, converting part of it into a saloon which had both felons and a justice of the peace as customers; it was opened by former San Diego Mayor Joshua Bean.

The Mission&#x27;s chapel functioned as a parish church for the City of San Gabriel from 1862 until 1908, when the Claretian Missionaries came to San Gabriel and began the job of rebuilding and restoring the Mission. In 1874, tracks were laid for Southern Pacific Railroad near the mission. In 2012, artifacts from the mission era were found when the tracks were lowered into a trench known as the Alameda Corridor-East. On October 1, 1987, the Whittier Narrows earthquake damaged the property. A significant portion of the original complex has since been restored.

Fire completely destroyed the roof of the original church sanctuary on July 11, 2020. Prior to the fire, the mission was undergoing renovation, saving some paintings and artifacts. An investigation into the origin of the fire was opened. On May 5, 2021, John David Corey, age 57, was charged with felony counts of arson and burglary for setting the fire. An invitation-only Mass was celebrated in September 2022 with hope of permanently opening the mission by early December. The mission officially reopened in July 2023.

==Mission industries==

The goal of the missions was to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming was the most important industry of any mission. Prior to the missions, the Native Americans had developed a complex, self-sufficient culture. The mission priests established what they thought of as a manual training school: to teach the Indians their style of agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. The missions, utilizing the labor of the s, produced everything they used and consumed. After 1811, the mission Indians could be said to sustain the entire military and civil government of California.

Ranchos (not to be confused with secular government land-grant ranchos) were established in a wide area for raising cattle, sheep and other livestock. These included; San Pasqual, Santa Anita, Azusa, San Francisquito, Cucumonga, San Antonio, San Bernardino, San Gorgonio, Yucaipa, Jurupa, Guapa, Rincon, Chino, San Jose, Ybarras, Puente, Mission Vieja, Serranos, Rosa de Castilla, Coyotes, Jabonaria, Las Bolsas, Alamitos, and Cerritos. When Rancho San Gorgonio was established in 1824, in what today is known as the San Gorgonio Pass, it became the most distant rancho operated by the San Gabriel Mission.

Many of the Native Americans lived in communities called rancherías. &quot;The names of the rancherías associated with San Gabriel Mission were: Acuragna, Alyeupkigna, Awigna, Azucsagna, Cahuenga, Chokishgna, Chowigna, Cucomogna, Hahamogna, Harasgna, Houtgna, Hutucgna, Isanthcogna, Maugna, Nacaugna, Pascegna, Pasinogna, Pimocagna, Pubugna, Sibagna, Sisitcanogna, Sonagna, Suangna, Tibahagna, Toviscanga, Toybipet, Yangna.&quot;

To efficiently manage its extensive lands, Mission San Gabriel established several outlying sub-missions, known as &quot;asistencias&quot;. Several of these became or were included in land grants following the Mexican secularization of the missions in the 1830s, including:
* Rancho Santa Ana del Chino
* Rancho La Puente
* San Bernardino de Sena Estancia
* Rancho Santa Anita

In 1816, the Mission built a grist mill on a nearby creek. El Molino Viejo still stands, now preserved as a museum and historic landmark. Other mission industries included cowhide tanning/exporting and tallow-rendering (for making soap and for export), lime kilns, tile making, cloth weaving for blankets and clothing, and adobe bricks.

==Mission bells==

Bells were important to daily life at any mission. They were rung to mark mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, to mark births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or a returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing of the mission bells. The mission bells were also used to tell time.

The actor Gil Frye portrayed Father Miguel Sánchez in a 1953 episode, &quot;The Bell of San Gabriel,&quot; of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days,&quot; hosted by Stanley Andrews. As a child portrayed in the segment by Peter J. Votrian, Miguel provides funds acquired from a wealthy nobleman to sweeten the tone of the bell at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. Years later, the ringing of the bell saves his life when he is a young monk stranded in the desert in the Death Valley country.

== Burials ==
The Mission San Gabriel Arcángel Cemetery is the oldest and first Catholic cemetery in the state of California. A large stone cross stands in the center of the &quot;Campo Santo&quot; (cemetery), first consecrated in 1778 and then again on January 29, 1939, by the Los Angeles Archbishop John Cantwell. It serves as the final resting place for some 6,000 &quot;neophytes;&quot; a small stone marker denotes the gravesite of José de los Santos, the last American Indian to be buried on the grounds, at the age of 101 in February 1921. It is the oldest and first cemetery in the state of California.

Also interred at the Mission are the bodies of numerous Franciscan priests who died during their time of service, as well as the remains of Reverend Raymond Catalan, C.M.F., who undertook the restoration of the Mission&#x27;s gardens. Entombed at the foot of the altar are the remains of eight Franciscan priests (listed in order of interment): Miguel Sánchez, Antonio Cruzado, Francisco Dumetz, Ramón Ulibarri, Joaquín P. Núñez, Gerónimo Boscana, José Bernardo Sánchez, and Blas Ordaz. Buried among the priests is centenarian Eulalia Pérez de Guillén Mariné, the &quot;keeper of the keys&quot; under Spanish rule; her grave is marked by a bench dedicated in her memory, and Victoria Reid, a woman from Comicranga, who was taken to the mission at a young age and became a respected figure in Mexican California. 

The Tongva people have their own ceremony and traditions after death. A 1724 engraving depicts Native Americans (most likely Tongva) carrying a dead body over a smoky fire.

==Exhibits==

Visitors can tour the church, museum and grounds. The adobe museum building was built in 1812 and was originally used for sleeping quarters and book storage. Exhibits include mission relics, books and religious artifacts. The grounds feature operations from the original mission complex, including indoor and outdoor kitchens, winery, water cisterns, soap and candle vats, tanning vats for preparing cattle hides, and a cemetery. There is also a gift shop.

==Matrimonial Investigation Records==
As part of the William McPherson Collection in the Special Collections at the Claremont Colleges&#x27; Honnold/Mudd Library, the San Gabriel Mission are a valuable resource for research on the pre-statehood activities of the Mission. William McPherson was a rancher, scholar, and collector from Orange County, California, who donated his extensive collection of mission documents, primarily from the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, to Special Collections in 1964. 

The matrimonial records span 1788 to 1861 and are notarized interviews with couples wanting to marry in the Roman Catholic Church, performed to establish the couples&#x27; freedom to marry. The collection includes 165 investigations, with 173 men and 170 women. Because the donated records are fragile, they are no longer available to be photocopied. The California Digital Library has an online guide available to search the collection.

<text>The University of Virginia (UVA) is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson and contains his Academical Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The original governing Board of Visitors included three U.S. presidents: Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, the latter as sitting president of the United States at the time of its foundation. As its first two rectors, Presidents Jefferson and Madison played key roles in the university&#x27;s foundation, with Jefferson designing both the original courses of study and the university&#x27;s architecture.

Located within its historic 1,135-acre central campus, the university is composed of eight undergraduate and three professional schools: the School of Law, the Darden School of Business, and the School of Medicine. Admission to UVA is among the most selective of public universities in the United States, its endowment is among the largest, and the university is known in part for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies. The university has been a member of the Association of American Universities for years.

In athletic competition, the university teams are called the Cavaliers and lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in team NCAA Championships for men&#x27;s sports, also ranking second in women&#x27;s and overall titles. In 2015, and again in 2019, the University of Virginia was presented with the Capital One Cup for fielding the nation&#x27;s best overall athletics programs for men&#x27;s sports.

The university&#x27;s alumni, faculty, and researchers have included several U.S. presidents, heads of state, , Pulitzer Prize winners, Marshall Scholars, and Fulbright Scholars. Thirty governors of U.S. states have attended the university, as have numerous U.S. senators and members of Congress. UVA has produced 57 Rhodes Scholars, the most of any flagship university in the United States, while its students and alumni have founded companies such as Reddit, Skillshare, VMware, and Space Adventures.

==History==
===1800s===
In 1802, while serving as president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new university would be &quot;on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet,&quot; and it might even attract talented students from &quot;other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge.&quot; Virginia was already home to the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, but Jefferson lost all confidence in his &quot;alma mater,&quot; partly because of its religious nature—it required all its students to recite a catechism—and its stifling of the sciences. Jefferson had flourished under William &amp; Mary professors William Small and George Wythe decades earlier, but the college was in a period of great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist Joseph Priestley, &quot;we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.&quot; These words would ring true some seventy years later when William &amp; Mary fell bankrupt after the Civil War and the Williamsburg college was shuttered completely in 1881, later being revived as primarily a small college for teachers until it regained university status later in the twentieth century. Jefferson envisioned his new university would &quot;be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.&quot;
In 1817, three presidents (Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison) and Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Marshall joined 24 other dignitaries at a meeting held in the Mountain Top Tavern at Rockfish Gap. After some deliberation, they selected nearby Charlottesville as the site of the new University of Virginia. The UVA Board of Visitors purchased just outside Charlottesville a farm that had once been owned by James Monroe. The Commonwealth of Virginia chartered a new flagship university to be based on the site in Charlottesville on January 25, 1819.

John Hartwell Cocke collaborated with James Madison, Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson&#x27;s dream to establish the university. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction. The UVA Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights is continuing to &quot;seek opportunities to engage and acknowledge with respect that we live, learn, and work on [what once was] the territory of the Monacan Indian Nation.&quot; Like many of its peers, the university owned slaves who helped build the campus. They also served students and professors. The university&#x27;s first classes met on March 7, 1825.

In contrast to other universities of the day, at which one could study in either medicine, law, or divinity, the first students at the University of Virginia could study in one or several of eight independent schools – medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry, ancient languages, modern languages, natural philosophy, and moral philosophy. Another innovation of the new university was that higher education would be separated from religious doctrine. UVA had no divinity school, was established independently of any religious sect, and the Grounds were planned and centered upon a library, the Rotunda, rather than a church, distinguishing it from peer universities still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular strain of Protestantism or another. Jefferson opined to philosopher Thomas Cooper that &quot;a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution&quot;, and never has there been one. There were initially two degrees awarded by the university: &quot;Graduate,&quot; to a student who had completed the courses of one school; and &quot;Doctor&quot; to a graduate in more than one school who had shown research prowess.

Jefferson was intimately involved in the university to the end, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students. Jefferson viewed the university&#x27;s foundation as having such great importance and potential that he counted it among his greatest accomplishments and insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his national accomplishments, such as the Louisiana Purchase and any other aspects of his presidency, in favor of his role with the young university.

Initially, some of the students arriving at the university matched the then-common picture of college students: wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse. This was a source of frustration for Jefferson, who assembled the students during the school&#x27;s first year, on October 3, 1825, to criticize such behavior; but was too overcome to speak. He later spoke of this moment as &quot;the most painful event&quot; of his life.

Although the frequency of such irresponsible behavior dropped after Jefferson&#x27;s expression of concern, it did not die away completely. Like many universities and colleges, it experienced periodic student riots, culminating in the shooting death of Professor John A. G. Davis, Chairman of the Faculty, in 1840. This event, in conjunction with the new UVA Honor System and the growing popularity of temperance and a rise in religious affiliation in society in general, seems to have resulted in a permanent change in student attitudes toward reporting the bad behavior, and thus such behavior among students that had so greatly bothered Jefferson finally vanished.

In the year of Jefferson&#x27;s death in 1826, poet Edgar Allan Poe enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin. The Raven Society, an organization named after Poe&#x27;s most famous poem, continues to maintain 13 West Range, the room Poe inhabited during the single semester he attended the university. He left because of financial difficulties. The School of Engineering and Applied Science opened in 1836, making UVA the first comprehensive university to open an engineering school.

Unlike the majority of Southern colleges, the university was kept open throughout the Civil War, despite its state seeing more bloodshed than any other and the near 100% conscription of the American South. After Jubal Early&#x27;s total loss at the Battle of Waynesboro, Charlottesville was willingly surrendered to Union forces to avoid mass bloodshed, and UVA faculty convinced George Armstrong Custer to preserve Jefferson&#x27;s university. Although Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer&#x27;s men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational mission. However, an extremely high number of officers of both Confederacy and Union were alumni. UVA produced 1,481 officers in the Confederate Army alone, including four major-generals, twenty-one brigadier-generals, and sixty-seven colonels from ten different states. John S. Mosby, the infamous &quot;Gray Ghost&quot; and commander of the lightning-fast 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry ranger unit, had also been a UVA student.

Thanks to a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia, tuition became free for all Virginians in the year 1875. During this period, the University of Virginia remained unique in that it had no president and mandated no core curriculum from its students, who often studied in and took degrees from more than one school. However, the university was also experiencing growing pains. As the original Rotunda caught fire and was gutted in 1895, there would soon be sweeping changes, much greater than merely reconstructing the Rotunda in 1899.

===1900s===


Jefferson had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no serving president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and the Board of Visitors. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university. Edwin Alderman, who had only recently moved from his post as president of UNC-Chapel Hill since 1896 to become president of Tulane University in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as &quot;Popular Science&quot; lamented the end of one of the things that made UVA unique among universities.

Alderman stayed 27 years, and became known as a prolific fund-raiser, a well-known orator, and a close adviser to U.S. president and UVA alumnus Woodrow Wilson. He added significantly to the University Hospital to support new sickbeds and public health research, and helped create departments of geology and forestry, the School of Education and Human Development (originally the Curry School of Education), the McIntire School of Commerce, and the summer school programs in which young Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe took part. Perhaps his greatest ambition was the funding and construction of a library on a scale of millions of books, much larger than the Rotunda could bear. Delayed by the Great Depression, Alderman Library was named in his honor in 1938. Alderman, who seven years earlier had died in office en route to giving a public speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, is still the longest-tenured president of the university.

In 1904, UVA became the first university south of Washington, D.C. to be elected to the Association of American Universities. After a gift by Andrew Carnegie in 1909 the University of Virginia was organized into twenty-six departments across six schools including the Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, the James Madison School of Law, the James Monroe School of International Law, the James Wilson School of Political Economy, the Edgar Allan Poe School of English and the Walter Reed School of Pathology. The honorific historical names for these schools – several of which have remained as modern schools of the university – are no longer used.

In December 1953, the University of Virginia joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for athletics. At the time, UVA had a football program that had just broken through to be nationally ranked in 1950, 1951, and 1952, and consistently beat its rivals North Carolina and Virginia Tech by scores such as 34–7 and 44–0. Other sports were very competitive as well. However, the administration of Colgate Darden de-emphasized athletics, defunding the department and declining to join the ACC before being overruled by the Board of Visitors on that decision. It would take until the 1980s for the bulk of athletics programs to fully recover but approaching the year 2000 UVA was again one of the most successful all-around sports programs with NCAA national titles achieved in an array of different sports; by 2020, it had twice won the Capital One Cup for overall athletics excellence in men&#x27;s sports programs.

UVA established a junior college in 1954, known today as the University of Virginia&#x27;s College at Wise. George Mason University and Mary Washington University used to similarly exist as UVA&#x27;s satellite campuses, but those are now wholly independent universities no longer administered by the University of Virginia.

The Academical Village and nearby Monticello became a joint World Heritage Site in 1987. Simultaneously with Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and Chaco Culture National Historical Park, they were the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth U.S. sites designated as culturally significant to the collective interests of global humanity, coming after the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite National Park three years earlier. As such, UVA possesses the only U.S. collegiate grounds to be internationally protected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

==== Integration, coeducation, and student dissent ====
The University of Virginia first admitted a few selected women to graduate studies in the late 1890s and to certain programs such as nursing and education in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1944, Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, became the Women&#x27;s Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. With this branch campus in Fredericksburg exclusively for women, UVA maintained its main campus in Charlottesville as near-exclusively for men, until a civil rights lawsuit in the 1960s forced it to commingle the sexes. In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational, and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university. When the first female class arrived, 450 undergraduate women entered UVA, comprising 39 percent of undergraduates, while the number of men admitted remained constant. By 1999, women made up a 52 percent majority of the total student body.

The university admitted its first black student when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university&#x27;s law school in 1950. Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA did not fully integrate until the 1960s. When Walter Ridley graduated with a doctorate in education, he was the first black person to graduate from UVA. UVA&#x27;s Ridley Scholarship Fund is named in his honor.

The fight for integration and coeducation came to the foreground particularly in the late 1960s, leading up to the May Strike of 1970, in which students protested for higher black enrollment, equal access to UVA admission by undergraduate women, unionization of employees, and against the presence of armed university police and recruiters of government agencies such as the CIA and FBI on Grounds.

===21st century===
Due to a continual decline in state funding for the university, today only 6 percent of its budget comes from the Commonwealth of Virginia. A Charter initiative was signed into law by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2005, negotiated with the university to have greater autonomy over its own affairs in exchange for accepting this decline in financial support.

The university welcomed Teresa A. Sullivan as its first female president in 2010. Just two years later its first woman rector, Helen Dragas, engineered a forced-resignation to remove President Sullivan from office. The attempted ouster elicited a faculty Senate vote of no confidence in Rector Dragas, and demands from student government for an explanation. In the face of mounting pressure including alumni threats to cease contributions, and a mandate from then-Governor Robert McDonnell to resolve the issue or face removal of the entire Board of Visitors, the board unanimously reinstated President Sullivan. In 2013 and 2014, the board passed new bylaws that made it harder to remove a president and possible to remove a rector.

In November 2014, the university suspended fraternity and sorority functions pending investigation of an article by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concerning an alleged rape story, which was later determined to be a hoax after the story was confirmed to be false through investigation by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The university nonetheless instituted new rules banning &quot;pre-mixed drinks, punches or any other common source of alcohol&quot; such as beer kegs and requiring &quot;sober and lucid&quot; fraternity members to monitor all parties. In April 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; fully retracted the article after the Columbia School of Journalism released a scathing and discrediting report on the &quot;anatomy of a journalistic failure&quot; by its author. Even before release of the Columbia University report, the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; story was named the &quot;Error of the Year&quot; by the Poynter Institute. The UVA chapter of Phi Kappa Psi settled a defamation suit against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and received $1.65 million.

In August 2017, the night before the infamous Unite the Right rally, a group of non-student and mostly non-Virginian white nationalists marched on the university&#x27;s Lawn bearing torches and chanting antisemitic and Nazi slogans after the city of Charlottesville decided to remove all remaining Confederate statues from the city including one depicting Robert E. Lee. They were met by student counter-protesters near the statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of the Rotunda, where a fight broke out.

James E. Ryan, a graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, became the university&#x27;s ninth president in August 2018. His first act upon his inauguration was to announce that in-state undergraduates from families making less than $80,000 per year would receive full scholarships covering tuition, and those from families making under $30,000 would also receive free room and board. Ryan was previously dean of the Harvard School of Education.

On the night of November 13, 2022, three students were killed and two others injured in a shooting on a charter bus that was returning to the campus from a play for a class trip in Washington, D.C. All three fatalities were current members of the Virginia Cavaliers football team and the alleged shooter was briefly a member of the team during the 2018 season.

==Campus==

The UVA campus, referred to as the Grounds, straddles the border between the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County. The university also maintains 562 acres north of the campus at North Fork and 2,913 acres southeast of the city at Morven Farm. It also is in the process of building a campus in Northern Virginia within Fairfax, Virginia.

===Academical Village===
Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique Jeffersonian architecture. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the design of the University of Virginia &quot;was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century.&quot; In the United States Bicentennial issue of their &quot;AIA Journal&quot;, the American Institute of Architects called it &quot;the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.&quot; The Academical Village, together with Jefferson&#x27;s home at Monticello, which he also designed, is a World Heritage Site. The first collegiate architecture and culture World Heritage Site in the world, it was listed by UNESCO in 1987.

Jefferson&#x27;s original architectural design revolves around the &quot;Academical Village&quot;, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of the Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, the Range, and the larger university surrounding it. The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the models for many similar designs of &quot;centralized green areas&quot; at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the Lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson&#x27;s ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.

Most notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by similar buildings built at: Duke University in 1892; Columbia University in 1895; Johns Hopkins University in 1902; Carnegie Mellon University in 1904; Rice University in 1910; Peabody College of Vanderbilt University in 1915; Killian Court at MIT in 1916; the Grand Auditorium of Tsinghua University built in 1917 in Beijing, China; the Sterling Quad of Yale Divinity School in 1932; and the university&#x27;s own Darden School in 1996.

Flanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student housing rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called &quot;serpentine&quot; because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.

On October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the help of overzealous faculty member William &quot;Reddy&quot; Echols, who attempted to save it by throwing roughly of dynamite into the main fire in the hopes the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson&#x27;s own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. Perhaps ironically, one of the university&#x27;s main honors student programs is named for him. University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect Stanford White to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson&#x27;s design and redesigning the Rotunda interior—making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a president&#x27;s house. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda&#x27;s northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were moved to the South Lawn in White&#x27;s new buildings.

The White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge &quot;quadrangle&quot;, albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the University of Cambridge or University of Oxford.

In concert with the United States Bicentennial in 1976, Stanford White&#x27;s changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson&#x27;s original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson&#x27;s birthday, April 13, 1976. Queen Elizabeth II came to visit the Rotunda in that same year for the Bicentennial and had a well-publicized stroll of the Lawn. The university was listed by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; in September 2011 as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and by MSN as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world.

===Libraries===
The first library at the University of Virginia was the Rotunda. Rather than a chapel or other religious structure, the university was built around its own library. Thomas Jefferson was deeply engaged in selecting the materials that made up that library&#x27;s original collection, and in developing the system by which it would be organized. The Rotunda served as the University Library for over a century, until Shannon Library was opened in 1937. Originally named Alderman Library, the Library was renamed to honor Edgar F. Shannon Jr., the University of Virginia&#x27;s fourth President, in 2024.

The University of Virginia Library System consists of a dozen libraries and holds over 5 million volumes. Its Electronic Text Center, established in 1992, has put 70,000 books online as well as 350,000 images that go with them. These e-texts are open to anyone and, , were receiving 37,000 daily visits (compared to 6,000 daily visitors to the physical libraries). Shannon Library holds the most extensive Tibetan collection in the world and holds ten floors of book &quot;stacks&quot; of varying ages and historical value. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library features a collection of American literature as well as two copies of the original printing of the Declaration of Independence. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English graduate student, discovered an unpublished Robert Frost poem from 1918. Clark Hall is the library for SEAS (the engineering school), and one of its notable features is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law. The murals were finished and set in place in 1934. , the university and Google were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.

Since 1992, the University of Virginia also hosts the Rare Book School, a non-profit organization in the study of historical books and the history of printing that began at Columbia University in 1983.

===Other areas===
Housing for first-year students, Brown College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the University of Virginia Medical School are near the historic Lawn and Range area. The McIntire School of Commerce is on the actual Lawn, in Rouss-Roberston Hall.

Away from the historic area, UVA&#x27;s architecture and its allegiance to the Jeffersonian design are controversial. The 1990s saw the construction of two deeply contrasting visions: the Williams Tsien post-modernist Hereford College in 1992 and the unapologetically Jeffersonian Darden School of Business in 1996. Commentary on both was broad and partisan, as the University of Virginia School of Architecture and &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Hereford for its bold new lines, while some independent press and wealthy donors praised the traditional design of the Darden school. The latter group appeared to have the upper hand when the South Lawn Project was designed in the early 2000s.

Billionaire John Kluge donated of additional lands to the university in 2001. Kluge desired the core of the land, the 2,913-acre Morven, to be developed by the university and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. Five farms totaling of the gift were soon sold to musician Dave Matthews, of the Dave Matthews Band, to be used in an organic farming project to complement his nearby Blenheim Vineyards. Morven has since hosted the Morven Summer Institute, a rigorous immersion program of study in civil society, sustainability, and creativity. , the university is developing further plans for Morven and has hired an architecture firm for the nearly three thousand acre property. In addition, the UVA Foundation owns the building and grounds of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection. The Collection itself is also owned by the University of Virginia.

===Student and faculty housing===

The primary housing areas for first-year students are McCormick Road Dormitories, often called &quot;Old Dorms&quot;, Alderman Road Dormitories, often called &quot;New Dorms&quot;, and suite style dorms located off of Alderman road near the football stadium. The 1970s-era Alderman Road Dorms are being fully replaced with brand new dormitory buildings in the same area. The replacements feature hall-style living arrangements with common areas and many modern amenities. Instead of being torn down and replaced like the original New Dorms, the Old Dorms have seen a $105 million renovation project between 2017 and 2022. They were constructed in 1950, and are also hall-style constructions but with fewer amenities. The Old Dorms are closer to the students&#x27; classes.

In the 1980s, in response to a housing shortage, the Stadium Road Residential Area was built to the south of the Alderman Road Dormitories. The largest of the houses in this area are the Gooch Dillard Residence Halls which house 610 students and are suite style type dorms.

There are three residential colleges at the university: Brown College, Hereford College, and the International Residential College. These involve an application process to live there, and are filled with both upperclass and first-year students. The application process can be extremely competitive, especially for Brown because of its location in central Grounds near classroom buildings, libraries, and Newcomb Hall.

It is considered a great honor and privilege to be invited to live on the Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there.

Prior to May 31, 2024, the university had dedicated housing for employees on Grounds. However, the University is considering new affordable housing proposals, one of which is located on the site of the current Piedmont Housing community.

==Organization and administration==
The university has several affiliated centers including the Rare Book School, headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, University of Virginia Center for Politics, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Miller Center of Public Affairs. The Fralin Museum of Art is dedicated to creating an environment where both the university community and the general public can study and learn from directly experiencing works of different art. The university has its own internal recruiting firm, the Executive Search Group and Strategic Resourcing. Since 2013, this department has been housed under the Office of the President.

In 2006, President Casteen announced an ambitious $3 billion capital campaign to be completed by December 2011. During the Great Recession, President Sullivan missed the 2011 deadline, and extended it indefinitely. The $3 billion goal would be met a year and a half later, which President Sullivan announced at graduation ceremonies in May 2013.

, UVA&#x27;s $1.4 billion academic budget is paid for primarily by tuition and fees (32%), research grants (23%), endowment and gifts (19%), and sales and services (12%). The university receives 10% of its academic funds through state appropriation from the Commonwealth of Virginia. For the overall (including non-academic) university budget of $2.6 billion, 45% comes from medical patient revenue. The Commonwealth contributes less than 6%.

UVA&#x27;s endowment is among the highest among universities in the United States. As of 2013, the University of Virginia was one of only two public universities in the United States that had a Triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies.

Although UVA is the flagship university of Virginia, state funding has decreased for several consecutive decades. Financial support from the state dropped by half from 12 percent of total revenue in 2001–02 to six percent in 2013–14. The portion of academic revenue coming from the state fell by even more in the same period, from 22 percent to just nine percent. This nominal support from the state, contributing just $154 million of UVA&#x27;s $2.6 billion budget in 2012–13, has led President Sullivan and others to contemplate the partial privatization of the University of Virginia. UVA&#x27;s Darden School and Law School are already self-sufficient.

Hunter R. Rawlings III, President of the prominent Association of American Universities research group of universities, came to Charlottesville to make a speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: &quot;there&#x27;s no possibility, as far as I can see, that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university&quot;. He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.

==Academics==
The University of Virginia offers 48 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 94 master&#x27;s degree programs, 55 doctoral degree programs, 6 educational specialist degree programs, and 2 first-professional degrees (Medicine and Law). UVA does not bestow honorary degrees.

===Scholarships===
The Jefferson Scholarship is the most competitive merit scholarship nationwide. Around 30 scholars are selected annually from a direct application pool of 4,500 nominating schools, each able to nominate only one student. Covering all tuition, books, room and board, the scholarship also provides scholars finances for summer enrichment, independent research and study abroad.

Echols Scholars (College of Arts and Sciences) and Rodman Scholars (School of Engineering and Applied Science), which include 5% of undergraduate students, receive no financial benefits, but are entitled to special advisors, priority course registration, residence in designated dorms and fewer curricular constraints than other students have.
Full tuition scholarships are given to each in-state student from families earning under $100,000 per year. Each in-state student from families earning under $50,000 per year also receives free room and board. These scholarships are initiatives of President Ryan, who announced them upon his inauguration in 2018.

===Research===
The University of Virginia is the first and longest serving public member of the Association of American Universities in the American South, attaining membership in 1904. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

According to the National Science Foundation, UVA spent $614 million on research and development in 2019, ranking it 44th in the nation and first in Virginia. Built in 1996, North Fork (formerly the UVA Research Park is an extensive 3.7-million square foot, 562 acre research park nine miles north of UVA&#x27;s North Grounds. It houses the UVA Applied Research Institute as well as many private R&amp;D efforts by such firms as Battelle, The MITRE Corporation, Signature Science, and CACI.

UVA is also home to globally recognized research on hypersonic flight for NASA and other organizations. The United States Air Force, National Science Foundation, and National Center for Hypersonic Combined Cycle Propulsion have each also granted UVA researchers millions in funding for the university&#x27;s ongoing broad and deep research into ultra-high velocity flight. Starting in 2015, a UVA team led by mechanical engineering professor Eric Loth began Department of Energy-funded research into an original design of offshore wind turbines that would potentially dwarf the size and scope of any being produced or researched anywhere else. The innovative design inspired by palm trees led to Loth being named to a &quot;Popular Science&quot; list of &quot;The Brilliant Minds Behind The New Energy Revolution&quot;.

UVA was recognized by &quot;Science&quot; as leading two of the top 10 scientific discoveries in the world in 2015. The first breakthrough was when UVA School of Medicine researchers Jonathan Kipnis and Antoine Louveau discovered previously unknown vessels connecting the human brain directly to the lymphatic system. The second breakthrough was when UVA psychology professor Brian Nosek examined the reproducibility of 100 psychology studies and found fewer than half could be reproduced. More than 270 researchers on five continents were involved, and twenty-two students and faculty from UVA were listed as co-authors on the scientific paper.

In the field of astrophysics, the university is a member of a consortium engaged in the construction and operation of the Large Binocular Telescope in the Mount Graham International Observatory of the Pinaleno Mountains of southeastern Arizona. It is also a member of both the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which operates telescopes at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy which operates the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the Gemini Observatory and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The University of Virginia hosts the headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Very Large Array radio telescope made famous in the Carl Sagan television documentary &quot;&quot; and film &quot;Contact&quot;. The North American Atacama Large Millimeter Array Science Center is also at the Charlottesville NRAO site. In 2019, researchers at NRAO co-authored a study documenting the discovery of a pair of giant hourglass shaped balloons emanating radio waves from the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

===Rankings===
As of the 2023 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks UVA&#x27;s undergraduate programs 24th among national universities overall. Its undergraduate business school, McIntire, is ranked 4th (and 1st among public universities) in the United States by the UK-based business school website &quot;Poets &amp; Quants&quot; as of 2023. In its (most recent as of 2024) undergraduate business school rankings of 2016, &quot;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&quot; ranked the McIntire School of Commerce, UVA&#x27;s undergraduate business program, 5th overall and 2nd among public universities. In its 2015 rankings, &quot;The Economist&quot; (which no longer produces rankings) listed Darden 2nd overall globally and 1st among public universities. In its 2024 ranking, &quot;Bloomberg.com&quot; ranks UVA as the #3 business school in the nation and 1st among public universities.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s 2024 rankings placed its law school fourth-best overall and 1st among public universities, its graduate Darden School of Business 10th nationally, the medical school 30th overall in the &quot;Research&quot; category, and the engineering school tied for 37th overall. The School of Education was ranked 8th in the nation. The specialization in special education, as well as in curriculum and instruction, were both ranked 4th in the nation. In the 2022 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the School of Education was ranked 8th in the world.

&quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked UVA 28th in its 2020 ranking of national universities based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting good public service. In its 2016 report, &quot;Business Insider&quot;, which strives to measure preparation for the professional workforce, ranked UVA ninth overall and first among public universities.

===Other recognition===
Reflecting a strong tradition of free speech dating back to Thomas Jefferson, UVA was ranked 1st by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in the 2025 Free Speech College Rankings, improving from a #6 ranking in 2024.

The University of Virginia has also been recognized for consistently having the highest African American graduation rate among national public universities. According to the Fall 2005 issue of &quot;Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot;, UVA &quot;has the highest black student graduation rate of the Public Ivies&quot; and &quot;by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates.&quot;

===Undergraduate admissions and financial aid===
For the undergraduate Class of 2027, the University of Virginia received a record 56,439 applications, admitting 16.2 percent. The early action acceptance rate was 27 percent for in-state Virginians and 12 percent for out-of-state applicants. The regular decision acceptance rate was 13 percent for in-state Virginians and 8 percent for out-of-state applicants. UVA is required, by Virginia state law, to matriculate two-thirds of its undergraduate student body from its pool of in-state applicants; it is barred, by Virginia state law, from giving admissions preference to the children of its alumni. Approximately 40 percent of those admitted to UVA are non-white. Matriculated students come from all 50 states and 147 foreign countries. The university has seen steady increases to its applicant pool in recent decades, and the number of applications has more than tripled since the Class of 2008 received 15,094 applications. Admission to the university is among the most selective in the United States among public universities. As of 2014, 93 percent of admitted applicants ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. For the Class of 2027, some 1,167 students were accepted after having had their application fees waived as either low-income or first-generation college students.

Admission is need-blind for domestic applicants. President James Ryan announced at his inauguration in fall 2018 that in-state students from families earning less than $80,000 a year will receive full tuition scholarships. Those from families earning less than $30,000 will also receive free room and board. The university already met 100 percent of demonstrated need for all admitted undergraduate students, making it one of only two public universities in the U.S. to reach this level of financial aid for its students. For 2014, the university ranked fourth overall by the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; for &quot;Great Financial Aid&quot;. In 2008 the Center for College Affordability and Productivity named UVA the top value among all national public colleges and universities; and in 2009, UVA was again named the &quot;No. 1 Best Value&quot; among public universities in the United States in a separate ranking by &quot;USA TODAY&quot; and the &quot;Princeton Review.&quot; &quot;Kiplinger&quot; in 2014 ranked UVA second out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation.

Graduate and professional school admissions are also highly selective. As of 2019, the average LSAT score was 169 at the School of Law, while at the Darden School of Business the average GMAT score was 718.

==Student life==

Student life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the university is referred to as the &quot;Grounds&quot;. Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years to reflect Jefferson&#x27;s belief that learning is a lifelong process, rather than one to be completed within four years.

===Student-faculty interaction and connections===
Professors are traditionally addressed as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; at UVA instead of &quot;Doctor&quot; (although medical doctors are the one exception) in deference to Jefferson&#x27;s desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. UVA facilitates close interactions between students and professors in a number of ways.

First-year students in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences have the opportunity to take two University Seminars, one per semester, which are later made available to other years students as well. These small classes, typically numbering from 4 to 19 students each, provide opportunities to work closely with professors at the university from the outset of a student&#x27;s academic career. The small groupings also help facilitate more frequent and intense discussions between students in this closer environment.

Select faculty live at Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, International Residential College, and in Pavilions on the Lawn. This living arrangement gives more opportunities for professors to invite students to lunches and dinners, which regularly happens, and creates chances for impromptu meetings and interactions between faculty and students around Grounds.

Reflecting this close student-faculty interaction at UVA, it welcomed Nobel Laureate William Faulkner to a position as &quot;Writer-in-Residence&quot; in 1957. He had no teaching responsibilities, and was paid merely to live among the students and write. He was badly injured in a horse riding accident in 1959, and did not return to the state before his death in 1962. Faulkner then bequeathed the majority of his papers to Shannon Library, giving UVA the largest Faulkner archives in the world.

===Global citizenship initiatives===
The International Residential College is a residential college at UVA that attracts and celebrates students from across the globe who choose to attend the university. It is one of the three major residential colleges at UVA. Students there come from 45 countries, representing 40% of the student population; but U.S. students are encouraged to live at the IRC as well to learn about the countries from which their classmates have journeyed to attend UVA.

UVA was previously the academic sponsor for Semester at Sea, a multi-country study abroad program conducted on a cruise ship.

The University of Virginia received the 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization, by the Association of International Educators. This award confirms the university&#x27;s success and commitment in educating its students on a global scale as well as nationally.

===Student leadership opportunities===
There are a number of UVA undergraduate leadership opportunities that are offered in addition to the standard student government or fraternity and sorority positions found at many other universities. They include UVA&#x27;s secret societies and debating societies, the student-run honor committees, and the chance to be recognized as a fourth-year student at the pinnacle of student leadership by being asked to live on the Lawn.

The Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, established in 2007, expands on these unique student leadership opportunities to study Leadership itself as a cross-disciplinary subject of focus and is closely aligned with many of the university&#x27;s schools, including the Architecture, Education, Engineering, Law, Medical, and Darden schools, as well as with programs in politics, economics, and applied ethics.

The University of Virginia has a long history of student activists who formed radical environmental, religious, and political groups to champion various social changes. An especially intense period of student activism occurred in the 1970s during the May Days strikes against the Vietnam War. More recently, the School of Education and Human Development and its Youth-Nex Center held a national conference in 2019 to promote student activism at UVA and beyond.

===Secret societies===


Student societies have existed on Grounds since the early twentieth century. Secret societies have been a part of University of Virginia student life since the first class of students in 1825. While the number of societies peaked during the 75-year period between 1875 and 1950, there are still six societies active that are over 100 years old, and several newer secret societies.

===Honor system===


The nation&#x27;s first codified honor system was instituted by UVA law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. in 1842, after a fellow professor was shot to death on the Lawn. There are three tenets to the system: students simply must not lie, cheat, or steal. For its first 180 years it was a &quot;single sanction system&quot;, meaning that committing any of these three offenses would result in immediate expulsion from the university. In the spring of 2022, following decades of criticism and waning support, a proposal to replace the penalty of expulsion with a two-semester suspension passed a student referendum with over 80% of the vote and took effect immediately.

The honor system is intended to be student-run and student-administered. If accused, students are tried before their peers—fellow students, never faculty, serve as counsel and jury. Although Honor Committee resources have been strained by mass cheating scandals such as a case in 2001 of 122 suspected cheaters over several years in a single large Physics survey course, and federal lawsuits have challenged the system, its verdicts are rarely overturned. There is only one documented case of direct UVA administration interference in an honor system proceeding: the trial and subsequent retrial of student Christopher Leggett.

===Student activities===
Many events take place at the University of Virginia, on the Lawn and across Grounds. One of the largest events at UVA is Springfest, hosted by the University Programs Council. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert, various inflatables, games. Another popular event and tradition is Lighting of the Lawn in the winter. Established in 2001 as a tribute to the September 11 Attacks, Lighting of the Lawn consists of a light and music show on the Lawn. Another popular event is Foxfield, a steeplechase and social gathering that takes place nearby in Albemarle County in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia, neighboring colleges, and local residents.

The student life building is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources. It also features several meeting rooms for student groups. Student Council, the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or &quot;StudCo&quot;, also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the University Programs Council and Class Councils. Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper &quot;The Declaration&quot;, &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot;, and the Consortium of University Publications.

In 2005, the university was named &quot;Hottest for Fitness&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, across the street from the Alderman Dorms. The University of Virginia sent more workers to the Peace Corps in 2006 and 2008 than any other &quot;medium-sized&quot; university in the United States. Volunteerism at the university is centered around Madison House which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville rather than allowing it to be discarded, among numerous other volunteer programs. Many students also choose to volunteer as emergency responders, the most common stations being Charlottesville Albemarle Rescue Squad (CARS) in the city of Charlottesville and Seminole Trail Volunteer Fire Department (STVFD) in Albemarle County.

As at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students. In 2005, concerns particularly arose about fourth-years consuming excessive alcohol during the day of the last home football game. President Casteen then announced a $2.5 million donation from Anheuser-Busch to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006. A spokesman said: &quot;the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students&quot;. On the other hand, the university was ranked first in &quot;Playboy&quot;″s 2012 list of Top 10 Party Schools based on ratings of sex, sports, and nightlife.

===Fraternities and sororities===
The University of Virginia has a number of fraternities and sororities on campus, encompassing the traditional social fraternities and sororities as well as coeducational professional, service, and honor fraternities. Social life at the university was originally dominated by debating societies. The first fraternity chapter founded at UVA was Delta Kappa Epsilon in 1852, and it was quickly followed by many more; the University of Virginia was the birthplace of two national fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha, which exist at the university as of 2023.

Through the twentieth century, the roles of these organizations on campus expanded to encompass social sororities, professional fraternities and sororities, service fraternities, honor societies, black fraternities and sororities, and multicultural fraternities and sororities. Roughly 30% of the student body are members of social fraternities and sororities, while additional students are involved with service, professional, and honor fraternities. &quot;Rush and pledging&quot; occur in the spring semester for most Greek organizations. Kappa Sigma and the Trigon Engineering Society hold reserved rooms on the Lawn, while Pi Kappa Alpha holds the only undergraduate room on the Range.

===Transportation===
A set of bus lines operated by the university&#x27;s University Transit Service connect different parts of the UVA Grounds with adjacent parking facilities. This is complemented by a set of bus lines operated by Charlottesville Area Transit that connect the University of Virginia with other parts of Charlottesville. The Virginia Department of Transportation maintains the roads through the university grounds as State Route 302.

Charlottesville Union Station is just from UVA, and from there Amtrak passenger trains serve Charlottesville on three routes: the &quot;Cardinal&quot; (Chicago to New York City), &quot;Crescent&quot; (New Orleans to New York City), and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; (Virginia to Boston). The long-haul &quot;Cardinal&quot; operates three times a week, while the &quot;Crescent&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; both run daily. Charlottesville–Albemarle Airport, away, has nonstop flights to Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Philadelphia. The larger Richmond International Airport is to the southeast, and the still larger Dulles International Airport is to the northeast. They are accessible via Interstate 64 and U.S. 29, respectively, both of which are major highways and frequently trafficked.

Megabus began serving Charlottesville with inexpensive direct express routes to and from Washington, D.C. in 2018. Megabus also runs up to four trips per day from Charlottesville to New York City with several stops between. Like the trains, the Megabus stop is at the nearby Amtrak station.

==Athletics==

Virginia has ranked near the top of collegiate athletics programs in recent years. In 2015 and 2019, UVA won the nationwide Capital One Cup for overall men&#x27;s sports excellence. The teams and athletes representing Virginia in college athletics have been dubbed the &quot;Cavaliers&quot; since 1923, predating the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers by nearly half a century.

In 2019, Virginia men&#x27;s basketball won the NCAA Championship in March Madness, the single-elimination national college basketball tournament considered by &quot;YouGov&quot; polled American viewers (as of the same year) to be the most exciting collegiate sporting event. In 2015, when Virginia first won its first Capital One Cup its teams won the 2014 College Cup, the 2015 College World Series, and the 2015 NCAA Tennis Championships. When it repeated the feat in 2019, the program won both the March Madness tournament and the 2019 Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship.

Virginia&#x27;s athletics director is Carla Williams, the first African American woman to hold the position at any power conference university. The previous athletics director was Craig Littlepage, the first African American to have that title in the ACC. He held the position for sixteen years and, under his leadership, UVA added many significant hires who have demonstrated success near the top of their respective sports, including recent NCAA Champions Tony Bennett, Lars Tiffany, Brian O&#x27;Connor, and Todd DeSorbo, as well as former football coach Bronco Mendenhall. Among coaches who have longer tenures, George Gelnovatch has won two NCAA men&#x27;s soccer national titles since 2009. Steve Swanson has led women&#x27;s soccer teams to six ACC titles and 24 consecutive winning seasons. Kevin Sauer has led UVA women&#x27;s rowing to two NCAA titles since 2010.

===Championships===
In the 21st century alone, UVA teams have won 18 NCAA championships. The men&#x27;s teams have won NCAA titles in basketball (2019); lacrosse (2003, 2006, 2011, 2019, and 2021); baseball (2015); soccer (2009 and 2014); and tennis (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2022, and 2023). UVA women have won recent NCAA titles in rowing (2010 and 2012) and swimming &amp; diving (2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024). The Cavaliers rank first in the ACC (a power conference) with 23 men&#x27;s NCAA Championships, and rank second in the conference with 11 women&#x27;s NCAA Championships.

Under Tony Bennett the Cavaliers have experienced a basketball renaissance, winning the 2019 NCAA Championship, winning the ACC tournaments of 2014 (over Duke) and 2018 (over North Carolina), and winning regular-season championships in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. UVA became the third program in ACC history to win 30 or more games in consecutive seasons and John Paul Jones Arena is considered one of the more intimidating trips for opposing teams to make. The women&#x27;s basketball program fell just short of its own NCAA Championship in 1990, losing the Championship Game in overtime.

The Virginia men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse programs are two of the most dominant in the history of the sport, winning ten of UVA&#x27;s twenty-nine NCAA Championships between them and two more (for a total of 11 recognized national championships) before NCAA oversight began. 2019 and 2021 NCAA champion men&#x27;s head coach Lars Tiffany has brought UVA back to prominence after Dom Starsia retired as the all-time ACC leader in men&#x27;s lacrosse wins. All three UVA head coaches in the position prior to Tiffany still rank (as of 2019) in the top 20 of career wins. Three-time NCAA champion head coach Julie Myers leads women&#x27;s lacrosse and under her guidance, Virginia is the only program to qualify for 24 straight NCAA tournament berths as of 2019.

The Cavalier baseball team under Brian O&#x27;Connor has also experienced tremendous success. UVA finished as national runners-up in the 2014 College World Series and came back to win the 2015 College World Series. Virginia has hosted five NCAA Super Regional tournament events at Davenport Field.

The UVA men&#x27;s tennis program won &quot;three-peat&quot; NCAA Championships in 2015–2017 after winning the Cavaliers&#x27; first in 2013. The team won back-to-back championships in 2022 and 2023. The program has regularly featured international talent combined with locally grown high school tennis talent from Virginia (often Northern Virginia).

The University of Virginia women&#x27;s cross country team won the 1981 and 1982 NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Cross Country Championship as well as the DI Indoor Championships.

The women&#x27;s swimming and diving team won its first NCAA Championship in 2021. The women repeated the feat in both 2022 and 2023.

===Rivalries===
Official ACC designated rivalry games include the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry and the Virginia–Louisville series. These two rivalries are guaranteed an annual game in all sports, and a home-and-away series in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. The Cavaliers competed against the Hokies in the &quot;Commonwealth Challenge&quot; and more recently competed in the &quot;Commonwealth Clash&quot;, under new rules, for many sports in which they compete head-to-head. The Cavaliers went 2–0 against the Hokies in the &quot;Challenge&quot; and 3–2 in the &quot;Clash&quot; (5–2 overall). Perhaps the two most significant rivalry games played between the Cavaliers and Hokies were both in men&#x27;s basketball, on March 1, 2007, and January 15, 2019. In the former, the two teams met with identical 10–4 ACC records and the winner would clinch a share of the regular-season conference championship. UVA won the game 69–56 and took their fifth of ten ACC titles. In the latter, No. 4 UVA beat No. 9 Virginia Tech 81–59 in the only meeting between two AP Top 10 teams in the rivalry&#x27;s history.

The ACC is often regarded as the best college basketball conference, and UVA leads the series in its official ACC basketball rivalries: against Virginia Tech 96–56, and Louisville 15–4, . A budding but lopsided series between Virginia&#x27;s Tony Bennett and Louisville&#x27;s Rick Pitino saw Bennett win 5 of 6 games before Pitino&#x27;s Hall of Fame career ended in scandal at Louisville. Other notable basketball rivalries include those against North Carolina and Maryland. Notably the 1982 ACC tournament championship game where Dean Smith had his team of future NBA stars (such as Michael Jordan and James Worthy) hold the ball for seven minutes, against a Virginia team featuring Ralph Sampson, led to the advent of the shot clock and the three-point line. The Maryland rivalry is now mostly dormant, but was reignited for the 2014 and 2018 editions of the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, with both Challenges won by the Cavaliers on the road in College Park.

Virginia men&#x27;s lacrosse, as one of the all-time great NCAA programs, has a championship rivalry with fellow ACC program Syracuse (the Cavaliers and Orange holding 18 NCAA Championships between them) as well as rivalries against Big Ten programs Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The Syracuse and Johns Hopkins rivalries are played out at least once each season (Syracuse played &quot;twice&quot; in 2021) with the teams often finding themselves facing off a second or third time in the ACC and NCAA tournaments. Virginia women&#x27;s lacrosse, also a multi-NCAA Championship program, maintains several of those same rivalries.

The Virginia football team competes against North Carolina in the South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry, a historic football rivalry game which a sitting President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, made time to attend in Charlottesville in 1924. The 1960s and 1970s were particularly dark decades for the football program, which later experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s under George Welsh. Coach Welsh led the program to its first bowl bids starting with the 1984 Peach Bowl. Welsh, who even reached AP No. 1 rankings for Virginia in October 1990, is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame after compiling the second-most wins in ACC history after Bobby Bowden. In a historic rivalry between two legendary coaches, Welsh finished two games up in the head-to-head series against Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, 8–6. He was also dominant against UNC in the South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry, finishing 13–5–1, including a perfect 10–0 record against North Carolina at Scott Stadium.

===Sponsorship===
In 2015, The Cavaliers negotiated a 10-year sponsorship deal with Nike, from which the program receives $3.5 million per year.

== People ==
=== Faculty ===

Faculty were originally housed in the Academical Village among the students, serving as both instructors and advisors, continuing on to include the McCormick Road Old Dorms, though this has been phased out in favor of undergraduate student resident advisors (RAs). Several of the faculty, however, continue the university tradition of living on Grounds, either on the Lawn in the various Pavilions, or as fellows at one of three residential colleges (Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, and the International Residential College).

The university&#x27;s faculty includes a National Humanities Medal and National Medal of Arts winner and former United States Poet Laureate, an awardee of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, 25 Guggenheim fellows, 26 Fulbright fellows, six National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, two Presidential Young Investigator Award winners, three Sloan award winners, three Packard Foundation Award winners, and a winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Physics professor James McCarthy was the lead academic liaison to the government in the establishment of Suranet, and the university has also participated in ARPANET, Abilene, Internet2, and Lambda Rail. On March 19, 1986, the university&#x27;s domain name, codice_1, became the first registration under the codice_2 top-level domain originating from the Commonwealth of Virginia on what would become the World Wide Web.

Larry Sabato has, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, become the most-cited professor in the country by national and regional news organizations, both on the Internet and in print. Civil rights activist Julian Bond, a professor in the Corcoran Department of History from 1990 to 2012, was the chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009 and was chosen to host the Nobel Laureates conference in 1998.
=== Alumni ===

, the University of Virginia has 221,000 living graduates. According to a study by researchers at the Darden School and Stanford University, UVA alumni have founded over 65,000 companies which have employed 2.3 million people worldwide with annual global revenues of $1.6 trillion. Extrapolated numbers show companies founded by UVA alumni have created 371,000 jobs in the state of Virginia alone. The relatively small amount that the Commonwealth gives UVA for support was determined by the study to have a tremendous return on investment for the state.

Rhodes Scholarships are international postgraduate awards given to students to study at the University of Oxford. Since the scholarship program began in 1904, UVA has had fifty-seven Rhodes Scholars, the most of any university in the American South, eighth-most overall, and third-most outside the Ivy League (behind Stanford University and the United States Military Academy (West Point)).

Eight NASA astronauts and launch directors are UVA alumni: Karl Gordon Henize, Bill Nelson, Thomas Marshburn, Leland Melvin, Jeff Wisoff, Kathryn Thornton, Patrick Forrester; and Michael Leinbach.

The Pulitzer Prize has been awarded to eight UVA alumni: Edward P. Jones, Ron Suskind, Virginius Dabney, Claudia Emerson, Henry Taylor, Lane DeGregory, George Rodrigue, and Michael Vitez.

Government leaders include 28th President of the United States Woodrow Wilson (who attended before transferring), former Special Counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller; NATO Secretary General Javier Solana; U.S. Speaker of the House Robert M. T. Hunter; widely known United States Senators Harry Byrd, Robert F. Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy; first African American Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court Leroy Hassell; Delaware Court of Chancery Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster; United States Supreme Court Justices Howell Edmunds Jackson, James Clark McReynolds, and Stanley Forman Reed; President of the Supreme Court of Israel, Asher Grunis; and Premier and President of the First Republic of China, Yan Huiqing.

Thirty U.S. state or U.S. territorial Governors have graduated from UVA, including fifteen Governors of Virginia, and fifteen Governors of other U.S. states and territories as well. 

UVA&#x27;s alumni ranks also include others who have achieved widespread fame: computer science pioneer John Backus; polar explorer Richard Byrd; scientists Walter Reed, Stuart Schreiber, Daniel Barringer, Richard Lutz, and Francis Collins; artists Edgar Allan Poe and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe; musicians Stephen Malkmus and Boyd Tinsley; self-made billionaire Paul Tudor Jones; national news anchors Katie Couric and Brit Hume; actors Tina Fey, Ben McKenzie, and Sarah Drew; Team USA Olympic team captains John Harkes, Dawn Staley, and Claudio Reyna; NBA All-Star MVP Ralph Sampson and the NBA&#x27;s eighth ever 50–40–90 shooter Malcolm Brogdon; two-time FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup champions Becky Sauerbrunn, Emily Sonnett and Morgan Brian; and voice actor Sam Riegel.

<text>Have Space Suit—Will Travel is a science fiction novel for young readers by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (August, September, and October 1958) and published by Scribner&#x27;s in hardcover in 1958. The last Heinlein novel to be published by Scribner&#x27;s, it was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1959 and won the Sequoyah Children&#x27;s Book Award for 1961. Heinlein&#x27;s engineering expertise enabled him to add realistic detail; during World War II, he had been a civilian aeronautics engineer at a laboratory which developed pressure suits for use at high altitudes.

==Plot summary==
In the near future, Earth has established some lunar bases. High school senior Clifford &quot;Kip&quot; Russell is determined to get to the Moon, but the price of a ticket is far beyond his reach. His unorthodox father suggests he enter an advertising jingle-writing contest; first prize is an all-expenses-paid trip there. Instead, he wins a used space suit. Kip puts the suit (which he names &quot;Oscar&quot;) back into working condition.

Kip reluctantly decides to return his space suit for a cash prize to help pay for college, but puts it on for one last walk. As he idly broadcasts on his shortwave radio, someone identifying herself as &quot;Peewee&quot; answers and requests a homing signal. He is shocked when a flying saucer lands practically on top of him. An 11-year-old girl (Peewee) and an alien being (the &quot;Mother Thing&quot;) flee from it, but all three are quickly captured and taken to the Moon.

Their kidnapper (&quot;Wormface&quot;) is a horrible-looking creature who contemptuously refers to all others as &quot;animals&quot;. Wormface has two human flunkies (&quot;Fats&quot; and &quot;Skinny&quot;) who assisted him in initially capturing the Mother Thing and Peewee, the latter a genius and the daughter of an eminent scientist. The Mother Thing speaks in what sounds like birdsong (illustrated by a few musical notations), but Kip and Peewee have no trouble understanding her.

Kip, Peewee, and the Mother Thing escape and try to reach the nearest human lunar base on foot, but they are recaptured and taken to a base on Pluto. Kip is thrown into a cell, later to be joined by Fats and Skinny, who have apparently outlived their usefulness. After Skinny is taken away, Fats tells Kip that his former employers eat humans, before he too disappears.

The Mother Thing, meanwhile, makes herself useful to their captors by constructing advanced devices for them. She manages to steal enough parts to assemble a bomb and a transmitter. The bomb takes care of all but one of the Wormfaces, and between them, Kip and Peewee deal with the last one. The Mother Thing freezes solid when she tries to set up the transmitter outside without a spacesuit. Kip puts Oscar on and activates the beacon, but becomes severely frostbitten in the extreme cold. Help arrives quickly. Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing are transported to Vega V, the Mother Thing&#x27;s home planet. 

Kip is kept in a state of cryopreservation while the Mother Thing&#x27;s people figure out how to heal him. It turns out that the Mother Thing is far hardier than Kip had suspected and freezing did not hurt her. While Kip recuperates, a Vegan anthropologist whom Kip nicknames &quot;Joe&quot; learns about Earth from Peewee and Kip. Once Kip is well, he, Peewee, and the Mother Thing travel to a planet in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, to face an intergalactic tribunal, composed of many advanced species that have banded together for self-protection.

The Wormfaces are put on trial first. Their representatives are so arrogantly xenophobic that they promise to destroy the &quot;animals&quot; who dared to try the &quot;Only People&quot;, and are judged to be dangerous. Their species is sentenced to have their planet &quot;rotated&quot; 90° out of the present space-time ... without their star, most likely dooming them to freezing to death.

Then it is humanity&#x27;s turn to be judged, as represented by Peewee, Kip, and two additional humans retrieved from different historical eras: Iunio (an ancient Roman centurion), and a Neanderthal man. The Neanderthal is rejected as being of another species. Iunio proves belligerent, but brave. Peewee&#x27;s and Kip&#x27;s recorded remarks are then admitted into evidence. In humanity&#x27;s defense, Kip makes an impassioned speech. The Mother Thing and a representative of another race argue that the short-lived species are essentially children who should be granted more time to learn and grow. It is decided to re-evaluate humanity after &quot;a dozen half-deaths of radium&quot; (19,200 years).

Kip and Peewee are returned to Earth with advanced alien devices and scientific equations provided by the Vegans to help the human race advance. Kip passes the information along to Professor Reisfeld, Peewee&#x27;s father. Reisfeld arranges a full scholarship for Kip at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Kip wants to study engineering and spacesuit design.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale wrote that the book &quot;is possibly the most unabashedly juvenile of Heinlein&#x27;s long list ... Great for kids, chancy for grownups who don&#x27;t identify readily with adolescent heroes&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, it was announced that &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer Harry Kloor had written a script for a film version and optioned the film rights. The film was expected to have come out in 2013, but as of the end of 2013 was still listed as &quot;in development&quot;.

<text>&quot;&#x27;—All You Zombies—&#x27;&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was written in one day, July 11, 1958, and first published in the March 1959 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; after being rejected by &quot;Playboy&quot;.

The story involves a number of paradoxes caused by time travel. In 1980, it was nominated for the Balrog Award for short fiction.

—All You Zombies— further develops themes explored by the author in a previous work: &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot;, published some 18 years earlier. Some of the same elements also appear later in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; (1985), including the Circle of Ouroboros and the Temporal Corps.

The unusual title of the story, which includes both the quotation marks and dashes shown above, is a quotation from a sentence near the end of the story; the quotation is taken from the middle of the sentence, hence the dashes indicating elided text before and after the title.

==Plot==
—All You Zombies— chronicles a young man (later revealed to be intersex) taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger, female self (before he was forced to undergo sexual reassignment surgery); he turns out to be the offspring of that union, with the paradoxical result that he is his own mother and father. As the story unfolds, all the major characters are revealed to be the same person, at different stages of their life.

===Narrative order of events===

The story involves an intricate series of time-travel journeys (see diagram). It begins with a young man speaking to the narrator, the Bartender, in 1970. The two of them relate in that both of them are from unmarried parents. The Bartender remarks that no one in his family ever gets married, including him. He wears an Ouroboros ring. The young man is called the Unmarried Mother, because he writes stories for confession magazines, many of them presumably from the point of view of an unmarried mother.

Cajoled by the Bartender, the Unmarried Mother explains why he understands the female viewpoint so well: he was born a girl, in 1945, and raised in an orphanage. While a fairly ugly teenager in 1963, she was seduced, impregnated, and abandoned by an older man. During the delivery of her child, doctors discovered she was intersex, with internalized male sex organs as well as female sex organs. Complications during delivery, by Caesarean section, rendered the female organs unviable and the physicians gave her a gender reassignment. The baby was kidnapped by a mysterious older gentleman, and not seen again. The Unmarried Mother then had to adjust to life as a man, despite an upbringing that left him unqualified for &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; jobs; he had planned to get into space as a sex worker for male workers and colonists. Instead, he used his secretarial skills to type manuscripts and eventually began writing.

Professing sympathy, the Bartender offers to take him to the abandoning seducer, whom the Unmarried Mother wishes revenge on. The Bartender guides him into a back room, where he (Bartender) uses a time machine to take them to 1963, and sets the young man loose. The Bartender goes forward eleven months, kidnaps a one-month-old baby, and takes her to 1945, leaving her at an orphanage. He returns to 1963 one month later and picks up the Unmarried Mother, who was instinctively attracted to his younger female self and has seduced and impregnated her. The Bartender nudges him to connect the dots and realize that the seducer, the young woman, the baby, and the time traveler are all &quot;him&quot;.

The Bartender then drops the Unmarried Mother in 1985 at an outpost of the Temporal Bureau, a time-traveling secret police force that manipulates events in history, to protect the human race. He has just created and recruited himself.

Finally, the Bartender returns to 1970, arriving a short time after he left the bar. He allows a customer to play &quot;I&#x27;m My Own Grandpa&quot; on the jukebox, having yelled at the customer for playing the song before he left. Closing the bar, he time travels again to his home base in 1993. As he beds down for a much-deserved rest, he contemplates the scar left over from the Caesarean section performed when he gave birth to his daughter, father, mother, and entire history. He thinks, &quot;I &quot;know&quot; where &quot;I&quot; came from—but &quot;where did all you zombies come from?&quot;

===Chronological order of events===
As the story is told as a disjointed point of view reference by several other points thereafter, this is the actual chronological history of &quot;Jane&quot; according to the story, although the story itself is still a classic example of a time paradox.

# On September 20, 1945, the Bartender drops off baby Jane at an orphanage. She grows up there. She dreams of joining one of the &quot;comfort organizations&quot; dedicated to providing R&amp;R for spacemen.
# Nearly 18 years later, the man who refers to himself as &quot;an unmarried mother&quot; is dropped off on April 3, 1963, by the Bartender. He meets and, after some weeks of dating, seduces and impregnates the 17-year-old Jane, who has an intersex condition. From Jane&#x27;s point of view, he then disappears. Actually, he has been retrieved by the Bartender, and taken to 1985 (see sixth bullet point).
# Jane learns that she is pregnant by the now-missing unknown man. On waking after giving birth by C-section, she is told she is intersex and has two full sets of reproductive organs, of which the female organs have developed fully, allowing her to have a child. She is told the female organs have been severely damaged by the pregnancy and birth; she learns that she has been subjected (without her consent) to a &quot;sex change&quot; using her male reproductive set, which reassigns her sex to male.
# On March 10, 1964, the Bartender kidnaps the baby and takes it back in time to the orphanage (see first bullet point). Jane, now male, becomes a stenographer, and then a writer. Whenever he is asked his occupation, he replies, somewhat truculently, &quot;I&#x27;m an unmarried mother—at four cents a word. I write confession stories.&quot; He becomes a regular at the bar where the narrator, the Bartender, works, but does not interact with him significantly for six years.
# On November 7, 1970, the Bartender meets the Unmarried Mother, yells at the customer playing &quot;I&#x27;m My Own Grandpa&quot;, conducts the Unmarried Mother into the back office, and takes him back to 1963 to &quot;find&quot; (and, ostensibly, get revenge upon) the man who got him pregnant (see second bullet point). He returns to the bar, seconds after going into the back room, and allows the customer to play the song. From his own point of view, he has carried out his mission of ensuring his own existence.
# On August 12, 1985, the Bartender travels to 1963 and retrieves the Unmarried Mother—whom he had left there and then during the events of the fifth (and second) bullet point(s)—to the Rocky Mountains base and enlists him (actually a younger version of himself) in the Temporal Bureau.
# On January 12, 1993, the Bartender, who is also Jane/mother/father/Unmarried Mother, arrives back at his base from 1970 to think about his life.

== Reception ==
Philosopher David Lewis considered —All You Zombies— and &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot; to be examples of &quot;perfectly consistent&quot; time travel stories. Stating that it and other Heinlein time-travel stories &quot;force the reader into contemplations of the nature of causality and the arrow of time&quot;, Carl Sagan listed —All You Zombies— as an example of how science fiction &quot;can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader&quot;. Stanisław Lem, in his monograph &quot;Science Fiction and Futurology&quot;, mentioned —All You Zombies— as an example of a minimal possible bootstrap paradox in SF.

== Film adaptation ==
The Spierig brothers directed the Australian science fiction film &quot;Predestination&quot; (2014) based on the story. The film starred Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook.

<doc id="59807" wikidata="Q3148480" url="?curid=59807" title="Blowups Happen">
<text>&quot;Blowups Happen&quot; is a 1940 science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It is one of two stories in which Heinlein, using only public knowledge of nuclear fission, anticipated the actual development of nuclear technology a few years later. The other story is &quot;Solution Unsatisfactory&quot;, which is concerned with a nuclear weapon, although it is only a radiological &quot;dirty bomb&quot;, not a nuclear explosive device.

The story was first published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in 1940, before any nuclear reactors had ever been built, and for its appearance in the 1946 anthology &quot;The Best of Science Fiction,&quot; Heinlein made some modifications to reflect how a reactor actually worked. In the omnibus &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Blowups Happen&quot; is referred to as a 1940 story, but it mentions Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reflecting revisions made in 1946.

The story made a later appearance in &quot;The Worlds of Robert A. Heinlein&quot;, a collection of short stories published in 1966. It also appears in his &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; in 1980, but here it appears as it did in &quot;Astounding&quot; in 1940 and Heinlein writes in an introduction to the story: &quot;I now see, as a result of the enormous increase in the art in 33 years, more errors in the &#x27;46 version than I spotted in the &#x27;40 version when I checked it in &#x27;46&quot;.

The story is one of the earliest in Heinlein&#x27;s Future History chronology, taking place in the late 20th century.

==Plot==
The story describes the tensions among the staff of a nuclear reactor, described as a uranium-powered pile. Heinlein&#x27;s concept of a nuclear reactor was one of a barely contained explosion, not the steady-state thermal plants developed later. As a consequence, the work is dangerous, and the slightest mistake could be catastrophic. By the time the story starts, all the technical staff are monitored by psychologists who have the authority to remove them from the work at any time lest they crack under the pressure and precipitate a disaster. The monitoring itself contributes to the problem of stress.

The supervisor calls up Dr. Lentz, a fictional student of Alfred Korzybski, to analyze the situation. Lentz determines that there is little to be done, and the reactor will have to be shut down. Another consultant, Captain Harrington of the United States Naval Observatory, arrives as Lentz is preparing to return home. Harrington has discovered that the calculations on the reactor have greatly underestimated the scale of the destruction, should the reactor go out of control, and proposes that the cratering of the moon is due to an extinct civilization that destroyed itself in such a manner. The situation seems hopeless, as the energy produced by the reactor is sorely needed on Earth, oil having become too scarce and valuable to use for fuel.

In a parallel subplot, some researchers have discovered a way to blend two isotopes that both solves safety problems and allows for nuclear-powered rockets. Using a method called &quot;calculus of statement&quot;, the team uses this discovery, taking into account the social, psychological, physical, and economic variables pressuring the reactor to remain online, and concludes that the reactor should be launched into space to produce the new fuel, which would then be returned to Earth and burned safely in different reactors. The main reactor being in space removes the danger of planetary catastrophe but, by breeding the new fuel, still allows it to produce the needed energy.

The protagonists have difficulty convincing the board of directors for the reactor of this plan. However, Lentz, speaking for the local manager, finally gets the point across. Lentz explains the danger of the current situation factually, but at their continued refusal, threatens them with public vilification by taking the issue public, while also offering to ennoble them should they shut it down. Finally relenting, a rocket is quickly built. A man goes crazy just as they finish, but is stopped. The reactor is shut down in preparation for being moved.

In Heinlein&#x27;s Future History, the next story sequentially is &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;, in which the reactor indeed explodes in space. The actual cause was the detonation of the service rocket&#x27;s fuel, caused by the effects of cosmic radiation on the supposedly stable nuclear material.

==Reception==
In 2016, the story was nominated for the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novelette.

<doc id="59808" wikidata="Q2786211" url="?curid=59808" title="By His Bootstraps">
<text>&quot;By His Bootstraps&quot; is a 20,000 word science fiction novella by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It plays with some of the inherent paradoxes that would be caused by time travel.

The story was published in the October 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; under the pen name Anson MacDonald; the same issue has &quot;Common Sense&quot; under Heinlein&#x27;s name. &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot; was reprinted in Heinlein&#x27;s 1959 collection &quot;The Menace From Earth&quot;, and in several subsequent anthologies, and is now available in at least two audio editions. Under the title &quot;The Time Gate&quot;, it was also included in a 1958 Crest paperback anthology, &quot;Race to the Stars&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
In 1952, Bob Wilson locks himself in his room to finish his graduate thesis on a mathematical aspect of metaphysics, using the concept of time travel as a case in point. Bob does not care much at this point whether his thesis (that time travel is impossible) is valid; he is desperate for sleep and just wants to get it done and typed up by the deadline the next day to become an academic, since he thinks academia beats working for a living. Suddenly, although Bob had locked himself alone in his room, someone says, “Don’t bother with it. It&#x27;s a lot of utter anyhow.&quot; The interloper, who looks strangely familiar, and to whom Bob takes a dislike, calls himself &quot;Joe&quot;, and explains that he has come from the future through a Time Gate, a circle about in diameter in the air behind Joe. Joe tells Bob that great opportunities await him through the Gate and thousands of years in his future. By way of demonstration, Joe tosses Bob&#x27;s hat into the Gate. It disappears.

Bob is reluctant. Joe plies him with drink, which Joe (a stranger, from Bob&#x27;s point of view) inexplicably retrieves from its hiding place in Bob&#x27;s apartment, and Bob becomes intoxicated. Bob&#x27;s talk with Joe is interrupted by odd phone calls, first from a man who sounds familiar, and then from his sometime girlfriend, who gets upset when Bob says he hasn&#x27;t seen her recently. Finally, Joe is about to manhandle Bob through the Gate when another man appears, one who looks very much like Joe. The newcomer does not want Bob to go. During the ensuing fight, Bob gets punched, sending him through the Gate.

He recovers his senses in a strange place. A somewhat older-looking, bearded man explains that he is some 30,000 years in the future. The man, calling himself Diktor, treats Bob to a sumptuous breakfast served by beautiful women, one of whom Bob speaks of admiringly. Diktor immediately gives that woman to Bob as a slave. Diktor explains that humans in the future are handsome, cultured in a primitive fashion, but much more docile and good natured than their ancestors. An alien race, the High Ones, built the Gate and refashioned humanity into compliant slaves, but the High Ones are gone now, leaving a world where a 20th-century &quot;go-getter&quot; can make himself king.

Diktor asks him to go back through the Gate and bring back the man he finds on the other side. Bob agrees. Stepping through, he finds himself back in his own room, watching himself typing his thesis. Without much memory of what happened before, he reenacts the scene, this time from the other point of view, and calling himself &quot;Joe&quot; so as not to confuse his earlier self. Just as he is about to shove Bob through the Gate, another version of himself shows up. The fight happens as before, and Bob goes through the Gate.

His future self claims that Diktor is just trying to tangle them up so badly that they can never get untangled, but Joe goes through and meets Diktor again. Diktor gives him a list of things to buy in his own time and bring back. A little annoyed by Diktor&#x27;s manner, Bob argues with him, but eventually returns to the past, back in his room once again.

He lives through the same scene for the third time, then realizes that he is now free of Diktor. Bob ponders the nature of the 20th-century society he lives in, finding it seedy and depressing. He is sure he no longer has time to finish his thesis, but it is obviously incorrect anyway, so he decides he will go back to the future through the Time Gate. While setting the Gate, he finds two things beside the controls: his hat, and a notebook containing translations between English words and the language of Diktor&#x27;s slaves. He returns to his own time and collects the items on Diktor&#x27;s list, which seem to be things a 20th-century man could find useful in making himself king in the future, intentionally writing a bad check for the purchases, after persuading the cashier that the check is good. He then visits a woman he had been dating, but has begun to dislike, and has his way with her, smugly intending to never see her again, and leaving his hat in her apartment. He phones his past self as a prank, quickly hanging up. After returning to the future, he adjusts the Gate to send himself back to a point ten years earlier, to give himself time to establish himself as the local chieftain. Thus he hopes to preempt Diktor&#x27;s influence, charting his own course instead.

He sets himself up as chief, taking precautions against the arrival of Diktor. He adopts the name Diktor, which is simply the local word for &quot;chief.&quot; He experiments with the Time Gate, hoping to see the High Ones. Once, he does catch a glimpse of one and has a brief mental contact with it. The experience is so traumatizing that he runs away screaming, for the creature feels such sadness and other deep emotions that a 20th-century go-getter like Bob cannot bear it. He forces himself to return long enough to shut down the Gate, then stays away from it for more than two years. He does not notice that his hair has begun to whiten prematurely, as a result of the stress and shock. Having worn out the notebook through long use, he copies its text into a new, identical, one.

One day, upon setting the Gate to view his old room in the past, he sees three versions of himself in a familiar arrangement. Shortly, his earliest self comes through. The circle has closed. &quot;He&quot; is Diktor—the only Diktor there ever was. Wondering who actually compiled the notebook, Diktor prepares to brief Bob, who has to orchestrate events to ensure his own past.

<text>&quot;Coventry&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, part of his Future History series. It was first published in the July 1940 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and later collected into the book &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot; in 1953. The title is inspired by the British idiom &quot;to send someone to Coventry&quot;. In 2017, the story won the Prometheus Hall of Fame award.

==Plot summary==
In a future American society, everyone must accept the Covenant of non-violence, and psychologists can &quot;cure&quot; criminal or violent personality traits. The protagonist, David MacKinnon, is a romantic idealist who has been convicted of assault, and the court determines he is a substantial risk to commit violence in the future. He must accept treatment to remove his violent tendency, or be exiled to &quot;Coventry&quot;, the area allocated to those who reject the Covenant or commit crimes and refuse psychological treatment, enclosed by an impassable electric field (the &quot;Barrier&quot;).
MacKinnon chooses to emigrate to escape what he sees as the boredom of a too-civilized society. But he discovers that Coventry is not the peaceful anarchy he envisioned. It is actually a bleak dystopia split into three separate &quot;countries&quot;:

* New America, a corrupt democracy with a dysfunctional judicial system, that lies closest to Coventry&#x27;s entry point and is the most populous of the three nations.
* The ironically named Free State, an absolute dictatorship ruled by the &quot;Liberator&quot; with an even harsher penal system, a nation frequently at war with New America though not at the time of the story.
* The Angels, remnants of the theocracy from &quot;&quot;If This Goes On—&quot;&quot;, in the hills north of New America, living under a new &quot;Prophet Incarnate&quot;—it is implied they are the least populous of the three.

On arrival in New America, MacKinnon is arrested and jailed, and loses everything he had brought with him through the Barrier. He is befriended by fellow inmate &quot;Fader&quot; Magee, and they break out of jail. MacKinnon learns that New America and the Free State have discovered how to breach the Barrier and are combining forces to attack the outside society. He and Fader break out of Coventry separately to warn of the imminent attack. In the outside world, MacKinnon learns that Fader is actually a government agent. Also, by risking his life for the good of the country, he has shown he is free of criminal tendencies and no longer needs therapy.

==Influence on Dianetics==
On March 8, 1949, fellow science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard wrote to Heinlein referencing Coventry as an influence on what would become Dianetics:

<text>&quot;[[Delilah]] and the Space Rigger&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. One of his Future History stories, it originally appeared in &quot;Blue Book&quot; in December 1949 and was reprinted in his collection, &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;).

&quot;Delilah and the Space Rigger&quot; is one of Heinlein&#x27;s stories with a typically strong, smart, capable (for the American science fiction market of the time) female protagonist.

==Plot summary==
Brooks McNye, a communications engineer, wangles a job as a radio technician (concealing her first name, Gloria) and joins the all-male crew of construction workers building a space station. On arrival, she is immediately confronted by &quot;Tiny&quot; Larsen, the hard-boiled construction superintendent, who had not realized she was female. He does not want women &quot;sniffing around my boys&quot; and orders her returned on the next shuttle, only to be forced by circumstances to keep her. Larsen is constantly putting his foot in his mouth with remarks like, &quot;Mind what [Hammond] tells you. He&#x27;s a good man,&quot; only to hear a brisk, &quot;I know, I trained him.&quot; In the end, he is forced to admit that having a woman on the team has improved morale and efficiency, and he decides to stop discriminating on the basis of sex. He also asks that a chaplain be assigned to the station, reasoning, &quot;under the new policy we may need one anytime.&quot;

<doc id="59813" wikidata="Q5533742" url="?curid=59813" title="Gentlemen, Be Seated!">
<text>&quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was first published in the May 1948 issue of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine. It was later included in two of Heinlein&#x27;s collections, &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot; (1967).

==Plot summary==

The story tells of a visit to a tunnel on the surface of the Moon which goes awry when a pressure seal fails, trapping three men (a supervisor, a reporter, and a tunnel worker). The title of the story derives from the way they plug an air leak while awaiting rescue: by sitting on it.

The phrase &quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated!&quot; is the opening line of the interlocutor in a traditional minstrel show. It was also, at the time the story was written and while Heinlein attended, the opening line for all classes at the military and naval academies (as well as classes for officers at the various service schools) in the United States.

The story might have been inspired by an episode in &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot;: The ship sprung a leak. It was my good fortune to discover it first. I found it a large hole about a foot diameter. ... This noble vessel was preserved, with all its crew, by a most fortunate thought! in short, I sat down over it. ... My situation, while I sat there, was rather cool, but the carpenter&#x27;s art soon relieved me.

<doc id="59814" wikidata="Q4177203" url="?curid=59814" title="&quot;If This Goes On—&quot;">
<text>&quot;If This Goes On—&quot; is a science fiction novella by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first serialized in 1940 in &quot;Astounding Science-Fiction&quot; and revised and expanded to novel length for inclusion in the 1953 collection &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot;. The story shows what might happen to Christianity in the United States with mass communications, applied psychology, and a hysterical populace. The story is part of Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot; series.

At the 2016 WorldCon the story won the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novella of 1940.

== Plot ==
The story is set in a future theocratic American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian &quot;Prophets.&quot; The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned President (elected in 2012), then dictator (no elections were held in 2016 or later).

John Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet&#x27;s capital of New Jerusalem. He had been devout, but he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet&#x27;s Virgins, Sister Judith. New to the vocation, Judith faints when she is called upon to submit sexually to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not shocked but even assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy. They are left with no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith&#x27;s friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal while they remain on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her but leave enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest thanks to a clandestine distress signal, which John managed to leave for Zeb while he is arrested.

Judith is spirited out of the country before John regains consciousness, and John is given a false identity to make his way to Cabal headquarters. He is detected en route, forced to flee, and arrives safely after several misadventures. He finds that Zeb and Magdalene, who he assumes are a couple, have made their way there before him. All take on significant roles in bringing to fruition the revolutionary plot, John as an aide to the commander, General Huxley.

Working there, John receives a literal &quot;Dear John&quot; letter from Judith that informs him of her impending marriage to a Mexican man she met while she was taking refuge in his country. He learns that Zeb and Magdalene have no marriage plans, as their strong personalities would inevitably clash, and he begins a romance with Magdalene.

The revolutionary plot is mostly successful, and the country other than New Jerusalem is seized. However, the capital must also be conquered to prevent it from serving as a rallying point for loyalists. Even as constitutional discussions go on, the new regime&#x27;s troops, tempered to provide the greatest possible individual freedom (that is the origin of the &#x27;Covenant&#x27; mentioned in other Heinlein works), prepare to take New Jerusalem. John and Magdalene are married just before the assault.

During the fight, Huxley is wounded, and John must take over temporary command though he is not entitled by rank to do so. He gives the orders that bring victory. He then turns over command to the senior unwounded general and leads a squad invading the Prophet&#x27;s private quarters. They find that he has been viciously killed by his own Virgins.

==Freemasonry==
The Cabal uses terminology associated with Freemasonry, and there are hints that the Masons are actually one of the groups involved in the loosely organized revolt against the government. (Heinlein himself was not a Mason, but he had considered joining the Masons as a young man.)

==Critical reception==
Damon Knight in his 1967 book &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot; wrote of the novella:

Revolution... has always been a favorite theme in science fiction. It&#x27;s romantic, it&#x27;s reliable, and—as a rule—it&#x27;s as phony as a Martian princess.

Who but Heinlein ever pointed out, as he does here in detail, that a modern revolution is big business? And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny?

A reviewer for &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2024 called the novel &quot;a peculiar mixture of pulpy action and political theorising&quot;. He noted that the novel version included extensive postscript by the author explaining his concerns. He quoted Heinlein words from it:

There is a latent deep strain of religious fanaticism in [America]; it is rooted in our history and it has broken out many times in the past…[T]here has been a sharp rise in strongly evangelical sects in this country in recent years, some of which hold beliefs theocratic in the extreme, anti-intellectual, anti-scientific, and anti-libertarian…The capacity of the human mind for swallowing nonsense and spewing it forth in violent and repressive action has never yet been plumbed.

In academia, the story has been analyzed as an early critique (in science fiction) of &quot;religion as a manipulative, hegemonic social tool&quot;, and argued to be an example of a feminist critique of religion. It has also been mentioned as one of the first portrayals of fictional religion in sci-fi.

==Connections with other works by Heinlein==

While set in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot;, the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; that during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate) and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. Lazarus Long specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum mostly on Venus when the Prophets ruled the United States, and space travel was forbidden.

The story also depicts the start of the negotiations that would lead to the Covenant, the somewhat-idealized basis for government depicted in &quot;Coventry&quot;, &quot;Misfit&quot;, and &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;.

Scudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; and would be again later on in Heinlein&#x27;s final novel, &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;. A story about the rise of Scudder, &quot;The Sound of His Wings&quot;, is contained in the &quot;Future History&quot; timeline but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot;: &quot;I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much.&quot; Also, a story called &quot;The Stone Pillow&quot;, which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written; Heinlein noted that there was &quot;too much tragedy in real life.&quot;

The 1940 version of &quot;If This Goes On—&quot; was believed to be Heinlein&#x27;s first novel until the unpublished work &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot; was discovered in 2003. The earlier unpublished novel also features a Nehemiah Scudder who comes very close to gaining power but is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.

Ward Carson wrote: &quot;In &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;, space colonization waits until the end of the twenty-first century and Scudder is defeated; in the &quot;Future History&quot; it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the twentieth century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic&#x27;s hands.&quot;

<text>&quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Back!&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. One of his Future History stories, it was first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the July 26, 1947 issue and later reprinted in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;).

==Plot summary==
A physical chemist and his wife (the MacRaes), who have been in residence in Luna City on the Moon for some time, spend much of their time volubly regretting having ever left Earth. When this attitude results in social conflict with &quot;Loonies&quot; who love their home, the couple feels isolated, misunderstood, and put-upon. They decide to return to &quot;dirt-side&quot;, only to discover that the Earth of their imaginations bears only the faintest of resemblances to the actuality, which includes things unheard of in Luna, like smog, unpleasant weather, the common cold, and repairmen who refuse to make house calls. Ultimately, they discover that all they really want is to go back to Luna City, where they are welcomed with open arms by their peers (now that they have realized that the Moon is &quot;home&quot; after all) and settle down to be happy &quot;Lunatics&quot;.

<text>&quot;Life-Line&quot; is a short story by American author Robert A. Heinlein. Published in the August 1939 edition of &quot;Astounding&quot;, it was Heinlein&#x27;s first published short story.

The protagonist, Professor Hugo Pinero, builds a machine that will predict how long a person will live. It does this by sending a signal along the world line of a person and detecting the echo from the far end. Professor Pinero&#x27;s invention has a powerful impact on the life insurance industry, as well as on his own life.

Pinero is mentioned in passing in the novels &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; and &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; when the practically immortal Lazarus Long mentions having been examined and being sent away because the machine is &quot;broken&quot;.

==Writing history==
Heinlein was motivated to write the story by an editorial in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; magazine, in which Hugo Gernsback wrote that he wanted to foster new talent in the field, and that &quot;We shall endeavor to present one amateur writer&#x27;s story in each forthcoming issue [...] until further notice.&quot; &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;&#x27;s rate at the time was 0.5¢ per word. After Heinlein had written the 7,000-word story, he submitted it first to a rival magazine, &quot;Astounding&quot;, which paid 1¢ per word. &quot;Astounding&quot; bought the story, and at their higher rate, Heinlein was paid $70 ().

According to Virginia Heinlein&#x27;s introductory biography of her husband in &quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot;, upon receiving the check for the story Heinlein reportedly said, &quot;How long has this racket been going on?&quot; Later, Heinlein&#x27;s authorized biography included a version of the story in which &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; had advertised a $50 contest. The first known version of this story appeared in a 1985 interview published in &quot;Xignals&quot;, a science fiction newsletter.

&quot;Life-Line&quot; was later collected in &quot;The Worlds of Robert A. Heinlein&quot; (1966), &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; (1980), and in a Baen edition of &quot;The Man Who Sold The Moon&quot; (1987).

==Reception==
One particular paragraph from &quot;Life-Line&quot; is often quoted in reference to (and criticism of) modern intellectual property rights:

In the realm of science another passage has come to be quoted:

A television web series loosely based on the short story began in 2017.

<doc id="59818" wikidata="Q6667471" url="?curid=59818" title="Logic of Empire">
<text>&quot;Logic of Empire&quot; is a science fiction novella by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Part of his Future History series, it originally appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (March 1941) and was collected in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;).

==Plot summary==
Two well-off Earth men are arguing about whether there is slavery on Venus, and one of them gets shanghaied there, or so he believes; they later find out that they have bet one another about the topic, gotten drunk, and signed on. Upon his arrival, he finds his contract sold to a farmer. His discovery that it will take him years to work off his debt is compounded by his realization that he cannot get to sleep at night without &quot;rhira&quot;, an expensive local narcotic, which thus increases his debt every day.

==Themes==
Ostensibly a tale about a man in the wrong place at the wrong time and his struggle to free himself from the oppressive circumstances in which he is plunged, the story also attempts to explain how slavery develops in a new colony. Even in the future, the technology available to a new colony is always initially low. If a machine to do a necessary job is too expensive to import (say a wheat harvester, a water pump, or even a washing machine), a human must do it instead. If too many jobs must be done by hand, and there is a shortage of labor compared with independent resources that free labor could take up (&quot;land&quot; although that condition is not clear in the story), a market for slavery develops. Decades later, while there is still an abundance of land, this market remains because the colony itself has quotas to meet and debts to repay and cannot spare the resources to develop local industries to make the machines itself, and free labor does not have to bid its price down enough to outcompete slave labor.

Throughout the story, Heinlein takes the view of the objective narrator in describing Venusian society. &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; places different rationales on the people who participate in slavery. There are no real villains; everybody is just doing their job of trying to maximize income in a mercantilist system. Even the plantation owner who owns the hero is portrayed as a struggling and failing small businessman, whose main motivation is to secure a livelihood for his daughter.

==Nehemiah Scudder==
There is in the story a casual reference to the rise of the fanatic preacher Nehemiah Scudder, who would eventually be elected president and establish a theocratic dictatorship which would rule the US for several generations. Heinlein considered writing a story focusing on his rise, which would have had the name &quot;The Sound of His Wings&quot; and chronologically followed directly upon &quot;Logic of Empire.&quot; He never did so, and a great gap was left in the Future History which resumes with the overthrow of the theocracy in &quot;If This Goes On—&quot;.
As an aside, Heinlein himself said he felt that 3 books would need to be devoted to Scudder to tell the story fully and he couldn’t stand the guy enough to spend that much time with him.

<doc id="59823" wikidata="Q6875402" url="?curid=59823" title="Misfit (short story)">
<text>&quot;Misfit&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was originally titled &quot;Cosmic Construction Corps&quot; before being renamed by the editor John W. Campbell and published in the November 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. &quot;Misfit&quot; was Heinlein&#x27;s second published story. One of the earliest of Heinlein&#x27;s Future History stories, it was later included in the collections &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot; and &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;.

==Plot summary==
A coming-of-age story that follows Andrew Jackson Libby, a boy from Earth with extraordinary mathematical ability but meager education. Finding few opportunities on Earth, he joins the &quot;Cosmic Construction Corps&quot;, a future military-led version of the US Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps employing out-of-work youth to construct the infrastructure needed to colonize the Solar System. With a group of other inexperienced young men he is assigned to a ship traveling to the asteroid belt, where their task is to build a base on an asteroid and then move it into a more convenient orbit between Earth and Mars. Libby comes to the Captain&#x27;s attention during the process of blasting holes in the asteroid for rocket engines when Libby realizes that a mistake has been made in calculating the size of the charge, preventing a catastrophic blast. He is assigned to the ship&#x27;s astrogation computer. During the move to the destination orbit, the computer malfunctions, and Libby takes over, performing all the complex calculations in his head. The asteroid is settled successfully into its final orbit.

&quot;Slipstick&quot; Libby became one of Heinlein&#x27;s recurring characters and would later appear in several works associated with Lazarus Long, among them &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;.

The story includes one of the earliest uses of the term &quot;space marines&quot;.

<text>&quot;Ordeal in Space&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally published in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, May 1948. It is one of Heinlein&#x27;s Future History stories, and appears in his collection &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;.

==Plot summary==
A spaceship&#x27;s crewman is called to repair an antenna while his ship is still underpinned. He is unable to hold on, despite supreme effort; he drifts away from the ship and has far too much time to ponder things. When he returns to Earth, he is unable to work as a spaceman and has a fear of heights. After living in fear and sadness for a time, he must face his troubles while rescuing a kitten stuck on the 35th-floor ledge of a building.

Heinlein includes a variant verse to the hymn &quot;Eternal Father, Strong to Save&quot;, dedicated &quot;to those who venture into space,&quot; in the story. Originally titled &quot;Broken Wings&quot;, the story was rejected by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. A reading of this story was broadcast on BBC Radio 7 on July 14, 2007.

<doc id="59826" wikidata="Q7314838" url="?curid=59826" title="Requiem (short story)">
<text>&quot;Requiem&quot; is a short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, a sequel to his science fiction novella &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;, although it was in fact published several years earlier than that story, in &quot;Astounding&quot;, January 1940. The story was also performed as a play on October 27, 1955, on the NBC Radio Network program &quot;X Minus One&quot;.

It is also the first story in the retrospective &quot;Requiem: New Collected Works by Robert A. Heinlein and Tributes to the Grand Master&quot;.

==Plot==
The story centers around D. D. Harriman, the lead character of &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;. Harriman, a tycoon and latter-day robber baron, had always dreamed of going to the Moon, and had spent much of his career and resources making space flight a practical commercial enterprise. Unfortunately, his business partners prevented him from taking the early flights because they could not risk the public face of their company. Now an old man, Harriman has still not been to the Moon, a fact that frustrates him, since he lives in a world where space travel is so commonplace that carnivals have their own barnstorming spacecraft. Although no longer bound by his contractual obligations, he is now too old to pass the medical examination needed for space travel.

Very wealthy, Harriman bribes two spacemen to help him get to the Moon after encountering them at a funfair in Butler, a small town outside Kansas City, Missouri (and Heinlein&#x27;s birthplace), where they sell rides on their old, somewhat run-down ship.

The three of them fight many obstacles, including Harriman&#x27;s heirs, who want him declared mentally incompetent or senile before he can spend their inheritance. In the end, Harriman finally makes it to the Moon, only to die on the surface soon after landing, content at finally having reached his goal. His body is left there, with his epitaph scrawled on the tag from an oxygen bottle. It is Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s:

<doc id="59827" wikidata="Q946042" url="?curid=59827" title="Searchlight">
<text>A searchlight (or spotlight) is an apparatus that combines an extremely bright source (traditionally a carbon arc lamp) with a mirrored parabolic reflector to project a powerful beam of light of approximately parallel rays in a particular direction. It is usually constructed so that it can be swiveled about. The most common element used in modern searchlights is Xenon (Xe). However, Rare-earth elements such as lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce) are used in phosphors to improve light quality in some specialized searchlights.

== Military use ==

The first use of searchlights using carbon arc technology occurred during the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. The Royal Navy used searchlights in 1882 to dazzle and prevent Egyptian forces from manning artillery batteries at Alexandria. Later that same year, the French and British forces landed troops under searchlights.

By 1907 the value of searchlights had become widely recognized. One recent use was to assist attacks by torpedo boats by dazzling gun crews on the ships being attacked. Other uses included detecting enemy ships at greater distances, as signaling devices, and to assist landing parties. Searchlights were also used by battleships and other capital vessels to locate attacking torpedo boats and were installed on many coastal artillery batteries for aiding night combat. They saw use in the Russo-Japanese War from 1904–05.

Searchlights were installed on most naval capital ships from the late 19th century through WWII, both for tracking small, close-in targets such as torpedo boats, and for engaging enemy units in nighttime gun battles. The Imperial Japanese Navy especially was known for its intensive development of nighttime naval combat tactics and extensive training. The War in the Pacific saw a number of nocturnal engagements fought by searchlight, particularly the Battle of Savo Sound at Guadalcanal. Although searchlights remained in use throughout the war, the newly developed radar proved to be a far more effective locating device, and Japanese radar development lagged far behind that of the US.

=== First World War ===

Searchlights were first used in the First World War to create &quot;artificial moonlight&quot; to enhance opportunities for night attacks by reflecting searchlight beams off the bottoms of clouds, a practice which continued in the Second World War. The term &quot;artificial moonlight&quot; was used to distinguish illumination provided by searchlights from that provided by natural moonlight, which was referred to as &quot;movement light&quot; in night-time manoeuvers. Searchlights were also heavily used in the defense of the UK against German nighttime bombing raids using Zeppelins.

=== Second World War ===
Searchlights were used extensively in defense against nighttime bomber raids during the Second World War. Controlled by sound locators and radars, searchlights could track bombers, indicating targets to anti-aircraft guns and night fighters and dazzling crews.
Searchlights were occasionally used tactically in ground battles. One notable occasion was the Red Army use of searchlights during the Battle of the Seelow Heights in April 1945. 143 searchlights were directed at the German defence force, with the aim of temporarily blinding them during a Soviet offensive, begun with the largest artillery bombardment the world had ever seen until that point. However, the morning fog diffused the light and silhouetted the attacking Soviet forces, making them clearly visible to the Germans. The Soviets suffered heavy losses as a result and were forced to delay their invasion of the city.

Second World War-era searchlights include models manufactured by General Electric and by the Sperry Company. These were mostly of 60 inch (152.4 cm) diameter with rhodium plated parabolic mirror, reflecting a carbon arc discharge. Peak output was 800,000,000 candela. It was powered by a 15 kW generator and had an effective beam visibility of 28 to 35 miles (45 to 56 km) in clear low humidity.

The searchlight also found a niche for use by night fighters and anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The Turbinlite was a powerful searchlight mounted in the nose of an RAF Douglas Boston light bomber, converted into a night fighter to shoot down Luftwaffe night bombers. The aircraft would be directed in the general direction of the enemy by ground-based or metre-wave airborne radar, and the pilot would then switch on the Turbinlite, illuminating the enemy aircraft, which would then be shot down by accompanying RAF day fighters such as the Hawker Hurricane. This never proved very successful, as the light made the emitting aircraft a very big target for rear gunners, who would simply have to shoot into the light and be guaranteed to hit something eventually.

During the Battle of the North Atlantic, RAF aircraft such as the Vickers Wellington were assigned to patrol for surfaced German U-boats at night, when they would be on the surface, charging their batteries. A large searchlight called a Leigh light was suspended from the bottom of the wing or fuselage, and would be used to illuminate the surfaced U-boat while it was being attacked with bombs and depth charges. The Leigh light was somewhat more successful than the Turbinlite, but in both cases the development of centimeter-wave radar proved to be the far more effective answer.

=== Ukraine ===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine a searchlight has been used for anti-aircraft warfare.

== Non-military use ==
Today, searchlights are used in advertising, fairs, festivals and other public events. Their use was once common for movie premieres; the waving searchlight beams can still be seen as a design element in the logos of 20th Century Studios and the Fox television network. The world&#x27;s most powerful searchlight today beams from the top of the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas. It concentrates about 13,650,000 lumens from 39 7kW xenon lamps into a beam of about 9,129,000,000 candela.

&quot;Tribute in Light&quot; is an art installation that uses two columns of searchlights to represent the former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, in remembrance of the September 11 attacks. It is produced annually in Lower Manhattan.

Disney parks uses searchlights in their nighttime fireworks displays. They are installed on top of the rooftops of several attractions in Fantasyland.

<doc id="59828" wikidata="Q7441731" url="?curid=59828" title="Searchlight (short story)">
<text>&quot;Searchlight&quot; is a very short science fiction story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, about a little blind girl whose spaceship crashes on the Moon. The search for her takes advantage of her prodigious musical ability to locate her.

It was originally written in 1962 as part of an advertisement for Hoffman Electronics. Heinlein says that because it was so short it was much harder to write than writing novels. Perhaps because of this, it was the last short story Heinlein wrote; the remaining quarter-century of his career was devoted to writing novels and non-fiction essays.

&quot;Searchlight&quot; is anthologized in &quot;The Worlds of Robert A. Heinlein&quot;, a collection of short stories published in 1966 and his &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; in 1980.</text><links>

<text>&quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, about a Boy Scout on a trip to the Moon and his novel way of finding his lost brother. Included as part of his Future History, it originally appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, January 10, 1948, and was collected in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;). 

== Synopsis ==
The short story is told from the viewpoint of Dick Logan, a Boy Scout who has accompanied his father on a business trip to the Moon alongside his mother and little brother, &quot;Baby Darling&quot;. They&#x27;re encouraged to visit the Black Pits of Luna on the back side of the Moon, however upon arriving they are told that the tour is too dangerous for small children. Unwilling to deny their &quot;Baby Darling&quot;, the parents raise a fuss until they are permitted to use a small space suit that had been special ordered for an elite&#x27;s daughter. Dick is instructed to watch over his brother, however once on the tour he quickly becomes enthralled by the Black Pits&#x27; landscape and history. 

As the tour comes to an end the family discovers that Baby Darling has wandered off. Searches are made for the child, however no one is able to locate the boy, who is at risk of running out of oxygen. Dick volunteers to help and quickly realizes that his brother would see the Pits as an excellent place to play hide-and-seek. He searches several locations matching his brother&#x27;s favorite hiding spots, using his size to access spaces that grown men would be too big to search. He eventually succeeds in finding his brother, who has passed out in a small crevice. The short ends with the parents swearing to never return to the Moon while Dick himself plans on eventually returning.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; was first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on January 10, 1948 and featured illustrations by Fred Ludekens. It was later re-printed in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;. The short has been translated into multiple languages.

Per Jerome Winter, &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; is one of four short stories that helped Heinlein reach a more mainstream market via &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the other four being &quot;The Green Hills of Earth” (1947), “Space Jockey” (1947), and “It’s Great to Be Back!” (1947).

== Critical reception and themes ==
In her 2019 book &quot;The Pleasant Profession of Robert A. Heinlein&quot; Farah Mendlesohn wrote that the character of Dick is portrayed as more responsible than his entitled parents, which she states is implied to be a result of his participation in the Boy Scouts. The short story was praised in the &quot;Journal of College Science Teaching&quot; by William R. Brice, who stated that &quot;Although the plot and story line are somewhat juvenile, the descriptions of the lunar surface are excellent.&quot;

George Slusser criticized the portrayal of the unnamed mother character, further noting that Heinlein frequently received criticism from feminists because &quot;he presents women who do domestic duty as irrevocably stupid.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. One of his Future History stories, the short story originally appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (February 8, 1947), and it was collected in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently in &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;). Heinlein selected the story for inclusion in the 1949 anthology &quot;My Best Science Fiction Story&quot;. &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; is also the title of a song mentioned in several of Heinlein&#x27;s novels. 

The Rhysling Award for speculative fiction poetry awarded by the Science Fiction Poetry Association (SFPA) is named for the blind poet Rhysling in “The Green Hills of Earth.”

Rhysling (crater) on the Moon was named by Apollo 15 astronauts. who quoted the last verse of Rhysling&#x27;s song &quot;The green hills of Earth&quot; (from this story) as their third moonwalk was ending.

==Plot summary==

It is the story of &quot;Noisy&quot; Rhysling, the blind space-going songwriter whose poetic skills rival Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s. Heinlein (himself a medically retired U.S. naval officer) spins a yarn about a radiation-blinded, unemployable spaceship engineer crisscrossing the Solar System writing and singing songs. The story takes the form of a nonfiction magazine article.

The events of the story concern the composition of the titular song. Rhysling realizes that his death of old age is near, and hitchhikes on a spaceship headed to Earth so he can die and be buried where he was born. A malfunction threatens the ship with destruction, and Rhysling enters the irradiated area to perform repairs. While completing the repairs, he knows that he will soon die of radiation poisoning and tells them to record his last song; he dies just moments after singing the final, titular verse.

== Apollo 15 ==

The Apollo 15 astronauts named a number of craters in their landing area after favorite science fiction stories. Near &quot;Dune&quot; (after the Frank Herbert novel) and &quot;Earthlight&quot; (Arthur C. Clarke) craters was Rhysling (crater), named after the blind singer of the spaceways in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;. They intended to read a bit of &quot;Green Hills of Earth&quot; at the crater, but the exigencies of lunar exploration kept it from happening. To squeeze it in, Capcom Joe Allen told them to &quot;come home again to the homes of men, to the cool green hills of Earth&quot; as their last moonwalk was ending:
Scott&#x27;s memory of this last verse does not match either of the versions in the story itself, which is fitting considering that 
&quot;most of the verses were collected after [Rhysling&#x27;s] death from people who knew him&quot; and &quot;The Green Hills of Earth grew through twenty years&quot;.

==The songs==

Heinlein wrote several fragments of lyrics and six full stanzas for the song.
*— &quot;We rot in the molds of Venus, / We retch at her tainted breath. / Foul are her flooded jungles, / Crawling with unclean death.&quot; —
*— &quot;harsh bright soil of Luna&quot; —
*— &quot;The arching sky is calling / Spacemen back to their trade. / All hands! Stand by! Free falling! / And the lights below us fade. / Out ride the sons of Terra, / Far drives the thundering jet, / Up leaps the race of Earthmen / Out, far, and onward yet&quot; —
*— &quot;Saturn&#x27;s rainbow rings&quot; —
*— &quot;the frozen night of Titan&quot; —
*&quot;We pray for one last landing/ On the globe that gave us birth/ Let us rest our eyes on the fleecy skies/ And the cool, green hills of Earth.&quot;

Moore and Kuttner also give fragments of lyrics in &quot;Quest of the Starstone.&quot;

*- &quot;Across the seas of darkness / The good green Earth is bright – / Oh, Star that was my homeland / Shine down on me tonight.&quot;-
*- &quot;My heart turns home in longing/ Across the voids between, / To know beyond the spaceways/ The hills of Earth are green.&quot; –
*- &quot;- and count the losses worth / To see across the darkness/ The green hills of Earth...&quot;

The story features several other partial songs and a number of titles attributed to Rhysling. These are:
*&quot;The Grand Canal&quot; (10 lines)
*&quot;Jet Song&quot; (14 lines, unclear if meant to be complete)
*&quot;The Skipper is a Father to His Crew&quot; (title only)
*&quot;Since the Pusher Met My Cousin&quot; (title only)
*&quot;That Red-Headed Venusburg Gal&quot; (title only)
*&quot;Keep Your Pants On, Skipper&quot; (title only)
*&quot;A Space Suit Built for Two&quot; (title only)
*&quot;Dark Star Passing&quot; (title only)
*&quot;Berenice&#x27;s Hair&quot; (title only)
*&quot;Death Song of a Woods Colt&quot; (title only)

Several are described as sexually explicit songs excluded from the official edition of Rhysling&#x27;s works.

Four collections of Rhysling&#x27;s works are mentioned. They are:
*&quot;Songs of the Spaceways&quot; (published the week he died)
*&quot;The Grand Canal, and other Poems&quot;
*&quot;High and Far&quot;
*&quot;UP SHIP!&quot;

==References in other Heinlein works==

Joe-Jim Gregory, the two-headed mutant in &quot;Universe&quot;, are both fond of &quot;Rhysling, the blind singer of the spaceways&quot;. This reference to the character appeared six years before Heinlein actually published &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;.

The song &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; is mentioned three times in &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot; as a piece that Bill Lermer plays on his own accordion. Later in that same novel, Lermer is trying to identify a quote (&quot;I have lived and worked with men&quot;) and guesses that it was written by Rhysling or Kipling.

Both the song &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; and the character of Rhysling are mentioned in the novel &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;. At an early point in the novel, Lazarus Long bemoans the fact that he cannot &quot;pray for one last landing&quot; because the &quot;Green Hills of Earth&quot; have deteriorated and the planet is uninhabitable. Later, Lazarus tells the story of a blind accordion player who temporarily took residence in a bordello that he owned on Mars almost two thousand years ago. Although Heinlein readers can easily recognize the character, Lazarus himself does not &quot;recall his right name, if he had one.&quot;

&quot;Since the Pusher Met My Cousin&quot; and &quot;That Red-Headed Venusburg Gal&quot; are both referred to, but no lyrics are provided, in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Logic of Empire&quot;.

In &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, writer Jubal Harshaw dictates a poem also named &quot;Death Song of a Wood&#x27;s Colt&quot;.

===Similarity to other works===
In 1935 Ernest Hemingway published &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;. There is, however, no clear evidence of Heinlein being influenced by this title.

==Film, TV, radio/audio and theatrical adaptations==
The story was adapted for the &quot;Dimension X&quot; radio series (episode 10). It also appeared on the July 7, 1955, broadcast of the NBC Radio Network program &quot;X Minus One&quot;. Both versions are told from the point of view of a friend of Rhysling&#x27;s, and have Rhysling using a guitar instead of an accordion. As well as part of the title song (including the origin of a stanza about Venus) using the tune &quot;Rosin the Bow&quot;, two verses of &quot;The Captain is a Father to His Crew&quot; are sung, plus choral verses of &quot;Jet Song&quot;, and a complete and particularly beautiful version of &quot;The Grand Canal&quot;. The songs were composed and sung by Tom Glazer in a manner akin to Woody Guthrie; Kenneth Williams played Rhysling as a backwoodsman from the Ozarks, an area not far from Heinlein&#x27;s Missouri birthplace. The broadcast is available on the &quot;Old-Time Radio Classical Favorites&quot; release in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s &quot;Radio Spirits&quot; series.

Another adaptation aired on the &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot; on July 21, 1957. The script was by Draper Lewis and Robert Heinlein, produced and directed by Dee Engelbach, with music by Clark Harrington. Everett Sloane played Rhysling, Berry Kroeger narrated, and other cast members included Jackson Beck, Danny Ocko, Ian Martin, Louis Volkman, and Bill Lipton.

The song &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; which appears in the story was also used in the 11th episode of the third series of the British radio series, &quot;Journey into Space&quot;.

The 1951 – 1952 television series &quot;Out There&quot; (episode aired December 2, 1951) had a loosely adapted version of the story (Rhysling is on a mission to the asteroids with a crew which includes a beautiful blonde biologist) which starred singer John Raitt.

In 1977, Leonard Nimoy recorded a dramatic reading of the story as the title track of an album for Caedmon Records. Nimoy narrated the song lyric excerpts as originally written by Heinlein without singing them.

The story &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; was read at Symphony Space by Kathleen Chalfant on 6/8/2001 and broadcast on the radio program Selected Shorts.

In his 2005 book &quot;Learning the World&quot;, Ken MacLeod pays homage to this song: Chapter 17 (&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;) ends with a scene where a spacecraft evades an attack. The chapter ends with the background intercom blaring:
:&#x27;&quot;All Hands! Stand by! Free Falling!&quot;&#x27;
:&#x27;And the lights below us fade.&#x27;

Anthony Boucher, who was a close friend of Heinlein&#x27;s in the 1930s in Los Angeles, in his short story &quot;Man&#x27;s Reach&quot; makes reference to Rhysling&#x27;s &quot;Jet Song&quot;, stating, &quot;The familiar words boomed forth with that loving vigor of all baritones who have never seen deep space&quot;:
:&#x27;&quot;Feel her rise! Feel her drive!&quot;&#x27;
:&#x27;Straining steel, come alive...&#x27;
In Randall Garrett&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Hated Mars,&quot; the song plays in the Recreation Building of the penal colony on Mars, reminding all of what they&#x27;ve left.

In &quot;Islands in the Sky&quot; (Season 1, Episode 3, 1965) of Lost in Space, Dr. Smith says he wishes to return to the &quot;green hills of earth.&quot;

==Notes==
Isaac Asimov recalled in 1969 &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the shock that rumbled through the entire world of science fiction fandom when ... Heinlein broke the &#x27;slicks&#x27; barrier by having an undiluted science fiction story of his published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;&quot;.

Heinlein credited the title of the song, &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;, to the short story &quot;Shambleau&quot; by C. L. Moore (first published in 1933),
in which a spacefaring smuggler named Northwest Smith hums the tune. In another of C.L. Moore&#x27;s Northwest Smith stories named &quot;The Cold Gray God&quot;, published in 1935, the song is mentioned as a solar-wide hit by a singer named Rose Robertson. Moore and Henry Kuttner also have Northwest Smith hum the song in their 1937 short story &quot;Quest of the Starstone,&quot; which quotes several lines of lyrics.

Heinlein revealed in the liner notes to the Leonard Nimoy album &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; that he partially based Rhysling&#x27;s unique abilities on a blind machinist he worked with at the Philadelphia Naval Yards during World War II. He never identified him beyond the name &quot;Tony.&quot; Heinlein was amazed that Tony had a perfect safety record and a production record equal to sighted machinists and could identify all his co-workers solely by the sound of their footsteps and other aural clues, without need of them speaking to him first. Tony also occasionally played the accordion and sang for the assembled shop. William H. Patterson, in his Heinlein biography &quot;Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century, Vol. 1 - Learning Curve (1907-1948)&quot;, identified the blind machinist as Tony Damico.

<text>&quot;The Long Watch&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It is about a military officer who faces a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by a would-be dictator.

Originally titled &quot;Rebellion on the Moon&quot;, the story originally appeared in an edited version in the December 1949 &quot;American Legion Magazine&quot;. It also featured in April 1955 &quot;Nebula Science Fiction Number 12&quot;, illustrated by John J. Greengrass. It appears in Heinlein&#x27;s short story collections &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; and &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;. While it is included in collections of Future History stories and appears on Heinlein&#x27;s timeline chart, &quot;The Long Watch&quot; does not appear to share continuity with the history, but with &quot;Space Cadet&quot; published a year earlier.

==Plot summary==
In 1999, Lieutenant John Ezra Dahlquist is a member of the Space Patrol, an international organization with the custody of all Earth&#x27;s remaining nuclear weapons. A young bomb officer and physicist at the Patrol&#x27;s lunar base, he is apolitical and is devoted to his wife and young daughter. The base&#x27;s executive officer Colonel Towers asks to meet with him. Towers and others want to overthrow the Earth government and plan to use the bombs to destroy &quot;an unimportant town or two&quot; so Earth takes them seriously. Dahlquist leads Towers to believe that he will cooperate, but he does not want his family to live under a dictatorship and plans to stop the coup by preventing the bombs&#x27; use.

Dahlquist locks himself in the bomb bunker, modifies a bomb to detonate by hand, and threatens to blow up himself and the bombs. He negotiates with Towers, pretending to be still naïve; he hopes to give the government time to stop the coup. Dahlquist is growing tired, however, and if he falls asleep the conspirators may regain control. He decides to disable the bombs beyond the plotters&#x27; ability to repair them, despite the danger. The only way to do so is to open them up and break the plutonium core of each bomb. Dahlquist does so, but in the process exposes himself to a fatal dose of radiation. He dies &quot;very happy&quot;. 

The coup collapses and Towers shoots himself. The Patrol recovers Dahlquist&#x27;s radioactive body and places it in a lead coffin. As Earth mourns the hero, his body is entombed in a marble monument, with an honor guard beyond the limit of safe approach.

==Connection with other Heinlein stories==
In &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, Ezra Dahlquist is one of &quot;[t]hose who helped create the Tradition of the Patrol&quot;. New recruits view a display about his heroism, &quot;the day shameful and glorious in the history of the Patrol&quot;. At every Patrol , his name is called with those of three other Patrol heroes. A skeptical candidate to become a Patrol cadet comments that Dahlquist disobeyed his commanding officer in performing the acts he is commended for, and that if things had gone the other way, Dahlquist would have been deemed a traitor. However, a patrol regulation read from the handbook by Cadet Matt Dodson reads: &quot;—but the responsibility of determining the legality of the order rests on the person ordered as well as on the person giving the order&quot;, suggesting that he was within regulations to do so.

As the protagonist dies at the end, he sees, standing around him, a number of heroes who sacrificed themselves for others in history, including Rodger Young, a soldier who died in World War II helping his unit retreat, who was recognized as a war hero at the time of the story. Heinlein also referred to Young&#x27;s heroism in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, in which the protagonist&#x27;s starship was named after Young, and the recall used to bring the soldiers home was &quot;The Ballad of Rodger Young&quot;.

==Comparison with actual history==

The story assumed that placing nuclear missiles on the Moon would be an acceptable act in international relations by 1999, and that such a nuclear base would in effect have Earth at its mercy - leading to the potential of this power being abused, as it very nearly is in the story. This was an entirely plausible possibility at the time of writing. 

In actual history, the possibility for such positioning of nuclear weapons on the Moon was averted, before the actual Moon landing in 1969, through the Outer Space Treaty, providing that
* States shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner; and that 
* the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. 

With the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signing the treaty in 1967 and most other nations joining in later, there are not known to be any space-based nuclear weapons such as Heinlein envisioned.

<text>The Man Who Sold the Moon is a science fiction novella by American author Robert A. Heinlein, written in 1949 and published in 1950. A part of his &quot;Future History&quot; and prequel to &quot;Requiem&quot;, it covers events around a fictional first Moon landing in 1978 and the schemes of Delos D. Harriman, a businessman who is determined to personally reach and control the Moon.

==Plot==
Delos David &quot;D. D.&quot; Harriman, &quot;the last of the Robber Barons&quot;, is obsessed with being the first to travel to—and possess—the Moon. He asks his business partner, George Strong, and other tycoons to invest in the venture. Most dismiss Harriman&#x27;s plans as foolhardy: Nuclear rocket fuel is scarce as the space station that produces it blew up, also destroying the only existing spaceship. The necessary technology for a chemical-fueled rocket stretches the boundaries of current engineering. The endeavor is both incredibly costly and of uncertain profitability. One skeptic offers to sell &quot;all of my interest in the Moon...for fifty cents&quot;; Harriman accepts and tries to buy the other associates&#x27; interests as well. Strong and two others agree to back his plans.

The technical problems are solvable with money and talent. To solve the tougher financial problems, Harriman exploits commercial and political rivalries. He implies to the Moka-Coka company, for example, that rival soft drink maker 6+ plans to turn the Moon into a massive billboard, using a rocket to scatter black dust on the surface in patterns. To an anti-Communist associate, he suggests that the Russians may print the hammer and sickle across the face of the Moon if they get to it first. To a television network, he offers the Moon as a reliable and uncensorable broadcasting station.

Harriman seeks to avoid government ownership of the Moon. As it passes directly overhead only in a narrow band north and south of the equator, he uses a legal principle that states that property rights extend to infinity above a land parcel. On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon. The United States also has a claim due to Florida and Texas. By arranging for many countries to assert their rights Harriman persuades the United Nations to, as a compromise, assign management of the Moon to his company.

Money remains the main difficulty. Harriman liquidates his assets, risks bankruptcy, damages his marriage, and raises funds in numerous legitimate and semi-legitimate ways; &quot;I&quot;, he says, &quot;would cheat, lie, steal, beg, bribedo &quot;anything&quot; to accomplish what we have accomplished&quot;. Children donate money for a promise of all contributors&#x27; names engraved on a plaque left on the Moon. The names, however, will be microscopic in size. Harriman sells land and naming rights to craters, and plans to sell postal covers canceled on the Moon to collectors. He starts rumors that diamonds exist in moondust, intending to secretly place gems in the rocket to convince people that the rumors are true. Harriman will strenuously deny that the diamonds are from the Moon, being merely part of a scientific experiment; he expects people not to believe him, but he will not be guilty of actual fraud.

Harriman wants to be on the first flight of the &quot;Pioneer&quot; but the ship only has room for one pilot, Leslie LeCroix. The multistage rocket launches from Peterson Field, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, lands on the Moon, and returns to Earth. Harriman is the first to open the rocket&#x27;s hatch; the canceled postal covers were left behind to save weight and he needs to get them aboard surreptitiously. While doing so, he asks LeCroix for the &quot;lunar&quot; diamonds. The pilot complies, then produces real lunar diamonds as well.

As Harriman predicted, once the first flight succeeds, many seek to invest in his venture to make more flights using a catapult launcher built on Pikes Peak. The next flight will begin a lunar colony. Harriman intends to be on the ship, but the majority owners of the venture object to his presence on the flight; he is too valuable to the company to risk in space. The rocket leaves without Harriman, who &quot;looks as Moses must have looked, when he gazed out over the promised land&quot;.

==Related works==
The Man Who Sold the Moon is also the title of two collections of Heinlein&#x27;s short stories. Both collections include &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;, &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;, and &quot;Requiem&quot;; the first also includes &quot;Life-Line&quot; and &quot;Blowups Happen&quot;.

Although the 1950 science fiction film &quot;Destination Moon&quot; is generally described as being based on Heinlein&#x27;s 1947 novel &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot;, the story in fact bears a much closer resemblance to &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;. However, the technology of &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot; is very different: its rocket is multi-staged, while &quot;Destination Moon&quot; uses a single-stage-to-orbit spaceship that takes off and lands vertically, both on Earth and the Moon. (Dialogue in the film makes it very clear that the spaceship is nuclear powered.)

The novella also inspired David Bowie&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, in both its title and its central themes.

==Influence on other Heinlein works==
Harriman appears in &quot;Requiem&quot; as an old man who has still not been able to go to the Moon. It was published in 1940, 11 years before &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;.

The name &quot;Harriman&quot; reappears in many &quot;Future History&quot; stories as the name of various businesses and foundations, indicating that Harriman&#x27;s impact on that timeline is significant. The name is also used in &quot;Variable Star&quot;, a novel outlined by Heinlein but written by Spider Robinson following Heinlein&#x27;s death; the novel diverges from the Future History.

<text>&quot;The Menace From Earth&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in the August 1957 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story is set in the near future, when the Moon is colonized with people living in underground cities. The &quot;menace&quot; of the title is a glamorous woman tourist who visits the Moon colony. She is assigned a young guide named Holly, a 15-year-old girl and aspiring starship designer who is the first-person narrator. Holly&#x27;s best friend Jeff develops a crush on the &quot;groundhog&quot; visitor, Ariel. As Jeff spends more time with Ariel, Holly becomes jealous and begins to doubt his friendship.

Living in an underground city on the Moon, Holly and Jeff&#x27;s hobby is flying with strap-on wings in a great cavern, made possible because the gravity field is one sixth the strength of Earth&#x27;s and the air pressure in the cavern is kept high enough. Ariel wants to try flying, and Holly, in order not to appear jealous, offers to teach her. However, during her first flight, Ariel loses control at a great height, falling toward the ground. Holly swoops down and saves her life, breaking both arms in the process as she cushions Ariel&#x27;s fall. 

In the hospital afterward, Ariel gently explains some things to Holly. Ariel is twice the age of the teenagers, and could never be romantically interested in Jeff. More to the point, Jeff is not in love with her but with Holly. Ariel tells how in the aftermath of the crash Jeff arrived &quot;like an avenging angel&quot;, ignoring Ariel to cradle the unconscious Holly in his arms, sobbing.

Following this revelation, Jeff arrives in the hospital room and Ariel tactfully leaves the two alone. After some embarrassed banter, Jeff kisses Holly for the first time.

==Analysis==
One of Heinlein&#x27;s stories written from a female perspective, with his typically strong, independent, capable (for this era) female protagonist. It effectively contrasts a traditional teenage romance story against realistically drawn details of everyday life as a colonist on the Moon.

==Relationship to other Heinlein works==
&quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot; sets the basis for lunar exploration and development in Heinlein&#x27;s Future History. The lunar colony in the story is described in more detail in &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. The memorial referred to in the story is set up in &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot;. Holly is also one of the many Heinlein characters mentioned in &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; called &quot;The Menace from Earth&quot; a &quot;startler&quot;, praising it as a &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; story &quot;set in a wildly imaginative alien environment&quot;.

<doc id="59836" wikidata="Q7761164" url="?curid=59836" title="The Roads Must Roll">
<text>&quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; is a 1940 science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was selected for &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964&quot; anthology in 1970.

The story is set in the near future, when &quot;roadtowns&quot; (wide rapidly moving passenger platforms similar to moving sidewalks, but reaching speeds of 100 mph) have replaced highways and railways as the dominant transportation method in the United States.

Heinlein&#x27;s themes are technological change and social cohesion. The fictional social movement he calls &quot;functionalism&quot; (which is unrelated to the real-life sociological theory of the same name), advances the idea that one&#x27;s status and level of material reward in a society must and should depend on the functions one performs for that society.

==Plot summary==

In the first section of the narrative, a stormy meeting takes place at a Sacramento Sector Guild Hall of the technicians working &quot;down inside&quot;, among the very noisy great rotors which keep the moving roads going. Speakers voice various grievances and call for immediate strike action. &quot;Shorty&quot; Van Kleeck, the Chief Deputy Engineer of the Sacramento sector, appears and declares his sympathy with the technicians&#x27; demands and effectively places himself at their head. As would become clear later, it was Van Kleeck who instigated the technicians&#x27; agitation in the first place.

The road&#x27;s workforce is sharply divided into two classes – the technicians, who are unionized civilians, and the engineers, who are organized as Transport Cadets, an elite paramilitary organization formed by the US Military to keep this crucial infrastructure running. The technicians feel some hostility to the &quot;arrogant&quot; engineers. Van Kleeck – himself a senior engineer who had &quot;come up from the ranks&quot; manipulates this hostility, with the intention of catapulting himself into a position of personal power.

After this initial scene, the point of view shifts – and remains for the rest of the story – to Van Kleeck&#x27;s superior Larry Gaines, Chief Engineer of the Diego-Reno Roadtown – at the outset yet unaware of the brewing trouble. He is busy entertaining Mr. Blenkinsop, the Australian Transport Minister, who is looking into Road technology with an eye to introducing it in Australia. Gaines&#x27;s explanation of the Road machinery to Blenkinsop is a device to bring the reader into the world of the Roads.

Larry Gaines is dining with his Australian guest in a moving restaurant on the road when one of the moving sidewalk strips stops unexpectedly. This causes a chain reaction of people falling from the stopped strip onto the fast moving strips next to it, and vice versa. The entire length of the Road becomes a scene of carnage. The reader already knows that this was the result of the ruthless action taken by Van Kleeck and his confederates. Gaines quickly concludes that this is no mechanical failure but sabotage, and that the technicians who maintain the Stockton section of the road are responsible. The rebels have stopped the strip – heedless of the resulting killing and wounding of numerous people traveling the moving road – as a demonstration to encourage their fellow technicians around the country to rebel against the Cadets.

Gaines calls the Stockton office and learns that the leader of the rebellion is his own deputy Van Kleeck, who defiantly declares &quot;The Functionalist Revolution&quot;. Holding to a radical social theory, &quot;Functionalism,&quot; the rebel technicians were persuaded that their role in maintaining the nation&#x27;s transport infrastructure is more important than that of any other workers and that they should therefore be in control. Blenkinsop is left behind at one of Road stations as Gaines takes charge of the advance on the Stockton office.

Going into the machinery under the roadway that runs it, Gaines takes command of the response. He doesn&#x27;t order the Road stopped, since that would leave millions of commuters stranded, but instead has the military evacuate the riders, a time-consuming procedure. In command of a hastily gathered corps of armed cadets, he proceeds up the underground access tunnel toward Stockton on &quot;tumblebugs,&quot; motorized and gyroscopically stabilized unicycles much like the later real-life Segway. As the military advance proceeds, they arrest rebel technicians and cross connect the wiring of the machinery, motor by motor, to take control away from the rebels in the Stockton office.

Over the videophone Van Kleeck warns that he has a button rigged to blow up the Road if Gaines doesn&#x27;t capitulate – which could cause countless deaths, possibly running into millions. Gaines doesn&#x27;t understand how Van Kleeck has gotten so many technicians to side with him; psychological screening tests are supposed to guarantee that technicians don&#x27;t have the temperament to revolt. Then Gaines realizes that Deputy Van Kleeck was able to move revolution-prone workers into his sector because, as deputy, Van Kleeck had access to the psychological files on the technicians. Gaines accesses Shorty&#x27;s psychological profile and studies the neurotic traits that have made him a demagogue.

Asking for a parley, Gaines is taken to the Stockton office and faces Shorty. There he uses his knowledge of Shorty&#x27;s psychology to push him into a nervous breakdown and overpowers him, gaining control of the &#x27;suicide&#x27; button. The Cadets attack the office and the rebellion is ended.

Later, Gaines ponders the changes that will have to be made to make sure there is never a recurrence of these events: more psychological testing, more careful oversight, and more &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. He concludes that the price of high-tech transportation like the Roadways is eternal vigilance. He then suddenly realizes that he had let the Australian Transport Minister kick his heels in an empty office the whole night, and rushes off to apologize.

==Themes==
Damon Knight, in his introduction to the paper-back edition from the New English Library edition of &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow, Vol 1.&quot;, compares the story to the then-current power of Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters Union. He also notes that Heinlein successfully predicted urban sprawl driven by cheap and efficient transport, as well as the development of &#x27;pseudopods&#x27; of urban development between communities.

==Adaptation==
&quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; was adapted for the radio shows &quot;Dimension X&quot; in 1950 and &quot;X Minus One&quot; in 1956.

<doc id="59840" wikidata="Q3909047" url="?curid=59840" title="—We Also Walk Dogs">
<text>&quot;—We Also Walk Dogs&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. One of his Future History stories, it was first published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (July 1941, as by Anson MacDonald) and collected in &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (and subsequently &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;).

Although considered part of the Future History, the story has no references to other stories in the canon, and features elements such as anti-gravity that are not fully consistent with other stories.

==Plot summary==
&quot;General Services&quot; is a very successful company that provides various personal services such as shopping for you or walking your dogs or supplying a host for a party, but also proudly advertises that no job is too large. One ad campaign idea which the staff discusses is &quot;Want somebody murdered? Then DON&#x27;T call General Services. But for &quot;anything else&quot;, call... It Pays!&quot;. The business model involves knowing to whom to subcontract work. The technology used involves rapid access to client data and the use of personal, portable telephones.

The company is asked to do the impossible: enable an interplanetary conference to be held on Earth, whose strong gravity is inhospitable to many of the native races of other planets and moons in the solar system. The solution of holding the conference on Mars or Luna is considered politically unacceptable.

In a side plot, the team also have to deal with a rich woman who wants to visit her son recuperating from a skiing injury over a thousand miles away while simultaneously conducting a fashionable party at her home. The solution is to conduct her to her son&#x27;s side while using 3-D projection to have her appear at the party. They charge a hefty fee for this. The fee is doubled when the woman selfishly tries to insist on hiring one of the team as her personal social secretary.

Much of the action of the story is not, as one might expect, about the science or engineering of creating an antigravity device to allow the conference to take place, but about how to persuade the world&#x27;s leading physicist, a Dr. O&#x27;Neill, to undertake the job. O&#x27;Neill is too wealthy to be tempted by money, but longs to possess a museum piece, a Chinese porcelain bowl called &quot;The Flower of Forgetfulness&quot;. The team have to find a way to get the bowl from its current location in a London museum. This involves the creation of a duplicate and some underhand tactics. When they receive it, they discover that it is indeed one of the most beautiful objects imaginable.

The anti-gravity generator is created, the government&#x27;s conference goes well, and O&#x27;Neill is paid and receives the bowl. General Services also asserts ownership of the anti-gravity invention, against the government&#x27;s attempts to claim it. O&#x27;Neill was under salaried contract at the time, with the bowl as a bonus, so by law General Services would own all the work that he did for them. O&#x27;Neill would have helped the government to grab the invention, but the team asks him for one condition: that the three of them, personally, be allowed to visit and view the bowl from time to time. Caught by surprise, he agrees and begins to regard them as potential friends.

<text>Red Planet is a 1949 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein about students at boarding school on the planet Mars. It represents the first appearance of Heinlein&#x27;s idealized Martian elder race (see also &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;). The version published in 1949 featured a number of changes forced on Heinlein by Scribner&#x27;s, since it was published as part of the Heinlein juveniles. After Heinlein&#x27;s death, the book was reissued by Del Rey Books as the author originally intended.

==Plot summary==
Mars has been colonized by humans, but is governed by an administrator appointed by an Earth-based company - the colonists have no political power. Colonial teenagers Jim Marlowe and Frank Sutton travel to the Lowell Academy boarding school for the start of the academic year. Jim takes along his native Martian pet, Willis the Bouncer, a round furry ball the size of a volleyball, who is about as intelligent as a human child and has a photographic memory for sounds, which he can also reproduce perfectly. At a rest stop, Willis wanders off and encounters one of the adult sentient Martians. The three-legged alien takes the two boys and Willis to participate in a ritual called &quot;growing together&quot; with a group of its fellows. They also share water, making Jim and Frank &quot;water friends&quot; with the Martian, named Gekko.

At school, Jim gets into trouble with the authoritarian headmaster, Mr. Howe, who confiscates Willis, claiming that it is against the new rules to have pets. When Jim and Frank sneak into Howe&#x27;s office and rescue Willis, the bouncer repeats two overheard conversations between Howe and Beecher, the unscrupulous colonial administrator of Mars, detailing Beecher&#x27;s plans for Willis and for the colony. When Beecher learns Howe has a bouncer, he is ecstatic; the London Zoo is willing to pay a hefty price for a specimen. Worse, Beecher has secretly planned to prevent the annual migration of the colonists (to avoid 12 months of severe winter weather) in order to save money. The boys run away from school to warn their parents and the colony.

The boys set out to skate the thousands of miles on the frozen Martian canals to their homes. During the trip, Frank gets sick. On the third night, they are forced to take shelter inside a giant Martian cabbage-plant (nearly suffocating when it folds up at night). The next day they meet some native Martians, who accept Jim because of his relationship to Willis and water-friendship with Gekko. The Martians treat Frank&#x27;s illness and send the two boys home by a swift, previously unknown subway.

Once warned, Jim&#x27;s father quickly organizes the migration, hoping to catch Beecher off guard. The colonists reach and take over the boarding school, turning it into a temporary shelter. Howe locks himself in his office, while Beecher sets up automatic, photosensor-controlled weapons outside to stop the malcontents (as he calls them) from leaving. After two colonists are killed trying to surrender, and the power to the building is cut, the colonists decide they have no choice but to fight back. The colonists organize a raiding party, with the boys taking part, capture Beecher&#x27;s office and proclaim the colony&#x27;s independence from Earth.

Several Martians enter the school area, and one of them shows up in the door leading to Howe&#x27;s office, hiding him from sight. When the Martian turns away, Howe is nowhere to be found. The Martians then go to Beecher&#x27;s building, and when they leave, he also has vanished. The Martians had been content to allow humans to share their planet, but Beecher&#x27;s threat to Willis has made them reconsider. They present the colonists with an ultimatum: leave the planet or else. Dr. MacRae negotiates with the Martians, and succeeds in persuading them to let the colonists stay, mainly because of Jim&#x27;s strong friendship with Willis.

MacRae theorizes that Martians start life as bouncers, metamorphose into adults, then continue to exist after their deaths as the &quot;old ones&quot;. In the end, Jim resigns himself to giving Willis up so the bouncer can undergo the transformation to adulthood.

As with &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot;, there are two versions of the ending. As originally written (and published much later) it is made clear that Willis will not emerge as an adult for 40 years. Heinlein&#x27;s publishers edited and changed this, as well as a discussion early in the novel in which MacRae expresses strong support for adults and older children being free to carry handguns, and opposition to any government which would restrict that.

==Critical reception==
Surveying Heinlein&#x27;s juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized &quot;Red Planet&quot; as Heinlein&#x27;s first genuinely successful effort in the sequence, saying that &quot;Heinlein [has] found his true direction ... The Martian setting is logically constructed and rich in convincing detail [while] the characters are engaging and the action develops naturally.&quot;

P. Schuyler Miller, reviewing the original edition, praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;verisimilitude, the attention to detail which Heinlein&#x27;s adult readers know well. . . . the explanations are never dragged in for their own sake, and the plot grows naturally out of the setting.&quot;

==Connections with &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;==

The life cycle of Martians (as described by MacRae) is the same in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. It is noted in this novel that the &quot;old ones&quot; inhabit two planes of existence: the physical and the (unspecified) other. Further, the water friends theme is recapitulated in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as &quot;water brothers.&quot; Furthermore, the Martian ability to make an item or person disappear, which was a major plot point in &quot;Stranger&quot;, is demonstrated here. Jack Williamson writes that &quot;The Martians in this story have a special interest, because they are the educators of Valentine Michael Smith [and] they display the same appalling powers that Smith brings back to Earth.&quot;

The general description of Martian society as characterized by reverence for freedom is similar. For instance, the Martian Gekko &quot;radiates displeasure&quot; upon understanding what is meant by &quot;london-zoo,&quot; and further discovering that Howe meant to sell Willis to a zoo—a reaction not dissimilar to that of Mike, who often senses a &quot;wrongness&quot; in cages, and whose first impulse when encountering the caged animals of a zoo is to attempt to set them free.

==Adaptations==

In 1994, the novel was adapted (and much altered) by Gunther-Wahl Productions into an animated miniseries for Fox Kids.

==Influences==
The background of Mars presented in the novel, as a desert planet crisscrossed by giant Martian canals built by an ancient civilization to bring water from the polar ice caps, is a common scenario in science fiction novels of the early 20th century, and was actually put forward as a plausible theory by some astronomers around the turn of the last century, notably Percival Lowell, mentioned in the novel. It stems from early telescope observations of Mars by 19th century astronomers who, beginning with the Italian Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877, believed they saw straight lines on the planet. Schiaparelli called them &quot;canali&quot; (grooves), which was popularly mistranslated into English as &quot;canals&quot;.

<doc id="59844" wikidata="Q2703133" url="?curid=59844" title="The Number of the Beast (novel)">
<text>The Number of the Beast is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1980. Excerpts from the novel were serialized in the magazine &quot;Omni&quot; (October–November 1979).

==Plot==
The book is a series of diary entries primarily by each of the four main characters: Zebadiah &quot;Zeb&quot; John Carter, programmer Dejah Thoris &quot;Deety&quot; Burroughs Carter, her mathematics professor father Jacob Burroughs, and off-campus socialite Hilda Corners. The names &quot;Dejah Thoris&quot;, &quot;Burroughs&quot;, and &quot;Carter&quot; are overt references to John Carter and Dejah Thoris, the protagonists of the Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

In the opening, Deety is dancing with Zeb at a party at Hilda&#x27;s mansion. Deety is trying to get Zeb to meet her father to discuss what she thinks is an article Zeb wrote about n-dimensional space, even going so far as to offer herself. Zeb figures out and explains to Deety that he is not the one who wrote the article but a relative with a similar name.

After dancing a very intimate tango, Zeb jokingly suggests the dance was so strong they should get married, and Deety agrees. Zeb is taken aback but then accepts. As they are leaving, Deety and Zeb rescue Jacob from a heated argument he is having with another faculty member before a fight breaks out. As they are approaching their vehicles, Hilda comes out, deciding to tag along. Zeb, having a premonition, grabs the three of them and ducks behind another vehicle before Jacob and Deety&#x27;s vehicle explodes. Zeb gets everyone into his modified air car &quot;Gay Deceiver&quot; and by activating the &quot;Deceiver&quot;″s flying capability, escapes undetected by the authorities or the criminals who put a bomb in the other vehicle.

Zeb flies to Elko, Nevada, the state being the only one to allow people to get married 24 hours a day with no waiting period or blood test. The incidents have so traumatized Jacob that he has agreed to marry Hilda and so they have a double ceremony. The couples then go to Jacob&#x27;s hidden cabin in the woods, where they have their honeymoons.

Thus begins the series of adventures that the four embark upon as they travel in the &quot;Gay Deceiver&quot;, which is equipped with the professor&#x27;s &quot;continua&quot; device and armed by the Australian Defence Force. The continua device was built by Professor Burroughs while he was formulating his theories on &quot;n&quot;-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry. The geometry of the novel&#x27;s universe contains six dimensions the three spatial dimensions, known to the real world, and three time dimensions: &quot;t&quot;, the real world&#x27;s temporal dimension, &quot;τ&quot; (Greek tau), and &quot;т&quot; (Cyrillic te). The continua device can travel on all six axes. The continua device allows travel into various fictional universes, such as the Land of Oz, as well as through time. An attempt to visit Barsoom takes them to an apparently different version of Mars, seemingly under the colonial rule of the British and Russian Empires, but near the end of the novel, Heinlein&#x27;s recurring character Lazarus Long hints that they had traveled to Barsoom and that its &quot;colonial&quot; status was an illusion imposed on them by the telepathically adept Barsoomians:
===Title===
In the novel, the biblical number of the beast turns out to be not 666 but formula_1 = 10,314,424,798,490,535,546,171,949,056, the initial number of parallel universes accessible through the continua device. It is later theorized by the character Jacob that the number may be merely the instantly accessible universes from a given location and that there is a larger structure that implies an infinite number of universes.

==Literary significance and reception==
Jack Kirwan wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; that the novel is &quot;about two men and two women in a time machine safari through this and other universes. But describing &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; thus is like saying &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is about a one-legged guy trying to catch a fish.&quot; He went on to state that Heinlein celebrates the &quot;competent person&quot;.

Sue K. Hurwitz wrote in her review for the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; that it is &quot;a catalog of Heinlein&#x27;s sins as an author; it is sophomoric, sexist, militantly right wing, and excessively verbose&quot; and commentary that the book&#x27;s ending was &quot;a devastating parody of SF conventions—will have genre addicts rolling on the floor. It&#x27;s garbage, but right from the top of the heap.&quot;

Heinlein buff David Potter explained on alt.fan.heinlein, in a posting reprinted on the Heinlein Society, that the entire book is actually &quot;one of the greatest textbooks on narrative fiction ever produced, with a truly magnificent set of examples of &quot;how not to do it&quot; right there in the foreground, and constant explanations of how to do it right, with literary references to people and books that &quot;did&quot; do it right, in the background.&quot; He noted that &quot;every single time there&#x27;s a boring lecture or tedious character interaction going on in the foreground, there&#x27;s an example of how to do it &quot;right&quot; in the background.&quot;

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5 and commented: &quot;No one writes like Heinlein, and what is a disappointment from him would be a smashing success from anyone else.&quot;

James Nicoll has credited it as having taught him that he does not have to finish reading every book he begins.

==&quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot;==

In 2020, a previously unpublished manuscript by Heinlein was released as The Pursuit of the Pankera. Using the same premise and characters as &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the first third of the two novels are the same. In the remainder of &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot;, the characters visit fictional universes, primarily Barsoom, Oz, and the world of E. E. Doc Smith″s &quot;Lensman&quot; series.

<text>Assignment in Eternity, is a collection of four science fiction and science fantasy novellas by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in hardcover by Fantasy Press in 1953. The stories, some of which were revised somewhat from their original magazine publication, were:

* &quot;Gulf&quot; (written and published in 1949 in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction,&quot; October–November 1949).
* &quot;Elsewhen&quot;, (written in 1939 and first published in 1941 in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; of September 1941 as &quot;Elsewhere&quot; by Caleb Saunders)
* &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; (written in 1939 but first published in 1941 in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot;, November 1941 as &quot;Lost Legion&quot; by Lyle Monroe)
* &quot;Jerry Was a Man&quot; (written in 1946 and published in 1947 in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, October 1947 as &quot;Jerry Is a Man&quot;)

Heinlein dedicated the book &quot;To Sprague and Catherine&quot;: L. Sprague de Camp (his friend and science fiction author) and his wife Catherine Crook de Camp. 

&quot;Assignment in Eternity&quot; was almost immediately picked up for mass market paperback publication by New American Library&#x27;s Signet line and is currently (as of 2007) offered by Baen Books in trade paper format, with a republication of Heinlein&#x27;s Future History chart, even though none of the stories falls into the Future History.

The four stories are loosely related as speculation on what—that we are not already aware of—makes one a human. &quot;Jerry Is a Man&quot; makes the most straightforward examination of the theme, a court making a legal ruling on the human rights of genetically engineered intelligent creatures. &quot;Gulf&quot;, a story connected by its story materials to Kuttner&#x27;s Baldy stories and Wilmar Shiras&#x27; &quot;In Hiding&quot;, suggests that superior individuals already living among us might become a new step in hominid evolution; &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; suggests that every person has unused paranormal abilities that can be awakened by esoteric training comparable to that used by the supermen of &quot;Gulf&quot;. &quot;Elsewhen&quot; suggests that the human mind is not bound to our here-and-now &quot;slum of space-time&quot; but can go voyaging into alternative timetracks of possibility. Although written in 1939, using materials popularized by J. W. Dunne, the story has gained new currency in the wake of the Wheeler-Everett &quot;Many Worlds&quot; hypothesis.
The story materials of all four novellas were revisited by Heinlein in later, more expansive novels. A number of figures of &quot;Lost Legacy&quot;, for example, are carried into &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), a book which ultimately could be said to have the same theme as the 1939 novella. Situations and individuals from both &quot;Gulf&quot; and &quot;Jerry Was a Man&quot; are examined in Friday (1982). And the &quot;multiverse&quot; concept first explored in &quot;Elsewhen&quot; gets very full treatment in Heinlein&#x27;s last novels, particularly &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; (1985) and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; (1987).
==Reception==
Boucher and McComas were unenthusiastic about the collection, saying it contained &quot;two lightweight and entertaining novelets and two pretty weak short novels.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller similarly found the stories &quot;not up to the best in the &quot;Future History&quot; series or the author&#x27;s recent teen-age books.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Villiers Gerson reported the collection evidenced Heinlein&#x27;s status as &quot;one of the ablest craftsmen writing science fiction.&quot;

<text>Revolt in 2100 is a 1953 science fiction collection by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, part of his Future History series.

The book consists of:
* Foreword by Henry Kuttner: &quot;The Innocent Eye&quot;
* &quot;If This Goes On—&quot; (1940; originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)
* &quot;Coventry&quot; (1940; originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)
* &quot;Misfit&quot; (1939; originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)
* Afterword: &quot;Concerning Stories Never Written&quot;

&quot;If This Goes On—&quot; is a short novel detailing a rebellion against an American theocracy. Heinlein revised and expanded the magazine version for this publication. &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Misfit&quot; are short stories showing the succeeding secular liberal society with &quot;Coventry&quot; presenting the point of view of characters who reject it.

The book&#x27;s afterword describes three unwritten stories which would have described the beginning of the theocracy and the beginning of the rebellion against it. &quot;The Sound of His Wings&quot; would have followed a televangelist named Nehemiah Scudder who rode a populist, racist wave of support to the presidency. &quot;Eclipse&quot; would have described the subsequent collapse of American society, with emphasis on the withdrawal from space travel by the new regime. &quot;The Stone Pillow&quot; would have covered the rise of the rebellion which the protagonists of &quot;If This Goes On—&quot; later join.

Reviewer Groff Conklin described the book as &quot;a classic&quot; and the lead story as &quot;a smashing tale of revolution in the United States&quot;. Boucher and McComas, however, described the collection as &quot;[i]mpressive in its time, and important in the development of modern science fiction&quot;, but found it highly uneven, &quot;with pages worthy of the mature 1954 Heinlein ... followed immediately by passages from the author&#x27;s literary apprenticeship&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller found it to be &quot;a distinctly minor Heinlein contribution, ... way below the mark Heinlein has set himself in his recent teen-age books&quot;.

<doc id="59853" wikidata="Q2835" url="?curid=59853" title="Retroreflector">
<text>A retroreflector (sometimes called a retroflector or cataphote) is a device or surface that reflects radiation (usually light) back to its source with minimum scattering. This works at a wide range of angle of incidence, unlike a planar mirror, which does this only if the mirror is exactly perpendicular to the wave front, having a zero angle of incidence. Being directed, the retroflector&#x27;s reflection is brighter than that of a diffuse reflector. Corner reflectors and cat&#x27;s eye reflectors are the most used kinds.

==Types==
There are several ways to obtain retroreflection:

===Corner reflector===

A set of three mutually perpendicular reflective surfaces, placed to form the internal corner of a cube, work as a retroreflector. The three corresponding normal vectors of the corner&#x27;s sides form a basis in which to represent the direction of an arbitrary incoming ray, . When the ray reflects from the first side, say x, the ray&#x27;s &quot;x&quot;-component, &quot;a&quot;, is reversed to −&quot;a&quot;, while the &quot;y&quot;- and &quot;z&quot;-components are unchanged. Therefore, as the ray reflects first from side x then side y and finally from side z the ray direction goes from to to to and it leaves the corner with all three components of its direction exactly reversed.

Corner reflectors occur in two varieties. In the more common form, the corner is literally the truncated corner of a cube of transparent material such as conventional optical glass. In this structure, the reflection is achieved either by total internal reflection or silvering of the outer cube surfaces. The second form uses mutually perpendicular flat mirrors bracketing an air space. These two types have similar optical properties.

A large relatively thin retroreflector can be formed by combining many small corner reflectors, using the standard hexagonal tiling.

===Cat&#x27;s eye===
Another common type of retroreflector consists of refracting optical elements with a reflective surface, arranged so that the focal surface of the refractive element coincides with the reflective surface, typically a transparent sphere and (optionally) a spherical mirror. In the paraxial approximation, this effect can be achieved with lowest divergence with a single transparent sphere when the refractive index of the material is exactly one plus the refractive index ni of the medium from which the radiation is incident (ni is around 1 for air). In that case, the sphere surface behaves as a concave spherical mirror with the required curvature for retroreflection. In practice, the optimal index of refraction may be lower than due to several factors. For one, it is sometimes preferable to have an imperfect, slightly divergent retroreflection, as in the case of road signs, where the illumination and observation angles are different. Due to spherical aberration, there also exists a radius from the centerline at which incident rays are focused at the center of the rear surface of the sphere. Finally, high index materials have higher Fresnel reflection coefficients, so the efficiency of coupling of the light from the ambient into the sphere decreases as the index becomes higher. Commercial retroreflective beads thus vary in index from around 1.5 (common forms of glass) up to around 1.9 (commonly barium titanate glass).

The spherical aberration problem with the spherical cat&#x27;s eye can be solved in various ways, one being a spherically symmetrical index gradient within the sphere, such as in the Luneburg lens design. Practically, this can be approximated by a concentric sphere system.

Because the back-side reflection for an uncoated sphere is imperfect, it is fairly common to add a metallic coating to the back half of retroreflective spheres to increase the reflectance, but this implies that the retroreflection only works when the sphere is oriented in a particular direction.

An alternative form of the cat&#x27;s eye retroreflector uses a normal lens focused onto a curved mirror rather than a transparent sphere, though this type is much more limited in the range of incident angles that it retroreflects.

The term &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; derives from the resemblance of the cat&#x27;s eye retroreflector to the optical system that produces the well-known phenomenon of &quot;glowing eyes&quot; or eyeshine in cats and other vertebrates (which are only reflecting light, rather than actually glowing). The combination of the eye&#x27;s lens and the cornea form the refractive converging system, while the tapetum lucidum behind the retina forms the spherical concave mirror. Because the function of the eye is to form an image on the retina, an eye focused on a distant object has a focal surface that approximately follows the reflective tapetum lucidum structure, which is the condition required to form a good retroreflection.

This type of retroreflector can consist of many small versions of these structures incorporated in a thin sheet or in paint. In the case of paint containing glass beads, the paint adheres the beads to the surface where retroreflection is required and the beads protrude, their diameter being about twice the thickness of the paint.

===Phase-conjugate mirror===
A third, much less common way of producing a retroreflector is to use the nonlinear optical phenomenon of phase conjugation. This technique is used in advanced optical systems such as high-power lasers and optical transmission lines. Phase-conjugate mirrors reflect an incoming wave so that the reflected wave exactly follows the path it has previously taken, and require a comparatively expensive and complex apparatus, as well as large quantities of power (as nonlinear optical processes can be efficient only at high enough intensities). However, phase-conjugate mirrors have an inherently much greater accuracy in the direction of the retroreflection, which in passive elements is limited by the mechanical accuracy of the construction.

==Operation==

Retroreflectors are devices that operate by returning light back to the light source along the same light direction. The coefficient of luminous intensity, &quot;RI&quot;, is the measure of a reflector performance, which is defined as the ratio of the strength of the reflected light (luminous intensity) to the amount of light that falls on the reflector (normal illuminance). A reflector appears brighter as its RI value increases.

The &quot;RI&quot; value of the reflector is a function of the color, size, and condition of the reflector. Clear or white reflectors are the most efficient, and appear brighter than other colors. The surface area of the reflector is proportional to the RI value, which increases as the reflective surface increases.

The RI value is also a function of the spatial geometry between the observer, light source, and reflector. Figures 1 and 2 show the observation angle and entrance angle between the automobile&#x27;s headlights, bicycle, and driver. The observation angle is the angle formed by the light beam and the driver&#x27;s line of sight. Observation angle is a function of the distance between the headlights and the driver&#x27;s eye, and the distance to the reflector. Traffic engineers use an observation angle of 0.2 degrees to simulate a reflector target about 800 feet in front of a passenger automobile. As the observation angle increases, the reflector performance decreases. For example, a truck has a large separation between the headlight and the driver&#x27;s eye compared to a passenger vehicle. A bicycle reflector appears brighter to the passenger car driver than to the truck driver at the same distance from the vehicle to the reflector.

The light beam and the normal axis of the reflector as shown in Figure 2 form the entrance angle. The entrance angle is a function of the orientation of the reflector to the light source. For example, the entrance angle between an automobile approaching a bicycle at an intersection 90 degrees apart is larger than the entrance angle for a bicycle directly in front of an automobile on a straight road. The reflector appears brightest to the observer when it is directly in line with the light source.

The brightness of a reflector is also a function of the distance between the light source and the reflector. At a given observation angle, as the distance between the light source and the reflector decreases, the light that falls on the reflector increases. This increases the amount of light returned to the observer and the reflector appears brighter.

==Applications==

===On roads===


Retroreflection (sometimes called retroflection) is used on road surfaces, road signs, vehicles, and clothing (large parts of the surface of special safety clothing, less on regular coats). When the headlights of a car illuminate a retroreflective surface, the reflected light is directed towards the car and its driver (rather than in all directions as with diffuse reflection). However, a pedestrian can see retroreflective surfaces in the dark only if there is a light source directly between them and the reflector (e.g., via a flashlight they carry) or directly behind them (e.g., via a car approaching from behind). &quot;Cat&#x27;s eyes&quot; are a particular type of retroreflector embedded in the road surface and are used mostly in the UK and parts of the United States.

Corner reflectors are better at sending the light back to the source over long distances, while spheres are better at sending the light to a receiver somewhat off-axis from the source, as when the light from headlights is reflected into the driver&#x27;s eyes.

Retroreflectors can be embedded in the road (level with the road surface), or they can be raised above the road surface. Raised reflectors are visible for very long distances (typically 0.5–1 kilometer or more), while sunken reflectors are visible only at very close ranges due to the higher angle required to properly reflect the light. Raised reflectors are generally not used in areas that regularly experience snow during winter, as passing snowplows can tear them off the roadways. Stress on roadways caused by cars running over embedded objects also contributes to accelerated wear and pothole formation.

Retroreflective road paint is thus very popular in Canada and parts of the United States, as it is not affected by the passage of snowplows and does not affect the interior of the roadway. Where weather permits, embedded or raised retroreflectors are preferred as they last much longer than road paint, which is weathered by the elements, can be obscured by sediment or rain, and is ground away by the passage of vehicles.

===For signs===
For traffic signs and vehicle operators, the light source is a vehicle&#x27;s headlights, where the light is sent to the traffic sign face and then returned to the vehicle operator. Retroreflective traffic sign faces are manufactured with glass beads or prismatic reflectors embedded in a base sheeting layer so that the face reflects light, therefore making the sign appear more bright and visible to the vehicle operator under darkened conditions. According to the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Traffic Safety Facts 2000 publication states the fatal crash rate is 3-4 times more likely during nighttime crashes than daytime incidents.

A misconception many people have is that retroreflectivity is only important during night-time travel. However, in recent years, more states and agencies require that headlights be turned on in inclement weather such as rain and snow. According to the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA): Approximately 24% of all vehicle accidents occur during adverse weather (rain, sleet, snow and fog). Rain conditions account for 47% of weather-related accidents. These statistics are based on 14-year averages from 1995 to 2008.

The FHWA&#x27;s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices requires that signs be either illuminated or made with retroreflective sheeting materials, and though most signs in the U.S. are made with retroreflective sheeting materials, they degrade over time. Until now, there has been little information available to determine how long the retroreflectivity lasts. The MUTCD now requires that agencies maintain traffic signs to a set of minimum levels but provide a variety of maintenance methods that agencies can use for compliance. The minimum retroreflectivity requirements do not imply that an agency must measure every sign. Rather, the new MUTCD language describes methods that agencies can use to maintain traffic sign retroreflectivity at or above the minimum levels.

In Canada, aerodrome lighting can be replaced by appropriately colored retroreflectors, the most important of which are the white retroreflectors that delineate the runway edges, and must be seen by aircraft equipped with landing lights up to 2 nautical miles away.

===Ships, boats, emergency gear===
Retroflective tape is recognized and recommended by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) because of its high reflectivity of both light and radar signals. Application to life rafts, personal flotation devices, and other safety gear makes it easy to locate people and objects in the water at night. When applied to boat surfaces it creates a larger radar signature—particularly for fiberglass boats, which produce very little radar reflection on their own. It conforms to International Maritime Organization regulation, IMO Res. A.658 (16) and meets U.S. Coast Guard specification 46 CFR Part 164, Subpart 164.018/5/0. Examples of commercially available products are 3M part numbers 3150A and 6750I, and Orafol Oralite FD1403.

===Surveying===
In surveying, a retroreflector—usually referred to as a prism—is normally attached on a surveying pole and is used as a target for distance measurement, for example, a total station. The instrument operator or robot aims a laser beam at the retroreflector. The instrument measures the propagation time of the light and converts it to a distance. Prisms are used with survey and 3D point monitoring systems to measure changes in horizontal and vertical position of a point.
Two prisms may also serve as targets for angle measurements, using total stations or simpler theodolites; this usage, reminiscent of the heliotrope, does not involve retroreflection per se, it only requires visibility by means of any source of illumination (such as the sun) for direct sighting to the center of the target prism as seen from the optical instrument.

===In space===
====On the Moon====

Astronauts on the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 missions left retroreflectors on the Moon as part of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment. The Soviet &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; and &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; rovers also carried smaller arrays. Reflected signals were initially received from &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, but no return signals were detected from 1971 until 2010, at least in part due to some uncertainty in its location on the Moon. In 2010, it was found in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographs and the retroreflectors have been used again. &quot;Lunokhod 2&#x27;s&quot; array continues to return signals to Earth. Even under good viewing conditions, only a single reflected photon is received every few seconds. This makes the job of filtering laser-generated photons from naturally occurring photons challenging.

Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 left Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) instrument supplied by NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center as part of international collaboration with ISRO. On 12 December 2023, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was successfully able to detect transmitted laser pulses from Vikram lander.

====On Mars====
A similar device, the Laser Retroreflector Array (LaRA), has been incorporated in the Mars &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover. The retroreflector was designed by the National Institute for Nuclear Physics of Italy, which built the instrument on behalf of the Italian Space Agency.
====In satellites====
Many artificial satellites carry retroreflectors so they can be tracked from ground stations. Some satellites were built solely for laser ranging.
LAGEOS, or Laser Geodynamics Satellites, are a series of scientific research satellites designed to provide an orbiting laser ranging benchmark for geodynamical studies of the Earth. There are two LAGEOS spacecraft: LAGEOS-1 (launched in 1976), and LAGEOS-2 (launched in 1992). They use cube-corner retroreflectors made of fused silica glass. As of 2020, both LAGEOS spacecraft are still in service. Three STARSHINE satellites equipped with retroreflectors were launched beginning in 1999. The LARES satellite was launched on February 13, 2012. (See also: List of laser ranging satellites.)

Other satellites include retroreflectors for orbit calibration and orbit determination, such as in satellite navigation (e.g., all Galileo satellites, most GLONASS satellites, IRNSS satellites, BeiDou, QZSS, and two GPS satellites) as well as in satellite gravimetry (GOCE) satellite altimetry (e.g., TOPEX/Poseidon, Sentinel-3).
Retroreflectors can also be used for inter-satellite laser ranging instead of ground-tracking (e.g., GRACE-FO).

The BLITS (Ball Lens In The Space) spherical retroreflector satellite was placed into orbit as part of a September 2009 Soyuz launch by the Federal Space Agency of Russia with the assistance of the International Laser Ranging Service, an independent body originally organized by the International Association of Geodesy, the International Astronomical Union, and international committees. The ILRS central bureau is located at the United States&#x27; Goddard Space Flight Center.
The reflector, a type of Luneburg lens, was developed and manufactured by the Institute for Precision Instrument Engineering (IPIE) in Moscow. The mission was interrupted in 2013 after a collision with space debris.

===Free-space optical communication===
Modulated retroreflectors, in which the reflectance is changed over time by some means, are the subject of research and development for free-space optical communications networks. The basic concept of such systems is that a low-power remote system, such as a sensor mote, can receive an optical signal from a base station and reflect the modulated signal back to the base station. Since the base station supplies the optical power, this allows the remote system to communicate without excessive power consumption. Modulated retroreflectors also exist in the form of modulated phase-conjugate mirrors (PCMs). In the latter case, a &quot;time-reversed&quot; wave is generated by the PCM with temporal encoding of the phase-conjugate wave (see, e.g., SciAm, Oct. 1990, &quot;The Photorefractive Effect,&quot; David M. Pepper, &quot;et al.&quot;).

Inexpensive corner-aiming retroreflectors are used in user-controlled technology as optical datalink devices. Aiming is done at night, and the necessary retroreflector area depends on aiming distance and ambient lighting from street lamps. The optical receiver itself behaves as a weak retroreflector because it contains a large, precisely focused lens that detects illuminated objects in its focal plane. This allows aiming without a retroreflector for short ranges.

===Other uses===
Retroreflectors are used in the following example applications:
*In common (non-SLR) digital cameras, the sensor system is often retroreflective. Researchers have used this property to demonstrate a system to prevent unauthorized photographs by detecting digital cameras and beaming a highly focused beam of light into the lens.
*In movie screens to allow for high brilliance under dark conditions.
* Digital compositing programs and chroma key environments use retroreflection to replace traditional lit backdrops in composite work as they provide a more solid color without requiring that the backdrop be lit separately.
* In Longpath-DOAS systems retroreflectors are used to reflect the light emitted from a lightsource back into a telescope. It is then spectrally analyzed to obtain information about the trace gas content of the air between the telescope and the retro reflector.
* Barcode labels can be printed on retroreflective material to increase the range of scanning up to 50 feet.
*In a form of 3D display; where a retro-reflective sheeting and a set of projectors is used to project stereoscopic images back to user&#x27;s eye. The use of mobile projectors and positional tracking mounted on user&#x27;s spectacles frame allows the illusion of a hologram to be created for computer generated imagery.
*Flashlight fish of the family Anomalopidae have natural retroreflectors. See tapetum lucidum.

==History==
Many prey and predator animals have naturally retroreflective eyes by having a reflective layer called the Tapetum lucidum behind the retina, since this doubles the light that their retina receives.
Inspired by the natural world, the inventor of road &#x27;cat&#x27;s eyes&#x27; was Percy Shaw of Boothtown, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. When the tram-lines were removed in the nearby suburb of Ambler Thorn, he realised that he had been using the polished steel rails to navigate at night. The name &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; comes from Shaw&#x27;s inspiration for the device: the eyeshine reflecting from the eyes of a cat. In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), and on 15 March 1935, founded Reflecting Roadstuds Limited in Halifax to manufacture the items. The name &quot;Catseye&quot; is their trademark. The retroreflecting lens had been invented six years earlier for use in advertising signs by Richard Hollins Murray, an accountant from Herefordshire and, as Shaw acknowledged, they had contributed to his idea.

<text>Rhea or Rheia (; Ancient Greek: Ῥέα or Ῥεία ) is a mother goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Titan daughter of the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus, himself a son of Gaia. She is the older sister of Cronus, who was also her consort, and the mother of the five eldest Olympian gods (Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Poseidon, and Zeus) and Hades, king of the underworld.

When Cronus learnt that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children like his father before him, he swallowed all the children Rhea bore as soon as they were born. When Rhea had her sixth and final child, Zeus, she spirited him away and hid him in Crete, giving Cronus a rock to swallow instead, thus saving her youngest son who would go on to challenge his father&#x27;s rule and rescue the rest of his siblings. Following Zeus&#x27;s defeat of Cronus and the rise of the Olympian gods into power, Rhea withdraws from her role as the queen of the gods to become a supporting figure on Mount Olympus. She has some roles in the new Olympian era. She attended the birth of her grandson Apollo and raised her other grandson Dionysus. After Persephone was abducted by Hades, Rhea was sent to Demeter by Zeus. In the myth of Pelops, she resurrects the unfortunate youth after he has been slain.

In early traditions, she is known as &quot;the mother of gods&quot; and therefore is strongly associated with Gaia and Cybele, who have similar functions. The classical Greeks saw her as the mother of the Olympian gods and goddesses. The Romans identified her with Magna Mater (their form of Cybele), and the Goddess Ops.

== Etymology ==
Some ancient etymologists derived &quot;&quot; () (by metathesis) from (, &#x27;ground&#x27;, &#x27;earth&#x27;); the same is suggested also by modern scholars, such as Robert Graves.

A different tradition, embodied in Plato and in Chrysippus, connected the word with (&quot;&quot;, &#x27;flow, discharge&#x27;), which is what &quot;A Greek–English Lexicon&quot; supports. Alternatively, the name &quot;Rhea&quot; may be connected with words for the pomegranate: (), and later ().

The name &quot;Rhea&quot; may ultimately derive from a Pre-Greek or Minoan source.

== Family ==
Rhea is the sister of the Titans (Oceanus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Coeus, Themis, Theia, Phoebe, Tethys, Mnemosyne, Cronus, and sometimes Dione), the Cyclopes, the Hecatoncheires, the Giants, the Meliae, and the Erinyes; and the half-sister of Aphrodite (in some versions), Typhon, Python, Pontus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Nereus, Eurybia, and Ceto.

According to Hesiod, Rhea had six children with Cronus: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. The philosopher Plato recounts that Rhea, Cronus, and Phorcys were the eldest children of Oceanus and Tethys.

According to the Orphic myths, Zeus wanted to marry his mother Rhea. After Rhea refused to marry him, Zeus turned into a snake and raped her. She had Persephone with Zeus.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth and children ===
Rhea was born to the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus, one of their twelve (or thirteen) Titan children. According to Hesiod, Uranus imprisoned all his children, while Apollodorus states he only imprisoned the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, not the Titans. With the help of Gaia, the youngest child, Cronus, overthrew his father, became king in his place, freed his siblings, and took his sister Rhea to wife. Ophion and Eurynome, a daughter of Oceanus, were said to have ruled snowy Mount Olympus in the early age. Rhea and Cronus fought them, and threw them into the waves of the Ocean, thus becoming rulers in their place. Rhea, skilled in wrestling, battled Eurynome specifically.

Gaia and Uranus told Cronus that just as he had overthrown his own father and become ruler of the cosmos, he was destined to be overcome by his own child; so as each of his children was born, he swallowed them. Rhea, Uranus, and Gaia devised a plan to save the last child, Zeus. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in a cavern on the island of Crete and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed; Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida. Her attendants, the warrior-like Kouretes and Dactyls, acted as bodyguards for the infant Zeus, helping to conceal his whereabouts from his father. In some accounts, by the will of Rhea a golden dog guarded a goat which offered her udder and gave nourishment to the infant Zeus. Later on, Zeus changed the goat into an immortal among the stars while the golden dog that guarded the sacred spot in Crete was stolen by Pandareus.&quot;&quot;

In an obscure version, attested only on the east frieze of a temple at Lagina, the goddess of crossroads Hecate assisted Rhea in saving Zeus from his father. The frieze shows Hecate presenting to Cronus the swaddled stone while the real infant is being whisked away in safety.

While Zeus was still an infant hidden in Crete, Rhea caught her husband Cronus with his mistress the nymph Philyra in the act; Cronus then transformed into a horse and galloped away, in order not to be seen by his wife.

In some accounts, Rhea along with Metis gave Cronus the potion that made him disgorge the children he had eaten.

=== Olympian era ===
Following Zeus&#x27;s ascension, Rhea withdrew from spotlight as she was no longer queen of gods, but remained an ally of her children and their families.

In some traditions, Rhea disapproved of her children Hera and Zeus getting married, so the two had to elope in order to be together. Rhea was present in the birth of her grandson Apollo, along with many other goddesses, the most notable exceptions being Hera and Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, whose absence left Leto in terrible agony. Rhea was said to be a goddess who eased childbirth for women.

After Demeter reunited with her daughter Persephone, Zeus sent Rhea to persuade Demeter to return to Olympus and rejoin the gods.

Rhea raised another one of her grandsons, Dionysus, after the fiery death of his mother, the mortal princess Semele. Later on she went on to heal Dionysus&#x27; raging madness, which had been inflicted on him by the jealous Hera, causing him to wander around aimlessly for some time. Rhea gave Dionysus the amethyst, which was thought to prevent drunkenness. Rhea sometimes joined Dionysus and his Maenads in their frenzy dances.

According to Bacchylides, it was Rhea herself who restored Pelops to life after his father Tantalus cut him down.

Rhea and Aphrodite rescued Creusa, the wife of Aphrodite&#x27;s son Aeneas, from the slavery the Greeks would have subjected her to after the fall of Troy. As for Aeneas, when he landed in Italy, a local warlord named Turnus set his pine-framed vessels ablaze. Rhea (or Cybele), remembering that those hulls had been crafted from trees felled on her holy mountains, transformed the vessels into sea nymphs.

After Melanion won the hand of Atalanta in marriage thanks to the help he received from Aphrodite, he neglected to thank her. Thus the goddess inflicted them with great passion for each other when they were near a temple of Rhea. The two then proceeded to have sex inside the temple. In anger, Rhea turned them into lions.

At some point, a mortal man named Sangas offended the goddess, and she turned him into a river that bore his name; Sangarius (now Sakarya River) in Asia Minor. In a similar manner a Phrygian man named Pyrrhus tried to rape her, but the goddess changed him into stone for his hubris.

In one Orphic myth, Zeus was filled with desire for his mother and pursued her, only for Rhea to refuse him and change into a serpent to flee. Zeus also turned himself into a serpent and raped her. The child born from that union was their daughter Persephone, and afterwards Rhea became Demeter. The child, Persephone, was born so deformed that Rhea ran away from her frightened, and did not breastfeed her daughter.

== Cult ==

Rhea had &quot;no strong local cult or identifiable activity under her control.&quot; She was originally worshiped on the island of Crete, identified in mythology as the site of Zeus&#x27;s infancy and upbringing. Her cults employed rhythmic, raucous chants and dances, accompanied by the tympanon (a wide, handheld drum), to provoke a religious ecstasy. Her priests impersonated her mythical attendants, the Curetes and Dactyls, with a clashing of bronze shields and cymbals.

The tympanon&#x27;s use in Rhea&#x27;s rites may have been the source for its use in Cybele&#x27;s – in historical times, the resemblances between the two goddesses were so marked that some Greeks regarded Cybele as their own Rhea, who had deserted her original home on Mount Ida in Crete and fled to the wilds of Phrygia to escape Cronus.

Rhea was often referred to as &quot;Meter Theon&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Gods&quot;) and there were several temples around Ancient Greece dedicated to her under that name. Pausanias mentioned temples dedicated to Rhea under the name Meter Theon in Anagyros in Attika, Megalopolis in Arkadia, on the Acropolis of Ancient Corinth, and in the district of Keramaikos in Athens, where the statue was made by Pheidias. In Sparta there was furthermore a sanctuary to &quot;Meter Megale&quot; (&quot;[the] Great Mother&quot;). Olympia had both an altar and a temple to the Meter Theon:
: A temple of no great size [at Olympia] in the Doric style they have called down to the present day Metroion (Temple of the Mother), keeping its ancient name. No image lies in it of the Meter Theon (Mother of the Gods), but there stand in it statues of Roman emperors.

Her temple in Akriai, Lakedaimon, was said to be her oldest sanctuary in the Peloponnese:
: Well worth seeing here [at Akriai, Lakedaimon,] are a temple and marble image of the Meter Theon (Mother of the Gods). The people of Akriai say that this is the oldest sanctuary of this goddess in the Peloponnesus.

Statues of her were also standing in the sanctuaries of other gods and in other places, such as a statue of Parian marble by Damophon in Messene. The scene in which Rhea gave Chronos a stone in the place of Zeus after his birth was assigned to have taken place on Petrakhos Mountain in Arcadia as well as on Mount Thaumasios in Arcadia, both of which were holy places:
: Mount Thaumasios (Wonderful) lies beyond the river Maloitas [in Arkadia], and the Methydrians hold that when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus, she came to this mountain and enlisted as her allies, in case Kronos should attack her, Hopladamos and his few Gigantes. They allow that she gave birth to her son on some part of Mount Lykaios, but they claim that here Kronos was deceived, and here took place the substitution of a stone for the child that is spoken of in the Greek legend. On the summit of the mountain is Rhea&#x27;s Cave, into which no human beings may enter save only the women who are sacred to the goddess.

The center of the worship of Rhea was however on Crete, where Mount Ida was said to be the birthplace of Zeus. Reportedly, there was a &quot;House of Rhea&quot; in Knossos:
: The Titanes had their dwelling in the land about Knosos [in Krete], at the place where even to this day men point out foundations of a house of Rhea and a cypress grove which has been consecrated to her from ancient times.

Upon Mount Ida, there was a cave sacred to Rhea:
: In Crete there is said to be a sacred cave full of bees. In it, as storytellers say, Rhea gave birth to Zeus; it is a sacred place and no one is to go near it, whether god or mortal. At the appointed time each year a great blaze is seen to come out of the cave. Their story goes on to say that this happens whenever the blood from the birth of Zeus begins to boil up. The sacred bees that were the nurses of Zeus occupy this cave.

== Iconography ==

Rhea only appears in Greek art from the fourth century BC, when her iconography draws on that of Cybele; the two therefore are often indistinguishable; both can be shown wearing a crown (either a Mural crown or a Polos), seated on a throne flanked by lions, riding a lion, and on a chariot drawn by two lions. In Roman religion, her counterpart Cybele was Magna Mater deorum Idaea, who was brought to Rome and was identified in as an ancestral Trojan deity. On a functional level, Rhea was thought equivalent to Roman Ops or &quot;Opis&quot;.

== Depiction in ancient literature ==
In Homer, Rhea is the mother of the gods, although not a universal mother like Cybele, the Phrygian Great Mother, with whom she was later identified.

In the &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius of Rhodes, the fusion of Rhea and Phrygian Cybele is completed. &quot;Upon the Mother depend the winds, the ocean, the whole earth beneath the snowy seat of Olympus; whenever she leaves the mountains and climbs to the great vault of heaven, Zeus himself, the son of Cronus, makes way, and all the other immortal gods likewise make way for the dread goddess,&quot; the seer Mopsus tells Jason in &quot;Argonautica&quot;; Jason climbed to the sanctuary high on Mount Dindymon to offer sacrifice and libations to placate the goddess, so that the Argonauts might continue on their way. For her &quot;temenos&quot; they wrought an image of the goddess, a &quot;xoanon&quot;, from a vine-stump. There &quot;they called upon the mother of Dindymon, mistress of all, the dweller in Phrygia, and with her Titias and Kyllenos who alone of the many Cretan Daktyls of Ida are called &#x27;guiders of destiny&#x27; and &#x27;those who sit beside the Idaean Mother&#x27;.&quot; They leapt and danced in their armour: &quot;For this reason the Phrygians still worship Rhea with tambourines and drums&quot;.

<text>Rhea () is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon in the Solar System, with a surface area that is comparable to the area of Australia. It is the smallest body in the Solar System for which precise measurements have confirmed a shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium. Rhea has a nearly circular orbit around Saturn, but it is also tidally locked, like Saturn&#x27;s other major moons; that is, it rotates with the same period it revolves (orbits), so one hemisphere always faces towards the planet.

The moon itself has a fairly low density, composed of roughly three-quarters ice and only one-quarter rock. The surface of Rhea is heavily cratered, with distinct leading and trailing hemispheres. Like the moon Dione, it has high-albedo ice cliffs that appear as bright wispy streaks visible from space. The surface temperature varies between −174 °C and −220 °C.

Rhea was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Since then, it has been visited by both Voyager probes and was the subject of close targeted flybys by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2011, and once more in 2013.

== Discovery ==
Rhea was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini on 23 December 1672, with a telescope made by Giuseppe Campani. Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus) &quot;Sidera Lodoicea&quot; (the stars of Louis) to honor King Louis XIV. Rhea was the second moon of Saturn that Cassini discovered, and the third moon discovered around Saturn overall.

==Name==
Rhea is named after the Titan Rhea of Greek mythology, the mother of the first generation of Olympian gods and wife of Cronus, the Greek counterpart of the god Saturn. It is also designated Saturn V (being the fifth major moon going outward from the planet, after Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione).

Astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them and Titan as &quot;Saturn I&quot; through &quot;Saturn V&quot;. Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered, in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to &quot;Saturn VII&quot;, and then to &quot;Saturn VIII&quot; with the discovery of Hyperion in 1848.

Rhea was not named until 1847, when John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of the planet Uranus and two other moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus) suggested in &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot; that the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Kronos (Saturn, in Roman mythology), be used.

== Orbit ==
The orbit of Rhea has very low eccentricity (0.001), meaning it is nearly circular. It has a low inclination of less than a degree, inclined by only 0.35° from Saturn&#x27;s equatorial plane.

Rhea is tidally locked and rotates synchronously; that is, it rotates at the same speed it revolves (orbits), so one hemisphere is always facing towards Saturn. This is called the near pole. Equally, one hemisphere always faces forward, relative to the direction of movement; this is called the leading hemisphere; the other side is the trailing hemisphere, which faces backwards relative to the moon&#x27;s motion.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Size, mass, and internal structure ===

Rhea is the second largest moon of Saturn, but with a mean diameter of 1,528 kilometers (949 miles) it is less than a third the radius of Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. Rhea is an icy body with a density of about 1.236 g/cm3. This low density indicates that it is made of ~25% rock (density ~3.25 g/cm3) and ~75% water ice (density ~0.93 g/cm3). A layer of Ice II (a high-pressure and extra-low temperature form of ice) is believed, based on the moon&#x27;s temperature profile, to start around beneath the surface. Saturn&#x27;s biggest moon. Although Rhea is the ninth-largest moon, it is only the tenth-most massive moon. Indeed, Oberon, the second-largest moon of Uranus, has almost the same size, but is significantly denser than Rhea (1.63 vs 1.24) and thus more massive, although Rhea is slightly larger by volume. The surface area of the moon can be estimated at , similar to Australia (7,688,287 km2).

Before the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission, it was assumed that Rhea had a rocky core. However, measurements taken during a close flyby by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter in 2005 cast this into doubt. In a paper published in 2007 it was claimed that the axial dimensionless moment of inertia coefficient was 0.4. Such a value indicated that Rhea had an almost homogeneous interior (with some compression of ice in the center) while the existence of a rocky core would imply a moment of inertia of about 0.34. In the same year, another paper claimed the moment of inertia was about 0.37. Rhea being either partially or fully differentiated would be consistent with the observations of the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe. A year later, yet another paper claimed that the moon may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning that the moment of inertia cannot be determined from the gravity data alone. In 2008, an author of the first paper tried to reconcile these three disparate results. He concluded that there is a systematic error in the &quot;Cassini&quot; radio Doppler data used in the analysis, but, after restricting the analysis to a subset of data obtained closest to the moon, he arrived at his old result that Rhea was in hydrostatic equilibrium and had a moment of inertia of about 0.4, again implying a homogeneous interior.

The triaxial shape of Rhea is consistent with a homogeneous body in hydrostatic equilibrium rotating at Rhea&#x27;s angular velocity. Modelling in 2006 suggested that Rhea could be barely capable of sustaining an internal liquid-water ocean through heating by radioactive decay; such an ocean would have to be at about 176 K, the eutectic temperature for the water–ammonia system. More recent indications are that Rhea has a homogeneous interior and hence that this ocean does not exist.

=== Surface features ===
Rhea&#x27;s features resemble those of Dione, with distinct and dissmillar leading and trailing hemispheres, suggesting similar composition and histories. The temperature on Rhea is 99 K (−174 °C) in direct sunlight and between 73 K (−200 °C) and 53 K (−220 °C) in the shade.

Rhea has a rather typical heavily cratered surface, with the exceptions of a few large Dione-type chasmata or fractures (formerly known as wispy terrain) on the trailing hemisphere (the side facing away from the direction of motion along Rhea&#x27;s orbit) and a very faint &quot;line&quot; of material at Rhea&#x27;s equator that may have been deposited by material deorbiting from its rings. Rhea has two very large impact basins on its hemisphere facing away from Saturn, which are about 400 and 500 km across. The more northerly and less degraded of the two, called Tirawa, is roughly comparable in size to the basin Odysseus on Tethys. There is a 48 km-diameter impact crater at 112°W that is prominent because of an extended system of bright rays, which extend up to away from the crater, across most of one hemisphere. This crater, called Inktomi, is nicknamed &quot;The Splat&quot;, and may be one of the youngest craters on the inner moons of Saturn. This was hypothesized in a 2007 paper published by &quot;Lunar and Planetary Science&quot;. Rhea&#x27;s impact craters are more crisply defined than the flatter craters that are pervasive on Ganymede and Callisto; it is theorized that this is due to a much lower surface gravity (0.26 m/s2, compared to Ganymede&#x27;s 1.428 m/s2 and Callisto&#x27;s 1.235 m/s2) and a stiffer crust of ice. Similarly, ejecta blankets – asymmetrical blankets of ejected particles surrounding impact craters – are not present on Rhea, potentially another result of the moon&#x27;s low surface gravity.

Its surface can be divided into two geologically different areas based on crater density; the first area contains craters which are larger than 40 km in diameter, whereas the second area, in parts of the polar and equatorial regions, has only craters under that size. This suggests that a major resurfacing event occurred some time during its formation. The leading hemisphere is heavily cratered and uniformly bright. As on Callisto, the craters lack the high relief features seen on the Moon and Mercury. It has been theorized that these cratered plains are up to four billion years old on average. On the trailing hemisphere there is a network of bright swaths on a dark background, and fewer craters. It is believed, based on data from the Cassini probe, that these are tectonic features: depressions (graben) and troughs, with ice-covered cliff sides causing the lines&#x27; whiteness (more technically their albedo). The extensive dark areas are thought to be deposited tholins, which are a mix of complex organic compounds generated on the ice by pyrolysis and radiolysis of simple compounds containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen. The trailing side of Rhea&#x27;s surface is irradiated by Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere, which may cause chemical-level changes on the surface, including radiolysis (see ). Particles from Saturn&#x27;s E-ring are also flung onto the moon&#x27;s leading hemisphere, coating it.

Rhea has some evidence of endogenic activity – that is, activity originating from within the moon, such as heating and cryovolcanic activity: there are fault systems and craters with uplifted bases (so-called &quot;relaxed&quot; craters), although the latter is apparently only present in large craters more than across.

==Formation==
The moons of Saturn are thought to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young giant planets formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. However, a model proposed by Erik Asphaug and Andreas Reufer for the formation of Titan may also shine a new light on the origin of Rhea and Iapetus. In this model, Titan was formed in a series of giant impacts between pre-existing moons, and Rhea and Iapetus are thought to have formed from part of the debris of these collisions.

== Atmosphere ==
On November 27, 2010, NASA announced the discovery of an extremely tenuous atmosphere—an exosphere. It consists of oxygen and carbon dioxide in proportion of roughly 5 to 2. The surface density of the exosphere is from 105 to 106 molecules in a cubic centimeter, depending on local temperature. The main source of oxygen is radiolysis of water ice at the surface via irradiation from the magnetosphere of Saturn. The source of the carbon dioxide is less clear, but it may be related to oxidation of the organics present in ice or to outgassing of the moon&#x27;s interior.

== Possible ring system ==

On March 6, 2008, NASA announced that Rhea may have a weak ring system. This would mark the first discovery of rings around a moon. The rings&#x27; existence was inferred by observed changes in the flow of electrons trapped by Saturn&#x27;s magnetic field as &quot;Cassini&quot; passed by Rhea. Dust and debris could extend out to Rhea&#x27;s Hill sphere, but were thought to be denser nearer the moon, with three narrow rings of higher density. The case for a ring was strengthened by the subsequent finding of the presence of a set of small ultraviolet-bright spots distributed along Rhea&#x27;s equator (interpreted as the impact points of deorbiting ring material). However, when &quot;Cassini&quot; made targeted observations of the putative ring plane from several angles, there was no evidence of ring material found, suggesting that another explanation for the earlier observations is needed.

== Exploration ==
The first images of Rhea were obtained by &quot;Voyager 1 &amp; 2&quot; spacecraft in 1980–1981.

There were five close targeted fly-bys by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, which was one part of the dual orbiter and lander &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission. Launched in 1997, &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; was targeted at the Saturn system; in total it took more than 450 thousand images. &quot;Cassini&quot; passed Rhea at a distance of 500 km on November 26, 2005; at a distance of 5,750 km on August 30, 2007; at a distance of 100 km on March 2, 2010; at 69 km flyby on January 11, 2011; and a last flyby at 992 km on March 9, 2013.

<text>Rheas ( ), also known as ñandus ( ) or South American ostrich, are South American ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) of the order Rheiformes. They are distantly related to the African ostriches and Australia&#x27;s emu (the largest and second-largest living ratites, respectively), with rheas placing just behind the emu in height and overall size. 

Most taxonomic authorities recognize two extant species: the greater or American rhea (&quot;Rhea americana&quot;), and the lesser or Darwin&#x27;s rhea (&quot;Rhea pennata&quot;). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the puna rhea as another species instead of a subspecies of the lesser rhea. The IUCN currently rates the greater and puna rheas as near-threatened in their native ranges, while Darwin&#x27;s rhea is of least concern, having recovered from past threats to its survival. In addition, the feral population of the greater rhea in Germany appears to be growing. However, control efforts are underway and seem to succeed in controlling the birds&#x27; population growth. Similarly to ostriches and emus, rheas are fairly popular livestock and pets, regularly kept and bred on farms, ranches, private parks, and by aviculturists, mainly in North and South America and Europe.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;rhea&quot; was used in 1752 by Paul Möhring and adopted as the English common name. Möhring named the rhea after the Greek Titan Rhea, whose Ancient Greek name () is thought to come from (&quot;éra&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;). This was fitting with the rhea being a flightless ground bird. Depending on the South American region, the rhea is known locally as (Guaraní –or related Tupi &quot;nhandú-gûasú&quot;– meaning &quot;big spider&quot; most probably concerning their habit of opening and lowering alternate wings when they run), (Portuguese), (Aymara and Quechua), or (Mapudungun). is the common name in many European languages and may sometimes be heard in English.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The genus &quot;Rhea&quot; was introduced by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the greater rhea (&quot;Rhea americana&quot;) as the type species.

===Extant species===
The genus contains two extant species and eight subspecies, although one subspecies is disputed:



&quot;Rhea pennata&quot; was not always in the genus &quot;Rhea&quot;. In 2008, the SACC, the last holdout, approved merging the genera &quot;Rhea&quot; and &quot;Pterocnemia&quot; on August 7, 2008. This merging of genera leaves only the genus &quot;Rhea&quot;. A former fourth species of rhea, &quot;Rhea nana&quot;, was described by Lydekker in 1894 based on a single egg found in Patagonia, but today no major authorities consider it valid.

===Fossils===
* †&quot;R. anchorenense&quot; [&quot;Rhea americana anchorenense&quot; ]
* †&quot;R. fossilis&quot; [&quot;Pterocnemia fossilis&quot; ; &quot;Rhea pampeana&quot; ]
* †&quot;R. mesopotamica&quot; [&quot;Pterocnemia mesopotamica&quot; ]
* †&quot;R. subpampeana&quot; 

==Description==

Rheas are large, flightless birds with grey-brown plumage, long legs, and long necks, similar to an ostrich. Large males of &quot;R. americana&quot; can reach tall at the head, at the back and can weigh up to . The lesser rhea is smaller, with a height of . Their wings are large for a flightless bird () and are spread while running, to act like sails. Unlike most birds, rheas have only three toes. Their tarsus has 18 to 22 horizontal plates on the front of it. They also store urine separately in an expansion of the cloaca.

==Distribution and habitat==

Rheas are from South America only and are limited within the continent to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. They are grassland birds, and both species prefer open land. The greater rheas live in open grasslands, pampas and woodlands. They prefer to breed near water and prefer lowlands, seldom going above . On the other hand, the lesser rhea will inhabit most shrubland, grassland, even desert salt puna up to .

=== Feral populations in Europe ===
A small population of rheas has emerged in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, northeastern Germany, after several couples escaped from an exotic meat farm near Lübeck in the late 1990s. Contrary to expectations, the large birds adapted well to conditions in the German countryside. A monitoring system has been in place since 2008. By 2014, there was already a population of well over 100 birds in an area of between the river Wakenitz and the A20 motorway, slowly expanding eastward.

The population grew steadily for several years. By autumn 2018, their numbers had significantly increased to about 600. As such, local farmers claim increasing damage to their fields, and some biologists say the rheas pose a growing risk to local wildlife. Still protected by German natural conservation law, a local discussion developed regarding how to handle the situation. Eventually, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania&#x27;s government allowed limited hunting of the birds, explicitly to just reduce the population&#x27;s growth and not to wipe them out. At this point, it was generally agreed that the rheas should be allowed to stay in the region. By spring 2021, just 247 rheas were counted; this development was attributed to both the hunting and the increased caution of the animals. Several had begun to avoid humans more than previously and retreated into the woods. Some members of this rhea population have also expanded into other areas; at least twice individual rheas who probably originated in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania were sighted in Brandenburg&#x27;s High Fläming Nature Park, over from their usual range. By early 2023, 91 rheas were counted in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; the population decline was attributed to both hunting as well as harsher weather of previous years. By this point, German authorities believed a stable population of 50 adult birds would be optimal for the local ecosystem and agriculture. Researchers concluded that the feral population was subject to substantial fluctuations but remained healthy, adaptable, and entrenched in the area.

There also appears to be a small population of wild rheas in the United Kingdom. In March 2021, about 20 rheas were reportedly running free on a residential estate in Hertfordshire. Local police could not identify any owner, so they assumed they were wild birds. Once caught, authorities intend to place them in a suitable nature reserve to allow them to develop as a colony.

==Behavior==
===Individual and flocking===
Rheas tend to be silent birds, except when they are chicks or the male seeks a mate. During the breeding season, the male will attempt to attract females by calling. This call is a loud booming noise. While calling like this, they will lift the front of their body and ruffle their plumage, all while keeping their neck stiff. They will then extend and raise their wings and run short distances, alternating with their wings. He may then single out a female and walk alongside or in front of her with a lowered head and spread wings. If the female notices him, he will wave his neck back and forth in a figure eight. Finally, a female may offer herself, and copulation will commence.

During the non-breeding season they may form flocks of between 20 and 25 birds, although the lesser rhea forms smaller flocks than this. When in danger, they flee in a zigzag course, using one wing and the other, similar to a rudder. During the breeding season, the flocks break up.

===Diet===
Mostly, rheas are herbivorous and prefer broad-leafed plants, but they also eat fruits, seeds, roots, and insects such as grasshoppers, small reptiles, and rodents. Young rheas eat only insects for the first few days. Outside the breeding season, they gather in flocks and feed with deer and cattle.

===Reproduction===
Rheas are polygynandrous, with males courting between two and twelve females and females commonly mating with multiple dominant males during the breeding season. After mating, the male builds a nest where each female lays eggs. The nest is a simple scrape in the ground, lined with grass and leaves. The male incubates from ten to sixty eggs. The male will use a decoy system and place some eggs outside the nest, then sacrifice these to predators so they do not attempt to get inside the nest. The male may use another subordinate male to incubate his eggs while he finds another group of females to start a second nest with. The chicks hatch within 36 hours of each other. Right before hatching, the chicks begin to whistle. The group of females, meanwhile, may move on and mate with other males. While caring for the young, the males will charge at any perceived threat approaching the chicks, including female rheas and humans. The young reach full adult size in about six months but do not breed until they reach two years of age.

==Status and conservation==
The numbers of the greater and puna rhea are decreasing as their habitats shrink. Both are considered near threatened by the IUCN. The IUCN also states that they are both approaching vulnerable status. The lesser rhea is classified as least concern.

==Human interaction==
Rheas have many uses in South America. Feathers are used for feather dusters, skins are used for cloaks or leather, and their meat is a staple to many people.

Gauchos traditionally hunt rheas on horseback, throwing &quot;bolas&quot; or &quot;boleadoras&quot;—a throwing device consisting of three balls joined by rope—at their legs, which immobilises the bird. The rhea is pictured on Argentina&#x27;s 1-centavo coin minted in 1987, and on the Uruguayan 5-peso coin.

<text>An experiment is a procedure carried out to support or refute a hypothesis, or determine the efficacy or likelihood of something previously untried. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exist natural experimental studies.

A child may carry out basic experiments to understand how things fall to the ground, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time. Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences.

Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variables.

==Overview==
In the scientific method, an experiment is an empirical procedure that arbitrates competing models or hypotheses. Researchers also use experimentation to test existing theories or new hypotheses to support or disprove them.

An experiment usually tests a hypothesis, which is an expectation about how a particular process or phenomenon works. However, an experiment may also aim to answer a &quot;what-if&quot; question, without a specific expectation about what the experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results. If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either support or disprove the hypothesis. According to some philosophies of science, an experiment can never &quot;prove&quot; a hypothesis, it can only add support. On the other hand, an experiment that provides a counterexample can disprove a theory or hypothesis, but a theory can always be salvaged by appropriate ad hoc modifications at the expense of simplicity.

An experiment must also control the possible confounding factors—any factors that would mar the accuracy or repeatability of the experiment or the ability to interpret the results. Confounding is commonly eliminated through scientific controls and/or, in randomized experiments, through random assignment.

In engineering and the physical sciences, experiments are a primary component of the scientific method. They are used to test theories and hypotheses about how physical processes work under particular conditions (e.g., whether a particular engineering process can produce a desired chemical compound). Typically, experiments in these fields focus on replication of identical procedures in hopes of producing identical results in each replication. Random assignment is uncommon.

In medicine and the social sciences, the prevalence of experimental research varies widely across disciplines. When used, however, experiments typically follow the form of the clinical trial, where experimental units (usually individual human beings) are randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition where one or more outcomes are assessed. In contrast to norms in the physical sciences, the focus is typically on the average treatment effect (the difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups) or another test statistic produced by the experiment. A single study typically does not involve replications of the experiment, but separate studies may be aggregated through systematic review and meta-analysis.

There are various differences in experimental practice in each of the branches of science. For example, agricultural research frequently uses randomized experiments (e.g., to test the comparative effectiveness of different fertilizers), while experimental economics often involves experimental tests of theorized human behaviors without relying on random assignment of individuals to treatment and control conditions.

==History==
One of the first methodical approaches to experiments in the modern sense is visible in the works of the Arab mathematician and scholar Ibn al-Haytham. He conducted his experiments in the field of optics—going back to optical and mathematical problems in the works of Ptolemy—by controlling his experiments due to factors such as self-criticality, reliance on visible results of the experiments as well as a criticality in terms of earlier results. He was one of the first scholars to use an inductive-experimental method for achieving results. In his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; he describes the fundamentally new approach to knowledge and research in an experimental sense:

According to his explanation, a strictly controlled test execution with a sensibility for the subjectivity and susceptibility of outcomes due to the nature of man is necessary. Furthermore, a critical view on the results and outcomes of earlier scholars is necessary:

Thus, a comparison of earlier results with the experimental results is necessary for an objective experiment—the visible results being more important. In the end, this may mean that an experimental researcher must find enough courage to discard traditional opinions or results, especially if these results are not experimental but results from a logical/ mental derivation. In this process of critical consideration, the man himself should not forget that he tends to subjective opinions—through &quot;prejudices&quot; and &quot;leniency&quot;—and thus has to be critical about his own way of building hypotheses. 

Francis Bacon (1561–1626), an English philosopher and scientist active in the 17th century, became an influential supporter of experimental science in the English renaissance. He disagreed with the method of answering scientific questions by deduction—similar to Ibn al-Haytham—and described it as follows: &quot;Having first determined the question according to his will, man then resorts to experience, and bending her to conformity with his placets, leads her about like a captive in a procession.&quot; Bacon wanted a method that relied on repeatable observations, or experiments. Notably, he first ordered the scientific method as we understand it today. 

In the centuries that followed, people who applied the scientific method in different areas made important advances and discoveries. For example, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) accurately measured time and experimented to make accurate measurements and conclusions about the speed of a falling body. Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), a French chemist, used experiment to describe new areas, such as combustion and biochemistry and to develop the theory of conservation of mass (matter). Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) used the scientific method to disprove the prevailing theory of spontaneous generation and to develop the germ theory of disease. Because of the importance of controlling potentially confounding variables, the use of well-designed laboratory experiments is preferred when possible.

A considerable amount of progress on the design and analysis of experiments occurred in the early 20th century, with contributions from statisticians such as Ronald Fisher (1890–1962), Jerzy Neyman (1894–1981), Oscar Kempthorne (1919–2000), Gertrude Mary Cox (1900–1978), and William Gemmell Cochran (1909–1980), among others.

==Types ==
Experiments might be categorized according to a number of dimensions, depending upon professional norms and standards in different fields of study.

In some disciplines (e.g., psychology or political science), a &#x27;true experiment&#x27; is a method of social research in which there are two kinds of variables. The independent variable is manipulated by the experimenter, and the dependent variable is measured. The signifying characteristic of a true experiment is that it randomly allocates the subjects to neutralize experimenter bias, and ensures, over a large number of iterations of the experiment, that it controls for all confounding factors.

Depending on the discipline, experiments can be conducted to accomplish different but not mutually exclusive goals: test theories, search for and document phenomena, develop theories, or advise policymakers. These goals also relate differently to validity concerns.

===Controlled experiments===
A controlled experiment often compares the results obtained from experimental samples against &quot;control&quot; samples, which are practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect whose effect is being tested (the independent variable). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group (treatment group); and the one receiving the placebo or regular treatment would be the control one. In many laboratory experiments it is good practice to have several replicate samples for the test being performed and have both a positive control and a negative control. The results from replicate samples can often be averaged, or if one of the replicates is obviously inconsistent with the results from the other samples, it can be discarded as being the result of an experimental error (some step of the test procedure may have been mistakenly omitted for that sample). Most often, tests are done in duplicate or triplicate. A positive control is a procedure similar to the actual experimental test but is known from previous experience to give a positive result. A negative control is known to give a negative result. The positive control confirms that the basic conditions of the experiment were able to produce a positive result, even if none of the actual experimental samples produce a positive result. The negative control demonstrates the base-line result obtained when a test does not produce a measurable positive result. Most often the value of the negative control is treated as a &quot;background&quot; value to subtract from the test sample results. Sometimes the positive control takes the quadrant of a standard curve.

An example that is often used in teaching laboratories is a controlled protein assay. Students might be given a fluid sample containing an unknown (to the student) amount of protein. It is their job to correctly perform a controlled experiment in which they determine the concentration of protein in the fluid sample (usually called the &quot;unknown sample&quot;). The teaching lab would be equipped with a protein standard solution with a known protein concentration. Students could make several positive control samples containing various dilutions of the protein standard. Negative control samples would contain all of the reagents for the protein assay but no protein. In this example, all samples are performed in duplicate. The assay is a colorimetric assay in which a spectrophotometer can measure the amount of protein in samples by detecting a colored complex formed by the interaction of protein molecules and molecules of an added dye. In the illustration, the results for the diluted test samples can be compared to the results of the standard curve (the blue line in the illustration) to estimate the amount of protein in the unknown sample.

Controlled experiments can be performed when it is difficult to exactly control all the conditions in an experiment. In this case, the experiment begins by creating two or more sample groups that are probabilistically equivalent, which means that measurements of traits should be similar among the groups and that the groups should respond in the same manner if given the same treatment. This equivalency is determined by statistical methods that take into account the amount of variation between individuals and the number of individuals in each group. In fields such as microbiology and chemistry, where there is very little variation between individuals and the group size is easily in the millions, these statistical methods are often bypassed and simply splitting a solution into equal parts is assumed to produce identical sample groups.

Once equivalent groups have been formed, the experimenter tries to treat them identically except for the one &quot;variable&quot; that he or she wishes to isolate. Human experimentation requires special safeguards against outside variables such as the &quot;placebo effect&quot;. Such experiments are generally &quot;double blind&quot;, meaning that neither the volunteer nor the researcher knows which individuals are in the control group or the experimental group until after all of the data have been collected. This ensures that any effects on the volunteer are due to the treatment itself and are not a response to the knowledge that he is being treated.

In human experiments, researchers may give a subject (person) a stimulus that the subject responds to. The goal of the experiment is to measure the response to the stimulus by a test method.

In the design of experiments, two or more &quot;treatments&quot; are applied to estimate the difference between the mean responses for the treatments. For example, an experiment on baking bread could estimate the difference in the responses associated with quantitative variables, such as the ratio of water to flour, and with qualitative variables, such as strains of yeast. Experimentation is the step in the scientific method that helps people decide between two or more competing explanations—or hypotheses. These hypotheses suggest reasons to explain a phenomenon or predict the results of an action. An example might be the hypothesis that &quot;if I release this ball, it will fall to the floor&quot;: this suggestion can then be tested by carrying out the experiment of letting go of the ball, and observing the results. Formally, a hypothesis is compared against its opposite or null hypothesis (&quot;if I release this ball, it will not fall to the floor&quot;). The null hypothesis is that there is no explanation or predictive power of the phenomenon through the reasoning that is being investigated. Once hypotheses are defined, an experiment can be carried out and the results analysed to confirm, refute, or define the accuracy of the hypotheses.

Experiments can be also designed to estimate spillover effects onto nearby untreated units.

=== Natural experiments ===

The term &quot;experiment&quot; usually implies a controlled experiment, but sometimes controlled experiments are prohibitively difficult, impossible, unethical or illegal. In this case researchers resort to natural experiments or quasi-experiments. Natural experiments rely solely on observations of the variables of the system under study, rather than manipulation of just one or a few variables as occurs in controlled experiments. To the degree possible, they attempt to collect data for the system in such a way that contribution from all variables can be determined, and where the effects of variation in certain variables remain approximately constant so that the effects of other variables can be discerned. The degree to which this is possible depends on the observed correlation between explanatory variables in the observed data. When these variables are &quot;not&quot; well correlated, natural experiments can approach the power of controlled experiments. Usually, however, there is some correlation between these variables, which reduces the reliability of natural experiments relative to what could be concluded if a controlled experiment were performed. Also, because natural experiments usually take place in uncontrolled environments, variables from undetected sources are neither measured nor held constant, and these may produce illusory correlations in variables under study.

Much research in several science disciplines, including economics, human geography, archaeology, sociology, cultural anthropology, geology, paleontology, ecology, meteorology, and astronomy, relies on quasi-experiments. For example, in astronomy it is clearly impossible, when testing the hypothesis &quot;Stars are collapsed clouds of hydrogen&quot;, to start out with a giant cloud of hydrogen, and then perform the experiment of waiting a few billion years for it to form a star. However, by observing various clouds of hydrogen in various states of collapse, and other implications of the hypothesis (for example, the presence of various spectral emissions from the light of stars), we can collect data we require to support the hypothesis. An early example of this type of experiment was the first verification in the 17th century that light does not travel from place to place instantaneously, but instead has a measurable speed. Observation of the appearance of the moons of Jupiter were slightly delayed when Jupiter was farther from Earth, as opposed to when Jupiter was closer to Earth; and this phenomenon was used to demonstrate that the difference in the time of appearance of the moons was consistent with a measurable speed.

=== Field experiments ===
Field experiments are so named to distinguish them from laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher external validity than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.

==Observational studies ==
An observational study is used when it is impractical, unethical, cost-prohibitive (or otherwise inefficient) to fit a physical or social system into a laboratory setting, to completely control confounding factors, or to apply random assignment. It can also be used when confounding factors are either limited or known well enough to analyze the data in light of them (though this may be rare when social phenomena are under examination). For an observational science to be valid, the experimenter must know and account for confounding factors. In these situations, observational studies have value because they often suggest hypotheses that can be tested with randomized experiments or by collecting fresh data.

Fundamentally, however, observational studies are not experiments. By definition, observational studies lack the manipulation required for Baconian experiments. In addition, observational studies (e.g., in biological or social systems) often involve variables that are difficult to quantify or control. Observational studies are limited because they lack the statistical properties of randomized experiments. In a randomized experiment, the method of randomization specified in the experimental protocol guides the statistical analysis, which is usually specified also by the experimental protocol. Without a statistical model that reflects an objective randomization, the statistical analysis relies on a subjective model. Inferences from subjective models are unreliable in theory and practice. In fact, there are several cases where carefully conducted observational studies consistently give wrong results, that is, where the results of the observational studies are inconsistent and also differ from the results of experiments. For example, epidemiological studies of colon cancer consistently show beneficial correlations with broccoli consumption, while experiments find no benefit.

A particular problem with observational studies involving human subjects is the great difficulty attaining fair comparisons between treatments (or exposures), because such studies are prone to selection bias, and groups receiving different treatments (exposures) may differ greatly according to their covariates (age, height, weight, medications, exercise, nutritional status, ethnicity, family medical history, etc.). In contrast, randomization implies that for each covariate, the mean for each group is expected to be the same. For any randomized trial, some variation from the mean is expected, of course, but the randomization ensures that the experimental groups have mean values that are close, due to the central limit theorem and Markov&#x27;s inequality. With inadequate randomization or low sample size, the systematic variation in covariates between the treatment groups (or exposure groups) makes it difficult to separate the effect of the treatment (exposure) from the effects of the other covariates, most of which have not been measured. The mathematical models used to analyze such data must consider each differing covariate (if measured), and results are not meaningful if a covariate is neither randomized nor included in the model.

To avoid conditions that render an experiment far less useful, physicians conducting medical trials—say for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval—quantify and randomize the covariates that can be identified. Researchers attempt to reduce the biases of observational studies with matching methods such as propensity score matching, which require large populations of subjects and extensive information on covariates. However, propensity score matching is no longer recommended as a technique because it can increase, rather than decrease, bias. Outcomes are also quantified when possible (bone density, the amount of some cell or substance in the blood, physical strength or endurance, etc.) and not based on a subject&#x27;s or a professional observer&#x27;s opinion. In this way, the design of an observational study can render the results more objective and therefore, more convincing.

== Ethics ==
By placing the distribution of the independent variable(s) under the control of the researcher, an experiment—particularly when it involves human subjects—introduces potential ethical considerations, such as balancing benefit and harm, fairly distributing interventions (e.g., treatments for a disease), and informed consent. For example, in psychology or health care, it is unethical to provide a substandard treatment to patients. Therefore, ethical review boards are supposed to stop clinical trials and other experiments unless a new treatment is believed to offer benefits as good as current best practice. It is also generally unethical (and often illegal) to conduct randomized experiments on the effects of substandard or harmful treatments, such as the effects of ingesting arsenic on human health. To understand the effects of such exposures, scientists sometimes use observational studies to understand the effects of those factors.

Even when experimental research does not directly involve human subjects, it may still present ethical concerns. For example, the nuclear bomb experiments conducted by the Manhattan Project implied the use of nuclear reactions to harm human beings even though the experiments did not directly involve any human subjects.

<doc id="59862" wikidata="Q1366809" url="?curid=59862" title="Escape Velocity (video game)">
<text>Escape Velocity is a single-player role-playing space trading and combat video game series first introduced in 1996 by Ambrosia Software for the Macintosh. Two other similar games based on the original, &quot;EV Override&quot; and &quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot;, followed in 1998 and 2002 respectively, the latter of which is also available on Microsoft Windows. In addition there is a trading card game available based on the storyline of the &quot;EV Nova&quot; universe.

The series was created as a joint effort between several people and groups. Matt Burch programmed all three games in their entirety except for the registration system and various libraries. He also devised and created the scenario for the first game. Ambrosia Software, headed by Andrew Welch, managed marketing, registration, and distribution, as well as providing several external libraries used by the games. Early test versions of the game went by the name &#x27;Merc&#x27; (short for &#x27;mercenary&#x27;). Peter Cartwright wrote the scenario for &quot;EV Override&quot; and the Australian company ATMOS created the scenario of &quot;EV Nova&quot;; both originated as plug-ins for the preceding games before being picked up by Ambrosia as sequels. The fighter pilot voices in the original game were provided by Patrick Delahanty. A plug-in of additional phrases was also created and later included as part of &quot;EV Override&quot;.

A remake of &quot;EV Override&quot; named &quot;Cosmic Frontier: Override&quot; was launched on April 21, 2020, by Peter Cartwright, scenario designer at Ambrosia Software, and reached its funding goal on May 24, 2020.

==Licensing and technical features==
The first two &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; games are only available in their original forms for the Apple Macintosh and are Classic-only. &quot;EV Nova&quot; is a Carbon application and runs natively on both the original Mac OS and Mac OS X, and has been ported to Windows. Version 1.1.0 of &quot;EV Nova&quot;, released in December 2008, is a Universal Binary, and runs natively on Intel-based Macs. Adapted versions of the scenarios of the first two games that run natively in &quot;EV Nova&quot; are available for free.

This series follows the general licensing rule for Ambrosia Software. All three games are shareware. Ambrosia&#x27;s shareware system allows most distribution of unregistered games. Copies of the first two &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; games will work without limitation for 30 days. Afterwards, the player is simply reminded at startup that they have not registered, and told how many times they have run the game, as well as for how many hours it has been run. There is also the character called &#x27;Cap&#x27;n Hector&#x27; (named after Ambrosia&#x27;s mascot and office parrot) who reminds the player to register. During the trial this is done by flying by the player&#x27;s ship and sending a message. After the trial period has expired, the character starts attacking the player, but in &quot;EV Override&quot;, Cap&#x27;n Hector also steals the player&#x27;s credits. Players can not damage Cap&#x27;n Hector directly, though in the original game it was possible for splash damage to disable or destroy her ship.

An unregistered copy of &quot;EV Nova&quot; is more limited. In addition to the attacks by Cap&#x27;n Hector, certain ships and technologies cannot be obtained after the thirty-day trial ends, and even before then, the game&#x27;s story lines stop about two thirds of the way through, and plug-ins are not supported. Once the game has been registered, Cap&#x27;n Hector and all of the other restrictions disappear from the game.

The entire series features an open-ended plug-in architecture, allowing new scenarios to be written by users. This technology is based on the Macintosh resource fork format, making it possible to develop plug-ins without using any purpose-designed editors (though several editors exist and are popular since they make the task much easier). Since Windows does not support resource forks and it is therefore impossible to preserve them when transferring files to Windows-based computers, an alternate format and a conversion system were devised for the Windows version of the game.

==Gameplay==
Much of the game takes place in two-dimensional space, with the player flying a ship from a third-person overhead perspective. The player has the option of engaging in both combat and trade. Players are able to fly through hundreds of star systems, which are connected to each other by hyperlinks. Ships travel between star systems along the hyperlinks by engaging their hyperdrive, a form of faster-than-light travel. In Nova, wormholes or hypergates may also be utilized for instantaneous travel. Most systems contain stellar objects such as planets and space stations. Players can land on these objects, where they may be given the option to trade, gain missions, and purchase new spaceships or add-on outfits for their current spaceship. The plot is advanced through missions available from facilities on planets as well as NPCs flying through space. Players can choose which missions to follow and which governments to form a good relationship with or to be entirely neutral. They can choose to be a trader or a mercenary or an asteroid miner among a number of things or a combination of several.

The three games are alike in gameplay only; the universe and plot are completely separate and unrelated between the releases (though &quot;EV Nova&quot; contains the Kestrel from &quot;EV&quot; with a description of being from another universe). Each release&#x27;s engine contains improvements on the previous version, although by far the most significant improvements were made in the third release.

A turbo boost can be acquired which, when activated, plays an audio clip from the introduction to the British television program &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Occasionally the player will encounter Sinistar, including his voice files.

==Premise==
The plot of the original &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; involves disputes between the Confederation government and a Rebellion against it. As noted earlier, the player may choose sides (or not) based on who they believe is right, who they believe is stronger, who they believe it is more profitable to support, or any other criteria. The player begins with a shuttlecraft resembling those from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

===Governments===
The &quot;Confederation&quot; is one of two main governments in the original game. According to the game, as humanity expanded into the Milky Way galaxy, the new colonies operated independently of each other. However, an invasion by an unknown alien race forced the colonies to unify under Earth&#x27;s leadership. This became known as the Confederation. The Confederation and the aliens fought a bloody war, with millions of humans being killed. Eventually the Confederation prevailed. At the start of the game, the Confederation and the Rebellion are locked in a bloody stalemate. The Confederation uses four ships in its military, namely the Confederate Patrol Ship, the Confederate Gunboat, the Confederate Frigate and the Confederate Cruiser.

The &quot;Rebellion&quot; is the other main government in &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;. According to the game, after winning the war with the aliens, the Confederation did not relinquish its naval power and began exploiting the resources of the outer worlds. Those worlds eventually seceded, provoking a civil war. The Rebellion is in turn criticized for its aggressive nature, support of quasi-criminal organizations, and attacks on civilian shipping and liners. The Rebellion uses four ships in their campaign against the Confederation, namely the Manta, the Rebel Destroyer, the Rebel Cruiser and the Escort Carrier, the last of which is seen only when the player is working for the Confederation.

The &quot;Cydonians&quot; of &quot;New Cydonia&quot; and &quot;Letheans&quot; of &quot;Lethe Prime&quot; occupy two systems in the galactic southeast of the galaxy and are also locked in a war over water rights at the start of the game; more specific information regarding the conflict is never provided. Both sides utilize the Defender, the Argosy, and the Corvette when fighting in space. The Cydonians also use the Lightning, whereas the Letheans supplement these ships with the Rapier.

The game also includes several trading corporations, including &quot;Starbound Shipping&quot;, &quot;Consolidated Express&quot;, and &quot;United Galactic Express&quot;. Starbound Shipping and United Galactic Express are both in direct (and sometimes violent) competition with Consolidated Express, and are therefore de facto allies. &quot;Astex Mining Corporation&quot; is a mining company that works exclusively for the Confederation, and as a result is often targeted by the Rebellion and its sympathizers.

The &quot;Artemis Group&quot; are a family run organization devoted to eliminating pirates as well as ensure the galactic order remains balanced. They attempt to prevent either the Confederation or Rebellion from winning the civil war.

The starting planet, &quot;Levo&quot;, which is in a system by the same name, has a militia patrolling it to defend it from Pirates, though Pirates never appear in the system except when following the player because of valuable cargo in their possession.

There are a number of Pirates in the game, who immediately attempt to destroy any non-Pirate ship they spot, with the exception of the player once they have achieved a high combat rating. The Pirates do not plunder their targets due to limitations in the game; the player, however, is allowed to board ships, and may from there steal money, cargo, fuel, or ammunition, or attempt to capture the ship for use as their own or as an escort. Another key detail, Pirates may board the player&#x27;s ship if they disable it. In &quot;EV Nova&quot;, Pirates do board and plunder ships, including the player&#x27;s.

==Reception==
&quot;MacUser&quot; named &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; the best shareware game of 1996.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Escape Velocity&quot; has two sequels: &quot;Override&quot; (1998) and &quot;Nova&quot; (2002).

Many subsequent games explicitly cite &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; as an or the primary influence on their design, such as &quot;3030 Deathwar&quot;, &quot;Endless Sky&quot;, &quot;Gaia Beyond&quot;, &quot;Space RPG&quot;, and &quot;Naev&quot;.

<text>In physics, a correspondence principle is any one of several premises or assertions about the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. 
The physicist Niels Bohr coined the term in 1920 during the early development of quantum theory; he used it to explain how quantized classical orbitals connect to quantum radiation. 
Modern sources often use the term for the idea that the behavior of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers: for large orbits and for large energies, quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations. A &quot;generalized&quot; correspondence principle refers to the requirement for a broad set of connections between any old and new theory.

== History ==
Max Planck was the first to introduce the idea of quanta of energy, while studying black-body radiation in 1900. In 1906, he was also the first to write that quantum theory should replicate classical mechanics at some limit, particularly if the Planck constant &quot;h&quot; were taken to be infinitesimal. With this idea, he showed that Planck&#x27;s law for thermal radiation leads to the Rayleigh–Jeans law, the classical prediction (valid for large wavelength).

Niels Bohr used a similar idea, while developing his model of the atom. In 1913, he provided the first postulates of what is now known as old quantum theory. Using these postulates he obtained that for the hydrogen atom, the energy spectrum approaches the classical continuum for large &quot;n&quot; (a quantum number that encodes the energy of the orbit). Bohr coined the term &quot;correspondence principle&quot; during a lecture in 1920.

Arnold Sommerfeld refined Bohr&#x27;s theory leading to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. Sommerfeld referred to the correspondence principle as Bohr&#x27;s magic wand (), in 1921.

=== Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle ===

The seeds of Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle appeared from two sources. First Sommerfeld and Max Born developed a &quot;quantization procedure&quot; based on the action angle variables of classical Hamiltonian mechanics. This gave a mathematical foundation for stationary states of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model of the atom. The second seed was Albert Einstein&#x27;s quantum derivation of Planck&#x27;s law in 1916. Einstein developed the statistical mechanics for Bohr-model atoms interacting with electromagnetic radiation, leading to absorption and two kinds of emission, spontaneous and stimulated emission. But for Bohr the important result was the use of classical analogies and the Bohr atomic model to fix inconsistencies in Planck&#x27;s derivation of the blackbody radiation formula.

Bohr used the word &quot;correspondence&quot; in italics in lectures and writing before calling it a correspondence principle. He viewed this as a correspondence between quantum motion and radiation, not between classical and quantum theories. He writes in 1920 that there exists &quot;a far-reaching correspondence between the various types of possible transitions between the stationary states on the one hand and the various harmonic components of the motion on the other hand.&quot;

Bohr&#x27;s first article containing the definition of the correspondence principle was in 1923, in a summary paper entitled (in the English translation) &quot;On the application of quantum theory to atomic structure&quot;. In his chapter II, &quot;The process of radiation&quot;, he defines his correspondence principle as a condition connecting harmonic components of the electron moment to the possible occurrence of a radiative transition. In modern terms, this condition is a selection rule, saying that a given quantum jump is possible if and only if a particular type of motion exists in the corresponding classical model.

Following his definition of the correspondence principle, Bohr describes two applications. First he shows that the frequency of emitted radiation is related to an integral which can be well approximated by a sum when the quantum numbers inside the integral are large compared with their differences. Similarly he shows a relationship for the intensities of spectral lines and thus the rates at which quantum jumps occur.
These asymptotic relationships are expressed by Bohr as consequences of his general correspondence principle. However, historically each of these applications have been called &quot;the correspondence principle&quot;.

The PhD dissertation of Hans Kramers working in Bohr&#x27;s group in Copenhagen applied Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle to account for all of the known facts of the spectroscopic Stark effect, including some spectral components not known at the time of Kramers work.
Sommerfeld had been skeptical of the correspondence principle as it did not seem to be a consequence of a fundamental theory; Kramers&#x27; work convinced him that the principle had heuristic utility nevertheless. Other physicists picked up the concept, including work by John Van Vleck and by Kramers and Heisenberg on dispersion theory. The principle became a cornerstone of the semi-classical Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic theory;
Bohr&#x27;s 1922 Nobel prize was partly awarded for his work with the correspondence principle.

Despite the successes, the physical theories based on the principle faced increasing challenges in the early 1920s. Theoretical calculations by Van Vleck and by Kramers of the ionization potential of Helium disagreed significantly with experimental values. Bohr, Kramers, and John C. Slater responded with a new theoretical approach now called the BKS theory based on the correspondence principle but disavowing conservation of energy. Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli criticized the new approach, and the Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment showed that energy was conserved in quantum collisions.

With the existing theories in conflict with observations, two new quantum mechanics concepts arose. First, Heisenberg&#x27;s 1925 &quot;Umdeutung&quot; paper on matrix mechanics was inspired by the correspondence principle, although he did not cite Bohr. Further development in collaboration with Pascual Jordan and Max Born resulted in a mathematical model without connection to the principle. Second, Schrodinger&#x27;s wave mechanics in the following year similarly did not use the principle. Both pictures were later shown to be equivalent and accurate enough to replace old quantum theory. These approaches have no atomic orbits: the correspondence is more of an analogy than a principle.

=== Dirac&#x27;s correspondence ===
Paul Dirac developed significant portions of the new quantum theory in the second half of the 1920s. While he did not apply Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle, he developed a different, more formal classical–quantum correspondence. Dirac connected the structures of classical mechanics known as Poisson brackets to analogous structures of quantum mechanics known as commutators:
formula_1
By this correspondence, now called canonical quantization, Dirac showed how the mathematical form of classical mechanics could be recast as a basis for the new mathematics of quantum mechanics.

Dirac developed these connections by studying the work of Heisenberg and Kramers on dispersion, work that was directly built on Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle; the Dirac approach provides a mathematically sound path towards Bohr&#x27;s goal of a connection between classical and quantum mechanics. While Dirac did not call this correspondence a &quot;principle&quot;, physics textbooks refer to his connections a &quot;correspondence principle&quot;.

=== The classical limit of wave mechanics ===

The outstanding success of classical mechanics in the description of natural phenomena up to the 20th century means that quantum mechanics must do as well in similar circumstances. 
One way to quantitatively define this concept is to require quantum mechanical theories to produce classical mechanics results as the quantum of action goes to zero, formula_2. This transition can be accomplished in two different ways.

First, the particle can be approximated by a wave packet, and the indefinite spread of the packet with time can be ignored. In 1927, Paul Ehrenfest proved his namesake theorem that showed that Newton&#x27;s laws of motion hold on average in quantum mechanics: the quantum statistical expectation value of the position and momentum obey Newton&#x27;s laws.

Second, the individual particle view can be replaced with a statistical mixture of classical particles with a density matching the quantum probability density. This approach led to the concept of semiclassical physics, beginning with the development of WKB approximation used in descriptions of quantum tunneling for example.

==Modern view==
While Bohr viewed &quot;correspondence&quot; as principle aiding his description of quantum phenomena, fundamental differences between the mathematical structure of quantum and of classical mechanics prevents correspondence in many cases. Rather than a principle, &quot;there may be in some situations an approximate correspondence between classical and quantum concepts,&quot; physicist Asher Peres put it. Since quantum mechanics operates in a discrete space and classical mechanics in a continuous one, any correspondence will be necessarily fuzzy and elusive.

Introductory quantum mechanics textbooks suggest that quantum mechanics goes over to classical theory in the limit of high quantum numbers or in a limit where the Planck constant in the quantum formula is reduced to zero, formula_2. However such correspondence is not always possible. For example, classical systems can exhibit chaotic orbits which diverge but quantum states are unitary and maintain a fixed overlap.

===Generalized correspondence principle===

The term &quot;generalized correspondence principle&quot; has been used in the study of the history of science to mean the reduction of a new scientific theory to an earlier scientific theory in appropriate circumstances. This requires that the new theory explain all the phenomena under circumstances for which the preceding theory was known to be valid; it also means that new theory will retain large parts of the older theory. The generalized principle applies correspondence across aspects of a complete theory, not just a single formula as in the classical limit correspondence. For example, Albert Einstein in his 1905 work on relativity noted that classical mechanics relied on Galilean relativity while electromagnetism did not, and yet both work well. He produced a new theory that combined them in a away that reduced to these separate theories in approximations.
Ironically the singular failure of this &quot;generalized correspondence principle&quot; concept of scientific theories is the replacement of classical mechanics with quantum mechanics.

<text>A secure cryptoprocessor is a dedicated computer-on-a-chip or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance. Unlike cryptographic processors that output decrypted data onto a bus in a secure environment, a secure cryptoprocessor does not output decrypted data or decrypted program instructions in an environment where security cannot always be maintained.

The purpose of a secure cryptoprocessor is to act as the keystone of a security subsystem, eliminating the need to protect the rest of the subsystem with physical security measures.

==Examples==
A hardware security module (HSM) contains one or more secure cryptoprocessor chips. These devices are high grade secure cryptoprocessors used with enterprise servers. A hardware security module can have multiple levels of physical security with a single-chip cryptoprocessor as its most secure component. The cryptoprocessor does not reveal keys or executable instructions on a bus, except in encrypted form, and zeros keys by attempts at probing or scanning. The crypto chip(s) may also be potted in the hardware security module with other processors and memory chips that store and process encrypted data. Any attempt to remove the potting will cause the keys in the crypto chip to be zeroed. A hardware security module may also be part of a computer (for example an ATM) that operates inside a locked safe to deter theft, substitution, and tampering.

Modern smartcards are probably the most widely deployed form of secure cryptoprocessor, although more complex and versatile secure cryptoprocessors are widely deployed in systems such as Automated teller machines, TV set-top boxes, military applications, and high-security portable communication equipment. Some secure cryptoprocessors can even run general-purpose operating systems such as Linux inside their security boundary. Cryptoprocessors input program instructions in encrypted form, decrypt the instructions to plain instructions which are then executed within the same cryptoprocessor chip where the decrypted instructions are inaccessibly stored. By never revealing the decrypted program instructions, the cryptoprocessor prevents tampering of programs by technicians who may have legitimate access to the sub-system data bus. This is known as bus encryption. Data processed by a cryptoprocessor is also frequently encrypted.

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an implementation of a secure cryptoprocessor that brings the notion of trusted computing to ordinary PCs by enabling a secure environment. Present TPM implementations focus on providing a tamper-proof boot environment, and persistent and volatile storage encryption.

Security chips for embedded systems are also available that provide the same level of physical protection for keys and other secret material as a smartcard processor or TPM but in a smaller, less complex and less expensive package. They are often referred to as cryptographic authentication devices and are used to authenticate peripherals, accessories and/or consumables. Like TPMs, they are usually turnkey integrated circuits intended to be embedded in a system, usually soldered to a PC board.

==Features==
Security measures used in secure cryptoprocessors:
* Tamper-detecting and tamper-evident containment.
* Conductive shield layers in the chip that prevent reading of internal signals.
* Controlled execution to prevent timing delays from revealing any secret information.
* Automatic zeroization of secrets in the event of tampering.
* Chain of trust boot-loader which authenticates the operating system before loading it.
* Chain of trust operating system which authenticates application software before loading it.
* Hardware-based capability registers, implementing a one-way privilege separation model.

==Degree of security==
Secure cryptoprocessors, while useful, are not invulnerable to attack, particularly for well-equipped and determined opponents (e.g. a government intelligence agency) who are willing to expend enough resources on the project.

One attack on a secure cryptoprocessor targeted the IBM 4758. A team at the University of Cambridge reported the successful extraction of secret information from an IBM 4758, using a combination of mathematics, and special-purpose codebreaking hardware. However, this attack was not practical in real-world systems because it required the attacker to have full access to all API functions of the device. Normal and recommended practices use the integral access control system to split authority so that no one person could mount the attack.

While the vulnerability they exploited was a flaw in the software loaded on the 4758, and not the architecture of the 4758 itself, their attack serves as a reminder that a security system is only as secure as its weakest link: the strong link of the 4758 hardware was rendered useless by flaws in the design and specification of the software loaded on it.

Smartcards are significantly more vulnerable, as they are more open to physical attack. Additionally, hardware backdoors can undermine security in smartcards and other cryptoprocessors unless investment is made in anti-backdoor design methods.

In the case of full disk encryption applications, especially when implemented without a boot PIN, a cryptoprocessor would not be secure against a cold boot attack if data remanence could be exploited to dump memory contents after the operating system has retrieved the cryptographic keys from its TPM.

However, if all of the sensitive data is stored only in cryptoprocessor memory and not in external storage, and the cryptoprocessor is designed to be unable to reveal keys or decrypted or unencrypted data on chip bonding pads or solder bumps, then such protected data would be accessible only by probing the cryptoprocessor chip after removing any packaging and metal shielding layers from the cryptoprocessor chip. This would require both physical possession of the device as well as skills and equipment beyond that of most technical personnel.

Other attack methods involve carefully analyzing the timing of various operations that might vary depending on the secret value or mapping the current consumption versus time to identify differences in the way that &#x27;0&#x27; bits are handled internally vs. &#x27;1&#x27; bits. Or the attacker may apply temperature extremes, excessively high or low clock frequencies or supply voltage that exceeds the specifications in order to induce a fault. The internal design of the cryptoprocessor can be tailored to prevent these attacks.

Some secure cryptoprocessors contain dual processor cores and generate inaccessible encryption keys when needed so that even if the circuitry is reverse engineered, it will not reveal any keys that are necessary to securely decrypt software booted from encrypted flash memory or communicated between cores.

The first single-chip cryptoprocessor design was for copy protection of personal computer software (see US Patent 4,168,396, Sept 18, 1979) and was inspired by Bill Gates&#x27;s Open Letter to Hobbyists.

==History==
The hardware security module (HSM), a type of secure cryptoprocessor, was invented by Egyptian-American engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, in 1972. He invented a high security module dubbed the &quot;Atalla Box&quot; which encrypted PIN and ATM messages, and protected offline devices with an un-guessable PIN-generating key. In 1972, he filed a patent for the device. He founded Atalla Corporation (now Utimaco Atalla) that year, and commercialized the &quot;Atalla Box&quot; the following year, officially as the Identikey system. It was a card reader and customer identification system, consisting of a card reader console, two customer PIN pads, intelligent controller and built-in electronic interface package. It allowed the customer to type in a secret code, which is transformed by the device, using a microprocessor, into another code for the teller. During a transaction, the customer&#x27;s account number was read by the card reader. It was a success, and led to the wide use of high security modules.

Fearful that Atalla would dominate the market, banks and credit card companies began working on an international standard in the 1970s. The IBM 3624, launched in the late 1970s, adopted a similar PIN verification process to the earlier Atalla system. Atalla was an early competitor to IBM in the banking security market.

At the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks (NAMSB) conference in January 1976, Atalla unveiled an upgrade to its Identikey system, called the Interchange Identikey. It added the capabilities of processing online transactions and dealing with network security. Designed with the focus of taking bank transactions online, the Identikey system was extended to shared-facility operations. It was consistent and compatible with various switching networks, and was capable of resetting itself electronically to any one of 64,000 irreversible nonlinear algorithms as directed by card data information. The Interchange Identikey device was released in March 1976. Later in 1979, Atalla introduced the first network security processor (NSP). Atalla&#x27;s HSM products protect 250million card transactions every day as of 2013, and secure the majority of the world&#x27;s ATM transactions as of 2014.

<text>The Charleston is a dance named after the harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina. The rhythm was popularized in mainstream dance music in the United States by a 1923 tune called &quot;The Charleston&quot; by composer/pianist James P. Johnson, which originated in the Broadway show &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; and became one of the most popular hits of the decade. &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; ran from 28 October 1923 through 28 June 1924. The Charleston dance&#x27;s peak popularity occurred from mid-1926 to 1927.

== Origins ==

While the dance probably came from the &quot;star&quot; or challenge dances that were all part of the African-American dance called Juba, the particular sequence of steps which appeared in &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; were probably newly devised for popular appeal. &quot;At first, the step started off with a simple twisting of the feet, to rhythm in a lazy sort of way. When the dance hit Harlem, a new version was added. It became a fast kicking step, kicking the feet, both forward and backward and later done with a tap.&quot; Further changes were undoubtedly made before the dance was put on stage. In the words of Harold Courlander, while the Charleston had some characteristics of traditional Black American dance, it &quot;was a synthetic creation, a newly devised conglomerate tailored for widespread popular appeal.&quot; Although the step known as &quot;Jay-Bird&quot; and other specific movement sequences are of Afro-American origin, no record of the Charleston dance being performed as such on the plantation has been discovered.

Although it achieved popularity when the song &quot;Charleston&quot;, sung by Elisabeth Welch, was added to the production &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot;, the dance itself had first been introduced in Irving C. Miller&#x27;s &quot;Liza&quot; in the spring of 1923. Although the name was new, Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith noted that the dance was known well before that; in particular, he mentions the version done by Russell Brown under the name &quot;Geechie dance&quot;. The &quot;Charleston&quot; composer James P. Johnson said that he had seen it danced as early as 1913 in New York City in the San Juan Hill neighborhood, at the Jungles Casino.

The characteristic Charleston beat, which Johnson said he first heard from Charleston dockworkers, incorporates the clave rhythm and was considered by composer and critic Gunther Schuller to be synonymous with the Habanera and the Spanish Tinge. Johnson actually recorded several &quot;Charlestons&quot; and in later years derided most of them as being of &quot;that same damn beat.&quot; Several of these were recorded on player piano rolls, some of which have survived to this day.

The Charleston and similar dances such as the Black Bottom which involved &quot;kicking up your heels&quot; were very popular in the latter 1920s. The trend subsided after 1930, probably in part because the new fashion for floor-level sheath evening dresses, which constricted the legs, did not suit them. In a British Pathé Instructional Short of 1933, a new variation – the &quot;Crawl Charleston&quot; – is demonstrated by Santos Casini and Jean Mence, a very sedate dance similar to a tango or waltz. It was not until dress hemlines rose toward the end of the thirties that the Charleston is again seen in film.

A slightly different form of Charleston became popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and is associated with Lindy Hop. In this later form, the hot jazz timing of the &#x27;20s Charleston was adapted to suit swing jazz music. This style of Charleston has many common names, including Lindy Charleston, Savoy Charleston, &#x27;30s or &#x27;40s Charleston, and Swinging Charleston, and its basic step takes eight counts and is danced either alone or with a partner. Frankie Manning and other Savoy dancers saw themselves as doing Charleston steps within the Lindy rather than dancing the Charleston itself.

== Contemporary Charleston ==
Today Charleston is an important dance in Lindy Hop dance culture, danced in many permutations: alone (solo), with a partner, or in groups of couples or solo dancers. The basic step allows for a vast range of variations and improvisation. Both the 20s and Swinging Charleston styles are popular today, though swinging Charleston is more commonly integrated into Lindy Hop dancing.

The Guinness World Record for the largest Charleston dance is 1,096 participants, set by Revel In Dance in Shrewsbury, UK on September 22nd 2018.

=== Solo ===

Charleston can be danced solo, or with a partner. Its simple, flexible basic step makes it easy to concentrate on styling, improvisation and musicality.

Whichever style of Charleston one chooses, whether dancing alone, with a partner, or in groups, the basic step resembles the natural movement of walking, though it is usually performed in place. The arms swing forward and backwards, with the right arm coming forward as the left leg &#x27;steps&#x27; forwards, and then moving back as the left arm and right leg begin their forward movement. Toes are not pointed, but feet usually form a right angle with the leg at the ankle. Arms are usually extended from the shoulder, either with straight lines, or more frequently with bent elbows and hands at right angles from the wrist (characteristics of many African dances). Styling varies with each Charleston type from this point.

==== Solo 20s Charleston ====

Solo 20s Charleston gained popularity in the early 2000s, in many local Lindy Hop scenes around the world, prompted by competitions such as the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown (in 2005 and 2006 particularly) and workshops in the dance taught by high-profile dancers such as the Harlem Hot Shots (formerly known as The Rhythm Hot Shots) and a range of independent dancers.

Usually danced to hot jazz music recorded or composed in the 1920s, solo 20s Charleston is styled quite differently from the Charleston associated with the 1930s, 1940s and Lindy Hop, though they are structurally similar.

Solo 20s Charleston is usually danced to music at comparatively high tempos (usually above 200 or 250 beats per minute, with tempos above 300 BPM considered &#x27;fast&#x27;), and is characterized by high-energy dancing. Faster movements are often contrasted with slower, dragging steps and improvisations.

As it is danced today, solo 20s Charleston often combines steps from several dances associated with the 1920s. The most valued form of solo 20s Charleston combines choreography with improvisation and creative variations on familiar dance steps. Above all, the most popular and most &quot;successful&quot; solo 20s Charleston dancers respond to the music in creative ways to express themselves.

Solo 20s Charleston is often danced in groups on the social dance floor or in formal choreography. Latterly, a derivative of the Charleston, known as the &#x27;Chevin&#x27;, has been witnessed in European dance halls. The origins of the Chevin are not known; however, some proponents suggest it is named after Elliott Chevin, a Serbian freedom fighter.

===== Solo 20s Charleston Competition =====

Solo 20s Charleston competitions often make use of elements of the jam circle format, where individual competitors take turns dancing alone for the audience (usually for intervals of a phrase or number of phrases). Competitors move forwards to the audience out of an informal line, usually taking advantage of this movement to perform &#x27;strolls&#x27; or other &#x27;traveling&#x27; steps, taking the opportunity to &quot;shine&quot;.

Despite the emphasis on solo dancing in these sorts of competitions, there is often much interaction between competitors and between the audience and competitors, frequently in the employment of comic devices (such as &quot;silly walks&quot; or impersonations) or showy and physically impressive &quot;stunt&quot; moves. This type of interaction is typical of the call and response of West African and Afro-American music and dance. In this call and response, audiences and fellow competitors encourage dancers with cheers, shouts, applause, physical gestures and other feedback.

This sort of competition structure is increasingly popular in Lindy Hop communities around the world, providing added challenges for dancers, new types of pleasure for audiences and emphasizing social dancing skills such as improvisation and musicality. This structure also echoes the cutting contests of jazz music which Ralph Ellison describes in his stories about live jazz music in the 1930s.

=== Partner Charleston ===
Partner Charleston uses the basic step described above, though stylistic changes over the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s affected the styling, as well as ways of holding a partner. Traditionally partner Charleston was danced by a man and a woman, but now both men and women may dance with same gender.

==== 20s Partner Charleston ====
In the 20s Partner Charleston, couples stand facing each other in a traditional European partner dancing pose, often referred to as closed position which aids leading and following. The leader&#x27;s right hand is placed on the follower&#x27;s back between their shoulder blades. The follower&#x27;s left hand rests on the leader&#x27;s shoulder or biceps. The leader&#x27;s left hand and the follower&#x27;s right hand are clasped palm to palm, held either at shoulder height or higher. Partners may maintain space between their bodies or dance with their torsos touching.

The basic step is for the leader to touch their left foot behind them, but not to shift their weight, on counts 1 and 2, while the follower mirrors the motion by touching their right foot in front of them without shifting weight. On counts 3 and 4, both partners bring their feet back to a standing position, but shift their weight onto the foot they have just moved. On counts 5 and 6, the leader touches their right foot in front of themselves while the follower touches their left foot back. On 7 and 8, both feet are brought back to the standing position where the necessary weight shift occurs to allow the basic step to repeat.

==== 30s and 40s Partner Charleston ====

30s and 40s Partner Charleston involves a number of positions, including &quot;jockey position&quot;, where closed position is opened out so that both partners may face forward, without breaking apart.

In &quot;side-by-side&quot; Charleston partners open out the closed position entirely, so that their only points of connection are at their touching hips, and where the lead&#x27;s right hand and arm touch the follower&#x27;s back, and the follower&#x27;s left hand and arm touch the leader&#x27;s shoulder and arm. Both partners then swing their free arms as they would in solo Charleston. In both jockey and side-by-side Charleston the leader steps back onto their left foot, while the follower steps back onto their right.
In &quot;tandem Charleston&quot; one partner stands in front of the other (usually the follower, though the arrangement may vary), and both step back onto their left feet to begin. The partner behind holds the front partner&#x27;s hands at their hip height, and their joined arms swing backwards and forwards as in the basic step.

There are numerous other variations on these holds, including &quot;hand-to-hand&quot; Charleston, and countless variations on the footwork (including Johnny&#x27;s Drop, freezes, Savoy kicks and so on). Names for each vary in different local Lindy Hop scenes, though most have historic names associated with their creators or people in the community of the day. Aria Zapata and Teresa were the most famous dancers at the time.

=== Groups ===
In swing dance or Lindy Hop communities today, both solo 20s Charleston and &quot;solo&quot; swinging Charleston are often danced in groups arranged in a loose circle on the social dance floor, in two long lines of facing dancers (evenly spaced) or in other formations in more strictly choreographed performances.

They may choose to follow steps &#x27;called&#x27; either by a designated Caller or by each dancer in turn. In this called context, the group perform the same step for a phrase, or until the new step is &quot;called&quot;. Individual dancers often improvise within the structure of the called step, bringing their own personal &quot;flavor&quot;.

There are many local variations on this group dancing, including the following. One person will typically call out a variation (such as turning 360 degrees in place on counts 5–10), which is then done by everyone beginning the next measure and again for the following 2 measures. If the caller doesn&#x27;t call another step immediately, the dancers return to the (default) basic step. Switching sides is sometimes called, upon which the dancers hop on the left foot across to the other side on counts 5–8, turning 180 degrees to the left.

In the more casual social group context, individual dancers may choose to dance &quot;alone&quot;, improvising in response to the music or copying dancers around them.

<text>In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

# Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
# Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and immediately execute that;
# Explicitly execute stored precompiled bytecode made by a compiler and matched with the interpreter&#x27;s virtual machine.

Early versions of Lisp programming language and minicomputer and microcomputer BASIC dialects would be examples of the first type. Perl, Raku, Python, MATLAB, and Ruby are examples of the second, while UCSD Pascal is an example of the third type. Source programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as machine independent code, which is then linked at run-time and executed by an interpreter and/or compiler (for JIT systems). Some systems, such as Smalltalk and contemporary versions of BASIC and Java, may also combine two and three types. Interpreters of various types have also been constructed for many languages traditionally associated with compilation, such as Algol, Fortran, Cobol, C and C++.

While interpretation and compilation are the two main means by which programming languages are implemented, they are not mutually exclusive, as most interpreting systems also perform some translation work, just like compilers. The terms &quot;interpreted language&quot; or &quot;compiled language&quot; signify that the canonical implementation of that language is an interpreter or a compiler, respectively. A high-level language is ideally an abstraction independent of particular implementations.

== History==
Interpreters were used as early as 1952 to ease programming within the limitations of computers at the time (e.g. a shortage of program storage space, or no native support for floating point numbers). Interpreters were also used to translate between low-level machine languages, allowing code to be written for machines that were still under construction and tested on computers that already existed. The first interpreted high-level language was Lisp. Lisp was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 computer. Russell had read John McCarthy&#x27;s paper, &quot;Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I&quot;, and realized (to McCarthy&#x27;s surprise) that the Lisp &quot;eval&quot; function could be implemented in machine code. The result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, &quot;evaluate Lisp expressions&quot;.

The development of editing interpreters was influenced by the need for interactive computing. In the 1960s, the introduction of time-sharing systems allowed multiple users to access a computer simultaneously, and editing interpreters became essential for managing and modifying code in real-time. The first editing interpreters were likely developed for mainframe computers, where they were used to create and modify programs on the fly. One of the earliest examples of an editing interpreter is the EDT (Editor and Debugger for the TECO) system, which was developed in the late 1960s for the PDP-1 computer. EDT allowed users to edit and debug programs using a combination of commands and macros, paving the way for modern text editors and interactive development environments.

== General operation ==
An interpreter usually consists of a set of known commands it can execute, and a list of these commands in the order a programmer wishes to execute them. Each command (also known as an Instruction) contains the data the programmer wants to mutate, and information on how to mutate the data. For example, an interpreter might read codice_1 and &quot;interpret&quot; it as a request to add five to the codice_2 variable.

Interpreters have a wide variety of instructions which are specialized to perform different tasks, but you will commonly find interpreter instructions for basic mathematical operations, branching, and memory management, making most interpreters Turing complete. Many interpreters are also closely integrated with a garbage collector and debugger.

== Compilers versus interpreters ==

Programs written in a high-level language are either directly executed by some kind of interpreter or converted into machine code by a compiler (and assembler and linker) for the CPU to execute.

While compilers (and assemblers) generally produce machine code directly executable by computer hardware, they can often (optionally) produce an intermediate form called object code. This is basically the same machine specific code but augmented with a symbol table with names and tags to make executable blocks (or modules) identifiable and relocatable. Compiled programs will typically use building blocks (functions) kept in a library of such object code modules. A linker is used to combine (pre-made) library files with the object file(s) of the application to form a single executable file. The object files that are used to generate an executable file are thus often produced at different times, and sometimes even by different languages (capable of generating the same object format).

A simple interpreter written in a low-level language (e.g. assembly) may have similar machine code blocks implementing functions of the high-level language stored, and executed when a function&#x27;s entry in a look up table points to that code. However, an interpreter written in a high-level language typically uses another approach, such as generating and then walking a parse tree, or by generating and executing intermediate software-defined instructions, or both.

Thus, both compilers and interpreters generally turn source code (text files) into tokens, both may (or may not) generate a parse tree, and both may generate immediate instructions (for a stack machine, quadruple code, or by other means). The basic difference is that a compiler system, including a (built in or separate) linker, generates a stand-alone &quot;machine code&quot; program, while an interpreter system instead &quot;performs&quot; the actions described by the high-level program.

A compiler can thus make almost all the conversions from source code semantics to the machine level once and for all (i.e. until the program has to be changed) while an interpreter has to do &quot;some&quot; of this conversion work every time a statement or function is executed. However, in an efficient interpreter, much of the translation work (including analysis of types, and similar) is factored out and done only the first time a program, module, function, or even statement, is run, thus quite akin to how a compiler works. However, a compiled program still runs much faster, under most circumstances, in part because compilers are designed to optimize code, and may be given ample time for this. This is especially true for simpler high-level languages without (many) dynamic data structures, checks, or type checking.
In traditional compilation, the executable output of the linkers (.exe files or .dll files or a library, see picture) is typically relocatable when run under a general operating system, much like the object code modules are but with the difference that this relocation is done dynamically at run time, i.e. when the program is loaded for execution. On the other hand, compiled and linked programs for small embedded systems are typically statically allocated, often hard coded in a NOR flash memory, as there is often no secondary storage and no operating system in this sense.
Historically, most interpreter systems have had a self-contained editor built in. This is becoming more common also for compilers (then often called an IDE), although some programmers prefer to use an editor of their choice and run the compiler, linker and other tools manually. Historically, compilers predate interpreters because hardware at that time could not support both the interpreter and interpreted code and the typical batch environment of the time limited the advantages of interpretation.

=== Development cycle ===
During the software development cycle, programmers make frequent changes to source code. When using a compiler, each time a change is made to the source code, they must wait for the compiler to translate the altered source files and link all of the binary code files together before the program can be executed. The larger the program, the longer the wait. By contrast, a programmer using an interpreter does a lot less waiting, as the interpreter usually just needs to translate the code being worked on to an intermediate representation (or not translate it at all), thus requiring much less time before the changes can be tested. Effects are evident upon saving the source code and reloading the program. Compiled code is generally less readily debugged as editing, compiling, and linking are sequential processes that have to be conducted in the proper sequence with a proper set of commands. For this reason, many compilers also have an executive aid, known as a Makefile and program. The Makefile lists compiler and linker command lines and program source code files, but might take a simple command line menu input (e.g. &quot;Make 3&quot;) which selects the third group (set) of instructions then issues the commands to the compiler, and linker feeding the specified source code files.

=== Distribution ===
A compiler converts source code into binary instruction for a specific processor&#x27;s architecture, thus making it less portable. This conversion is made just once, on the developer&#x27;s environment, and after that the same binary can be distributed to the user&#x27;s machines where it can be executed without further translation. A cross compiler can generate binary code for the user machine even if it has a different processor than the machine where the code is compiled.

An interpreted program can be distributed as source code. It needs to be translated in each final machine, which takes more time but makes the program distribution independent of the machine&#x27;s architecture. However, the portability of interpreted source code is dependent on the target machine actually having a suitable interpreter. If the interpreter needs to be supplied along with the source, the overall installation process is more complex than delivery of a monolithic executable, since the interpreter itself is part of what needs to be installed.

The fact that interpreted code can easily be read and copied by humans can be of concern from the point of view of copyright. However, various systems of encryption and obfuscation exist. Delivery of intermediate code, such as bytecode, has a similar effect to obfuscation, but bytecode could be decoded with a decompiler or disassembler.

=== Efficiency ===
The main disadvantage of interpreters is that an interpreted program typically runs more slowly than if it had been compiled. The difference in speeds could be tiny or great; often an order of magnitude and sometimes more. It generally takes longer to run a program under an interpreter than to run the compiled code but it can take less time to interpret it than the total time required to compile and run it. This is especially important when prototyping and testing code when an edit-interpret-debug cycle can often be much shorter than an edit-compile-run-debug cycle.

Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled code because the interpreter must analyze each statement in the program each time it is executed and then perform the desired action, whereas the compiled code just performs the action within a fixed context determined by the compilation. This run-time analysis is known as &quot;interpretive overhead&quot;. Access to variables is also slower in an interpreter because the mapping of identifiers to storage locations must be done repeatedly at run-time rather than at compile time.

There are various compromises between the development speed when using an interpreter and the execution speed when using a compiler. Some systems (such as some Lisps) allow interpreted and compiled code to call each other and to share variables. This means that once a routine has been tested and debugged under the interpreter it can be compiled and thus benefit from faster execution while other routines are being developed. Many interpreters do not execute the source code as it stands but convert it into some more compact internal form. Many BASIC interpreters replace keywords with single byte tokens which can be used to find the instruction in a jump table. A few interpreters, such as the PBASIC interpreter, achieve even higher levels of program compaction by using a bit-oriented rather than a byte-oriented program memory structure, where commands tokens occupy perhaps 5 bits, nominally &quot;16-bit&quot; constants are stored in a variable-length code requiring 3, 6, 10, or 18 bits, and address operands include a &quot;bit offset&quot;. Many BASIC interpreters can store and read back their own tokenized internal representation.
An interpreter might well use the same lexical analyzer and parser as the compiler and then interpret the resulting abstract syntax tree. Example data type definitions for the latter, and a toy interpreter for syntax trees obtained from C expressions are shown in the box.

=== Regression ===
Interpretation cannot be used as the sole method of execution: even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted and so on, a directly executed program is needed somewhere at the bottom of the stack because the code being interpreted is not, by definition, the same as the machine code that the CPU can execute.

== Variations ==
=== Bytecode interpreters ===

There is a spectrum of possibilities between interpreting and compiling, depending on the amount of analysis performed before the program is executed. For example, Emacs Lisp is compiled to bytecode, which is a highly compressed and optimized representation of the Lisp source, but is not machine code (and therefore not tied to any particular hardware). This &quot;compiled&quot; code is then interpreted by a bytecode interpreter (itself written in C). The compiled code in this case is machine code for a virtual machine, which is implemented not in hardware, but in the bytecode interpreter. Such compiling interpreters are sometimes also called &quot;compreters&quot;. In a bytecode interpreter each instruction starts with a byte, and therefore bytecode interpreters have up to 256 instructions, although not all may be used. Some bytecodes may take multiple bytes, and may be arbitrarily complicated.

Control tables - that do not necessarily ever need to pass through a compiling phase - dictate appropriate algorithmic control flow via customized interpreters in similar fashion to bytecode interpreters.

=== Threaded code interpreters ===

Threaded code interpreters are similar to bytecode interpreters but instead of bytes they use pointers. Each &quot;instruction&quot; is a word that points to a function or an instruction sequence, possibly followed by a parameter. The threaded code interpreter either loops fetching instructions and calling the functions they point to, or fetches the first instruction and jumps to it, and every instruction sequence ends with a fetch and jump to the next instruction. Unlike bytecode there is no effective limit on the number of different instructions other than available memory and address space. The classic example of threaded code is the Forth code used in Open Firmware systems: the source language is compiled into &quot;F code&quot; (a bytecode), which is then interpreted by a virtual machine.

=== Abstract syntax tree interpreters ===

In the spectrum between interpreting and compiling, another approach is to transform the source code into an optimized abstract syntax tree (AST), then execute the program following this tree structure, or use it to generate native code just-in-time. In this approach, each sentence needs to be parsed just once. As an advantage over bytecode, the AST keeps the global program structure and relations between statements (which is lost in a bytecode representation), and when compressed provides a more compact representation. Thus, using AST has been proposed as a better intermediate format for just-in-time compilers than bytecode. Also, it allows the system to perform better analysis during runtime.

However, for interpreters, an AST causes more overhead than a bytecode interpreter, because of nodes related to syntax performing no useful work, of a less sequential representation (requiring traversal of more pointers) and of overhead visiting the tree.

=== Just-in-time compilation ===

Further blurring the distinction between interpreters, bytecode interpreters and compilation is just-in-time (JIT) compilation, a technique in which the intermediate representation is compiled to native machine code at runtime. This confers the efficiency of running native code, at the cost of startup time and increased memory use when the bytecode or AST is first compiled. The earliest published JIT compiler is generally attributed to work on LISP by John McCarthy in 1960. Adaptive optimization is a complementary technique in which the interpreter profiles the running program and compiles its most frequently executed parts into native code. The latter technique is a few decades old, appearing in languages such as Smalltalk in the 1980s.

Just-in-time compilation has gained mainstream attention amongst language implementers in recent years, with Java, the .NET Framework, most modern JavaScript implementations, and Matlab now including JIT compilers.

===Template Interpreter===
Making the distinction between compilers and interpreters yet again even more vague is a special interpreter design known as a template interpreter. Rather than implement the execution of code by virtue of a large switch statement containing every possible bytecode, while operating on a software stack or a tree walk, a template interpreter maintains a large array of bytecode (or any efficient intermediate representation) mapped directly to corresponding native machine instructions that can be executed on the host hardware as key value pairs (or in more efficient designs, direct addresses to the native instructions), known as a &quot;Template&quot;. When the particular code segment is executed the interpreter simply loads or jumps to the opcode mapping in the template and directly runs it on the hardware. Due to its design, the template interpreter very strongly resembles a just-in-time compiler rather than a traditional interpreter, however it is technically not a JIT due to the fact that it merely translates code from the language into native calls one opcode at a time rather than creating optimized sequences of CPU executable instructions from the entire code segment. Due to the interpreter&#x27;s simple design of simply passing calls directly to the hardware rather than implementing them directly, it is much faster than every other type, even bytecode interpreters, and to an extent less prone to bugs, but as a tradeoff is more difficult to maintain due to the interpreter having to support translation to multiple different architectures instead of a platform independent virtual machine/stack. To date, the only template interpreter implementations of widely known languages to exist are the interpreter within Java&#x27;s official reference implementation, the Sun HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, and the Ignition Interpreter in the Google V8 javascript execution engine.

===Self-interpreter===

A self-interpreter is a programming language interpreter written in a programming language which can interpret itself; an example is a BASIC interpreter written in BASIC. Self-interpreters are related to self-hosting compilers.

If no compiler exists for the language to be interpreted, creating a self-interpreter requires the implementation of the language in a host language (which may be another programming language or assembler). By having a first interpreter such as this, the system is bootstrapped and new versions of the interpreter can be developed in the language itself. It was in this way that Donald Knuth developed the TANGLE interpreter for the language WEB of the de-facto standard TeX typesetting system.

Defining a computer language is usually done in relation to an abstract machine (so-called operational semantics) or as a mathematical function (denotational semantics). A language may also be defined by an interpreter in which the semantics of the host language is given. The definition of a language by a self-interpreter is not well-founded (it cannot define a language), but a self-interpreter tells a reader about the expressiveness and elegance of a language. It also enables the interpreter to interpret its source code, the first step towards reflective interpreting.

An important design dimension in the implementation of a self-interpreter is whether a feature of the interpreted language is implemented with the same feature in the interpreter&#x27;s host language. An example is whether a closure in a Lisp-like language is implemented using closures in the interpreter language or implemented &quot;manually&quot; with a data structure explicitly storing the environment. The more features implemented by the same feature in the host language, the less control the programmer of the interpreter has; for example, a different behavior for dealing with number overflows cannot be realized if the arithmetic operations are delegated to corresponding operations in the host language.

Some languages such as Lisp and Prolog have elegant self-interpreters. Much research on self-interpreters (particularly reflective interpreters) has been conducted in the Scheme programming language, a dialect of Lisp. In general, however, any Turing-complete language allows writing of its own interpreter. Lisp is such a language, because Lisp programs are lists of symbols and other lists. XSLT is such a language, because XSLT programs are written in XML. A sub-domain of metaprogramming is the writing of domain-specific languages (DSLs).

Clive Gifford introduced a measure quality of self-interpreter (the eigenratio), the limit of the ratio between computer time spent running a stack of &quot;N&quot; self-interpreters and time spent to run a stack of self-interpreters as &quot;N&quot; goes to infinity. This value does not depend on the program being run.

The book &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; presents examples of meta-circular interpretation for Scheme and its dialects. Other examples of languages with a self-interpreter are Forth and Pascal.

=== Microcode ===

Microcode is a very commonly used technique &quot;that imposes an interpreter between the hardware and the architectural level of a computer&quot;. As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements. Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, as well as in more specialized processors such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, channel controllers, disk controllers, network interface controllers, network processors, graphics processing units, and in other hardware.

Microcode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, state machine data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlying electronics so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called microprogramming and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a microprogram.

More extensive microcoding allows small and simple microarchitectures to emulate more powerful architectures with wider word length, more execution units and so on, which is a relatively simple way to achieve software compatibility between different products in a processor family.

=== Computer processor ===
Even a non microcoding computer processor itself can be considered to be a parsing immediate execution interpreter that is written in a general purpose hardware description language such as VHDL to create a system that parses the machine code instructions and immediately executes them.

== Applications ==
* Interpreters are frequently used to execute command languages, and glue languages since each operator executed in command language is usually an invocation of a complex routine such as an editor or compiler.
* Self-modifying code can easily be implemented in an interpreted language. This relates to the origins of interpretation in Lisp and artificial intelligence research.
* Virtualization. Machine code intended for a hardware architecture can be run using a virtual machine. This is often used when the intended architecture is unavailable, or among other uses, for running multiple copies.
* Sandboxing: While some types of sandboxes rely on operating system protections, an interpreter or virtual machine is often used. The actual hardware architecture and the originally intended hardware architecture may or may not be the same. This may seem pointless, except that sandboxes are not compelled to actually execute all the instructions the source code it is processing. In particular, it can refuse to execute code that violates any security constraints it is operating under.
* Emulators for running computer software written for obsolete and unavailable hardware on more modern equipment.

<text>The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a non-relativistic quantum-mechanical system. Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of quantum mechanics. It is named after Erwin Schrödinger, an Austrian physicist, who postulated the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.

Conceptually, the Schrödinger equation is the quantum counterpart of Newton&#x27;s second law in classical mechanics. Given a set of known initial conditions, Newton&#x27;s second law makes a mathematical prediction as to what path a given physical system will take over time. The Schrödinger equation gives the evolution over time of the wave function, the quantum-mechanical characterization of an isolated physical system. The equation was postulated by Schrödinger based on a postulate of Louis de Broglie that all matter has an associated matter wave. The equation predicted bound states of the atom in agreement with experimental observations.

The Schrödinger equation is not the only way to study quantum mechanical systems and make predictions. Other formulations of quantum mechanics include matrix mechanics, introduced by Werner Heisenberg, and the path integral formulation, developed chiefly by Richard Feynman. When these approaches are compared, the use of the Schrödinger equation is sometimes called &quot;wave mechanics&quot;.

The equation given by Schrödinger is nonrelativistic because it contains a first derivative in time and a second derivative in space, and therefore space and time are not on equal footing. Paul Dirac incorporated special relativity and quantum mechanics into a single formulation that simplifies to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. This is the Dirac equation, which contains a single derivative in both space and time. Another partial differential equation, the Klein–Gordon equation, led to a problem with probability density even though it was a relativistic wave equation. The probability density could be negative, which is physically unviable. This was fixed by Dirac by taking the so-called square root of the Klein–Gordon operator and in turn introducing Dirac matrices. In a modern context, the Klein–Gordon equation describes spin-less particles, while the Dirac equation describes spin-1/2 particles.

== Definition ==
=== Preliminaries ===
Introductory courses on physics or chemistry typically introduce the Schrödinger equation in a way that can be appreciated knowing only the concepts and notations of basic calculus, particularly derivatives with respect to space and time. A special case of the Schrödinger equation that admits a statement in those terms is the position-space Schrödinger equation for a single nonrelativistic particle in one dimension:
formula_1
Here, formula_2 is a wave function, a function that assigns a complex number to each point formula_3 at each time formula_4. The parameter formula_5 is the mass of the particle, and formula_6 is the &quot;potential&quot; that represents the environment in which the particle exists. The constant formula_7 is the imaginary unit, and formula_8 is the reduced Planck constant, which has units of action (energy multiplied by time).
Broadening beyond this simple case, the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac, David Hilbert, John von Neumann, and Hermann Weyl defines the state of a quantum mechanical system to be a vector formula_9 belonging to a separable complex Hilbert space formula_10. This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space&#x27;s inner product, that is, in Dirac notation it obeys formula_11. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable functions formula_12, while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is the two-dimensional complex vector space formula_13 with the usual inner product.

Physical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which are self-adjoint operators acting on the Hilbert space. A wave function can be an eigenvector of an observable, in which case it is called an eigenstate, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a quantum superposition. When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue formula_14 is non-degenerate and the probability is given by formula_15, where formula_16 is its associated eigenvector. More generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by formula_17, where formula_18 is the projector onto its associated eigenspace.

A momentum eigenstate would be a perfectly monochromatic wave of infinite extent, which is not square-integrable. Likewise a position eigenstate would be a Dirac delta distribution, not square-integrable and technically not a function at all. Consequently, neither can belong to the particle&#x27;s Hilbert space. Physicists sometimes regard these eigenstates, composed of elements outside the Hilbert space, as &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot;. These are used for calculational convenience and do not represent physical states. Thus, a position-space wave function formula_2 as used above can be written as the inner product of a time-dependent state vector formula_20 with unphysical but convenient &quot;position eigenstates&quot; formula_21:
formula_22

=== Time-dependent equation ===

The form of the Schrödinger equation depends on the physical situation. The most general form is the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, which gives a description of a system evolving with time:

where formula_4 is time, formula_24 is the state vector of the quantum system (formula_25 being the Greek letter psi), and formula_26 is an observable, the Hamiltonian operator.

The term &quot;Schrödinger equation&quot; can refer to both the general equation, or the specific nonrelativistic version. The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the Dirac equation to quantum field theory, by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is an approximation that yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory).

To apply the Schrödinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schrödinger equation. The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system. In practice, the square of the absolute value of the wave function at each point is taken to define a probability density function. For example, given a wave function in position space formula_2 as above, we have
formula_28

=== Time-independent equation ===
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form standing waves, called stationary states. These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the task of solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for &quot;any&quot; state. Stationary states can also be described by a simpler form of the Schrödinger equation, the time-independent Schrödinger equation.
where formula_29 is the energy of the system. This is only used when the Hamiltonian itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function is dependent on time as explained in the section on linearity below. In the language of linear algebra, this equation is an eigenvalue equation. Therefore, the wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) formula_29.

== Properties ==
=== Linearity ===
The Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation, meaning that if two state vectors formula_31 and formula_32 are solutions, then so is any linear combination
formula_33
of the two state vectors where and are any complex numbers. Moreover, the sum can be extended for any number of state vectors. This property allows superpositions of quantum states to be solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schrödinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over a basis of states. A choice often employed is the basis of energy eigenstates, which are solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation. In this basis, a time-dependent state vector formula_20 can be written as the linear combination
formula_35
where formula_36 are complex numbers and the vectors formula_37 are solutions of the time-independent equation formula_38.

=== Unitarity ===
Holding the Hamiltonian formula_26 constant, the Schrödinger equation has the solution
formula_40
The operator formula_41 is known as the time-evolution operator, and it is unitary: it preserves the inner product between vectors in the Hilbert space. Unitarity is a general feature of time evolution under the Schrödinger equation. If the initial state is formula_42, then the state at a later time formula_4 will be given by
formula_44
for some unitary operator formula_45. Conversely, suppose that formula_45 is a continuous family of unitary operators parameterized by formula_4. Without loss of generality, the parameterization can be chosen so that formula_48 is the identity operator and that formula_49 for any formula_50. Then formula_45 depends upon the parameter formula_4 in such a way that
formula_53
for some self-adjoint operator formula_54, called the &quot;generator&quot; of the family formula_45. A Hamiltonian is just such a generator (up to the factor of the Planck constant that would be set to 1 in natural units).
To see that the generator is Hermitian, note that with formula_56, we have
formula_57 so formula_45 is unitary only if, to first order, its derivative is Hermitian.

=== Changes of basis ===
The Schrödinger equation is often presented using quantities varying as functions of position, but as a vector-operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in Hilbert space. As mentioned above, &quot;bases&quot; that lie outside the physical Hilbert space are also employed for calculational purposes. This is illustrated by the &quot;position-space&quot; and &quot;momentum-space&quot; Schrödinger equations for a nonrelativistic, spinless particle. The Hilbert space for such a particle is the space of complex square-integrable functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space, and its Hamiltonian is the sum of a kinetic-energy term that is quadratic in the momentum operator and a potential-energy term:
formula_59
Writing formula_60 for a three-dimensional position vector and formula_61 for a three-dimensional momentum vector, the position-space Schrödinger equation is
formula_62
The momentum-space counterpart involves the Fourier transforms of the wave function and the potential:
formula_63
The functions formula_64 and formula_65 are derived from formula_20 by
formula_67
formula_68
where formula_69 and formula_70 do not belong to the Hilbert space itself, but have well-defined inner products with all elements of that space.

When restricted from three dimensions to one, the position-space equation is just the first form of the Schrödinger equation given above. The relation between position and momentum in quantum mechanics can be appreciated in a single dimension. In canonical quantization, the classical variables formula_3 and formula_72 are promoted to self-adjoint operators formula_73 and formula_74 that satisfy the canonical commutation relation
formula_75
This implies that
formula_76
so the action of the momentum operator formula_74 in the position-space representation is formula_78. Thus, formula_79 becomes a second derivative, and in three dimensions, the second derivative becomes the Laplacian formula_80.

The canonical commutation relation also implies that the position and momentum operators are Fourier conjugates of each other. Consequently, functions originally defined in terms of their position dependence can be converted to functions of momentum using the Fourier transform. In solid-state physics, the Schrödinger equation is often written for functions of momentum, as Bloch&#x27;s theorem ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples formula_81 with formula_82 for only discrete reciprocal lattice vectors formula_83. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum-space Schrödinger equation at each point in the Brillouin zone independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.

=== Probability current ===
The Schrödinger equation is consistent with local probability conservation. It also ensures that a normalized wavefunction remains normalized after time evolution. In matrix mechanics, this means that the time evolution operator is a unitary operator. In contrast to, for example, the Klein Gordon equation, although a redefined inner product of a wavefunction can be time independent, the total volume integral of modulus square of the wavefunction need not be time independent.

The continuity equation for probability in non relativistic quantum mechanics is stated as: 
formula_84where
formula_85
is the probability current or probability flux (flow per unit area).

If the wavefunction is represented as formula_86 where formula_87 is a real function which represents the complex phase of the wavefunction, then the probability flux is calculated as:formula_88Hence, the spatial variation of the phase of a wavefunction is said to characterize the probability flux of the wavefunction. Although the formula_89 term appears to play the role of velocity, it does not represent velocity at a point since simultaneous measurement of position and velocity violates uncertainty principle.

=== Separation of variables ===
If the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, Schrödinger&#x27;s equation reads: 
formula_90 The operator on the left side depends only on time; the one on the right side depends only on space.
Solving the equation by separation of variables means seeking a solution of the form of a product of spatial and temporal parts
formula_91
where formula_92 is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and formula_93 is a function of time only. Substituting this expression for formula_25 into the time dependent left hand side shows that formula_93 is a phase factor:
formula_96
A solution of this type is called &quot;stationary,&quot; since the only time dependence is a phase factor that cancels when the probability density is calculated via the Born rule.

The spatial part of the full wave function solves the equation
formula_97
where the energy formula_29 appears in the phase factor.

This generalizes to any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time-independent potential): the standing wave solutions of the time-independent equation are the states with definite energy, instead of a probability distribution of different energies. In physics, these standing waves are called &quot;stationary states&quot; or &quot;energy eigenstates&quot;; in chemistry they are called &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; or &quot;molecular orbitals&quot;. Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels. The energy eigenstates form a basis: any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is an example of the spectral theorem, and in a finite-dimensional state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix.

Separation of variables can also be a useful method for the time-independent Schrödinger equation. For example, depending on the symmetry of the problem, the Cartesian axes might be separated, as in
formula_99
or radial and angular coordinates might be separated:
formula_100

== Examples ==
=== Particle in a box ===
The particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy &quot;inside&quot; a certain region and infinite potential energy &quot;outside&quot;. For the one-dimensional case in the formula_3 direction, the time-independent Schrödinger equation may be written
formula_102

With the differential operator defined by
formula_103
the previous equation is evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue,
formula_104
with state formula_105 in this case having energy formula_29 coincident with the kinetic energy of the particle.

The general solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the particle in a box are
formula_107
or, from Euler&#x27;s formula,
formula_108

The infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of formula_109 and formula_110 at formula_111 and formula_112 where formula_105 must be zero. Thus, at formula_111,
formula_115
and formula_116. At formula_112,
formula_118
in which formula_119 cannot be zero as this would conflict with the postulate that formula_105 has norm 1. Therefore, since formula_121, formula_122 must be an integer multiple of formula_123,
formula_124

This constraint on formula_110 implies a constraint on the energy levels, yielding
formula_126

A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth. The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well. Another related problem is that of the rectangular potential barrier, which furnishes a model for the quantum tunneling effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy.

=== Harmonic oscillator ===


The Schrödinger equation for this situation is
formula_127
where formula_128 is the displacement and formula_129 the angular frequency. Furthermore, it can be used to describe approximately a wide variety of other systems, including vibrating atoms, molecules, and atoms or ions in lattices, and approximating other potentials near equilibrium points. It is also the basis of perturbation methods in quantum mechanics.

The solutions in position space are
formula_130
where formula_131, and the functions formula_132 are the Hermite polynomials of order formula_133. The solution set may be generated by
formula_134

The eigenvalues are
formula_135

The case formula_136 is called the ground state, its energy is called the zero-point energy, and the wave function is a Gaussian.

The harmonic oscillator, like the particle in a box, illustrates the generic feature of the Schrödinger equation that the energies of bound eigenstates are discretized.

=== Hydrogen atom ===

The Schrödinger equation for the electron in a hydrogen atom (or a hydrogen-like atom) is
formula_137
where formula_138 is the electron charge, formula_139 is the position of the electron relative to the nucleus, formula_140 is the magnitude of the relative position, the potential term is due to the Coulomb interaction, wherein formula_141 is the permittivity of free space and
formula_142
is the 2-body reduced mass of the hydrogen nucleus (just a proton) of mass formula_143 and the electron of mass formula_144. The negative sign arises in the potential term since the proton and electron are oppositely charged. The reduced mass in place of the electron mass is used since the electron and proton together orbit each other about a common center of mass, and constitute a two-body problem to solve. The motion of the electron is of principal interest here, so the equivalent one-body problem is the motion of the electron using the reduced mass.

The Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom can be solved by separation of variables. In this case, spherical polar coordinates are the most convenient. Thus,
formula_145
where are radial functions and formula_146 are spherical harmonics of degree formula_147 and order formula_148. This is the only atom for which the Schrödinger equation has been solved for exactly. Multi-electron atoms require approximate methods. The family of solutions are:
formula_149
where
* formula_150 is the Bohr radius,
* formula_151 are the generalized Laguerre polynomials of degree formula_152,
* formula_153 are the principal, azimuthal, and magnetic quantum numbers respectively, which take the values formula_154 formula_155 formula_156

=== Approximate solutions ===
It is typically not possible to solve the Schrödinger equation exactly for situations of physical interest. Accordingly, approximate solutions are obtained using techniques like variational methods and WKB approximation. It is also common to treat a problem of interest as a small modification to a problem that can be solved exactly, a method known as perturbation theory.

== Semiclassical limit ==
One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the &quot;expected&quot; position and &quot;expected&quot; momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the Ehrenfest theorem. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential formula_157, the Ehrenfest theorem says
formula_158
Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair formula_159 were to satisfy Newton&#x27;s second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be
formula_160
which is typically not the same as formula_161. For a general formula_162, therefore, quantum mechanics can lead to predictions where expectation values do not mimic the classical behavior. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, formula_162 is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.

For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will &quot;approximately&quot; follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point formula_164, then formula_165 and formula_166 will be &quot;almost&quot; the same, since both will be approximately equal to formula_167. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.

The Schrödinger equation in its general form
formula_168
is closely related to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (HJE)
formula_169
where formula_170 is the classical action and formula_171 is the Hamiltonian function (not operator). Here the generalized coordinates formula_172 for formula_173 (used in the context of the HJE) can be set to the position in Cartesian coordinates as formula_174.

Substituting
formula_175
where formula_176 is the probability density, into the Schrödinger equation and then taking the limit formula_177 in the resulting equation yield the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

== Density matrices==

Wave functions are not always the most convenient way to describe quantum systems and their behavior. When the preparation of a system is only imperfectly known, or when the system under investigation is a part of a larger whole, density matrices may be used instead. A density matrix is a positive semi-definite operator whose trace is equal to 1. (The term &quot;density operator&quot; is also used, particularly when the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.) The set of all density matrices is convex, and the extreme points are the operators that project onto vectors in the Hilbert space. These are the density-matrix representations of wave functions; in Dirac notation, they are written formula_178

The density-matrix analogue of the Schrödinger equation for wave functions is
formula_179
where the brackets denote a commutator. This is variously known as the von Neumann equation, the Liouville–von Neumann equation, or just the Schrödinger equation for density matrices. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, this equation can be easily solved to yield
formula_180

More generally, if the unitary operator formula_45 describes wave function evolution over some time interval, then the time evolution of a density matrix over that same interval is given by
formula_182

Unitary evolution of a density matrix conserves its von Neumann entropy.

== Relativistic quantum physics and quantum field theory ==
The one-particle Schrödinger equation described above is valid essentially in the nonrelativistic domain. For one reason, it is essentially invariant under Galilean transformations, which form the symmetry group of Newtonian dynamics. Moreover, processes that change particle number are natural in relativity, and so an equation for one particle (or any fixed number thereof) can only be of limited use. A more general form of the Schrödinger equation that also applies in relativistic situations can be formulated within quantum field theory (QFT), a framework that allows the combination of quantum mechanics with special relativity. The region in which both simultaneously apply may be described by relativistic quantum mechanics. Such descriptions may use time evolution generated by a Hamiltonian operator, as in the Schrödinger functional method.

=== Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations ===
Attempts to combine quantum physics with special relativity began with building relativistic wave equations from the relativistic energy–momentum relation
formula_183
instead of nonrelativistic energy equations. The Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation are two such equations. The Klein–Gordon equation,
formula_184
was the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one-particle Schrödinger equation, and applies to massive spinless particles. Historically, Dirac obtained the Dirac equation by seeking a differential equation that would be first-order in both time and space, a desirable property for a relativistic theory. Taking the &quot;square root&quot; of the left-hand side of the Klein–Gordon equation in this way required factorizing it into a product of two operators, which Dirac wrote using 4 × 4 matrices formula_185. Consequently, the wave function also became a four-component function, governed by the Dirac equation that, in free space, read
formula_186

This has again the form of the Schrödinger equation, with the time derivative of the wave function being given by a Hamiltonian operator acting upon the wave function. Including influences upon the particle requires modifying the Hamiltonian operator. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass and electric charge in an electromagnetic field (described by the electromagnetic potentials and ) is:
formula_187
in which the and are the Dirac gamma matrices related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all particles, and the solutions to the equation are spinor fields with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the antiparticle.

For the Klein–Gordon equation, the general form of the Schrödinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields, of which the Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations are two examples, can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a Lagrangian density and using the Euler–Lagrange equations for fields, or using the representation theory of the Lorentz group in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).

In general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schrödinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin , are complex-valued spinor fields.

=== Fock space ===
As originally formulated, the Dirac equation is an equation for a single quantum particle, just like the single-particle Schrödinger equation with wave function This is of limited use in relativistic quantum mechanics, where particle number is not fixed. Heuristically, this complication can be motivated by noting that mass–energy equivalence implies material particles can be created from energy. A common way to address this in QFT is to introduce a Hilbert space where the basis states are labeled by particle number, a so-called Fock space. The Schrödinger equation can then be formulated for quantum states on this Hilbert space. However, because the Schrödinger equation picks out a preferred time axis, the Lorentz invariance of the theory is no longer manifest, and accordingly, the theory is often formulated in other ways.

== History ==

Following Max Planck&#x27;s quantization of light (see black-body radiation), Albert Einstein interpreted Planck&#x27;s quanta to be photons, particles of light, and proposed that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, one of the first signs of wave–particle duality. Since energy and momentum are related in the same way as frequency and wave number in special relativity, it followed that the momentum formula_72 of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength formula_14, or proportional to its wave number formula_110:
formula_191
where formula_192 is the Planck constant and formula_193 is the reduced Planck constant. Louis de Broglie hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form standing waves, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.
These quantized orbits correspond to discrete energy levels, and de Broglie reproduced the Bohr model formula for the energy levels. The Bohr model was based on the assumed quantization of angular momentum formula_194 according to
formula_195
According to de Broglie, the electron is described by a wave, and a whole number of wavelengths must fit along the circumference of the electron&#x27;s orbit:
formula_196

This approach essentially confined the electron wave in one dimension, along a circular orbit of radius formula_197.

In 1921, prior to de Broglie, Arthur C. Lunn at the University of Chicago had used the same argument based on the completion of the relativistic energy–momentum 4-vector to derive what we now call the de Broglie relation. Unlike de Broglie, Lunn went on to formulate the differential equation now known as the Schrödinger equation and solve for its energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom; the paper was rejected by the &quot;Physical Review&quot;, according to Kamen.

Following up on de Broglie&#x27;s ideas, physicist Peter Debye made an offhand comment that if particles behaved as waves, they should satisfy some sort of wave equation. Inspired by Debye&#x27;s remark, Schrödinger decided to find a proper 3-dimensional wave equation for the electron. He was guided by William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s analogy between mechanics and optics, encoded in the observation that the zero-wavelength limit of optics resembles a mechanical system—the trajectories of light rays become sharp tracks that obey Fermat&#x27;s principle, an analog of the principle of least action.
The equation he found is
formula_198

By that time Arnold Sommerfeld had refined the Bohr model with relativistic corrections. Schrödinger used the relativistic energy–momentum relation to find what is now known as the Klein–Gordon equation in a Coulomb potential (in natural units):
formula_199

He found the standing waves of this relativistic equation, but the relativistic corrections disagreed with Sommerfeld&#x27;s formula. Discouraged, he put away his calculations and secluded himself with a mistress in a mountain cabin in December 1925.

While at the cabin, Schrödinger decided that his earlier nonrelativistic calculations were novel enough to publish and decided to leave off the problem of relativistic corrections for the future. Despite the difficulties in solving the differential equation for hydrogen (he had sought help from his friend the mathematician Hermann Weyl) Schrödinger showed that his nonrelativistic version of the wave equation produced the correct spectral energies of hydrogen in a paper published in 1926. Schrödinger computed the hydrogen spectral series by treating a hydrogen atom&#x27;s electron as a wave formula_200, moving in a potential well formula_157, created by the proton. This computation accurately reproduced the energy levels of the Bohr model.

The Schrödinger equation details the behavior of formula_25 but says nothing of its &quot;nature&quot;. Schrödinger tried to interpret the real part of formula_203 as a charge density, and then revised this proposal, saying in his next paper that the modulus squared of formula_25 is a charge density. This approach was, however, unsuccessful. In 1926, just a few days after this paper was published, Max Born successfully interpreted formula_25 as the probability amplitude, whose modulus squared is equal to probability density. Later, Schrödinger himself explained this interpretation as follows:
== Interpretation ==

The Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say &quot;what,&quot; exactly, the wave function is. The meaning of the Schrödinger equation and how the mathematical entities in it relate to physical reality depends upon the interpretation of quantum mechanics that one adopts.

In the views often grouped together as the Copenhagen interpretation, a system&#x27;s wave function is a collection of statistical information about that system. The Schrödinger equation relates information about the system at one time to information about it at another. While the time-evolution process represented by the Schrödinger equation is continuous and deterministic, in that knowing the wave function at one instant is in principle sufficient to calculate it for all future times, wave functions can also change discontinuously and stochastically during a measurement. The wave function changes, according to this school of thought, because new information is available. The post-measurement wave function generally cannot be known prior to the measurement, but the probabilities for the different possibilities can be calculated using the Born rule. Other, more recent interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as relational quantum mechanics and QBism also give the Schrödinger equation a status of this sort.

Schrödinger himself suggested in 1952 that the different terms of a superposition evolving under the Schrödinger equation are &quot;not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously&quot;. This has been interpreted as an early version of Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation. This interpretation, formulated independently in 1956, holds that &quot;all&quot; the possibilities described by quantum theory &quot;simultaneously&quot; occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. This interpretation removes the axiom of wave function collapse, leaving only continuous evolution under the Schrödinger equation, and so all possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superposition. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a time. Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate. Why we should assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and why should the probabilities be given by the Born rule? Several ways to answer these questions in the many-worlds framework have been proposed, but there is no consensus on whether they are successful.

Bohmian mechanics reformulates quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of adding a force due to a &quot;quantum potential&quot;. It attributes to each physical system not only a wave function but in addition a real position that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation. The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schrödinger equation together with the guiding equation.

<doc id="59877" wikidata="Q182333" url="?curid=59877" title="Gas constant">
<text>The molar gas constant (also known as the gas constant, universal gas constant, or ideal gas constant) is denoted by the symbol or . It is the molar equivalent to the Boltzmann constant, expressed in units of energy per temperature increment per amount of substance, rather than energy per temperature increment per &quot;particle&quot;. The constant is also a combination of the constants from Boyle&#x27;s law, Charles&#x27;s law, Avogadro&#x27;s law, and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. It is a physical constant that is featured in many fundamental equations in the physical sciences, such as the ideal gas law, the Arrhenius equation, and the Nernst equation.

The gas constant is the constant of proportionality that relates the energy scale in physics to the temperature scale and the scale used for amount of substance. Thus, the value of the gas constant ultimately derives from historical decisions and accidents in the setting of units of energy, temperature and amount of substance. The Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant were similarly determined, which separately relate energy to temperature and particle count to amount of substance.

The gas constant &quot;R&quot; is defined as the Avogadro constant &quot;N&quot;A multiplied by the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot; (or &quot;k&quot;B):
: formula_1
:: = 

Since the 2019 revision of the SI, both &quot;N&quot;A and &quot;k&quot; are defined with exact numerical values when expressed in SI units. As a consequence, the SI value of the molar gas constant is exact.

Some have suggested that it might be appropriate to name the symbol &quot;R&quot; the Regnault constant in honour of the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault, whose accurate experimental data were used to calculate the early value of the constant. However, the origin of the letter &quot;R&quot; to represent the constant is elusive. The universal gas constant was apparently introduced independently by August Friedrich Horstmann (1873) and Dmitri Mendeleev who reported it first on 12 September 1874. Using his extensive measurements of the properties of gases,
Mendeleev also calculated it with high precision, within 0.3% of its modern value.

The gas constant occurs in the ideal gas law:
formula_2
where &quot;P&quot; is the absolute pressure, &quot;V&quot; is the volume of gas, &quot;n&quot; is the amount of substance, &quot;m&quot; is the mass, and &quot;T&quot; is the thermodynamic temperature. &quot;R&quot;specific is the mass-specific gas constant. The gas constant is expressed in the same unit as molar heat.

== Dimensions ==
From the ideal gas law &quot;PV&quot; = &quot;nRT&quot; we get:
: formula_3
where &quot;P&quot; is pressure, &quot;V&quot; is volume, &quot;n&quot; is number of moles of a given substance, and &quot;T&quot; is temperature.

As pressure is defined as force per area of measurement, the gas equation can also be written as:
: formula_4

Area and volume are (length)2 and (length)3 respectively. Therefore:
: formula_5

Since force × length = work:
: formula_6

The physical significance of &quot;R&quot; is work per mole per degree. It may be expressed in any set of units representing work or energy (such as joules), units representing degrees of temperature on an absolute scale (such as kelvin or rankine), and any system of units designating a mole or a similar pure number that allows an equation of macroscopic mass and fundamental particle numbers in a system, such as an ideal gas (see &quot;Avogadro constant&quot;).

Instead of a mole the constant can be expressed by considering the normal cubic metre.

Otherwise, we can also say that:
: formula_7

Therefore, we can write &quot;R&quot; as:
: formula_8

And so, in terms of SI base units:
: &quot;R&quot; = .

== Relationship with the Boltzmann constant ==
The Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;B (alternatively &quot;k&quot;) may be used in place of the molar gas constant by working in pure particle count, &quot;N&quot;, rather than amount of substance, &quot;n&quot;, since:
: formula_9
where &quot;N&quot;A is the Avogadro constant.
For example, the ideal gas law in terms of the Boltzmann constant is:
: formula_10
where &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles (molecules in this case), or to generalize to an inhomogeneous system the local form holds:
: formula_11
where &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/&quot;V&quot; is the number density.
Finally, by defining the kinetic energy associated to the temperature:
: formula_12
the equation becomes simply:
: formula_13
which is the form usually encountered in statistical mechanics and other branches of theoretical physics.

== Measurement and replacement with defined value ==
As of 2006, the most precise measurement of &quot;R&quot; had been obtained by measuring the speed of sound &quot;c&quot;a(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) in argon at the temperature &quot;T&quot; of the triple point of water at different pressures &quot;P&quot;, and extrapolating to the zero-pressure limit &quot;c&quot;a(0, &quot;T&quot;). The value of &quot;R&quot; is then obtained from the relation:
: formula_14
where:
* &quot;γ&quot;0 is the heat capacity ratio ( for monatomic gases such as argon);
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature, &quot;T&quot;TPW = 273.16 K by the definition of the kelvin at that time;
* &quot;A&quot;r(Ar) is the relative atomic mass of argon and &quot;M&quot;u =  as defined at the time.

However, following the 2019 revision of the SI, &quot;R&quot; now has an exact value defined in terms of other exactly defined physical constants.

== Specific gas constant ==
The specific gas constant of a gas or a mixture of gases (&quot;R&quot;specific) is given by the molar gas constant divided by the molar mass (&quot;M&quot;) of the gas or mixture:
: formula_15

Just as the molar gas constant can be related to the Boltzmann constant, so can the specific gas constant by dividing the Boltzmann constant by the molecular mass of the gas:
: formula_16

Another important relationship comes from thermodynamics. Mayer&#x27;s relation relates the specific gas constant to the specific heat capacities for a calorically perfect gas and a thermally perfect gas:
: formula_17
where &quot;c&quot;p is the specific heat capacity for a constant pressure and &quot;c&quot;v is the specific heat capacity for a constant volume.

It is common, especially in engineering applications, to represent the specific gas constant by the symbol &quot;R&quot;. In such cases, the universal gas constant is usually given a different symbol such as &quot;&quot; to distinguish it. In any case, the context and/or unit of the gas constant should make it clear as to whether the universal or specific gas constant is being referred to.

In case of air, using the perfect gas law and the standard sea-level conditions (SSL) (air density &quot;ρ&quot;0 = 1.225 kg/m3, temperature &quot;T&quot;0 = 288.15 K and pressure &quot;p&quot;0 = ), we have that &quot;R&quot;air = &quot;P&quot;0/(&quot;ρ&quot;0&quot;T&quot;0) = . Then the molar mass of air is computed by &quot;M&quot;0 = &quot;R&quot;/&quot;R&quot;air = .

== U.S. Standard Atmosphere ==
The U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 (USSA1976) defines the gas constant &quot;R&quot;∗ as:
: &quot;R&quot;∗ = = .

Note the use of the kilomole, with the resulting factor of in the constant. The USSA1976 acknowledges that this value is not consistent with the cited values for the Avogadro constant and the Boltzmann constant. This disparity is not a significant departure from accuracy, and USSA1976 uses this value of &quot;R&quot;∗ for all the calculations of the standard atmosphere. When using the ISO value of &quot;R&quot;, the calculated pressure increases by only 0.62 pascal at 11 kilometres (the equivalent of a difference of only 17.4 centimetres or 6.8 inches) and 0.292 Pa at 20 km (the equivalent of a difference of only 33.8 cm or 13.2 in).

Also note that this was well before the 2019 SI redefinition, through which the constant was given an exact value.

<doc id="59879" wikidata="Q131591" url="?curid=59879" title="1938 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 1938 FIFA World Cup was the 3rd edition of the World Cup, the quadrennial international football championship for senior men&#x27;s national teams. It was held in France from 4 to 19 June 1938. Italy defended its title in the final, beating Hungary 4–2. Italy&#x27;s 1934 and 1938 teams hold the distinction of being the only men&#x27;s national team to win the World Cup multiple times under the same coach, Vittorio Pozzo. It would be the last World Cup until 1950; the 1942 and 1946 World Cups were cancelled due to World War II.

== Host selection ==

France was chosen as host nation by FIFA in Berlin on 13 August 1936. France was chosen over Argentina and Germany in the first round of voting. The decision to hold a second consecutive tournament in Europe (after Italy in 1934) caused outrage in South America, where it was believed that the venue should alternate between the two continents. This was the last World Cup to be staged before the outbreak of the Second World War.

== Qualification ==

Because of anger over the decision to hold a second successive World Cup in Europe, Uruguay, Argentina, United States and Mexico refused to enter the competition. Spain meanwhile could not participate due to the ongoing Spanish Civil War.

It was the first time that the hosts, France, and the title holders, Italy, qualified automatically. Title holders were given an automatic entry into the World Cup from 1938 until 2002 (inclusive), since abolished.

Of the 14 remaining places, eleven were allocated to Europe, two to the Americas, and one to Asia. As a result, only three non-European nations took part: Brazil, Cuba and Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), the latter being the first Asian country to participate in a FIFA World Cup. This is the smallest ever number of teams from outside the host continent to compete at a FIFA World Cup.

Austria qualified for the World Cup, but after qualification was complete, the Anschluss united Austria with Germany. Austria subsequently withdrew from the tournament, with some Austrian players joining the German squad, although not including Austrian star player Matthias Sindelar, who refused to play for the unified team. Latvia was the runner-up in Austria&#x27;s qualification group, but was not invited to participate; instead Austria&#x27;s place remained empty, and Sweden, which would have been Austria&#x27;s initial opponent, progressed directly to the second-round by default.

This tournament saw the first, and the only, participation in a World Cup tournament from Cuba and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). It also saw the World Cup debuts of Poland and Norway. Romania would not qualify for another World Cup until 1970, Poland and the Netherlands would not reappear at a finals tournament until 1974, and Norway would not qualify for another World Cup finals until 1994. A unified Germany team would not appear again until 1994, although Austria returned in 1954 and finished in third place.

===List of qualified teams===

The following 16 teams originally qualified for the final tournament. However, 15 teams participated after Austria&#x27;s withdrawal due to the Anschluss.
Asia (1)
* (debut)
Africa (0)
* None qualified

North, Central America and Caribbean (1)
* (debut)
South America (1)

Europe (12)
* Austria (withdrew)
* 
* (hosts)
* 
* (1934 champions)
* (debut)
* (debut)
* 

== Format ==
The knockout format from 1934 was retained. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, then 30 minutes of extra time were played. If the score was still tied after extra time, the match would be replayed. This was the last World Cup tournament that used a straight knockout format.

== Summary ==
Germany, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Cuba and Brazil were seeded for the draw taking place in Paris, on 5 March 1938. Sweden was given a bye due to Austria&#x27;s withdrawal.

Five of the seven first round matches required extra time to break the deadlock; two games still went to a replay. In one replay, Cuba advanced to the next round at the expense of Romania. In the other replay, Germany, which had led 1–0 in the first game against Switzerland, led 2–0 but eventually was beaten 2–4. This loss, which took place in front of a hostile, bottle-throwing crowd in Paris, was blamed by German coach Sepp Herberger on a defeatist attitude from the five Austrian players he had been forced to include; a German journalist later commented that &quot;Germans and Austrians prefer to play against each other even when they&#x27;re in the same team&quot;. Until they were knocked out in the first round in 2018, this was the only time Germany had failed to advance past the first round, and until their penalty shootout victory over France in the round of 16 of UEFA Euro 2020, this would be the last time Switzerland advanced past the first knockout game of a tournament.

Sweden advanced directly to the quarter-finals as a result of Austria&#x27;s withdrawal, and they proceeded to beat Cuba 8–0. The hosts, France, were beaten by the holders, Italy, and Switzerland were seen off by Hungary. Czechoslovakia took Brazil to extra time in a notoriously feisty match in Bordeaux before succumbing in a replay; the South Americans proved too strong for the depleted Czechoslovak side (both Oldřich Nejedlý and František Plánička had suffered broken bones in the first game) and won 2–1. This was the last match to be replayed in a World Cup.

Hungary destroyed Sweden in one of the semi-finals 5–1, while Italy and Brazil had the first of their many important World Cup clashes in the other. The Brazilians were without their star player Leônidas, who was injured, and the Italians won 2–1. Brazil topped Sweden 4–2 for third place.

Rumour has it, before the finals Benito Mussolini was to have sent a telegram to the team, saying &quot;Vincere o morire!&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Win or die!&quot;). This should not have been meant as a literal threat, but instead just an encouragement to win. However, no record remains of such a telegram, and World Cup player Pietro Rava said, when interviewed in 2001, &quot;No, no, no, that&#x27;s not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never &#x27;win or die&#x27;.&quot;

The final itself took place at the Stade Olympique de Colombes in Paris. Vittorio Pozzo&#x27;s Italian side took the lead early, but Hungary equalised within two minutes. The Italians took the lead again shortly after, and by the end of the first half were leading the Hungarians 3–1. Hungary never really got back into the game. With the final score favouring the Italians 4–2, Italy became the first team to successfully defend the title and were once more crowned World Cup winners.

Because of World War II, the World Cup would not be held for next 12 years, until 1950. As a result, Italy were the reigning World Cup holders for a record 16 years, from 1934 to 1950. The Italian Vice-president of FIFA, Dr. Ottorino Barassi, hid the trophy in a shoe-box under his bed throughout the Second World War and thus saved it from falling into the hands of occupying troops.

== Venues ==
Eleven venues in ten cities were planned to host the tournament; of these, all hosted matches except the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, which did not due to Austria&#x27;s withdrawal.

<doc id="59881" wikidata="Q191785" url="?curid=59881" title="Ideal gas law">
<text>The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle&#x27;s law, Charles&#x27;s law, Avogadro&#x27;s law, and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form:

formula_1
where formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 are the pressure, volume and temperature respectively; formula_5 is the amount of substance; and formula_6 is the ideal gas constant.
It can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Krönig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.

==Equation==

The state of an amount of gas is determined by its pressure, volume, and temperature. The modern form of the equation relates these simply in two main forms. The temperature used in the equation of state is an absolute temperature: the appropriate SI unit is the kelvin.

===Common forms===

The most frequently introduced forms are:formula_7where:
* formula_2 is the absolute pressure of the gas,
* formula_3 is the volume of the gas,
* formula_5 is the amount of substance of gas (also known as number of moles),
* formula_6 is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant,
* formula_12 is the Boltzmann constant,
* formula_13 is the Avogadro constant,
* formula_4 is the absolute temperature of the gas,
* formula_15 is the number of particles (usually atoms or molecules) of the gas.

In SI units, &quot;p&quot; is measured in pascals, &quot;V&quot; is measured in cubic metres, &quot;n&quot; is measured in moles, and &quot;T&quot; in kelvins (the Kelvin scale is a shifted Celsius scale, where 0 K = −273.15 °C, the lowest possible temperature). &quot;R&quot; has for value 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.989 ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), or 0.0821 L⋅atm/(mol⋅K).

===Molar form===
How much gas is present could be specified by giving the mass instead of the chemical amount of gas. Therefore, an alternative form of the ideal gas law may be useful. The chemical amount, &quot;n&quot; (in moles), is equal to total mass of the gas (&quot;m&quot;) (in kilograms) divided by the molar mass, &quot;M&quot; (in kilograms per mole):
: formula_16
By replacing &quot;n&quot; with &quot;m&quot;/&quot;M&quot; and subsequently introducing density &quot;ρ&quot; = &quot;m&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, we get:
: formula_17
: formula_18
: formula_19
Defining the specific gas constant &quot;R&quot;specific as the ratio &quot;R&quot;/&quot;M&quot;,
: formula_20
This form of the ideal gas law is very useful because it links pressure, density, and temperature in a unique formula independent of the quantity of the considered gas. Alternatively, the law may be written in terms of the specific volume &quot;v&quot;, the reciprocal of density, as
: formula_21

It is common, especially in engineering and meteorological applications, to represent the specific gas constant by the symbol &quot;R&quot;. In such cases, the universal gas constant is usually given a different symbol such as formula_22 or formula_23 to distinguish it. In any case, the context and/or units of the gas constant should make it clear as to whether the universal or specific gas constant is being used.

=== Statistical mechanics ===
In statistical mechanics, the following molecular equation (i.e. the ideal gas law in its theoretical form) is derived from first principles:
: formula_24
where is the absolute pressure of the gas, is the number density of the molecules (given by the ratio , in contrast to the previous formulation in which is the &quot;number of moles&quot;), is the absolute temperature, and is the Boltzmann constant relating temperature and energy, given by:
: formula_25
where is the Avogadro constant.
The form can be furtherly simplified by defining the kinetic energy corresponding to the temperature:
: formula_26
so the ideal gas law is more simply expressed as:
: formula_27

From this we notice that for a gas of mass , with an average particle mass of times the atomic mass constant, , (i.e., the mass is  Da) the number of molecules will be given by
: formula_28
and since , we find that the ideal gas law can be rewritten as
: formula_29

In SI units, is measured in pascals, in cubic metres, in kelvins, and in SI units.

=== Combined gas law ===
Combining the laws of Charles, Boyle and Gay-Lussac gives the combined gas law, which takes the same functional form as the ideal gas law says that the number of moles is unspecified, and the ratio of formula_30 to formula_4 is simply taken as a constant:
: formula_32
where formula_33 is the pressure of the gas, formula_3 is the volume of the gas, formula_4 is the absolute temperature of the gas, and formula_36 is a constant. When comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as
: formula_37

== Energy associated with a gas ==
According to the assumptions of the kinetic theory of ideal gases, one can consider that there are no intermolecular attractions between the molecules, or atoms, of an ideal gas. In other words, its potential energy is zero. Hence, all the energy possessed by the gas is the kinetic energy of the molecules, or atoms, of the gas.
: formula_38

This corresponds to the kinetic energy of &quot;n&quot; moles of a monoatomic gas having 3 degrees of freedom; &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;. The table here below gives this relationship for different amounts of a monoatomic gas.

== Applications to thermodynamic processes ==
The table below essentially simplifies the ideal gas equation for a particular process, making the equation easier to solve using numerical methods.

A thermodynamic process is defined as a system that moves from state 1 to state 2, where the state number is denoted by a subscript. As shown in the first column of the table, basic thermodynamic processes are defined such that one of the gas properties (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, or &quot;H&quot;) is constant throughout the process.

For a given thermodynamic process, in order to specify the extent of a particular process, one of the properties ratios (which are listed under the column labeled &quot;known ratio&quot;) must be specified (either directly or indirectly). Also, the property for which the ratio is known must be distinct from the property held constant in the previous column (otherwise the ratio would be unity, and not enough information would be available to simplify the gas law equation).

In the final three columns, the properties (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, or &quot;T&quot;) at state 2 can be calculated from the properties at state 1 using the equations listed.

 a. In an isentropic process, system entropy (&quot;S&quot;) is constant. Under these conditions, &quot;p&quot;1&quot;V&quot;1&quot;γ&quot; = &quot;p&quot;2&quot;V&quot;2&quot;γ&quot;, where &quot;γ&quot; is defined as the heat capacity ratio, which is constant for a calorifically perfect gas. The value used for &quot;γ&quot; is typically 1.4 for diatomic gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), (and air, which is 99% diatomic). Also &quot;γ&quot; is typically 1.6 for mono atomic gases like the noble gases helium (He), and argon (Ar). In internal combustion engines &quot;γ&quot; varies between 1.35 and 1.15, depending on constitution gases and temperature.

 b. In an isenthalpic process, system enthalpy (&quot;H&quot;) is constant. In the case of free expansion for an ideal gas, there are no molecular interactions, and the temperature remains constant. For real gasses, the molecules do interact via attraction or repulsion depending on temperature and pressure, and heating or cooling does occur. This is known as the Joule–Thomson effect. For reference, the Joule–Thomson coefficient μJT for air at room temperature and sea level is 0.22 °C/bar.

== Deviations from ideal behavior of real gases ==
The equation of state given here (&quot;PV&quot; = &quot;nRT&quot;) applies only to an ideal gas, or as an approximation to a real gas that behaves sufficiently like an ideal gas. There are in fact many different forms of the equation of state. Since the ideal gas law neglects both molecular size and intermolecular attractions, it is most accurate for monatomic gases at high temperatures and low pressures. The neglect of molecular size becomes less important for lower densities, i.e. for larger volumes at lower pressures, because the average distance between adjacent molecules becomes much larger than the molecular size. The relative importance of intermolecular attractions diminishes with increasing thermal kinetic energy, i.e., with increasing temperatures. More detailed &quot;equations of state&quot;, such as the van der Waals equation, account for deviations from ideality caused by molecular size and intermolecular forces.

== Derivations ==

=== Empirical ===
The empirical laws that led to the derivation of the ideal gas law were discovered with experiments that changed only 2 state variables of the gas and kept every other one constant.

All the possible gas laws that could have been discovered with this kind of setup are:
* Boyle&#x27;s law () formula_39
* Charles&#x27;s law () formula_40
* Avogadro&#x27;s law () formula_41
* Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law () formula_42
* formula_43
* formula_44

where &quot;P&quot; stands for pressure, &quot;V&quot; for volume, &quot;N&quot; for number of particles in the gas and &quot;T&quot; for temperature; where formula_45 are constants in this context because of each equation requiring only the parameters explicitly noted in them changing.

To derive the ideal gas law one does not need to know all 6 formulas, one can just know 3 and with those derive the rest or just one more to be able to get the ideal gas law, which needs 4.

Since each formula only holds when only the state variables involved in said formula change while the others (which are a property of the gas but are not explicitly noted in said formula) remain constant, we cannot simply use algebra and directly combine them all. This is why: Boyle did his experiments while keeping &quot;N&quot; and &quot;T&quot; constant and this must be taken into account (in this same way, every experiment kept some parameter as constant and this must be taken into account for the derivation).

Keeping this in mind, to carry the derivation on correctly, one must imagine the gas being altered by one process at a time (as it was done in the experiments). The derivation using 4 formulas can look like this:

at first the gas has parameters formula_46

Say, starting to change only pressure and volume, according to Boyle&#x27;s law (), then:

After this process, the gas has parameters formula_47

Using then equation () to change the number of particles in the gas and the temperature,

After this process, the gas has parameters formula_48

Using then equation () to change the pressure and the number of particles,

After this process, the gas has parameters formula_49

Using then Charles&#x27;s law (equation 2) to change the volume and temperature of the gas,

After this process, the gas has parameters formula_50

Using simple algebra on equations (), (), () and () yields the result:
formula_51 or formula_52 where formula_53 stands for the Boltzmann constant.

Another equivalent result, using the fact that formula_54, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of moles in the gas and &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant, is:
formula_55 which is known as the ideal gas law.

If three of the six equations are known, it may be possible to derive the remaining three using the same method. However, because each formula has two variables, this is possible only for certain groups of three. For example, if you were to have equations (), () and () you would not be able to get any more because combining any two of them will only give you the third. However, if you had equations (), () and () you would be able to get all six equations because combining () and () will yield (), then () and () will yield (), then () and () will yield (), as well as would the combination of () and () as is explained in the following visual relation:
where the numbers represent the gas laws numbered above.

If you were to use the same method used above on 2 of the 3 laws on the vertices of one triangle that has a &quot;O&quot; inside it, you would get the third.

For example:

Change only pressure and volume first:
then only volume and temperature:
then as we can choose any value for formula_56, if we set formula_57, equation () becomes:
combining equations () and () yields formula_58, which is equation (), of which we had no prior knowledge until this derivation.

=== Theoretical ===

==== Kinetic theory ====
The ideal gas law can also be derived from first principles using the kinetic theory of gases, in which several simplifying assumptions are made, chief among which are that the molecules, or atoms, of the gas are point masses, possessing mass but no significant volume, and undergo only elastic collisions with each other and the sides of the container in which both linear momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

First we show that the fundamental assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases imply that
: formula_59

Consider a container in the formula_60 Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we assume that a third of the molecules moves parallel to the formula_61-axis, a third moves parallel to the formula_62-axis and a third moves parallel to the formula_63-axis. If all molecules move with the same velocity formula_64, denote the corresponding pressure by formula_65. We choose an area formula_66 on a wall of the container, perpendicular to the formula_61-axis. When time formula_68 elapses, all molecules in the volume formula_69 moving in the positive direction of the formula_61-axis will hit the area. There are formula_71 molecules in a part of volume formula_69 of the container, but only one sixth (i.e. a half of a third) of them moves in the positive direction of the formula_61-axis. Therefore, the number of molecules formula_74 that will hit the area formula_66 when the time formula_68 elapses is formula_77.

When a molecule bounces off the wall of the container, it changes its momentum formula_78 to formula_79. Hence the magnitude of change of the momentum of one molecule is formula_80. The magnitude of the change of momentum of all molecules that bounce off the area formula_66 when time formula_68 elapses is then formula_83. From formula_84 and formula_85 we get

: formula_86

We considered a situation where all molecules move with the same velocity formula_64. Now we consider a situation where they can move with different velocities, so we apply an &quot;averaging transformation&quot; to the above equation, effectively replacing formula_65 by a new pressure formula_33 and formula_90 by the arithmetic mean of all squares of all velocities of the molecules, i.e. by formula_91 Therefore
: formula_92
which gives the desired formula.

Using the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, the fraction of molecules that have a speed in the range formula_64 to formula_94 is formula_95, where
: formula_96
and formula_36 denotes the Boltzmann constant. The root-mean-square speed can be calculated by
: formula_98

Using the integration formula
: formula_99
it follows that
: formula_100
from which we get the ideal gas law:
: formula_101

==== Statistical mechanics ====
Let q = (&quot;q&quot;x, &quot;q&quot;y, &quot;q&quot;z) and p = (&quot;p&quot;x, &quot;p&quot;y, &quot;p&quot;z) denote the position vector and momentum vector of a particle of an ideal gas, respectively. Let F denote the net force on that particle. Then (two times) the time-averaged kinetic energy of the particle is:
: formula_102
where the first equality is Newton&#x27;s second law, and the second line uses Hamilton&#x27;s equations and the equipartition theorem. Summing over a system of &quot;N&quot; particles yields
: formula_103

By Newton&#x27;s third law and the ideal gas assumption, the net force of the system is the force applied by the walls of the container, and this force is given by the pressure &quot;P&quot; of the gas. Hence
: formula_104
where dS is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the divergence of the position vector q is
: formula_105
the divergence theorem implies that
: formula_106
where &quot;dV&quot; is an infinitesimal volume within the container and &quot;V&quot; is the total volume of the container.

Putting these equalities together yields
: formula_107
which immediately implies the ideal gas law for &quot;N&quot; particles:
: formula_108
where &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/&quot;N&quot;A is the number of moles of gas and &quot;R&quot; = &quot;N&quot;A&quot;k&quot;B is the gas constant.

== Other dimensions ==
For a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional system, the ideal gas pressure is:
: formula_109
where formula_110 is the volume of the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional domain in which the gas exists. The dimensions of the pressure changes with dimensionality.

<text>A blast beat is a type of drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with certain styles of extreme metal, namely black metal, death metal and their respective subgenres, and occasionally in metalcore. In Adam MacGregor&#x27;s definition, &quot;the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.&quot; Blast beats have been described by &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Whitney Strub as, &quot;maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence&quot;. According to Brad Schlueter of &quot;Drum!&quot;,

Napalm Death is said to have coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been used by others for its characteristically chaotic sound.

==History==

=== Antecedents in jazz and rock ===
Although most commonly associated with hardcore punk and extreme metal, the earliest forms of what would later become the blast beat are noted to have appeared in jazz music. A commonly cited early example that somewhat resembles the modern technique is a brief section of Sam Woodyard&#x27;s drum solo during a 1962 rendition of &quot;Kinda Dukish&quot; with the Duke Ellington orchestra. A clip of the performance under the title &quot;The first blast beat in the world&quot; garnered almost one million views on YouTube. Woodyard&#x27;s example, however, lacks the modern inclusion of kick drum and cymbal work into the beat. Another early instance can be heard in Sunny Murray&#x27;s 1966 or &#x27;67 performance on a live recording &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; with saxophonist Albert Ayler, although this did not receive an official release until the 1998 reissue of &quot;Albert Ayler in Greenwich Village&quot;. Prior to these two examples resurfacing and receiving the attention in the 2010s, AllMusic contributor Thom Jurek credited Tony Williams as the &quot;true inventor of the blastbeat&quot; for his frenetic performance on &quot;Dark Prince&quot; for Trio of Doom in 1979, officially released only in 2007. 

Some early antecedents of blast beats have also been identified in rock music. An early example of a proto-blast beat can be found in the Tielman Brothers&#x27; 1959 single, &quot;Rock Little Baby of Mine&quot; during the instrumental break. Drummer Steve Ross of the band Coven also plays an &quot;attempt&quot; at a blast beat in the track &quot;Dignitaries of Hell&quot; off the group&#x27;s 1969 album, &quot;Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls&quot;.

Four early examples of blast beats were performed in 1970: King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot; off their sophomore release &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; includes proto-blastbeats in the later half of the song; Mike Fouracre of Marsupilami performs many blast beats throughout their self-titled album, most notably on &quot;And the Eagle Chased the Dove to Its Ruin&quot;; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s track &quot;The Barbarian&quot; contains a very brief blast beat in the outro; Bill Ward, drummer of pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, played a few blast beats on a live performance of their song &quot;War Pigs&quot; (e.g. at timestamps 3:52 and 6:38).

=== Modern hardcore and metal blast beats ===
The blast beat as it is known today originated in the hardcore punk and grindcore scenes of the 1980s. Contrary to popular belief, blast beats originated from punk and hardcore music, not metal music. In the UK punk and hardcore scene of the early 1980s there were many bands attempting to play as fast as possible. English band Napalm Death coined the term &quot;blast beat&quot;, although this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the [hardcore] blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo. D.R.I. (1983, &quot;No Sense&quot;), Beastie Boys (1982, track 5, &quot;Riot Fight&quot;), Sepultura (1985, track 11, &quot;Antichrist&quot;), S.O.D. (1985, track 11, &quot;Milk&quot;), Sarcófago (1986, track 10, &quot;Satanas&quot;), and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death&#x27;s emergence. Rockdetector contributor Garry Sharpe-Young credits D.R.I.&#x27;s Eric Brecht as the first on their 1983 debut but credits Napalm Death with making it better known. 

In 1985, Napalm Death, then an emerging grindcore band, replaced their former drummer Miles &quot;Rat&quot; Ratledge with Mick Harris, who brought to the band a whole new level of speed. Harris is credited with developing the term &quot;blast beat&quot;, describing the fast notes played on the kick and snare. Harris started using the blast beat as a fundamental aspect of Napalm Death&#x27;s early musical compositions. It was finally with Napalm Death&#x27;s first full-length album &quot;Scum&quot; (1987) that blast beat started to evolve into a distinct musical expression of its own. Blast beats became popular in extreme music from the mid to late 1980s . The blast beat evolved into its modern form as it was developed in the American death metal and grindcore scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pete Sandoval, drummer of Terrorizer (1986–1989) and later Morbid Angel (1984–2013), purportedly was the first to use blast beats in metronomic time (and not as arhythmic or non-metric white noise) and thus gave it a more useful musical characteristic for timekeeping.

Blast beats eventually appeared in commercially successful metal music, beginning with Fear Factory&#x27;s album &quot;Demanufacture&quot; (1995) and Slipknot&#x27;s album &quot;Iowa&quot; (2001).

==Characteristics==
A blast beat is traditionally played as an alternating single-stroke roll broken up between the kick drum and the snare drum. Blast beats are counted in 32nd or 16th notes. In a modern musical context blast beats are usually regarded as such when played at a minimum of above 90 beats per minute 32nd notes, or 180 bpm 16th notes. Early blast beats were generally quite slow and less precise compared to today&#x27;s standards. Nowadays, a blast beat is normally played from 180 bpm 16th notes up to such high tempos as in the range of 250-280 bpm 16th notes (or even higher). There is also the &quot;gravity blast&quot;, not to be confused with the one-handed &quot;gravity roll&quot; (see below). This technique uses the rim of the snare drum as a fulcrum, allowing two snare hits with one downward motion (essentially doing the work of two hands with only one).

Typical blast beats consist of 8th-note patterns between both the bass and snare drum alternately, with the hi-hat or the ride synced. Variations exist such as displacing hi-hat/ride, snare and bass drum hits and/or using other cymbals such as splashes, crashes, chinas and even tambourines for accenting, for example when using odd time or playing progressively. While playing 8th or 8th note triplets some drummers choose to play in sync with one foot while others split the 8th notes between both feet. In blast beats in general, the notes on the kick drum can be played either with one foot only or by alternating both feet, referred to as a &quot;two-foot&quot; or &quot;economy&quot; blast.

===Variations===
As blast beats have evolved, different types and interpretations have emerged. There are four main variations of the blast beat: the traditional blast, the bomb blast, the hammer blast and the freehand blast.

The traditional blast beat is a single-stroke roll alternating between the snare drum and kick drum. The ride hand is usually playing in unison with the kick drum. The traditional blast beat is structurally very similar to the skank beat, which can be regarded as a predecessor and a half time variation of the traditional blast beat. The skank beat originated in the early punk and thrash metal scene as a drum beat for extreme music. The skank beat is similar to the blast beat as it alternates between the kick and the snare, with the difference that the ride hand plays notes in unison with both kick and snare. A skank beat is in other words a sped up 2/4 rock or polka beat. In the US the skank beat was early on also referred to as the &quot;Slayer&quot; or &quot;thrash&quot; beat due to its popularity among thrash metal bands such as Slayer.

The bomb blast is essentially a combination of blast beat and double bass drumming. When measured in 16th notes a bomb blast consists of 8th notes on the snare played above a 16th notes kick drum line. Most drummers play this beat by leading with the snare, while the traditional blast beat is usually led with the kick. The bomb blast became popular among 1990s death metal bands such as Cannibal Corpse, which is why the bomb blast is also referred to as the &quot;Cannibal&quot; blast.

The hammer blast is played with the kick and snare in unison. Instead of playing 8th notes kick and snare in alternation and thus creating a 16th notes roll, the hammer blast is played as a straight 8th notes roll on the kick and snare simultaneously. The advantage of the hammer blast is that only one fast hand is needed, which usually is the drummer&#x27;s leading hand (right for right-handed and left for left-handed). If the weaker hand can&#x27;t keep up with the 8th notes snare line, it can play quarter notes. The kick drum line can be played with one foot as well as a two-footed economy blast. When played at an extremely fast tempo, the hammer blast can be referred to as a &quot;hyper blast&quot;. The hammer blast became popular in death metal music of the early 1990s.

The freehand blast, also known as the gravity blast, utilizes the gravity roll technique in a blast beat context. Of all the main blast beat variations, this one is the most recent to have emerged. The snare line is played as a 16th notes single stroke roll, also known as a gravity roll or single handed roll. The roll is played with an up and down motion in which you push and pull the drumstick on and off the snare drum. By using the snare rim as a fulcrum you create a stroke each time you push and pull the drumstick up and down. In this way, the player can double the output of notes to match the amount of notes produced by two feet on the bass drum. It usually presents similarly to a unison hammer blast, but at double the tempo of what would be possible with normal techniques. One drawback is that this blast has a limited volume. The concept behind the gravity roll is not new, but is noted for being brought into modern music by drummer Johhny Rabb. Rabb has published the book &quot;The Official Freehand Technique&quot;, which covers the gravity roll technique. The term &quot;gravity roll&quot; or &quot;gravity blast,&quot; while common and accepted usage, is less correct than &quot;freehand roll&quot; or &quot;fulcrum roll&quot; in that the technique does not rely on gravity and can be played sideways, inverted, or in a zero gravity environment. A combination of the gravity blast and the bomb blast (i.e. both the kick and the snare is playing 16th notes in unison) is called a gravity bomb.

==Examples==
Examples of the four main blast beat variations in drum tab:

 C- x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-| C- x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-| C- x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-| C- x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
 S- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-| S- -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o| S- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-| S- oooooooooooooooo|
 B- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-| B- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-| B- oooooooooooooooo| B- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-|

The first example is a hammer blast. The second example shows a traditional blast beat - essentially a skank beat played at a high tempo (this particular one leads with the bass drum, but the snare can lead as well). Example #3 shows a blast beat with double bass, known as a bomb blast. Example #4 illustrates a freehand blast, also known as a gravity blast and is the only one that showcases the proper speed of a modern blast beat.


== Criticism ==
The blast beat has drawn criticism from some musicians in the heavy metal community due to what they perceive as a lack of &quot;groove&quot; associated with the technique, as well as the inaccessibility of its sound to listeners who are not musicians. Vinnie Paul, drummer of the American heavy metal band Pantera delineated to &quot;Blabbermouth&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s drummers playing for drummers. It&#x27;s called, &#x27;Look at me. Listen how fast I can go&#x27; — dudududududududu [mimics ultra-fast double-bass beat]. There&#x27;s no melody, there&#x27;s no song and there&#x27;s no chorus. It just doesn&#x27;t take you anywhere, so it doesn&#x27;t have a groove to me. [...] I can appreciate people for being able to go that fast with their left hand, man. But I just can&#x27;t groove to that beat. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s just like somebody sweeping the floor or something [...] I&#x27;d rather hear a [John] Bonham groove going on than somebody sweeping the floor. You know?&quot;

<text>The Royal Spanish Academy ( , generally abbreviated as RAE) is Spain&#x27;s official royal institution with a mission to ensure the stability of the Spanish language. It is based in Madrid, Spain, and is affiliated with national language academies in 22 other Hispanophone nations through the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language. 

The RAE dedicates itself to language planning by applying linguistic prescription aimed at promoting linguistic unity within and between various territories, to ensure a common standard. The proposed language guidelines are shown in a number of works.

==History==
In 1711, Spain, unlike France, Italy and Portugal, did not have a large dictionary with a comprehensive and collegially elaborated lexicographical repertoire. 
The initial nucleus of the future Academy was formed that same year by the eight novatores who met in the library of the palace of , Duke of Escalona and Marquess of Villena, located in the Plaza de las Descalzas Reales in Madrid.

The Spanish Academy was founded in 3 August 1713 on the initiative of Pacheco, with the purpose of &quot;fixing the voices and words of the Castilian language in their greatest propriety, elegance and purity&quot;. The objective was to fix the language in the state of fullness that it had reached during the 16th century and that had been consolidated in the 17th century. 
The Italian Accademia della Crusca founded in 1582 and the Académie Française founded in 1635 were taken as models. 

The first official session of the new corporation was held at the residence of Pacheco on 6 July 1713, an event that is recorded in the book of minutes, begun on 3 August 1713. 

Its creation, with twenty-four elected members was approved on 3 October 1714 by Royal Decree of Philip V, that gave the academy the right to be called the &quot;Royal Spanish Academy&quot;. This meant that the academicians enjoyed the preeminences and exemptions granted to the servants of the Royal Household. It had its first seat at number 26 Valverde Street, from where it moved to Alarcón Street, corner of Felipe IV, its definitive seat.

The emblem chosen was a fiery crucible placed on the fire, with the legend (&quot;cleans, fixes and gives splendor&quot;). 
Collective utility became the main hallmark of the Spanish Academy, differentiating itself from other academies that had proliferated in the golden centuries and that were conceived as mere occasional literary gatherings.

The RAE began establishing rules for the orthography of Spanish beginning in 1741 with the first edition of the (spelled from the second edition onwards). The proposals of the Academy became the official norm in Spain by royal decree in 1844, and they were also gradually adopted by the Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas.
Several reforms were introduced in the (1959, New Norms of Prosody and Orthography). Since the establishment of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language in 1951, the Spanish academy works in close consultation with the other Spanish language academies in its various works and projects. The 1999 Orthography was the first to be edited by the twenty two academies together. The current rules and practical recommendations on spelling are presented in the latest edition of the (2010).

The headquarters, opened in 1894, is located at Calle Felipe IV, 4, in the ward of Jerónimos, next to the . The Center for the Studies of the Royal Spanish Academy, opened in 2007, is located at Calle Serrano 187–189.


== Fundamentals ==

According to Salvador Gutiérrez, an academic numerary of the institution, the Academy does not dictate the rules but studies the language, collects information and presents it. The rules of the language are simply the continued use of expressions, some of which are collected by the Academy. Although he also says that it is important to read and write correctly. 
Article 1 of the statutes of the Royal Spanish Academy, translated from Spanish, says the following:

== Composition ==

Members of the Academy are known as (), chosen from among prestigious people within the arts and sciences, including several Spanish-language authors, known as The Immortals (Spanish: ), similarly to their French Academy counterparts. The numeraries (Spanish: &quot;Números)&quot; are elected for life by the other academicians. Each academician holds a seat labeled with a letter from the Spanish alphabet, with upper and lower case letters denoting separate seats. Only eight letters of the alphabet do not have—nor have they had in the past—representation in the seats of the RAE: &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;Ñ&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;.

The Academy has included Latin American members from the time of Rafael María Baralt, although some Spanish-speaking countries have their own academies of the language.

<text>The Institute for Catalan Studies ( ), also known by the acronym IEC, is an academic institution which seeks to undertake research and study into &quot;all elements of Catalan culture&quot;. It is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

==IEC==
The IEC is known principally for its work in standardising the Catalan language. The Institute&#x27;s current president is Joan Domènec Ros Aragonès, elected to the office for four years in 2013 and to a second term in 2017, following Salvador Giner, elected to the office for four years in 2005 and to a second term in 2009. The IEC is based in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, and the second largest city in Spain.

Enric Prat de la Riba, who was to become the first President of the Commonwealth of Catalonia, signed the founding document of the Institute, as president of the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona on 17 June 1907. The IEC is one of a number of cultural and scientific institutions created at that time to lend greater prestige to the Catalan language and culture; others include the (Library of Catalonia), the &quot;Escola Industrial&quot; (Industrial School), the Hiking Club of Catalonia, the &quot;Escola Superior de Belles Arts&quot; (Higher School of Fine Arts) and the &quot;Escola del Treball&quot; (School of Labour), &quot;el Centre de Recerca Matemàtica&quot;. Prat de la Riba also founded the &quot;Escola de l&#x27;Administració Local&quot; (School of Local Administration), in order to create a body of Catalan civil servants for the regional government.

The IEC was admitted to the Union Académique Internationale in 1922, shortly after the establishment of the latter.

During the dictatorship of Franco, along with many other Catalan cultural institutions, the Institut lived a semiclandestine existence, and was not officially restored to its previous status in the field of language standardisation until a 1991 bill was passed by the (also restored) Catalan Parliament.

The IEC inspired the creation of the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans in Occitania. Occitania is an area in southern France where Occitan (often called &quot;Provençal&quot;) has historically been spoken.

== Philological Section ==
The IEC&#x27;s Philological Section was founded in 1911. Antoni Maria Alcover served as its first president. Along with Pompeu Fabra, the Philological Section worked to establish a series of spelling norms that were approved by members in 1913. These became the foundation of modern written Catalan which are still in use today. Similarly, in 1917, the &quot;Diccionari Ortogràfic de l&#x27;Institut&quot; was published; it soon became a dictionary of spelling norms irredeemably tied to the reputation of former Institute Director Pompeu Fabra. The dictionary went through several editions, with the last released in 1937. This work and others were the basis of Fabra&#x27;s &quot;Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana&quot; published in 1932, a general-purpose dictionary that became a standard reference work throughout the various Catalan-speaking territories.

Officially the IEC provides standards for the language as a whole: the Philological Section has members from Catalonia proper, Northern Catalonia (located in France), the Balearic Islands, Valencia, Alghero in Sardinia and the Principality of Andorra (the only country where Catalan is the sole official language). However, the Valencian Region south of Catalonia has its own language academy, the &quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&quot;, which nevertheless formally acknowledges that theirs is one variant of the common language. In an area known as the &quot;Franja de Ponent&quot;, the eastern edge of Aragon adjacent to Catalonia where Catalan is spoken by about 44,000 inhabitants, the rules are followed &quot;de facto&quot; although Catalan is not an official language in that region.

Other IEC works of note include the &quot;Diccionari de la Llengua Catalana&quot; published in 1995, and the regionally sensitive &quot;Diccionari Català-Valencià-Balear&quot; (Catalan-Valencian-Balearic Dictionary). Notable members of the Philological Section include Josep Carner, Àngel Guimerà, Joan Maragall, and Aina Moll Marquès.

==Societat Catalana de Terminologia==
The Societat Catalana de Terminologia (Catalan Terminology Society – SCATERM) is a subsidiary society of the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans (Institute for Catalan Studies – IEC) which is attached to the latter&#x27;s Philological Section and brings together all the organisations and professionals involved in Catalan terminology and disseminates terminological activities carried out in Catalan-speaking areas.

===History of the Societat Catalana de Terminologia===
The Societat Catalana de Terminologia was founded as the Associació Catalana de Terminologia (Catalan Terminology Association – ACATERM) following a proposal presented at the 1st Terminology and Language Services Conference on 18 May 2001 at Pompeu Fabra University (UPF). Under this initiative, a management committee consisting of members of various institutions in Catalan-speaking areas was responsible for steering the founding process. It was made up of representatives from the Unió de Federacions Esportives de Catalunya (Sports Federations Union of Catalonia – UFEC), the terminology centre TERMCAT, the Institut Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada (University Institute for Applied Linguistics – IULA) at the UPF and the language services at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya – BarcelonaTech and Jaume I University at Castelló.

===Societat Catalana de Terminologia&#x27;s goals===
* Encourage the dissemination of terminology in Catalan in scientific and technical fields.
* Provide a platform for promoting the recognition and professionalisation of the field of terminology.
* Sponsor the provision and exchange of information about terminology activities between terminology users and professionals.
* Establish relationships with other organisations, associations and institutions which have similar purposes.
* Cooperate with the Philological Section and other IEC bodies in work and discussions related to the terminology of this institution.

===Societat Catalana de Terminologia&#x27;s activities===
SCATERM regularly runs academic conferences, seminars and training courses. Every two months it publishes the electronic newsletter Butlletí de la Societat Catalana de Terminologia and every six months the terminology journal Terminàlia (as a hardcopy and online) which is both a specialist peer-reviewed scientific journal and also an informative magazine. It also publishes two collections created in 2009: &quot;Memòries de la Societat Catalana de Terminologia&quot;, which features the proceedings of the most important events organised by the Society and in particular its annual conference, and &quot;Eines de Terminologia&quot;, which includes monographs concerning the study and practice of terminology.
In order to drive research into terminology, SCATERM holds a biennial award for students as part of the awards and scholarships given by the IEC called the Societat Catalana de Terminologia Award.
