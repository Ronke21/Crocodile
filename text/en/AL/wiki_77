<text>Mary Louise &quot;Meryl&quot; Streep (born June 22, 1949) is an American actress. Known for her versatility and adept accent work, she has been described as &quot;the best actress of her generation&quot;. She has received numerous accolades throughout her career spanning over five decades, including three Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, eight Golden Globe Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards as well as nominations for seven Grammy Awards and a Tony Award. 

She made her feature film debut in &quot;Julia&quot; (1977) and soon established herself as one of the most respected actresses of all time. She has received three Academy Awards, the first for Best Supporting Actress for playing a troubled wife in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979), followed by two Best Actress wins for playing a Holocaust survivor in &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982) and Margaret Thatcher in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011). Throughout her career she has continued to earn critical acclaim for her diverse roles on film ranging from the dramatic in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1984), &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995), &quot;Doubt&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot; (2013), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Post&quot; (2017) to the comedic in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008), &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; (both 2009), and &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; (2016).

On stage, Streep made her debut in 1975 in &quot;Trelawny of the Wells&quot;, and the following year she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for a double-bill production of &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; and &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot;. For her work on television, Streep won three Primetime Emmy Awards including for her roles in the miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978) and &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003). She also took roles in the HBO drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; (2019) and the Hulu comedy-mystery series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; (2023–24).

Streep has been the recipient of many honorary awards, including an Honorary César in 2003, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2004, a Gala Tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2008, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2011, an Honorary Golden Bear in 2012 and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2017. President Barack Obama awarded her the National Medal of Arts in 2010 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. In 2003, the French government made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.

==Early life and education==
Mary Louise Streep was born on June 22, 1949, in Summit, New Jersey. to artist Mary Wilkinson Streep and pharmaceutical executive Harry William Streep Jr. She has two younger brothers, Harry William Streep III and Dana David Streep, both actors. Streep&#x27;s mother, whom she has compared in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep said, &quot;She was a mentor because she said to me, &#x27;Meryl, you&#x27;re capable. You&#x27;re so great.&#x27; She was saying, &#x27;You can do whatever you put your mind to. If you&#x27;re lazy, you&#x27;re not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.&#x27; And I believed her.&quot; Although she was naturally more introverted than her mother, when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother at times for advice. 

Streep was raised as a Presbyterian in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Cedar Hill Elementary School and the Oak Street School, which was a junior high school at that time. In her junior high debut, she starred as Louise Heller in the play &quot;The Family Upstairs&quot;. In 1963, the family moved to Bernardsville, New Jersey, where she attended Bernards High School. Author Karina Longworth described her as a &quot;gawky kid with glasses and frizzy hair&quot;, yet noted that she liked to show off in front of the camera in family home movies from a young age. At age 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. Despite her talent, she later remarked, &quot;I was singing something I didn&#x27;t feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through.&quot; She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended Mass. She was a high school cheerleader for the Bernards High School Mountaineers. She was also chosen as the homecoming queen her senior year. 
Although Streep appeared in numerous school plays during her high school years, she was uninterested in serious theater until acting in the play &quot;Miss Julie&quot; at Vassar College in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus. Vassar drama professor Clinton J. Atkinson noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself.&quot; Streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She received her AB in drama &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1971, before applying for an MFA from the Yale School of Drama. At Yale, she supplemented her course fees by working as a waitress and typist, and appeared in over a dozen stage productions per year; at one point, she became overworked and developed ulcers, so she contemplated quitting acting and switching to study law. Streep played a variety of roles on stage, from Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; to an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato. She was a student of choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, whom she introduced at the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors. Another of her teachers was Robert Lewis, a co-founder of the Actors Studio. Streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, remarking that one professor taught the emotional recall technique by delving into personal lives in a way she found &quot;obnoxious&quot;. She received her MFA in drama from Yale in 1975. She also enrolled as a visiting student at Dartmouth College in 1970, and received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the college in 1981.
==Career==
===1970s: Early work and breakthrough===

One of Streep&#x27;s first professional jobs in 1975 was at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s National Playwrights Conference, during which she acted in five plays over six weeks. She moved to New York City in 1975, and was cast by Joseph Papp in a production of &quot;Trelawny of the Wells&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, opposite Mandy Patinkin and John Lithgow. She went on to appear in five more roles in her first year in New York, including in Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival productions of &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; with Raul Julia, and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; opposite Sam Waterston and John Cazale. She entered into a relationship with Cazale at this time, and resided with him until his death three years later. She starred in the musical &quot;Happy End&quot; on Broadway, and won an Obie for her performance in the off-Broadway play &quot;Alice at the Palace&quot;.

Although Streep had not aspired to become a film actor, Robert De Niro&#x27;s performance in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976) had a profound impact on her; she said to herself, &#x27;That&#x27;s the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up.&#x27; Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s remake of the action adventure &quot;King Kong&quot; which was released in 1976. De Laurentiis, referring to Streep as she stood before him, said in Italian to his son: &quot;This is so ugly. Why did you bring me this?&quot; Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian, and she remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry that I&#x27;m not as beautiful as I should be, but, you know – this is it. This is what you get.&quot; She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot;. She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep&#x27;s other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical &quot;Happy End&quot;, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.

Streep&#x27;s first feature film role came opposite Jane Fonda in the 1977 film &quot;Julia&quot;, in which she had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress, &quot;I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I&#x27;ve made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business.&quot; However, Streep stated in 2015 that Fonda had a lasting influence on her as an actress, and credited her with opening &quot;probably more doors than I probably even know about&quot;. Robert De Niro, who had spotted Streep in her stage production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, suggested that she play the role of his girlfriend in the war film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). Cazale, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer, was also cast in the film, and Streep took on the role of a &quot;vague, stock girlfriend&quot; to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. Longworth notes that Streep, &quot;Made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concepta normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew&quot;. Pauline Kael, who later became a strong critic of Streep, remarked that she was a &quot;real beauty&quot; who brought much freshness to the film with her performance. The film&#x27;s success exposed Streep to a wider audience and earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
In the 1978 miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;, Streep played the leading role of a German woman married to a Jewish artist played by James Woods in Nazi era Germany. She found the material to be &quot;unrelentingly noble&quot; and professed to have taken on the role for financial gain. Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale&#x27;s illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. With an estimated audience of 109 million, &quot;Holocaust&quot; brought a wider degree of public recognition to Streep, who found herself &quot;on the verge of national visibility&quot;. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance. Despite the awards success, Streep was still not enthusiastic towards her film career and preferred acting on stage.

She played the supporting role of Leilah in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s &quot;Uncommon Women and Others&quot; in a May 1978 &quot;Theater in America&quot; television production for PBS&#x27;s Great Performances. She replaced Glenn Close, who played the role in the Off-Broadway production at the Phoenix Theatre. Hoping to divert herself from the grief of Cazale&#x27;s death, Streep accepted a role in &quot;The Seduction of Joe Tynan&quot; (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on &quot;automatic pilot&quot;. She performed the role of Katherine in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; for Shakespeare in the Park. That same year she played a supporting role as the former girlfriend turned lesbian in &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her performance as being &quot;beautifully played&quot;. 

In the drama &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as &quot;too evil&quot; and insisted that it was not representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who &quot;hated her guts&quot; at first. Hoffman and producer Stanley R. Jaffe later spoke of Streep&#x27;s tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting: &quot;She&#x27;s extraordinarily hard-working, to the extent that she&#x27;s obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else, but what she&#x27;s doing.&quot; The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep&#x27;s &quot;own emotional intensity&quot;, writing that she was one of the &quot;rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery&quot;. 

For the film, Streep won both the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, which she famously left in the ladies&#x27; room after giving her speech. She received awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Board of Review and National Society of Film Critics for her collective work in her three film releases of 1979. Both &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; were major commercial successes and were consecutive winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture.

===1980s: Rise to prominence===
In 1979, Streep began workshopping &quot;Alice in Concert&quot;, a musical version of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, with writer and composer Elizabeth Swados and director Joseph Papp; the show was put on at New York&#x27;s Public Theater from December 1980. Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Streep as the production&#x27;s &quot;one wonder&quot;, but questioned why she devoted so much energy to it. By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;A Star for the 80s&quot;; Jack Kroll commented, &quot;There&#x27;s a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn&#x27;t simply imitate (although she&#x27;s a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior&quot;.

Streep denounced her fervent media coverage at the time as &quot;excessive hype&quot;. The story within a story drama &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981) was Streep&#x27;s first leading role. The film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as contemporary actors, telling their modern story, as well as the Victorian era drama they were performing. Streep developed an English accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help wishing that I was more beautiful&quot;. A &quot;New York&quot; magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a &quot;chameleon&quot;, willing to play any type of role. Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work. The following year, she re-united with Robert Benton for the psychological thriller, &quot;Still of the Night&quot; (1982), co-starring Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep &quot;is stunning, but she&#x27;s not on screen anywhere near long enough&quot;.

Greater success came later in the year when Streep starred in the drama &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (also 1982), portraying a Polish survivor of Auschwitz caught in a love triangle between a young naïve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep&#x27;s emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the &quot;choice&quot; scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. That scene, in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; who wrote in 2006: &quot;It&#x27;s classic Streep, the kind of scene that makes your scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions&quot;. 

Among several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, &quot;Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I&#x27;ve ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn&#x27;t touch in this movie, and yet we&#x27;re never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine&quot;. Pauline Kael, on the contrary, called the film an &quot;infuriatingly bad movie&quot;, and thought that Streep &quot;decorporealizes&quot; herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines &quot;don&#x27;t seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her&quot;.

In 1983, Streep played her first non-fictional character, the nuclear whistleblower and labor union activist Karen Silkwood, who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols&#x27; biographical film &quot;Silkwood&quot;. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation, she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her ... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside&quot;. Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; considered Streep&#x27;s characterization to have been &quot;brilliant&quot;, while Silkwood&#x27;s boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen&#x27;s father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. 

Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance &quot;Falling in Love&quot; (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed &quot;great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm ... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms.&quot; In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep&#x27;s performance in &quot;Plenty&quot;, believing it to be &quot;one of Streep&#x27;s most difficult and ambiguous&quot; films and &quot;most feminist&quot; role.

Longworth considers Streep&#x27;s next release, &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), to have established her as a Hollywood superstar. In the film, Streep starred as the Danish writer Karen Blixen, opposite Robert Redford&#x27;s Denys Finch Hatton. Director Sydney Pollack was initially dubious about Streep in the role, as he did not think she was sexy enough, and had considered Jane Seymour for the part. Pollack recalls that Streep impressed him in a different way: &quot;She was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit. There was no shielding between her and me.&quot; Streep and Pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in Kenya, particularly over Blixen&#x27;s voice. Streep had spent much time listening to tapes of Blixen, and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which Pollack thought excessive. A significant commercial success, the film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture. It also earned Streep another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and the film ultimately won Best Picture. Film critic Stanley Kauffmann praised her performance, writing &quot;Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means her performance in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; is at the highest level of acting in film today.&quot;

Longworth notes that the dramatic success of &quot;Out of Africa&quot; led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep in the years that followed, especially as she was now demanding $4 million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time, such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep &quot;never seemed to play herself&quot;, and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1986) and &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the &quot;Great Performances&quot; telecast of the Phoenix Theater production of &quot;Secret Service&quot; (1977). In &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of developing the Australian accent in the film: &quot;I had to study a little bit for Australian because it&#x27;s not dissimilar [to American], so it&#x27;s like coming from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to her performance as &quot;another stunning performance&quot;, played with &quot;the kind of virtuosity that seems to re-define the possibilities of screen acting&quot;.

In 1989, Streep lobbied to play the lead role in Oliver Stone&#x27;s adaption of the play &quot;Evita&quot;, but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing &quot;exhaustion&quot; initially, although it was later revealed that there was a dispute over her salary. By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in &quot;She-Devil&quot; (1989), a satire that parodied societal obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer. Though the film was not a success, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that Streep was the &quot;one reason&quot; to see it, and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play. Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: &quot;Audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach males from 16 to 25 – it&#x27;s become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First, they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who&#x27;s going to see them.&quot;

===1990s: Commercial fluctuations===
Biographer Karen Hollinger described the early 1990s as a downturn in the popularity of Streep&#x27;s films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious, but commercially unsuccessful, dramas, and, more significantly, to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, &quot;By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one&#x27;s interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you&#x27;ve got to pick your parts with great care.&quot; At the Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild National Women&#x27;s Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women&#x27;s work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.

After roles in the comedy-drama &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), and the comedy-fantasy &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), Streep starred with Goldie Hawn in the farcical black comedy, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to re-write several of the scenes, particularly the one in which her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was &quot;unrealistically male&quot; in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep&#x27;s career, during which she got into character by &quot;thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time&quot;. Due to Streep&#x27;s allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they made her look nearer 70. Longworth considers &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; to have been &quot;the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling&quot;. Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1 million in just five days, Streep&#x27;s contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep&#x27;s &quot;wicked-witch routine&quot; but dismissed the film as &quot;&quot;She-Devil&quot; with a make-over&quot; and one which &quot;hates women&quot;. Streep later admitted to having disliked filming the scenes involving heavy special effects, and vowed never to work again on a film with heavy special effects.

Streep appeared with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1993), set in Chile during Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship. The film was not well received by critics. Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever&quot;. The following year, Streep starred in &quot;The River Wild&quot;, as the mother of children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found her to be &quot;strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen&quot;.

Streep&#x27;s most successful film of the decade was the romantic drama &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995) directed by Clint Eastwood, who adapted the film from Robert James Waller&#x27;s novel of the same name. It relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife Francesca (Streep). Though Streep disliked the novel it was based on, she found the script to be a special opportunity for an actress her age. She gained weight for the part and dressed differently from the character in the book to emulate voluptuous Italian film stars such as Sophia Loren. Both Loren and Anna Magnani were an influence in her portrayal, and Streep viewed Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Roma&quot; (1962) prior to filming. The film was a box office hit and grossed over $70 million in the United States. The film, unlike the novel, was warmly received by critics. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Eastwood had managed to create &quot;a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller&#x27;s self-congratulatory overkill&quot;, while Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory&quot;. Longworth believes that Streep&#x27;s performance was &quot;crucial to transforming what could have been a weak soap opera into a vibrant work of historical fiction implicitly critiquing postwar America&#x27;s stifling culture of domesticity&quot;. She considers it to have been the role in which Streep became &quot;arguably the first middle-aged actress to be taken seriously by Hollywood as a romantic heroine&quot;.

Streep played the estranged sister of Bessie (Diane Keaton), a woman battling leukemia, in &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Streep recommended Keaton for the role. Roger Ebert stated that, &quot;Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.&quot; The film was well received, and Streep earned another Golden Globe nomination for her performance.

Streep&#x27;s performance in &quot;...First Do No Harm&quot; (1997) garnered her a second Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie. In 1998, Streep first appeared opposite Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, another Broadway adaptation, which was entered into the Venice Film Festival in its year of release. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that &quot;Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.&quot; Later that year, she played a housewife dying of cancer in &quot;One True Thing&quot;. The film met with positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declared, &quot;After &quot;One True Thing&quot;, critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she&#x27;s able to give us a woman who&#x27;s at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan noted that her role &quot;is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career,&quot; but she &quot;adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [her performance] one of her most moving&quot;.

Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari in the music drama &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; (1999). Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote: Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you&#x27;ve heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari&#x27;s speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep&#x27;s other accents. This is not Streep&#x27;s voice, but someone else&#x27;s – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.

===2000s: Career resurgence and stage work===


Streep entered the 2000s with a voice cameo in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), a science fiction film about a childlike android, played by Haley Joel Osment. The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Liam Neeson which was held in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2001, in honour of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the United Nations and Kofi Annan. In 2001, Streep returned to the stage for the first time in more than twenty years, playing Arkadina in The Public Theater&#x27;s revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;, directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Kevin Kline, Natalie Portman, John Goodman, Marcia Gay Harden, Stephen Spinella, Debra Monk, Larry Pine and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Streep&#x27;s son, Henry Gummer, later to be known as musician Henry Wolfe, was also featured in the play in the role of Yakov, a hired workman.

The same year, Streep began work on Spike Jonze&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Adaptation.&quot; (2002), in which she portrayed real-life journalist Susan Orlean. Lauded by critics and viewers alike, the film won Streep her fourth Golden Globe in the Best Supporting Actress category. A. O. Scott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered Streep&#x27;s portrayal of Orlean to have been &quot;played with impish composure&quot;, noting the contrast in her &quot;wittily realized&quot; character with love interest Chris Cooper&#x27;s &quot;lank-haired, toothless charisma&quot; as the autodidact arrested for poaching rare orchids. Streep appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore in Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), based on the 1999 novel by Michael Cunningham. Focusing on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; by Virginia Woolf, the film was generally well received and won all three leading actresses a Silver Bear for Best Actress.

In 2003, Streep re-united with Mike Nichols to star with Al Pacino and Emma Thompson in the HBO&#x27;s adaptation of Tony Kushner&#x27;s six-hour play &quot;Angels in America&quot;, the story of two couples whose relationships dissolve amidst the backdrop of Reagan era politics. Streep, who was cast in four roles in the miniseries, received her second Emmy Award and fifth Golden Globe for her performance. She appeared in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s moderately successful remake of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; in 2004, co-starring Denzel Washington, playing the role of a woman who is both a U.S. senator and the manipulative, ruthless mother of a vice-presidential candidate. The same year, she played the supporting role of Aunt Josephine in &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; alongside Jim Carrey, based on the first three novels in Snicket&#x27;s book series. The black comedy received generally favorable reviews from critics, and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup. Streep also narrated the film &quot;Monet&#x27;s Palate&quot;. Streep was next cast in the comedy film &quot;Prime&quot; (2005), directed by Ben Younger. In the film, she played Lisa Metzger, the Jewish psychoanalyst of a divorced and lonesome business-woman, played by Uma Thurman, who enters a relationship with Metzger&#x27;s 23-year-old son (Bryan Greenberg). A modest mainstream success, it eventually grossed US$67.9 million internationally. Roger Ebert noted how Streep had &quot;that ability to cut through the solemnity of a scene with a zinger that reveals how all human effort is, after all, comic at some level&quot;.

In August and September 2006, Streep starred onstage at The Public Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. The Public Theater production was a new translation by playwright Tony Kushner, with songs in the Weill/Brecht style written by composer Jeanine Tesori; veteran director George C. Wolfe was at the helm. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton in this three-and-a-half-hour play. Around the same time, Streep, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed the last two members of what was once a popular family country music act in Robert Altman&#x27;s final film &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006). A comedic ensemble piece featuring Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film grossed more than US$26 million, the majority of which came from domestic markets.

Commercially, Streep fared better with a role in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (also 2006), a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger&#x27;s 2003 novel of the same name. Streep portrayed the powerful and demanding Miranda Priestly, fashion magazine editor (and boss of a recent college graduate played by Anne Hathaway). Though the overall film received mixed reviews, her portrayal, of what Ebert calls the &quot;poised and imperious Miranda&quot;, drew rave reviews from critics, and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, as well as another Golden Globe. On its commercial release, the film became Streep&#x27;s biggest commercial success to this point, grossing more than US$326.5 million worldwide.

She portrayed a wealthy university patron in Chen Shi-zheng&#x27;s much-delayed feature drama &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, a film about a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired by the events of the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve &quot;Dark Matter&quot; out of respect for the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller &quot;Rendition&quot; (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts, and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, &quot;Rendition&quot; was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.

In this period, Streep had a short role alongside Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close, and her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer in Lajos Koltai&#x27;s drama film &quot;Evening&quot; (2007), based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Susan Minot. Switching between the present and the past, it tells the story of a bedridden woman, who remembers her tumultuous life in the mid-1950s. The film was released to a lukewarm reaction from critics, who called it &quot;beautifully filmed, but decidedly dull [and] a colossal waste of a talented cast&quot;. She had a role in Robert Redford&#x27;s &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot; (also 2007), a film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan, a U.S. senator, a reporter, and a California college professor. Like &quot;Evening&quot;, critics felt that the talent of the cast was wasted, and that it suffered from slow pacing, although one critic announced that Streep positively stood out, being &quot;natural, unforced, quietly powerful&quot;, in comparison to Redford&#x27;s forced performance.

Streep found major commercial success when she starred in Phyllida Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008), a film adaptation of the musical of the same name, based on the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA. Co-starring Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski, Streep played a single mother and a former girl-group singer, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding on the idyllic Greek island of Skopelos known in the film as Kalokairi. An instant box office success, &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; became Streep&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million, also ranking it first among the highest-grossing musical films. Nominated for another Golden Globe, Streep&#x27;s performance was generally well received by critics, with Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commenting: &quot;The greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star.&quot;

&quot;Doubt&quot; (also 2008) features Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. A drama revolving around the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings accusations of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success, and was hailed by many critics as one of the best films of 2008. The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s script. Ebert, who awarded the film the full four stars, highlighted Streep&#x27;s caricature of a nun, who &quot;hates all inroads of the modern world&quot;, while Kelly Vance of &quot;The East Bay Express&quot; remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s thrilling to see a pro like Streep step into an already wildly exaggerated role, and then ramp it up a few notches just for the sheer hell of it. Grim, red-eyed, deathly pale Sister Aloysius may be the scariest nun of all time.&quot;

In 2009, Streep played chef Julia Child in Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, co-starring with Stanley Tucci, and again with Amy Adams. (Tucci and Streep had worked together earlier in &quot;Devil Wears Prada&quot;.) The first major motion picture based on a blog, &quot;Julie and Julia&quot; contrasts the life of Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot;. Longworth believes her caricature of Julia Child was &quot;quite possibly the biggest performance of her career, while also drawing on her own experience to bring lived-in truth to the story of a late bloomer&quot;. In Nancy Meyers&#x27; romantic comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; (also 2009), Streep starred with Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. She received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for both &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;; she won the award for &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, and later received her 16th Oscar nomination for it. She also lent her voice to Mrs. Felicity Fox in Wes Anderson&#x27;s stop-motion film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;.

===2010s: Further critical and commercial success===
Streep re-teamed with &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; director Phyllida Lloyd on &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011), a British biographical film about Margaret Thatcher, which takes a look at the Prime Minister during the Falklands War and her years in retirement. Streep, who attended a session of the House of Commons to see British Members of Parliament (MPs) in action in preparation for her role as Thatcher, called her casting &quot;a daunting and exciting challenge&quot;. While the film had a mixed reception, Streep&#x27;s performance gained rave reviews, earning her Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, as well as her third win at the 84th Academy Awards. Former advisers, friends, and family of Thatcher criticized Streep&#x27;s portrayal of her as &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;biased&quot;. The following year, after Thatcher&#x27;s death, Streep issued a formal statement describing Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;hard-nosed fiscal measures&quot; and &quot;hands-off approach to financial regulation&quot;, while praising her &quot;personal strength and grit&quot;.

Streep re-united with &quot;Prada&quot; director David Frankel on the set of the romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Hope Springs&quot; (2012), co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell. Streep and Jones play a middle-aged couple, who attend a week of intensive marriage counseling to try to bring back the intimacy missing in their relationship. Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising the &quot;mesmerizing performances ... which offer filmgoers some grown-up laughs – and a thoughtful look at mature relationships&quot;. In 2013, Streep starred alongside Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor in the black comedy drama &quot;&quot; (2013) about a dysfunctional family that re-unites into the familial house when their patriarch suddenly disappears. Based on Tracy Letts&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning , Streep received positive reviews for her portrayal of the family&#x27;s strong-willed and contentious matriarch, who is suffering from oral cancer and an addiction to narcotics. She was subsequently nominated for another Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Award.

In 2014&#x27;s &quot;The Giver&quot;, a motion picture adaptation of the young adult novel, Streep played a community leader. Set in 2048, the social science fiction film recounts the story of a post-apocalyptic community without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, where a young boy is chosen to learn the real world. Streep was aware of the book before being offered the role by co-star and producer Jeff Bridges. Upon its release, &quot;The Giver&quot; was met with generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. Streep also had a small role in the period drama film &quot;The Homesman&quot; (2014). Set in the 1850s midwest, the film stars Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones as an unusual pair who help three women driven to madness by the frontier to get back East. Streep does not appear until near the end of the film, playing a preacher&#x27;s wife, who takes the women into care. &quot;The Homesman&quot; premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it garnered largely positive reviews from critics.

Directed by Rob Marshall, &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (also 2014) is a Disney film adaptation of the Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim in which Streep plays a witch. A fantasy genre crossover inspired by the Grimm Brothers&#x27; fairy tales, it centers on a childless couple who set out to end a curse placed on them by Streep&#x27;s vengeful witch. Though the film was dismissed by some critics such as Mark Kermode as &quot;irritating naffness&quot;, Streep&#x27;s performance earned her Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and Critic&#x27;s Choice Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. In July 2014, it was announced that Streep would portray Maria Callas in &quot;Master Class&quot;, but the project was pulled after director Mike Nichols&#x27;s death in November of the same year.

In 2015, Streep starred in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Ricki and the Flash&quot;, playing a grocery store checkout worker by day who is a rock musician at night, and who has one last chance to reconnect with her estranged family. Streep learned to play the guitar for the semi-autobiographical drama-comedy film, which again featured Streep with her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer. Reviews of the film were generally mixed. Streep&#x27;s other film of this time was director Sarah Gavron&#x27;s period drama &quot;Suffragette&quot; (also 2015), co-starring Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter. In the film, she played the small, but pivotal, role of Emmeline Pankhurst, a British political activist and leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. The film received mostly positive reviews, particularly for the performances of the cast, though its distributor earned criticism that Streep&#x27;s prominent position within the marketing was misleading.

Following the duties of the president at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016, Streep starred in the Stephen Frears-directed comedy &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; (2016), an eponymous biopic about a blithely unaware tone-deaf opera singer who insists upon public performance. Other cast members were Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg. Robbie Collin considered it to be one of her most &quot;human performance&quot; and felt that it was &quot;full of warmth that gives way to heart-pinching pathos&quot;. She won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA nominations.

Streep next starred as the first American female newspaper publisher, Katharine Graham, to Tom Hanks&#x27; Ben Bradlee, in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s political drama &quot;The Post&quot; (2017), which centers on &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s publication of the 1971 Pentagon Papers. The film received positive reviews with praise directed to the performances of the two leads. Manohla Dargis wrote that &quot;Streep creates an acutely moving portrait of a woman who in liberating herself helps instigate a revolution&quot;. It earned over $177 million against a budget of $50 million. Streep received her 31st Golden Globe nomination and 21st Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

In 2018, Streep briefly reprised her role in the musical sequel &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;. She also played a supporting part in Rob Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, a musical sequel to the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; starring Emily Blunt in the titular role. Streep next featured in her first main role in a television series by starring in the second season of the HBO drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; in 2019. She took on the part of Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Nicole Kidman&#x27;s character. Liane Moriarty, author of the novel of the same name, on which the first season is based, wrote a 200-page novella that served as the basis for the second season. Moriarty decided to name the new character Mary Louise, after Streep&#x27;s legal name. Streep subsequently agreed to the part without reading a script for the first time in her career. Writing for the BBC, Caryn James labeled her performance &quot;delicious and wily&quot; and found her to be the &quot;embodiment of a passive-aggressive granny&quot;. She received an Emmy nomination for the show. The same year, Streep then starred in the Steven Soderbergh-directed biographical comedy &quot;The Laundromat&quot;, about the Panama Papers, opposite Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas. It was the first movie distributed by Netflix in which Streep starred. She also played Aunt March in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot;, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Timothée Chalamet, and Laura Dern. 
David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Streep&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;Streep is clearly having a ball as the imperious snob who snorts with disapproval...[and] does her best to hide her affection for her nieces behind her narrowed gaze and all-purpose disdain&quot;. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $218 million against its $40 million budget.

===2020s: Streaming projects===

In 2020, she voiced a role in the Apple TV+ animated short film &quot;Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth&quot;. Streep had leading roles in two films, both released by streaming services. She reunited with Nicole Kidman for Netflix, in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Prom&quot; (2020), a film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. That same year she also reunited with director Steven Soderbergh for his HBO Max comedy film &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot; (2020). Streep starred alongside Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen, Lucas Hedges, and Gemma Chan. Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; noted, &quot;Streep could, in some senses, be approaching the film as a meta commentary on her own ivied stature as the world&#x27;s greatest living actor (in some people&#x27;s estimation, anyway). If that is what&#x27;s happening, she never betrays her motivations with a wink. It&#x27;s all played pretty earnestly&quot;.

Streep then starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; (2021), directed by Adam McKay for Netflix. Streep played a comical role as the fictional President of the United States who waves off the fears of climate change. In his mixed review, Peter DeBruge of &quot;Variety&quot; compared her performance of that of Donald Trump, adding she was &quot;clearly having more fun than we are&quot;. Streep served as an executive producer on &quot;Sell/Buy/Date&quot; (2022), directed by Sarah Jones. She acted in the Apple TV+ anthology series &quot;Extrapolations&quot; (2023). Later that year, she began playing Loretta Durkin, a struggling actress, from the third season of the Hulu comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;, starring Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. Leila Latif of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Streep, unsurprisingly, plays Loretta beautifully, truly tapping into the agony of a woman who&#x27;s faced a lifetime of rejection but somehow kept her dream alive&quot;. She received a Golden Globe, and Primetime Emmy Award nomination and won a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award.

In 2025, Streep attended the &quot;Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special&quot;, in which she acted in an alien abduction skit portraying the mother of Colleen Rafferty, played by Kate McKinnon. It marked Streep&#x27;s first &quot;SNL&quot; appearance.

==Other ventures==
After Streep starred in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, her rendition of the titular song rose to popularity on the Portuguese music charts, where it peaked at number eight in October 2008. At the 35th People&#x27;s Choice Awards, her version of &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; won an award for &quot;Favorite Song From A Soundtrack&quot;. In 2008, Streep was nominated for a Grammy Award (her fifth nomination) for her work on the &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; soundtrack. Streep has narrated numerous audio books, including three by children&#x27;s book author William Steig: &quot;Brae Irene&quot;, &quot;Spinky Sulks&quot;, and &quot;The One and Only Shrek!&quot;.

Streep is the spokesperson for the National Women&#x27;s History Museum, to which she has made significant donations (including her fee for &quot;The Iron Lady, &quot;which was $1 million), and hosted numerous events. On October 4, 2012, Streep donated $1 million to The Public Theater in honor of both its late founder, Joseph Papp, and her friend, the author Nora Ephron. She also supports Gucci&#x27;s &quot;Chime for Change&quot; campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.

In 2014, Streep established two scholarships for students at the University of Massachusetts Lowell – the Meryl Streep Endowed Scholarship for English majors, and the Joan Hertzberg Endowed Scholarship (named for Streep&#x27;s former classmate at Vassar College) for math majors.

In April 2015, it was announced that Streep had funded a screenwriters lab for female screenwriters over forty years old, called the Writers Lab, to be run by New York Women in Film &amp; Television and the collective IRIS. The Lab was the only one of its kind in the world for female screenwriters over forty years old. In 2015, Streep signed an open letter for which One Campaign had been collecting signatures; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they served as heads of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa, respectively, in setting development funding priorities. Also in 2015, Streep sent each member of the U.S. Congress a letter supporting the Equal Rights Amendment. Each of her letters was sent with a copy of the book &quot;Equal Means Equal: Why the Time for the ERA is Now&quot; by Jessica Neuwirth, president of the ERA Coalition.

When asked in a 2015 interview with &quot;Time Out&quot; if she was a feminist, Streep replied, &quot;I am a humanist, I am for nice easy balance.&quot; In March 2016, Streep, among others, signed a letter asking for gender equality throughout the world, in observance of International Women&#x27;s Day; this was also organized by One Campaign. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time&#x27;s Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.

On April 25, 2017, Streep publicly backed the campaign to free Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker from Crimea who was subjected to a sham trial by Russia and jailed in Siberia for 20 years in August 2015. She was pictured alongside Ukrainian lawmaker Mustafa Nayyem with a &quot;Free Sentsov&quot; sign in a photograph taken during the PEN America Annual Literary Gala on April 25, at which Sentsov was honoured with a 2017 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write award.

==Reception and legacy==
In 2004, Streep was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award by the board of directors of the American Film Institute. In 2011, she received a Kennedy Center Honors, introduced by Tracey Ullman, and speeches by 2009 Kennedy Center Honoree Robert De Niro and 2003 Kennedy Center Honoree Mike Nichols. Those also to honor Streep included, Kevin Kline, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, and Anne Hathaway. The tribute ended with the whole cast who sang &quot;She&#x27;s My Pal&quot;, a play on &quot;He&#x27;s My Pal&quot; from &quot;Ironweed&quot;.

In November 2014, President Barack Obama bestowed upon Streep the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. The citation reads as follows, &quot;Meryl Streep is one of the most widely known and acclaimed actors in history. Ms. Streep has captured our imaginations with her unparalleled ability to portray a wide range of roles and attract an audience that has only grown over time, portraying characters who embody the full range of the human experience.&quot; In January 2017, Viola Davis presented Streep with the Cecil B. DeMille at the Golden Globes. Davis stated to Streep &quot;You make me proud to be an artist&quot;. In her acceptance speech, Streep quoted the recently departed Carrie Fisher, saying, &quot;Take your broken heart and make it into art.&quot;

&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; commented that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to imagine that there was a time before Meryl Streep was the greatest-living actress&quot;. Emma Brockes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; notes that despite Streep&#x27;s being &quot;one of the most famous actresses in the world&quot;, it is &quot;strangely hard to pin an image on Streep&quot;, in a career where she has &quot;laboured to establish herself as an actor whose roots lie in ordinary life&quot;. Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, &quot;I have a smattering of things I&#x27;ve learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say &#x27;Now, which one would you like?&#x27; Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.&quot; She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, allowing her to have a degree of improvisation and to learn from her mistakes.

Karina Longworth notes how &quot;external&quot; Streep&#x27;s performances are, &quot;chameleonic&quot; in her impersonation of characters, &quot;subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them&quot;. In her early roles such as &quot;Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, she was compared to both Diane Keaton and Jill Clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy. Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, &quot;I come ready and I don&#x27;t want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable&quot;.

Mike Nichols, who directed Streep in &quot;Silkwood&quot;, &quot;Heartburn&quot;, &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;, and &quot;Angels in America&quot;, praised Streep&#x27;s ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, &quot;In every role, she becomes a totally new human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to her as if she were that person.&quot; He said that directing her is &quot;so much like falling in love that it has the characteristics of a time which you remember as magical, but which is shrouded in mystery&quot;. He also noted that Streep&#x27;s acting ability had a profound impact on her co-stars, and that &quot;one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her&quot;. Longworth believes that in nearly every film, Streep has &quot;sly infused&quot; a feminist point of view in her portrayals. However, film critic Molly Haskell has stated, &quot;None of her heroines are feminist, strictly speaking. Yet, they uncannily embody various crosscurrents of experience in the last twenty years, as women have re-defined themselves against the background of the women&#x27;s movement&quot;.

Streep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents – from Danish in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985) to British Received Pronunciation in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011); Italian in &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995); a southern American accent in &quot;The Seduction of Joe Tynan&quot; (1979); a Minnesota accent in &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006); Upstate New York in &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1987); and a heavy Bronx accent in &quot;Doubt&quot; (2008). Streep has stated that she grew up listening to artists such as Barbra Streisand, the Beatles, and Bob Dylan, and she learned a lot about how to use her voice, her &quot;instrument&quot;, by listening to Barbra Streisand&#x27;s albums. In the film &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (1988, released in the U.S. as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;), in which she portrays a New Zealand transplant to Australia, Streep developed a hybrid of Australian and New Zealand English. Her performance received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, as well as Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.

For her role in the film &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, she reproduced the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.
When questioned in Belfast as to how she reproduces different accents, Streep replied in a reportedly &quot;perfect&quot; Belfast accent: &quot;I listen.&quot;

==Activism and advocacy==
Politically, Streep has described herself as part of the American Left. She gave a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In January 2017, Streep was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, during which she delivered a predominantly political speech that implicitly criticized President-elect Donald Trump. She argued that Trump had a very strong platform and used it inappropriately to mock a disabled reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski, whom, in her words, Trump &quot;outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back&quot;. Trump responded by calling Streep &quot;one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;a Hillary flunky who lost big&quot;.

While promoting &quot;Suffragette&quot; in 2015, Streep accused the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. In June 2023, Streep was reported as one of many A-List members of the SAG-AFTRA who signed a letter threatening to strike.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships and family === 
Author Karina Longworth notes that despite her stardom, for decades Streep has managed to maintain a relatively normal personal life. Streep lived with actor John Cazale in the 1970s, caring for him after his lung cancer diagnosis until he died in March 1978. Streep said of his death:

Streep married sculptor Don Gummer six months after Cazale&#x27;s death. They have four children: musician Henry Wolfe Gummer (born 1979), and actresses Mary Willa &quot;Mamie&quot; Gummer (born 1983), Grace Jane Gummer (born 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (born 1991). In 1985, the family moved into a $1.8-million private estate in Connecticut and lived there until they bought a $3-million mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, in 1990. They later moved back to Connecticut. In 2023, it was reported that Streep and Gummer had been separated for more than six years. They were publicly last seen together at the 90th Academy Awards in 2018. 

Streep is the godmother of Billie Lourd, daughter of fellow actress and close friend Carrie Fisher. Fisher wrote the screenplay for Streep&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Postcards from the Edge,&quot; based on Fisher&#x27;s book.

=== Beliefs === 
When asked if religion plays a part in her life in 2009, Streep replied: &quot;I follow no doctrine. I don&#x27;t belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram.&quot; In an interview in December 2008, she alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: So, I&#x27;ve always been really, deeply interested because I think I can understand the solace that&#x27;s available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don&#x27;t believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So, it&#x27;s a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can&#x27;t go there.

When asked where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, Streep responded: Consolation? I&#x27;m not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?

==Acting credits and awards==
One of the most prolific actresses of screen and stage since her career&#x27;s inception in the late 1970s, Streep&#x27;s most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, include &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979), &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982), &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983), &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; (1988), &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995), &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2007), &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; (2008), &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009), &quot;The Homesman&quot; (2014), &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; (2016), &quot;Little Women&quot; (2019), and &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot; (2020). Her television projects include the miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978), the television film &quot;...First Do No Harm&quot; (1997), the miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003), and the drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; (2019). Her stage roles include the Broadway theatre productions &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot;, &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; (both 1976) and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1977), as well as multiple plays at the Delacorte Theater.

Streep has been recognised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the following performances:
These nominations make Streep the most Academy Award-nominated performer in history, with 21 in total (17 for Best Actress and four for Best Supporting Actress), as well as one of only 13 performers to win an Oscar in both acting categories and one of only three performers to win three Academy Awards across the two acting categories (with Ingrid Bergman and Jack Nicholson being the only others to achieve this feat).

She has also received six Grammy Award nominations, five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (with three wins), and one Tony Award nomination. Streep is one of few performers to be nominated for the Triple Crown of Acting and EGOT. Her other accolades include two BAFTA Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (for &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;), nine Golden Globe Awards (as well as the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award), a Silver Bear and Honorary Golden Bear in Berlin International Film Festival, Best Actress, Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or in Cannes Film Festival and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

<doc id="63392" wikidata="Q4391516" url="?curid=63392" title="Consensus reality">
<text>Consensus reality refers to the generally agreed-upon version of reality within a community or society, shaped by shared experiences and understandings. This understanding arises from the inherent differences in individual perspectives or subjectivities relating to knowledge or ontology, leading to uncertainties about what is real. While various viewpoints exist, people strive to establish a consensus, serving as a pragmatic guide for social norms. The term carries both positive and negative connotations, as it is viewed critically by anti-realist theorists but recognized for its practical benefits in fostering shared beliefs. Consensus reality differs from consensual reality, with the former representing mutual agreement about what is true. Artists and thinkers have challenged consensus reality, aiming to disrupt established norms and question the authenticity of the world&#x27;s reality.

Children have sometimes been described or viewed as &quot;inexperience[d] with consensus reality,&quot; though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.

==General discussion==
In considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the realist approach, in which there is a single, objective, overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the perceptions of any given individual, and the idealistic approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own &quot;experience&quot; of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.

Berger and Luckmann argue that &quot;reality is socially constructed and that the sociology of knowledge must analyze the process in which this occurs&quot;. Rather than being a purely philosophical topic, the question of reality includes, for them, the sociological study of consensus reality.

Consider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of science alone, for explaining life and the universe.

In societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality. In a predominantly secular society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone, the religious worldview would be the non-consensus (or alternative) reality.

In this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different world views, with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as science, slavery, and human sacrifice may differ in direct consequence of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.

Charles Tart in his book &quot;The Awakening&quot; proposed an alternative term - &quot;&quot;conditioned reality&quot; &quot; (&quot;conditioned&quot; or &quot;conditional reality&quot;), pointing out the inaccuracy of the term &quot;consensus reality&quot;, since no one asks an individual for consent whether he wants to live in a &quot;generally accepted reality&quot;, because he is accustomed to it through “ conditioning ” - the development of conditioned reflexes in the process of education and socialization.

==In science and philosophy==
===Idealists===
Some idealists (subjective idealists) hold the view that there isn&#x27;t one particular way things are, but rather that each person&#x27;s personal reality is unique. Such idealists have the world view which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.

===Materialists===
Materialists may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one reality. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered delusional.

==Social consequences==

===Views on the term===
The connotation of the term &quot;consensus reality&quot; is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by idealist, surrealist and other anti-realist theorists opposing or hostile to this &quot;reality,&quot; with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase &quot;consensus reality&quot; may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.

===Consensus vs. consensual reality===
Consensus reality is related to, but distinct from, consensual reality. The difference between these terms is that whereas consensus reality describes a state of mutual agreement about what is true (consensus is a noun), consensual reality describes a type of agreement about what is true (consensual is an adjective). In other words, reality may also be non-consensual, as when one person&#x27;s preferred version of reality conflicts with another person&#x27;s preferred version of reality. Consensual reality is relevant to understanding a variety of social phenomena, such as deception. 

===Social aspects===
Artists, writers, and theorists have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are &quot;ignoring&quot; it. For example, Salvador Dalí intended by his paranoiac-critical method to &quot;systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality&quot;.

<doc id="63393" wikidata="Q57628" url="?curid=63393" title="Maximilian II Emanuel">
<text>Maximilian II (11 July 1662 – 26 February 1726), also known as Max Emanuel or Maximilian Emanuel, was a Wittelsbach ruler of Bavaria and a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also the last governor of the Spanish Netherlands and Duke of Luxembourg. An able soldier, his ambition led to conflicts that limited his ultimate dynastic achievements.

He was born in Munich to Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria and Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy.

==War against the Ottoman Empire==
Maximilian inherited the elector&#x27;s mantle while still a minor in 1679 and remained under his uncle Maximilian Philipp&#x27;s regency until 1680. By 1683 he was already embarked on a military career, fighting in the defence of Vienna against the attempt of the Ottoman Empire to extend their possessions further into Europe. He returned to court for long enough to marry Maria Antonia, daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret Theresa of Spain, on 15 July 1685 in Vienna, Austria. This marriage was very unhappy since the couple disliked each other, but it was successful in producing the desired heir for both Bavaria and the Spanish monarchy. Maximilian Emanuel&#x27;s fame was assured when, in 1688, he led the capture of Belgrade from the Turks, with the full support of Serbian insurgents under the command of Jovan Monasterlija.

==Governor of the Spanish Netherlands==
In the War of the Grand Alliance he again fought on the Habsburgs&#x27; side, protecting the Rhine frontier, and, being the Emperor&#x27;s son-in-law and the husband of the King of Spain&#x27;s niece, was appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands in late 1691.

His Netherlands adventure catalyzed Maximilian Emanuel&#x27;s dynastic ambitions. One year after his appointment as governor, Maria Antonia died in Vienna, having given birth to a son, Joseph Ferdinand, who was appointed heir to the Spanish monarchy but died in 1699 before acceding the throne. An alternative avenue for Maximilian Emanuel&#x27;s ambition was offered by his marriage on 12 January 1694 to Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, the death of whose father, the elected King of Poland John III Sobieski, two years later, offered a potential avenue of influence in Polish affairs. Maximilian II was a candidate in the 1697 Polish–Lithuanian royal election, however, in view of the lack of strong support from other powers, the limited royal authority by the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and his greater interest in assuming the Spanish throne, he did not make a serious effort for the Polish crown.

However, he concentrated his interests in Western Europe, making his sons by Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, Charles Albert and Clemens August, the principal beneficiaries of his ambitions.

The unsuccessful siege and bombardment of Brussels in 1695 during the Nine Years&#x27; War by French troops and the resulting fire during Max Emanuel&#x27;s rule were together the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels.

==War of the Spanish Succession==

Maximilian Emanuel, who had married Archduchess Maria Antonia, the sole child of Emperor Leopold&#x27;s Spanish marriage, was one of the more serious claimants to the Spanish inheritance of Charles II of Spain, and the birth of his son Joseph Ferdinand in October 1692 immediately created a new claimant to the Spanish throne. In October 1698, William III of England and Louis XIV of France concluded the First Partition Treaty, which gave the Spanish crown with the Indies to Joseph Ferdinand, the Duchy of Milan to Emperor Leopold&#x27;s younger son Archduke Charles, and the rest of Spanish Italy to France. The unexpected death of Joseph Ferdinand four months later voided this plan and in the Second Partition Treaty, the Bavarian portion of the inheritance was allotted to Archduke Charles. By the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, Maximilian Emanuel, who had long-term imperial aspirations, had hoped that his governorship of the Spanish Netherlands might yet reap the reward of a share of the Spanish inheritance from either Leopold or, failing him, Louis XIV. Allying himself with the French against Austria, his campaign against Tyrol in 1703 did not have success and his plans were then frustrated by the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.
In 1704–05, following the evacuation of the Bavarian court to the Spanish Netherlands after the defeat at the Battle of Blenheim, Max Emanuel&#x27;s consort apparently was in charge of the government in the Stewardship of Munich of the Electorate of Bavaria as Regent Princess. However, when Theresa Kunegunda had found love letters of the Countess of Arco, a mistress of Max Emanuel, she left Munich to see her mother in Venice. The army would not allow her to return. In the ensuing evacuation of his court to the Netherlands, Maximilian Emanuel&#x27;s family became separated and his sons were held prisoners for several years in Austria, Clemens August being brought up by Jesuits. Bavaria was partitioned between Austria and Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The harsh Austrian administration which managed to extract massive amounts of money and manpower from Bavaria led to a serious peasant uprising within a year.
Maximilian Emanuel was again forced to flee the Netherlands after the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May 1706 and found refuge at the French court in Versailles where his late sister Maria Anna (1660–1690) had been the &quot;Dauphine of France&quot;. In 1712, Luxemburg and Namur were ceded to Maximilian Emanuel by his French allies, a cession that was not definitive since France was only the occupant of what was still the Spanish Netherlands. The war between France and Austria finally ended in 1714 in the Treaty of Rastatt in which Louis XIV compelled Austria to implement the full restoration of his faithful ally Maximilian Emanuel, including the return of the Upper Palatinate. Maximilian Emanuel was to remain in possession of Luxemburg, Namur and Charleroi until he was restored.

==Final years in Bavaria==

Back in Bavaria, Maximilian Emanuel focused on architecture projects to balance the failure of his political ambitions. It was bitter for him to witness the royal elevation of the German princes Augustus II the Strong (1697), Frederick I of Prussia (1701) and George I of Hanover (1714) as well as of his cousin Victor Amadeus of Sicily (1713) while his own political dreams could not be realized.

Maximilian Emanuel then supported the Habsburgs in a new war against the Turks, contributing troops to the Army of the Holy Roman Empire in (1717).

In 1724, he created a union of all lines of the Wittelsbach dynasty to increase the influence of his house. The Wittelsbach prince-electors Max Emanuel, his son Clemens August of Cologne, Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine and Franz Ludwig of Trier had at that time four votes at their disposal for the next imperial election. The crown of the Holy Roman Empire was sought for either Max Emanuel or his son Charles Albert. Already in 1722 Charles Albert had been married to the Habsburg Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria.

In 1726, Max Emanuel died of a stroke. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.

==Cultural legacy==
During his entire reign Maximilian II Emanuel patronized the arts. As governor of the Spanish Netherlands he acquired numerous Dutch and Flemish paintings for the Wittelsbach collection.

The first half of Max Emanuel&#x27;s reign was still dominated by his parents&#x27; Italian court artists, like Enrico Zuccalli and Giovanni Antonio Viscardi. Between 1684 and 1688, Zuccalli built the Italian style Lustheim Palace for Max Emanuel and his first wife Maria Antonia, located on a central island. With the appointment of Joseph Effner serving as chief architect of the court and the young François de Cuvilliés as his assistant, the French influence significantly increased and Max Emanuel&#x27;s return in 1715 marked the origin of the era of Bavarian Rococo.

The Nymphenburg Palace was enlarged, the Dachau Palace redesigned, and the new Schleissheim Palace was finally completed (1726) during Max Emanuel&#x27;s reign. These palaces were connected with a network of canals as Max Emanuel had become acquainted with in the Netherlands. Between 1715 and 1717, he had the Baroque style Fürstenried Palace built by Effner as a hunting lodge which was the extension and modification of an already existing noble mansion.

<doc id="63394" wikidata="Q11106" url="?curid=63394" title="Bacon">
<text>Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back. It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), used as a central ingredient (e.g., the BLT sandwich), or as a flavouring or accent. Regular bacon consumption is associated with increased mortality and other health concerns.

Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic &quot;*bakkon&quot;, meaning &quot;back meat&quot;. 
Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as, for example, &quot;turkey bacon&quot;. Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork. Vegetarian bacons such as &quot;soy bacon&quot; also exist.

== Curing and smoking ==
Before the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was necessary for its safe long-term preservation. However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary in the developed world, it continues in wide use.

Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting it with or soaking it in brine, known as wet curing, or rubbed with salt, known as dry curing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably nitrites or nitrates, which speed the curing and stabilise colour. Cured bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be smoked or boiled. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat. This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired. &quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot; (1824), thought to be one of the earliest American cookbooks, gives no indication that bacon is ever &quot;not&quot; smoked, though it gives no advice on flavouring, noting only that care should be taken lest the fire get too hot.

Bacon is distinguished from other salt-cured pork by differences in the cuts of meat used and in the brine or dry packing. Historically, the terms &quot;ham&quot; and &quot;bacon&quot; referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel. Today, ham is defined as coming from the hind portion of the pig and brine specifically for curing ham includes a greater amount of sugar, while bacon is less sweet, though ingredients such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for flavour. Bacon is similar to salt pork, which in modern times is often prepared from similar cuts, but salt pork is never smoked, and has a much higher salt content.

For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis, caused by &quot;Trichinella&quot;, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried.

== Cuts ==

Bacon type differs depending on the primal cut of pork from which it is prepared, which reflects local preference.

* Side bacon, sometimes known as &quot;streaky bacon&quot;, comes from the pork belly. It has long alternating layers of fat and muscle running parallel to the rind. This is the most common form of bacon in the United States.
**Pancetta is an Italian form of side bacon, sold smoked or unsmoked (&quot;aqua&quot;). It is generally rolled up into cylinders after curing. Pancetta is known for having a strong flavour, and is often used as an ingredient in pasta dishes such as Carbonara.
* Back bacon contains meat from the loin in the middle of the back of the pig with belly attached. It is a leaner cut, with less fat compared to side bacon. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom and Ireland is back bacon.
* Collar bacon is taken from the back of a pig near the head.
* Cottage bacon is made from the lean meat from a boneless pork shoulder that is typically tied into an oval shape.
* Jowl bacon is cured and smoked cheeks of pork. Guanciale is an Italian jowl bacon that is seasoned and dry cured but not smoked.

The inclusion of skin with a cut of bacon, known as the &#x27;bacon rind&#x27;, varies, though is less common in the English-speaking world.

== Around the world ==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The most common form sold is &quot;middle bacon&quot;, which includes some of the streaky, fatty section of side bacon along with a portion of the loin of back bacon. In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as &quot;short cut bacon&quot; and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon. Both varieties are usually available with the rind removed.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, the term &quot;bacon&quot; on its own typically refers to side bacon. Canadian-style back bacon is a lean cut from the eye of the pork loin with little surrounding fat. Peameal bacon is an unsmoked back bacon, wet-cured and coated in fine-ground cornmeal (historically, it was rolled in ground, dried peas); it is popular in southern Ontario. Bacon is often eaten in breakfasts, such as with cooked eggs or pancakes. Maple syrup is often used as a flavouring while curing bacon in Canada.

=== Germany ===
Some of the meanings of bacon overlap with the German-language term &quot;Speck&quot;. Germans use the term &quot;bacon&quot; explicitly for &quot;Frühstücksspeck&quot; (&#x27;breakfast &quot;Speck&quot;&#x27;) which are cured or smoked pork slices. Traditional German cold cuts favour ham over bacon; however, &quot;Wammerl&quot; (grilled pork belly) remains popular in Bavaria.

Small bacon cubes (called &quot;Grieben&quot; or &quot;Grammerln&quot; in Austria and southern Germany) have been a rather important ingredient of various southern German dishes. They are used for adding flavour to soups and salads and for Speck dumplings and various noodle and potato dishes. Instead of preparing them at home from larger slices, they have been sold ready made as convenience foods recently as &quot;Baconwürfel&quot; (&quot;bacon cubes&quot;) in German retail stores.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, bacon (ベーコン) is pronounced &quot;bēkon&quot;. It is cured and smoked belly meat as in the US, and is sold in either regular or half-length sizes. Bacon in Japan is different from that in the US in that the meat is not sold raw, but is processed, precooked and has a ham-like consistency when cooked. Uncured, sliced pork belly, known as bara (バラ), is very popular in Japan and is used in a variety of dishes (e.g. yakitori and yakiniku).

=== Great Britain and Ireland ===
Back bacon is the most common form in Great Britain and Ireland, and is the usual meaning of the plain term &quot;bacon&quot;. A thin slice of bacon is known as a &quot;rasher&quot;; about 70% of bacon is sold as rashers. Heavily trimmed back cuts which consist of just the eye of meat, known as a &quot;medallion&quot;, are also available. All types may be unsmoked or smoked. The side cut normal in America is known as &quot;streaky bacon&quot;, and there is also a long cut, curving round on itself, known as &quot;middle bacon&quot;, which is back bacon at one end, and streaky at the other, as well as less common cuts. Bacon is also sold and served as joints, usually boiled, broiled or roast, or in thicker slices called chops or steaks. These are usually eaten as part of other meals.

Bacon may be cured in several ways, and may be smoked or unsmoked; unsmoked bacon is known as &quot;green bacon&quot;. Fried or grilled bacon rashers are included in the &quot;traditional&quot; full breakfast. Hot bacon sandwiches are a popular cafe dish throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure.

Bacon is often served with eggs and sausages as part of a full English breakfast.

=== United States ===
The term &quot;bacon&quot; on its own generally refers to side bacon, which is the most popular type of bacon sold in the US. Back bacon is known as &quot;Canadian bacon&quot; or &quot;Canadian-style bacon&quot;, and is usually sold pre-cooked and thick-sliced. American bacons include varieties smoked with hickory, mesquite or applewood and flavourings such as maple, brown sugar, honey, or molasses. A side of unsliced bacon is known as &quot;slab bacon&quot;.

USDA regulations only recognise bacon as &quot;cured&quot; if it has been treated with synthetic nitrites or nitrates (e.g. sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate). This means that bacon cured with nitrites derived from celery or beets (which has the same chemical outcome) must be labelled &quot;uncured&quot; and include a notice such as &quot;no nitrates or nitrites added except for that naturally occurring in celery&quot;. There is also bacon for sale uncured with any nitrites from any sources.

==History==
Salted pork belly first appeared in China. In Middle English the term bacon or bacoun referred to all pork in general. Before the Industrial Revolution, bacon was generally produced on local farms and in domestic kitchens. In the 1770s, John Harris opened the world&#x27;s first commercial bacon processing plant in Calne, Wiltshire.

== Bacon mania ==

The United States and Canada have seen an increase in the popularity of bacon and bacon-related recipes, dubbed &quot;bacon mania&quot;. The sale of bacon in the US has increased significantly since 2011. Sales climbed 9.5% in 2013, making it an all-time high of nearly $4 billion in US. In a survey conducted by Smithfield, 65% of Americans would support bacon as their &quot;national food&quot;. Dishes such as bacon explosion, chicken fried bacon, and chocolate-covered bacon have been popularised over the Internet, as has the use of candied bacon. Recipes spread quickly through both countries&#x27; national media, culinary blogs, and YouTube. Celebrity chef Bobby Flay has endorsed a &quot;Bacon of the Month&quot; club online, in print, and on national television. &quot;Everything Tastes Better with Bacon&quot;, a 2002 book by Sara Perry, is a cookbook in which all dishes contain bacon. 

Commentators explain this surging interest in bacon by reference to what they deem American cultural characteristics. Sarah Hepola, in a 2008 article in &quot;Salon.com&quot;, suggests a number of reasons, one of them being that eating bacon in the modern, health-conscious world is an act of rebellion: &quot;Loving bacon is like shoving a middle finger in the face of all that is healthy and holy while an unfiltered cigarette smoulders between your lips.&quot; She also suggests bacon is sexy (with a reference to Sarah Katherine Lewis&#x27; book &quot;Sex and Bacon&quot;), kitsch, and funny. Hepola concludes by saying that &quot;Bacon is American&quot;.

Alison Cook, writing in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, argues the case of bacon&#x27;s American citizenship by referring to historical and geographical uses of bacon. Early American literature echoes the sentiment—in Ebenezer Cooke&#x27;s 1708 poem &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot;, a satire of life in early colonial America, the narrator already complains that practically all the food in America was bacon-infused.

As of December 2016, the U.S. national frozen pork belly inventory totaled , the lowest level in 50 years.

== Bacon dishes ==

Bacon dishes include bacon and eggs, bacon, lettuce, and tomato (BLT) sandwiches, Cobb salad, and various bacon-wrapped foods, such as scallops, shrimp, and asparagus. Recently invented bacon dishes include chicken fried bacon, chocolate covered bacon, bacon jerky, bacon ice cream and the bacon explosion. Tatws Pum Munud is a traditional Welsh stew, made with sliced potatoes, vegetables and smoked bacon. Bacon jam and bacon marmalade are also commercially available.

Streaky bacon is more commonly used as a topping in the US on such items as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the US, sliced smoked back bacon is used less frequently than the streaky variety, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.

Bacon is also used as an accent in dishes, such as bacon-topped meatloaf, sautéed crisp and crumbled into green beans, or as a crumble in a salad.

Bacon bits are crumbled bacon in condiment form, typically commercially prepared and preserved for long shelf life.

== Bacon fat ==
Bacon fat liquefies and becomes drippings when it is heated. Once cool, it firms into a form of lard. Bacon fat is flavourful and is used for various cooking purposes. Traditionally, bacon grease is saved in British and southern US cuisine, and used as a base for cooking and as an all-purpose flavouring, for everything from gravy to cornbread to salad dressing.

In Germany, &quot;Griebenschmalz&quot; is a popular spread made from bacon lard.

Bacon is often used for a cooking technique called &quot;barding&quot; consisting of laying or wrapping strips of bacon or other fats over a roast to provide additional fat to a lean piece of meat. It is often used for roast game birds, and is a traditional method of preparing beef filet mignon, which is wrapped in strips of bacon before cooking. The bacon itself may afterwards be discarded or served to eat, like cracklings. It may also be cut into lardons.

One teaspoon () of bacon grease has 38 calories (40 kJ/g). It is composed almost completely of fat, with very little additional nutritional value. Bacon fat is roughly 40% saturated. Despite the likely health risks of excessive bacon grease consumption, it remains popular in the cuisine of the American South.

== Nutrients ==
One 10-g slice of cooked side bacon contains 4.5 g of fat, 3.0 g of protein, and 205 mg of sodium. The fat, protein, and sodium content varies depending on the cut and cooking method.

68% of the food energy of bacon comes from fat, almost half of which is saturated. A serving of three slices of bacon contains 30 milligrams of cholesterol (0.1%).

== Health concerns ==
Studies have consistently found the consumption of processed meat to be linked to increased mortality, and to an increased risk of developing a number of serious health conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. As bacon is very high in salt, it comes with all the negative health effects associated with high salt intake.

Bacon can contain nitrites, which can form carcinogenic nitroso-compounds such as S-Nitrosothiols, nitrosyl-heme and nitrosamines. In the United States, sodium nitrite cannot exceed certain levels in bacon. Vitamin C (ascorbate) or sodium erythorbate can be added to bacon, which greatly reduces the formation of nitrosamines but has no effect on S-Nitrosothiols and nitrosyl-heme. Vitamin E (tocopherol) also reduces nitrosamine levels. Bacon fried at higher temperatures potentially has more nitrosamines than bacon fried at lower temperatures.

According to the World Health Organization in 2015, regular consumption of processed meats such as bacon increases the likelihood of developing colorectal cancers by 18%.

== Alternatives ==
Several alternatives to and substitutes for bacon have been developed for those who cannot or prefer not to eat standard pork bacon, including beef, chicken, turkey, bison, soy, and coconut bacon.

=== Turkey bacon ===

Turkey bacon is consumed by some as an alternative to pork bacon for health benefits, religious laws, or other concerns. It is lower in fat and food energy than bacon, but is used similarly.

The meat for turkey bacon comes from the whole turkey, which is chopped and reformed into strips to resemble bacon, and can be cured or uncured, or smoked. Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be less than 10% fat. The low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and has a tendency to stick to the pan.

=== Macon ===
&quot;Macon&quot; is produced by curing cuts of mutton in a manner similar to the production of pork bacon. Historically produced in Scotland, it was introduced across Britain during World War II as a consequence of rationing. It is today available as an alternative to bacon, produced for the Muslim market and sold at halal butchers; it is largely similar in appearance to pork bacon except for the darker colour.

=== Vegetarian bacon ===
Vegetarian bacon, also referred to as &quot;facon&quot;, &quot;veggie bacon&quot;, or &quot;vacon&quot;, is a vegetarian &quot;bacon&quot; made from plant matter. It has no cholesterol, is low in fat, and contains large amounts of protein and fibre. Two slices contain about . Vegetarian bacon is usually made from marinated strips of textured soy protein or tempeh (fermented soybeans).

== Bacon-flavoured products ==
The popularity of bacon in the United States has given rise to a number of commercial products that promise to add bacon flavouring without the labour involved in cooking it.

=== Bacon bits ===

Bacon bits are a frequently used topping on salad or potatoes, and a common element of salad bars. They are usually salted. Bacon bits are made from small, crumbled pieces of bacon; in commercial plants they are cooked in continuous microwave ovens. Similar products are made from ham or turkey, and vegetarian substitutes are made from textured vegetable protein, artificially flavoured to resemble bacon.

=== Other bacon-flavoured products ===
There is also a wide range of other bacon-flavoured products, including a bacon-flavoured salt (Bacon Salt), Baconnaise (a bacon-flavoured mayonnaise), Bacon Grill (a tinned meat, similar to Spam) and bacon ice cream.

<text>Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a mechanical or electronic system during normal system operation. MTBF can be calculated as the arithmetic mean (average) time between failures of a system. The term is used for repairable systems while mean time to failure (MTTF) denotes the expected time to failure for a non-repairable system.

The definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a failure. For complex, repairable systems, failures are considered to be those out of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state for repair. Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an unrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not considered failures under this definition. In addition, units that are taken down for routine scheduled maintenance or inventory control are not considered within the definition of failure. The higher the MTBF, the longer a system is likely to work before failing.

==Overview==
Mean time between failures (MTBF) describes the expected time between two failures for a repairable system. For example, three identical systems starting to function properly at time 0 are working until all of them fail. The first system fails after 100 hours, the second after 120 hours and the third after 130 hours. The MTBF of the systems is the average of the three failure times, which is 116.667 hours. If the systems were non-repairable, then their MTTF would be 116.667 hours.

In general, MTBF is the &quot;up-time&quot; between two failure states of a repairable system during operation as outlined here:

For each observation, the &quot;down time&quot; is the instantaneous time it went down, which is after (i.e. greater than) the moment it went up, the &quot;up time&quot;. The difference (&quot;down time&quot; minus &quot;up time&quot;) is the amount of time it was operating between these two events.

By referring to the figure above, the MTBF of a component is the sum of the lengths of the operational periods divided by the number of observed failures:
:formula_1

In a similar manner, mean down time (MDT) can be defined as
:formula_2

== Mathematical description ==
The MTBF is the expected value of the random variable formula_3 indicating the time until failure. Thus, it can be written as
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the probability density function of formula_3. Equivalently, the MTBF can be expressed in terms of the reliability function formula_7 as
: formula_8.
The MTBF and formula_3 have units of time (e.g., hours).

Any practically-relevant calculation of the MTBF assumes that the system is working within its &quot;useful life period&quot;, which is characterized by a relatively constant failure rate (the middle part of the &quot;bathtub curve&quot;) when only random failures are occurring. In other words, it is assumed that the system has survived initial setup stresses and has not yet approached its expected end of life, both of which often increase the failure rate.

Assuming a constant failure rate formula_10 implies that formula_3 has an exponential distribution with parameter formula_10. Since the MTBF is the expected value of formula_3, it is given by the reciprocal of the failure rate of the system,
: formula_14.

Once the MTBF of a system is known, and assuming a constant failure rate, the probability that any one particular system will be operational for a given duration can be inferred from the reliability function of the exponential distribution, formula_15. In particular, the probability that a particular system will survive to its MTBF is formula_16, or about 37% (i.e., it will fail earlier with probability 63%).

== Application ==
The MTBF value can be used as a system reliability parameter or to compare different systems or designs. This value should only be understood conditionally as the “mean lifetime” (an average value), and not as a quantitative identity between working and failed units.

Since MTBF can be expressed as “average life (expectancy)”, many engineers assume that 50% of items will have failed by time &quot;t&quot; = MTBF. This inaccuracy can lead to bad design decisions. Furthermore, probabilistic failure prediction based on MTBF implies the total absence of systematic failures (i.e., a constant failure rate with only intrinsic, random failures), which is not easy to verify. Assuming no systematic errors, the probability the system survives during a duration, T, is calculated as exp^(-T/MTBF). Hence the probability a system fails during a duration T, is given by 1 - exp^(-T/MTBF).

MTBF value prediction is an important element in the development of products. Reliability engineers and design engineers often use reliability software to calculate a product&#x27;s MTBF according to various methods and standards (MIL-HDBK-217F, Telcordia SR332, Siemens SN 29500, FIDES, UTE 80-810 (RDF2000), etc.). The Mil-HDBK-217 reliability calculator manual in combination with RelCalc software (or other comparable tool) enables MTBF reliability rates to be predicted based on design.

A concept which is closely related to MTBF, and is important in the computations involving MTBF, is the mean down time (MDT). MDT can be defined as mean time which the system is down after the failure. Usually, MDT is considered different from MTTR (Mean Time To Repair); in particular, MDT usually includes organizational and logistical factors (such as business days or waiting for components to arrive) while MTTR is usually understood as more narrow and more technical.

== Application of MTBF in manufacturing ==
MTBF serves as a crucial metric for managing machinery and equipment reliability. Its application is particularly significant in the context of total productive maintenance (TPM), a comprehensive maintenance strategy aimed at maximizing equipment effectiveness. MTBF provides a quantitative measure of the time elapsed between failures of a system during normal operation, offering insights into the reliability and performance of manufacturing equipment.

By integrating MTBF with TPM principles, manufacturers can achieve a more proactive maintenance approach. This synergy allows for the identification of patterns and potential failures before they occur, enabling preventive maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime. As a result, MTBF becomes a key performance indicator (KPI) within TPM, guiding decisions on maintenance schedules, spare parts inventory, and ultimately, optimizing the lifespan and efficiency of machinery. This strategic use of MTBF within TPM frameworks enhances overall production efficiency, reduces costs associated with breakdowns, and contributes to the continuous improvement of manufacturing processes.

==MTBF and MDT for networks of components==

Two components formula_17 (for instance hard drives, servers, etc.) may be arranged in a network, in &quot;series&quot; or in &quot;parallel&quot;. The terminology is here used by close analogy to electrical circuits, but has a slightly different meaning. We say that the two components are in series if the failure of &quot;either&quot; causes the failure of the network, and that they are in parallel if only the failure of &quot;both&quot; causes the network to fail. The MTBF of the resulting two-component network with repairable components can be computed according to the following formulae, assuming that the MTBF of both individual components is known:

:formula_18
where formula_19 is the network in which the components are arranged in series.

For the network containing parallel repairable components, to find out the MTBF of the whole system, in addition to component MTBFs, it is also necessary to know their respective MDTs. Then, assuming that MDTs are negligible compared to MTBFs (which usually stands in practice), the MTBF for the parallel system consisting from two parallel repairable components can be written as follows:

formula_20

where formula_21 is the network in which the components are arranged in parallel, and formula_22 is the probability of failure of component formula_23 during &quot;vulnerability window&quot; formula_24.

Intuitively, both these formulae can be explained from the point of view of failure probabilities. First of all, let&#x27;s note that the probability of a system failing within a certain timeframe is the inverse of its MTBF. Then, when considering series of components, failure of any component leads to the failure of the whole system, so (assuming that failure probabilities are small, which is usually the case) probability of the failure of the whole system within a given interval can be approximated as a sum of failure probabilities of the components. With parallel components the situation is a bit more complicated: the whole system will fail if and only if after one of the components fails, the other component fails while the first component is being repaired; this is where MDT comes into play: the faster the first component is repaired, the less is the &quot;vulnerability window&quot; for the other component to fail.

Using similar logic, MDT for a system out of two serial components can be calculated as:
:formula_25
and for a system out of two parallel components MDT can be calculated as:
:formula_26

Through successive application of these four formulae, the MTBF and MDT of any network of repairable components can be computed, provided that the MTBF and MDT is known for each component. In a special but all-important case of several serial components, MTBF calculation can be easily generalised into 
:formula_27
which can be shown by induction, and likewise
:formula_28
since the formula for the mdt of two components in parallel is identical to that of the mtbf for two components in series.

== Variations of MTBF ==
There are many variations of MTBF, such as &quot;mean time between system aborts&quot; (MTBSA), &quot;mean time between critical failures&quot; (MTBCF) or &quot;mean time between unscheduled removal&quot; (MTBUR). Such nomenclature is used when it is desirable to differentiate among types of failures, such as critical and non-critical failures. For example, in an automobile, the failure of the FM radio does not prevent the primary operation of the vehicle.

It is recommended to use &quot;Mean time to failure&quot; (MTTF) instead of MTBF in cases where a system is replaced after a failure (&quot;non-repairable system&quot;), since MTBF denotes time between failures in a system which can be repaired.

MTTFd is an extension of MTTF, and is only concerned about failures which would result in a dangerous condition. It can be calculated as follows:
:formula_29

where &quot;B&quot;10 is the number of operations that a device will operate prior to 10% of a sample of those devices would fail and &quot;n&quot;op is number of operations. &quot;B&quot;10d is the same calculation, but where 10% of the sample would fail to danger. &quot;n&quot;op is the number of operations/cycle in one year.

=== MTBF considering censoring === 

In fact the MTBF counting only failures with at least some systems still operating that have not yet failed underestimates the MTBF by failing to include in the computations the partial lifetimes of the systems that have not yet failed. With such lifetimes, all we know is that the time to failure exceeds the time they&#x27;ve been running. This is called censoring. In fact with a parametric model of the lifetime, the likelihood for the experience on any given day is as follows:

:formula_30, 

where 
:formula_31 is the failure time for failures and the censoring time for units that have not yet failed, 
:formula_32 = 1 for failures and 0 for censoring times, 
:formula_33 = the probability that the lifetime exceeds formula_31, called the survival function, and 
:formula_35 is called the hazard function, the instantaneous force of mortality (where formula_36 = the probability density function of the distribution). 

For a constant exponential distribution, the hazard, formula_10, is constant. In this case, the MBTF is 

:MTBF = formula_38, 

where formula_39 is the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_10, maximizing the likelihood given above and formula_41 is the number of uncensored observations. 

We see that the difference between the MTBF considering only failures and the MTBF including censored observations is that the censoring times add to the numerator but not the denominator in computing the MTBF.

<text>Ashburton is a town on the south-southeastern edge of Dartmoor in Devon, England, adjacent to the A38. The town is 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Plymouth and 17 miles (27 km) southwest of Exeter.

It was formerly important as a stannary town (a centre for the administration of tin mining), and remains the largest town within the national park. Ashburton has two pubs within the centre of town and six restaurants/cafés. The town is also part of the electoral ward named &quot;Ashburton and Buckfastleigh&quot;, the population of which at the 2011 census was 7,718.

== History ==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;æsc-burna-tun&quot; meaning &#x27;farm/settlement with a stream frequented by ash trees&#x27;.

The name is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Essebretone&quot;. Ashburton was then the main town of the Parish of Ashburton, in Teignbridge Hundred. During the English Civil War, Ashburton was a temporary refuge for Royalist troops fleeing after their defeat by General Fairfax at nearby Bovey Tracey.

The town was the terminus of the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway that opened on 1 May 1872. Ashburton railway station closed to passengers in November 1958 although goods traffic on the line continued until 7 September 1962. Links to Buckfastleigh and Totnes are maintained by Country Bus route 88 which also serves Newton Abbot.

Ashburton used to be famous for a beverage known as Ashburton Pop, possibly a type of champagne, the recipe of which was lost with the brewer in 1765.

Ashburton Carnival is one of the oldest, possibly the oldest, surviving in Devon. Written records date it back to 1891, but it is believed to have been started in the mid-1880s to raise funds for a new hospital.

Ashburton Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1910. The club continued into the 1920s.

Ashmoor Hockey Club was formed in 2003 and plays at South Dartmoor Community College.

Ashburton Cookery School &amp; Chefs Academy, located to the north of the town, was founded in 1992.

== Politics ==
Ashburton was the first place to elect a candidate of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party to public office. The candidate was Alan Hope, a local publican, who was elected unopposed to Ashburton Town Council in 1989. He subsequently became deputy mayor and later mayor of Ashburton.

The town is one of a few to still annually appoint a portreeve or &#x27;port warden&#x27;. Others are Laugharne, Beccles, Callington (where the name is given to the council chairman), and Yeovil.

==Education==
South Dartmoor Community College, a large secondary school for pupils aged 11-18, is located in Ashburton.

== Sites of interest ==

The parish church of St Andrew is a Grade One Building and a fine building of the 15th century with a tall tower and two aisles. The 15th-century church tower includes sculptures by Herbert Edmund Read (1885–1951), who also carved the oak reredos; this is not the art historian Herbert Read. One window has stained glass designed by C. E. Kempe. The porch is partly Norman.

St Lawrence Chapel is a Grade II* Listed Building in St Lawrence Lane in the centre of the town. Originally a chantry chapel and then a grammar school for over 600 years, St Lawrence Chapel is now an important heritage, cultural and community centre, managed by the Guild of St Lawrence.

The town&#x27;s old Methodist Church (Grade II listed) at 15 West St was built in 1835. In 2015 the Methodist congregation moved to the nearby St Andrew&#x27;s Church Hall. Their previous building was sold by public auction on 19 July 2017, when it was bought by Ashburton Arts Ltd (a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee) using funds donated or loaned by members of the community. The building now houses Ashburton Arts Centre.

St Gudula&#x27;s Well and Cross in Old Totnes Road is probably named after St Gulval, also honoured at the village of Gulval in Cornwall.

Ashburton Town Hall was originally built as a market hall in 1850.

==Early life and education==

Stephen John Fry was born on 24 August 1957 in the Hampstead area of London, the son of Marianne Eve Fry (née Neumann) and physicist and inventor Alan John Fry (1930–2019). He has an older brother, Roger, and a younger sister, Joanna. His paternal grandmother, Ella Fry (née Pring), had roots in Cheshire and Kent. The Fry family originates around the Shillingstone and Blandford areas of Dorset; in the early 1800s, Samuel Fry settled in Surrey, with his descendants residing in Middlesex. In his autobiographical writings and elsewhere, Fry has claimed relationship to the Fry family that founded the eponymous chocolate company, John Fry (one of the signatories to the death warrant for Charles I), and the cricketer C. B. Fry. Fry&#x27;s mother is Jewish, but he was not brought up in a religious family. His maternal grandparents, Martin and Rosa Neumann, were Hungarian Jews who emigrated from Šurany (now in Slovakia) to the UK in 1927. Rosa&#x27;s parents, who originally lived in Vienna, were deported to a Nazi ghetto in Riga, where they perished. His mother&#x27;s aunt and cousins were sent to Auschwitz and Stutthof and never seen again.

Fry grew up in the village of Booton, Norfolk, having moved at an early age from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where he had attended Chesham Preparatory School. He briefly attended Cawston Primary School in Cawston, Norfolk, before going on to Stouts Hill Preparatory School in Uley, Gloucestershire, at the age of seven, and then to Uppingham School in Rutland, where he joined Fircroft house and was described as a &quot;near-asthmatic genius&quot;. He took his O-levels in 1972 at the early age of 14 and passed all except physics, but was expelled from Uppingham half a term into the sixth form. Fry described himself as a &quot;monstrous&quot; child and wrote that he was expelled for &quot;various misdemeanours&quot;. He was later dismissed from Paston School, a grant-maintained grammar school that refused to let him progress to study A-Levels.

Fry moved to Norfolk College of Arts and Technology, where, after two years in the sixth form studying English, French, and History of Art, he ultimately failed his A-Levels, not turning up for his English and French papers. Over the summer, Fry absconded with a credit card stolen from a family friend. He had taken a coat when leaving a pub, planning to spend the night sleeping rough, but had then discovered the card in a pocket. He was arrested in Swindon and, as a result, spent three months in Pucklechurch Remand Centre on remand. Following his release, he resumed his education at City College Norwich, promising administrators that he would study rigorously and sit the Cambridge entrance exams. In 1977 he passed two A-levels in English and French, with grades of A and B. He also received a grade A in an alternative O-level in the Study of Art and scored a distinction in an S-level paper in English. Having successfully passed the entrance exams in 1977, Fry was offered a scholarship to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, for matriculation in 1978, briefly teaching at Cundall Manor School, a preparatory school in North Yorkshire, before taking his place. At Cambridge, he joined the Footlights, appeared on the &quot;University Challenge&quot; TV quiz, and read English Literature, graduating with an upper second-class honours BA degree in 1981 (subsequently promoted automatically to a Cambridge MA degree). Fry also met his future comedy collaborator Hugh Laurie (through their mutual friend Emma Thompson) at Cambridge and starred alongside him in the Footlights.

==Career==
=== 1981–1993: Sketch comedy beginnings ===
Fry wrote the play &quot;Latin! or Tobacco and Boys&quot; for the 1980 Edinburgh Festival, where it won the Fringe First prize. It had a revival in 2009 at London&#x27;s Cock Tavern Theatre, directed by Adam Spreadbury-Maher. &quot;The Cellar Tapes&quot;, the Footlights Revue of 1981, won the Perrier Comedy Award. In 1984, Fry adapted the hugely successful 1930s musical &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; for the West End, where it ran for eight years and received two Laurence Olivier Awards. The show transferred to Broadway and Fry was nominated for a Tony Award for his adaptation.

Fry has appeared in numerous advertisements, predominantly on UK television – either on-screen or in voice-over – starting with an appearance as &quot;Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar&quot; in a 1982 advert for Whitbread Best Bitter. Fry has said, in his memoirs, that after receiving his payment for this work – £25,000 – he has never subsequently experienced &quot;what one could call serious money troubles&quot;. He has since appeared in adverts for products and companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Twinings, Kenco, Vauxhall Motors, Honda, Calpol, Heineken, Alliance &amp; Leicester (a series of adverts which also featured Hugh Laurie), After Eight mints, Direct Line insurance (with Paul Merton), Trebor mints, Virgin Media, Walkers potato crisps (fronting a new flavour), and Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket. He filmed a 2016 advertisement where he explains the essence of British culture to foreigners arriving at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport.

Fry&#x27;s career in television began with the 1982 broadcasting of &quot;The Cellar Tapes&quot;, the 1981 Cambridge Footlights Revue which was written by Fry, Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, and Tony Slattery. The revue caught the attention of Granada Television, who, keen to replicate the success of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, hired Fry, Laurie and Thompson to star alongside Ben Elton in &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing to Worry About!&quot; A second series, retitled &quot;Alfresco&quot;, was broadcast in 1983, and a third in 1984; it established Fry and Laurie&#x27;s reputation as a comedy double act. In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became &quot;The Crystal Cube&quot;, a mixture of science fiction and mockumentary that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry, Laurie and Thompson appeared in &quot;Bambi&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; from 1984 where they parodied themselves as the &quot;University Challenge&quot; representatives of &quot;Footlights College, Oxbridge&quot;, and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Happy Families&quot; series. In April 1986, Fry was among the British comedians who appeared in the first live telethon Comic Relief. In 1986 and 1987, Fry and Laurie performed sketches on the LWT/Channel 4 show &quot;Saturday Live&quot;.

In 1986, the BBC commissioned a sketch show that was to become &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;. Following a 1987 pilot, the programme ran for 26 episodes across four series between 1989 and 1995. During this time, Fry starred in &quot;Blackadder II&quot; as Lord Melchett, made a guest appearance in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; as the Duke of Wellington, then returned to a starring role in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, as General Melchett. In a 1988 television special, &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, he played the roles of Lord Melchett and Lord Frondo. Between 1990 and 1993, Fry starred as Jeeves (alongside Hugh Laurie&#x27;s Bertie Wooster) in &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, 23-hour-long adaptations of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s novels and short stories. Fry has appeared in a number of BBC adaptations of plays and books, including a 1992 adaptation of the Simon Gray play &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot; (he had previously appeared in the West End stage production).

Having made his film début in &quot;The Good Father&quot; (1985), followed by a brief cameo in &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988; getting clobbered by Kevin Kline in an airport), Fry was then featured by Kenneth Branagh as the eponymous Peter in &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1992). Fry came to the attention of radio listeners with the 1986 creation of his alter-ego, Donald Trefusis, whose &quot;wireless essays&quot; were broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Loose Ends&quot;. In the 1980s, he starred as David Lander in four series of the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Delve Special&quot;, written by Tony Sarchet, which then became the six-part Channel 4 series &quot;This is David Lander&quot; in 1988. In 1988, Fry wrote and presented a six-part comedy series entitled &quot;Saturday Night Fry&quot;. Frequent radio appearances have ensued, notably on panel games &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

Fry was cast in Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot; for its first staging in the West End on 7 April 1988, with Rik Mayall, John Sessions, Sarah Berger, Paul Mooney and John Gordon Sinclair, directed by Simon Gray. Fry is a long-standing fan of the anarchic British musical comedy group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and particularly of its eccentric front man, the late Vivian Stanshall. Fry helped to fund a 1988 London re-staging of Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera&quot;, written by Vivian and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall for the Bristol-based Old Profanity Showboat.

Fry&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Liar,&quot; was published in 1991. Fry has since written three further novels, several non-fiction works and three volumes of autobiography. &quot;Making History&quot; (1996) is partly set in an alternative universe in which Adolf Hitler&#x27;s father is made infertile and his replacement proves a more effective Führer. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. &quot;The Hippopotamus&quot; (1994) is about Edward (Ted/Tedward) Wallace and his stay at his old friend Lord Logan&#x27;s country manor in Norfolk. &quot;The Hippopotamus&quot; was later adapted into a 2017 film. &quot;The Stars&#x27; Tennis Balls&quot; (2000) is a modern retelling of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

==Personal life==
Fry married comedian Elliott Spencer, 30 years his junior, in January 2015 in Dereham, Norfolk. Fry lives in West Bilney in Norfolk. He became friends with King Charles III while Charles was Prince of Wales, through his work with The Prince&#x27;s Trust. He attended the then-Prince&#x27;s wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. He is also a friend of Rowan Atkinson and was best man at Atkinson&#x27;s wedding to Sunetra Sastry at the Russian Tea Room in New York City. He was a friend of John Mills. His best friend is Hugh Laurie, whom he met while both were at Cambridge and with whom he has collaborated many times over the years. He was best man at Laurie&#x27;s wedding and is godfather to all three of his children.

Fry started using cocaine in his twenties, and continued until 2001. He wrote about his drug use in the memoir &quot;More Fool Me&quot; (2014).

A fan of cricket, Fry has stated that he is related to former England cricketer C. B. Fry, and was interviewed for the &quot;Ashes Fever&quot; DVD, reporting on England&#x27;s victory over Australia in the 2005 Ashes series. Regarding football, he is a supporter of Norwich City FC, and is a regular visitor to their home ground at Carrow Road. He has been described as &quot;deeply dippy for all things digital&quot; and claims to have bought the third Macintosh computer sold in the UK (his friend Douglas Adams bought the first two). He jokes that he has never encountered a smartphone that he has not purchased. He counts Wikipedia among his favourite websites.

Fry has a long-standing interest in Internet production, including having his own website since 1997. His site &quot;The New Adventures of Mr Stephen Fry&quot; has existed since 2002 and has attracted many visitors following his first blog in September 2007, which consisted of a 6,500-word &quot;blessay&quot; on smartphones. In February 2008, he launched his private podcast series, &quot;Stephen Fry&#x27;s Podgrams&quot; (defunct), and a forum, including discussions on depression and activities in which he is involved. The website content is created by Fry and produced by Andrew Sampson. Fry&#x27;s weekly gadget column &quot;Dork Talk&quot; appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; from November 2007 to October 2008. Fry is also a supporter of GNU and the Free Software Foundation. For the 25th anniversary of the GNU operating system, Fry appeared in a video explaining some of the philosophy behind GNU by likening it to the sharing found in science. 

When in London, he drives a dark green TX4 London cab. This vehicle has been featured in Fry&#x27;s production &quot;Stephen Fry in America&quot;. On 16 April 2018, Fry released the first episode of a new podcast &quot;Stephen Fry&#x27;s 7 Deadly Sins&quot; available on his website and other podcasting platforms The first episode of the second series was released on 13 January 2020 and continued to be released over the course of nine weeks. In 2019, he was featured in the filmed poem rendition &quot;Love Goes Never Alone,&quot; for the online theatre publication &quot;First Night Magazine&quot; in support of the LGBTQ+ community.

In 2023, during an &#x27;Alternative Christmas message&#x27;, broadcast on Channel 4, Fry remarked that he was proud of his Jewish heritage. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been on lists of British Jews that some ultra-right wing newspapers and sites have published over the years. And I&#x27;m frankly damned if I&#x27;ll let antisemites be the ones who define me, and take ownership of the word &#x27;Jew&#x27;, injecting it with their own spiteful venom. So I accept and claim the identity with pride, I am Stephen Fry, and I am a Jew.&quot;

Enabled by a 2020 change in citizenship legislation in Austria, Fry acquired Austrian citizenship as a descendant of persons persecuted by Nazism, thus regaining the citizenship his ancestors forcibly lost.

===Sexuality===

Fry struggled to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years until the mid-1990s. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: &quot;I suppose it all began when I came out of the womb. I looked back up at my mother and thought to myself, &#x27;That&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;m going up one of those&#x27;. In his 1997 autobiography titled Moab Is My Washpot, however, Fry attributed the joke to &#x27;a friend at university&#x27; adding, &#x27;I have since shamelessly used this as my own explanation of When I Knew.&#x27;

Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen that ended in 2010. Fry was listed number 2 in 2016 and number 12 in 2017 on the Pride Power list.
On 6 January 2015, British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that Fry would marry his partner, comedian Elliott Spencer. Fry wrote on Twitter: &quot;It looks as though a certain cat is out of a certain bag. I&#x27;m very very happy of course but had hoped for a private wedding. Fat chance!&quot; Eleven days after the news story, Fry married Spencer on 17 January at Dereham in Norfolk.

===Politics===
Fry was an active supporter of the Labour Party for many years and appeared in a party political broadcast on its behalf with Hugh Laurie and Michelle Collins in November 1993. He did not vote in the 2005 general election because of the stance of both the Labour and Conservative parties with regard to the Iraq War. Despite his praise of the Blair/Brown government&#x27;s work on social reform, Fry was an outspoken critic of the Labour Party&#x27;s Third Way concept. Fry appeared in campaign literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing members of parliament to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum of 2011.

On 30 April 2008, Fry signed an open letter, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper by a number of Jewish personalities, stating their opposition to celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel. Furthermore, he is a signatory member of the British Jews for Justice for Palestinians (JJP) organisation, which campaigns for Palestinian rights. Fry was among over 100 signatories to a statement published by Sense about Science on 4 June 2009, condemning British libel laws and their use to &quot;severely curtail the right to free speech on a matter of public interest&quot;.

In August 2013, Fry published an open letter to David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, and the International Olympic Committee calling for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, due to concerns over the state-sanctioned persecution of LGBT people in Russia under the 2013 anti-&quot;gay propaganda&quot; laws. Cameron stated on Twitter he believed &quot;we can better challenge prejudice as we attend, rather than boycotting the Winter Olympics&quot;. Fry said in 2015 that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; editor Paul Dacre &quot;has done more to damage the Britain I love than any single person&quot;.

In March 2014, Fry publicly backed &quot;Hacked Off&quot; and its campaign towards press self-regulation by &quot;safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable&quot;.

In 2016 he caused controversy by accusing survivors of child sexual abuse of self-pity for expecting trigger warnings. Soon after he apologised for his comments.

On 18 May 2018, Fry participated in the semi-annual Munk Debates in Toronto, Canada, where he argued against political correctness on the &quot;Con&quot; side of the topic &quot;Be it resolved, what you call political correctness, I call progress...&quot; alongside Jordan Peterson, and in opposition to &quot;Pro&quot; side represented by Michelle Goldberg and Michael Eric Dyson. During the debate, Fry paraphrased a famous sentence from the 1923 essay &quot;I Am Afraid&quot;, in which Old Bolshevik-turned-Soviet dissident Yevgeny Zamyatin denounced censorship in the Soviet Union. The original sentence reads, &quot;True literature can exist only when it is created, not by diligent and reliable officials, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and skeptics.&quot; Fry&#x27;s rendering, however, reads, &quot;Progress is not achieved by preachers and guardians of morality, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels, and sceptics.&quot;

On 1 February 2021, Fry supported the petition of two Holocaust survivors, Dorit Oliver-Wolff and Ruth Barnett who were asking to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson regarding the &#x27;genocide amendment&#x27; to the trade bill; this amendment would allow an independent parliamentary judicial committee to examine evidence of genocide. In a tweet, Fry highlighted the plight of the Uyghurs.

 Poland controversy 

On 6 October 2009, Fry was interviewed by Jon Snow on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; as a signatory of a letter to British Conservative Party leader David Cameron expressing concern about the party forming a political alliance with the right-wing Polish Law and Justice party in the European Parliament. During the interview, he stated:

The remark prompted a complaint from the Polish Embassy in London, an editorial in &quot;The Economist&quot; and criticism from British Jewish historian David Cesarani. Fry later posted an apology in a six-page post on his personal blog, in which he apologised for his remarks, stating that &quot;I didn&#x27;t even really at the time notice the import of what I had said, so gave myself no opportunity instantly to retract the statement. It was a rubbishy, cheap and offensive remark that I have been regretting ever since. I take this opportunity to apologise now.&quot; and &quot;It detracted from and devalued my argument, such as it was, and it outraged and offended a large group of people for no very good reason.&quot;

===Health===
Fry has cyclothymia, a form of bipolar disorder (considered to be a milder type). Fry has spoken publicly about his experience with the condition, which was depicted in the documentary &quot;Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive&quot;. In the programme, he interviewed other people with bipolar disorder including Carrie Fisher, Richard Dreyfuss and Tony Slattery. He also interviewed Robbie Williams, who suffers with unipolar depression, and they discussed the differences and similarities of their mental health experiences and diagnoses. He is involved with the mental health charity Stand to Reason and is president of Mind. In 2013, he said that, in the previous year, he had started taking medication for the first time, in an attempt to control his condition. In 2018, alongside Nadiya Hussain and Olly Alexander, Fry was part of Sport Relief&#x27;s attempt to raise awareness of mental health.

In 1995, while appearing in the West End play &quot;Cell Mates&quot;, Fry had a nervous breakdown and walked out of the production, causing its early closure and incurring the displeasure of co-star Rik Mayall and playwright Simon Gray. Fry went missing for several days and contemplated suicide. He later said that he would have killed himself if he had not had &quot;the option of disappearing&quot;. He abandoned the idea and left the United Kingdom by ferry, eventually resurfacing in Belgium. Fry has attempted suicide on a number of occasions, most recently in 2012. In an interview with Richard Herring in 2013, Fry said that he had attempted suicide the previous year while filming abroad. He said that he took a &quot;huge number of pills and a huge [amount] of vodka&quot; and had to be brought back to the UK to be &quot;looked after&quot;.

In January 2008, Fry broke his arm while filming &quot;Last Chance to See&quot; in Brazil. While climbing aboard a boat, he slipped between it and the dock, and, stopping himself from falling into the water, his body weight snapped his right humerus. The resulting vulnerability to his radial nerve – which affects use of the arm – was not diagnosed until he saw a consultant in the UK.

Appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2009, Fry had lost a significant amount of weight, and explained that he had shed a total of 6 stone (84 lb; 38 kg). He attributed the weight loss to walking while listening to audiobooks. Fry is between and in height. Fry has prosopagnosia (&quot;face blindness&quot;).

In February 2018, Fry announced that he was recovering from an operation to treat prostate cancer, involving the removal of the prostate and 11 adjacent lymph nodes. He described the cancer as aggressive and said that early intervention had saved his life. In December 2020, Fry said he was having some radiotherapy, as is sometimes required after removal of the prostate to mop up remaining prostate cancer cells.

In March 2021, Fry hailed the &quot;wonderful moment&quot; of receiving the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID vaccine at Westminster Abbey. The University of Cambridge alumnus joked that he would have to &quot;put petty rivalries behind [him]&quot;.

On 14 September 2023, Fry was taken to hospital after he fell about onto a concrete floor, when exiting the stage following a conference on artificial intelligence at The O2 Arena in Greenwich; he had sustained injuries to his ribs and legs. After a recovery period he was reported to be back at work on 9 December.

===Views on religion===
Fry has repeatedly expressed opposition to organised religion, and has identified himself as an atheist and humanist, while declaring some sympathy for the ancient Greek belief in gods. In his first autobiography, he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but came to the conclusion that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe in God, because [he] was fundamentally Hellenic in [his] outlook&quot;. He has stated that religion can have positive effects: &quot;Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist such as myself cannot but find inspiring.&quot; Fry claims to have been expelled from Salt Lake City, Utah, because of a joke made about doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a letter from Fry addressing his younger self, explaining how his future is soon to unfold, reflecting on the positive progression towards gay acceptance and openness around him, and yet not everywhere, while warning on how &quot;the cruel, hypocritical and loveless hand of religion and absolutism has fallen on the world once more&quot;. Later that year, he and Christopher Hitchens participated in an &quot;Intelligence Squared&quot; debate in which they argued against Ann Widdecombe and Archbishop John Onaiyekan, who supported the view that the Catholic Church was a force for good. Fry and Hitchens argued that the church did more harm than good, and were declared the victors after an audience vote. Fry attacked the Catholic Church&#x27;s teachings on sexuality and denounced its wealth.

In 2010, Fry was made a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association, stating: &quot;it is essential to nail one&#x27;s colours to the mast as a humanist.&quot; Later that year, Fry joined 54 other public figures in signing an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom being a state visit. On 22 February 2011, Fry was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University.

When interviewed in 2015 by the Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne, Fry was asked what he would say if he came face-to-face with God, to which he replied: &quot;Bone cancer in children: what&#x27;s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that&#x27;s not our fault? It&#x27;s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?&quot; Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion: &quot;I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks.&quot; &quot;Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.&quot; In May 2017, it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the Defamation Act 2009, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after Gardaí confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people. The following year, in 2018, the article on blasphemy was removed from the Irish Constitution following a referendum.

He has praised Anglican priest Michael Coren&#x27;s book &quot;The Rebel Christ&quot;, saying: &quot;Integrity, wit and passion. A fine advocate for the best of Christian thought and a faith that encompasses the human as well as the divine.&quot;

=== Narration ===
Fry is known for his extensive voice-over work; he read all seven of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels for the UK audiobook recordings, narrated Paddington Bear audiobooks, narrated the video game series &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; and &quot;Birds of Steel&quot;, narrated an animated series of explanations of the laws of cricket and narrated a series of animations about humanism for Humanists UK.

===Twitter===

Fry wielded a considerable amount of influence through his use of Twitter. He was frequently asked to promote various charities and causes, often inadvertently causing their websites to crash because of the volume of traffic generated by his large number of followers; as Fry noted on his website: &quot;Four thousand hits a second all diving down the pipeline at the same time for minutes on end.&quot; He used his influence to recommend underexposed musicians and authors (who often saw large increases in web hits and sales) and to raise awareness of contemporary issues in the world of media and politics, notably the dropping of an injunction against &quot;The Guardian&quot; and public anger over &quot;Daily Mail&quot; columnist Jan Moir&#x27;s article on the death of Boyzone member Stephen Gately.

In November 2009, Fry&#x27;s Twitter account reached one million followers. He commemorated the million-followers milestone with a humorous video blog in which a &#x27;Step Hen Fry&#x27; clone speaks from the year 2034, where MySpace, Facebook and Twitter have combined to form &#x27;Twit on MyFace&#x27;. In November 2010, he welcomed his two-millionth follower with a blog entry detailing his opinions and experiences of Twitter. On 11 March 2012, Fry noted his passing of the four-million-followers mark with a tweet: &quot;Lordy I&#x27;ve breasted the 4 million followers tape. Love you all. Yes even YOU. But let&#x27;s dedicate today to Douglas Adams&#x27;s diamond jubilee&quot;. he had 12.4 million followers.

Fry had a history of temporarily distancing himself from the social networking site which began when he received criticism in October 2009. However, he retracted the announcement that he would be leaving the following day. In October 2010, Fry left Twitter for a few days, with a farewell message of &quot;Bye bye&quot;, following press criticism of a quote taken from an interview he had given. After returning, he explained that he had left Twitter to &quot;avoid being sympathised with or told about an article&quot; he &quot;would otherwise never have got wind of&quot;. The methods Fry uses on Twitter have been criticised. On 15 February 2016, Fry deleted his Twitter account after receiving criticism for a tweet commenting on Jenny Beavan&#x27;s outfit choice at that year&#x27;s BAFTAs where she received an award for costume design. Fry alluded to this on an April 2016 episode of &quot;The Rubin Report&quot; in which he criticised groupthink mentality and stated that his return to Twitter was a &quot;maybe&quot;. He returned to Twitter in August 2016. He left Twitter again in November 2022, joining Mastodon that same month.

=== Sport ===
In August 2010, Fry joined the board of directors at Norwich City Football Club. A lifelong fan of &quot;the Canaries&quot; and a regular visitor to Carrow Road, he said, on being appointed, &quot;Truly this is one of the most exciting days of my life, and I am as proud and pleased as I could be.&quot; Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as &quot;Norwich City Ambassador&quot;. Fry said, &quot;My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I&#x27;m going to. It was all me. It can&#x27;t have been a coincidence ... But now I&#x27;m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City.&quot; In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of Proud Canaries, a supporters&#x27; group for Norwich City&#x27;s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.

Fry succeeded Clare Connor to become president of Marylebone Cricket Club on 1 October 2022, relinquishing the role after one year to his successor Mark Nicholas in 2023.

=== Business ===
In 2008, Fry formed SamFry Ltd, with long-term collaborator Andrew Sampson to produce and fund new material and to manage his official website. Fry is the co-owner, with Gina Carter and Sandi Toksvig, of Sprout Pictures, an independent film and television company.

In 2016, Fry launched Pindex, &quot;a self-funded online platform that creates and curates educational videos and infographics for teachers and students,&quot; founded and run by a four-person team.

===Charity===

In 2008, Fry appeared in a film made by the Free Software Foundation to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the GNU Project to create a completely free operating system. In the film, Fry explains the principles of software freedom central to the development of the Linux and GNU software projects. For the Comic Relief telethon in 2011, Fry was one of four celebrities who represented a new flavour of Walkers crisps: &quot;Stephen Fry Up&quot;, with the flavour inspired by the full English breakfast (also known as a &#x27;fry up&#x27;). In 2014, Fry designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

Fry is a supporter of nature and wildlife conservation. He has been the president of the Great Fen Project since 2006 and vice-president of international NGO Fauna and Flora International since 2009. Fry has also expressed support for action on climate change and activist group Extinction Rebellion, and has criticized climate change denial.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fry appeared in a sketch alongside Prince William for a charity show titled &quot;The Big Night In&quot; on BBC One. In the lighthearted sketch, Fry reprises his &quot;Blackadder&quot; character Lord Melchett, who is on a Zoom call with the then Duke of Cambridge as they talk about television shows such as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Tiger King&quot; as well as homeschooling. The sketch had been put together by Comic Relief and Children in Need to raise money and keep people entertained during the lockdown. In March 2021, Fry narrated a short film for Cambridge Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Fry has been the patron of UK audiobook charity Listening Books since 2005.

<text>John Napier Wyndham Turner (June 7, 1929September 19, 2020) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 17th prime minister of Canada from June to September 1984. He served as leader of the Liberal Party and leader of the Opposition from 1984 to 1990.

Turner practised law before being elected as a member of Parliament in the 1962 federal election. He served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as minister of justice and attorney general from 1968 to 1972, and minister of finance from 1972 to 1975. As a cabinet minister, Turner came to be known as a leader of the Business Liberal faction of the Liberal Party. Amid a global recession and the prospect of having to implement unpopular wage and price controls, Turner resigned from his position in 1975.

From 1976 to 1984, Turner took a hiatus from politics, working as a corporate lawyer on Bay Street. Trudeau&#x27;s resignation in 1984 triggered a leadership election, which Turner successfully contested. Turner held the office of prime minister for just 79 days, as he advised the governor general to dissolve Parliament soon after being sworn in. He went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide to Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, leading the Liberals to the second-worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level (in terms of proportion of seats). Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and led the Opposition for the next six years. In the 1988 election, he vigorously campaigned against Mulroney&#x27;s proposed free trade agreement with the United States, and led the Liberals to a modest recovery. Turner resigned as party leader in 1990 and did not seek re-election as a MP in 1993.

Turner was Canada&#x27;s first prime minister born in the United Kingdom since Mackenzie Bowell in 1896, Canada&#x27;s second shortest-serving prime minister behind Charles Tupper, and Canada&#x27;s fourth longest-lived prime minister, living to the age of 91.

==Early life==
Turner was born on June 7, 1929, in Richmond, Surrey, England (now a part of London), to Leonard Hugh Turner, an English journalist with the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, and Phyllis Gregory, a Canadian economist. He had a brother, Michael, born in 1930 (who died shortly after birth), and a sister, Brenda, born in 1931. When Turner&#x27;s father died in 1932, he and his sister moved to Canada with their Canadian-born mother. The family settled in her childhood home in Rossland, British Columbia, and later moved to Ottawa.

Turner&#x27;s mother was loving but demanding of her two children. The family was not wealthy. His mother remarried in 1945 to Frank Mackenzie Ross, who later served as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and the family relocated to Vancouver.

===Education===
Turner was educated at Ashbury College and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Ottawa (senior matriculation). He enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1945 at age 16 where he was a member of the UBC chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and was among Canada&#x27;s outstanding track sprinters in the late 1940s. He held the Canadian record for the men&#x27;s 100-yard dash and qualified for the 1948 London Olympics, but a bad knee kept him from competing. He graduated from UBC with a BA (Honours) in 1949.

Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, Turner went on to Magdalen College at the University of Oxford, where he earned a BA in jurisprudence in 1951, and a BCL in 1952; his BA was promoted to an MA per tradition in 1957. He was on the track and field team at Oxford. One of his teammates was Roger Bannister, who became the first runner to break the four-minute barrier in the mile. At Oxford, Turner was a classmate and friend of future Australian Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke, as well as Jeremy Thorpe, future leader of Britain&#x27;s Liberal Party. He also pursued doctoral studies at the University of Paris from 1952 to 1953.

===Relationship with Princess Margaret===
On July 25, 1958, a ball was hosted by Turner&#x27;s mother and stepfather (in the latter&#x27;s role of Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia), in honour of Princess Margaret at HMCS Discovery, the Canadian navy&#x27;s land station in Vancouver. Turner danced with Princess Margaret, one year his junior, and they sat out talking, refusing requests to return to supper. This was the first time that Turner received significant press attention in Canada. Further meetings between them during Margaret&#x27;s three week official visit to Canada led to considerable speculation about whether the two would become a serious couple. Contemporary press reports suggested there was some consternation about the reports among British officials, but their Canadian counterparts were more relaxed.

A year later, in September 1959, press attention returned when reports circulated that Turner had been a recent guest at Balmoral in August where discussions had taken place concerning marriage between the pair; that he had also paid a secret visit to see her in April and that his parents had commented on their close friendship during their visit to Scotland in August.

According to letters discovered in 2015, written by Margaret to her friend Sharman Douglas and obtained by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the relationship was more serious than previously thought with the princess writing in one letter, seven years later: &quot;John Turner is here &amp; we meet on Thursday. It will seem so funny as we haven&#x27;t met since I nearly married him &amp; he&#x27;s bringing his wife!&quot;. Turner told the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;: &quot;I have never talked about it, and I am not going to start talking about it now&quot;. Brenda confirmed a &quot;very definite attraction&quot; between her brother and the princess, but said that Turner was uninterested in royalty and would not have given up Catholicism.

It has been claimed Turner attended Margaret&#x27;s party at Balmoral Castle in August 1959 where his roommate was Margaret&#x27;s future husband Antony Armstrong-Jones; however, according to his authorized biography, Armstrong-Jones visited Balmoral for the first time in early October 1959. Turner was the only Canadian unofficial guest at their wedding in May 1960. Turner remained friends with Margaret, he and his wife often meeting the princess in Britain or during official visits to Canada. They attended Margaret&#x27;s 2002 private funeral and were Canada&#x27;s official representatives at the memorial service.

===Marriage and family===
Turner was married on May 11, 1963, to Geills McCrae Kilgour (b. 1937) who was then a systems engineer with IBM, and the great niece of Canadian Army doctor John McCrae, the author of what is probably the best-known First World War poem, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, and sister of David Kilgour, a long-time Canadian Member of Parliament. The Turners have a daughter named Elizabeth and two sons: Michael and Andrew. Their second son, David, died in 2021. The Turner children attended Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. All three sons attended Upper Canada College, in Toronto.

==Early career==

Turner practised law, initially with the firm of Stikeman Elliott in Montreal, Quebec. He was elected as Member of Parliament for St. Lawrence—St. George in 1962 and was reelected there in every election until the riding&#x27;s dissolution in 1968. He was the Member of Parliament for Ottawa—Carleton from 1968 to 1976.

In 1965, while vacationing in Barbados, Turner noticed that former prime minister and Leader of the Opposition John Diefenbaker, staying at the same hotel, was struggling in the strong surf and undertow. Turner, a competitive swimmer while in university, jumped in and pulled Diefenbaker to shore.

==Cabinet minister==
Turner was generally respected for his work as a cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s, under prime ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.

===Premiership of Lester Pearson===

Turner served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Lester Pearson in various capacities, most notably as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. When Pearson retired, Turner ran to succeed him at the 1968 leadership convention. Turner, at age 38 the youngest of the dozen leadership candidates, stated &quot;My time is now&quot;, and remarked during his speech that he was &quot;not here for some vague, future convention in, say, 1984&quot;. Turner stayed on until the fourth and final ballot, finishing third behind Pierre Trudeau and runner-up Robert Winters.

===Premiership of Pierre Trudeau===
Turner served in Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet as minister of justice for four years. Biographer Paul Litt argues that Turner was a hard-working, well-informed minister whose success was assured by his warm relationship with his peers. His achievements, say Litt, included strengthening the rights of individual defendants on trial, greater efficiency in the justice system, creation of the influential Law Reform Commission, selecting highly professional judges, and bringing a policy perspective to the Justice Department. He led the government&#x27;s position in the highly controversial Official Languages Act, and he took control during the October Crisis in 1970.

A member of the Business Liberal faction of the Liberal Party, Turner then served as Minister of Finance from 1972 until 1975. His challenges were severe in the face of global financial issues such as the 1973 oil crisis, the collapse of the postwar Bretton Woods trading system, slowing economic growth combined with soaring inflation (stagflation), and growing deficits. His positions were more conservative than Trudeau&#x27;s and they drew apart. In 1975 Turner surprisingly resigned from cabinet. The Liberals had won the 1974 election by attacking Robert Stanfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives over their platform involving wage and price controls. However, Trudeau decided to implement the wage and price controls in late 1975, so some have suggested that Turner quit rather than carry out that proposal. In a 2013 interview with Catherine Clark on CPAC Turner confirmed his resignation from cabinet was a direct result of refusing to implement wage and price controls, after campaigning against them in 1974.

In his memoirs, Trudeau wrote that Turner said he resigned as Finance Minister in 1975 because he was tired of politics, after 13 years in Ottawa, and wanted to move on to a better-paying job as a lawyer in Toronto, to better support his family and to be with them more, as his children were growing up. Trudeau also suggested that Turner&#x27;s years as finance minister were very difficult because of turbulent and unusual conditions in the world economy, characterized as stagflation, largely caused by enormous increases in the price of oil.

==Bay Street==
From 1975 to 1984, Turner worked as a corporate lawyer at the Bay Street law firm McMillan Binch. When Pierre Trudeau resigned as Liberal leader in 1979 following an election loss, Turner announced that he would not be a candidate for the Liberal leadership. Trudeau was talked into rescinding his resignation after the government of Joe Clark was defeated by a motion of no confidence, and returned to contest and win the 1980 federal election. Trudeau then served as Prime Minister until 1984.

==Prime minister (June–September 1984)==
Trudeau retired after polls showed the Liberals faced certain defeat in the next election if he remained in office. Turner then re-entered politics, and defeated Jean Chrétien, his successor as finance minister, on the second ballot of the June 1984 Liberal leadership convention. He was formally appointed prime minister on June 30. When he was sworn in, Turner was not an MP or senator. He also announced that he would not run in a by-election to get into the Commons, but would instead run in the next general election as the Liberal candidate in the British Columbia riding of Vancouver Quadra, a seat held by the Tories. However, this was part of Turner&#x27;s strategy to rebuild the Liberals&#x27; image in western Canada; at the time, the party held no seats west of Winnipeg.

In his final days of office, Trudeau recommended that Governor General Jeanne Sauvé appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage positions, including senators, judges, and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards. Turner then made a further 19 appointments himself, one of Trudeau&#x27;s conditions for retiring earlier than he had planned.

===1984 federal election===

On July 9, only nine days after being sworn in, Turner asked Sauvé to dissolve parliament and advised her to call an election for early September. Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney and other experts had expected Turner to tour Canada during the summer and early autumn, accompanying Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II on their upcoming visits, and then call the election for later in the autumn. As the campaign unfolded, the Tories and Mulroney, who was fighting his first general election in any capacity, soon took the lead.

Early in the campaign, Turner appeared rusty and old-fashioned. His policies contrasted with Trudeau&#x27;s and seemed to legitimize the Tory calls for lowering the deficit, improving relations with the United States, cutting the bureaucracy, and promoting more federal-provincial harmony. He spoke of creating &quot;make work projects&quot;, a discarded phrase from the 1970s that had been replaced by the less patronizing &quot;job creation programs&quot;. Turner was also caught on television patting the bottoms of Liberal Party President Iona Campagnolo and Vice-President Lise St. Martin-Tremblay, causing an uproar among feminists, who saw such behaviour as sexist and condescending.

During the televised leaders&#x27; debate, Turner attacked Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had allegedly set up in anticipation of victory, comparing it to the Union Nationale governments of Quebec. Mulroney responded by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made on the advice of Trudeau and Turner. Turner had the right to advise Sauvé to cancel Trudeau&#x27;s appointments—advice that she was bound to follow by convention—but failed to do so and added to his own. Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for what he called &quot;these horrible appointments.&quot; Turner claimed that &quot;I had no option&quot; except to let them stand. Mulroney responded, &quot;You had an option, sirto say &#x27;no&#x27;and you chose to say &#x27;yes&#x27; to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.&quot; He highlighted the Liberals&#x27; long record in government and resulting patronage appointments.

Turner discovered late in the campaign that the Liberals&#x27; electoral hopes were poor in their traditional stronghold of Quebec. The party had heretofore relied on Trudeau&#x27;s appeal, patronage, and traditional dislike of the Progressive Conservatives for victory in recent previous elections. Turner had surrounded himself with Trudeau&#x27;s factional opponents and Trudeau himself did not endorse Turner. In a last-minute turnaround, Turner rehired much of Trudeau&#x27;s staff during the final weeks, but this had little effect. Quebec&#x27;s disaffection with the federal Liberals regarding patriation in 1982 further contributed to their defeat. Mulroney, a native Quebecker, was able to harness that discontent to the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; advantage by promising a new constitutional agreement.

On September 4, the Liberals were swept from power in a Tory landslide. The Liberals were cut down to 40 seats, the fewest in the party&#x27;s history until 2011, against 211 for the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals fell to 17 seats in Quebec, all but four in and around Montreal. Eleven members of Turner&#x27;s cabinet were defeated. It was the worst defeat the Liberals experienced in a federal election since 1958.

Turner stepped down as prime minister on September 17. The election having been called just over a week after his being sworn in, Turner held the office of prime minister for two months and seventeen days, the second-shortest stint in Canadian history, ahead of only Sir Charles Tupper, who took office after dissolution of parliament. Turner, along with Tupper and later Mulroney&#x27;s successor Kim Campbell, were the only PMs who never faced a parliament or implemented any legislative initiative.

==Leader of the Opposition (1984-1990)==

In 1984, Turner managed to defeat the Tory incumbent in Vancouver Quadra, Bill Clarke by 3,200 votes, a surprising result given the size of the Tory wave, and became leader of the opposition. He was the only Liberal MP from British Columbia, and one of only two from west of Ontario. The Liberals, amid their worst showing in party history and led by an unpopular Turner, were said by some pundits to be following the British Liberals into oblivion. Though the Liberals had not fared much better in the 1958 election, they had clearly emerged as the main opposition party back then. After the 1984 election, however, the NDP were not far behind with 30 seats. Their leader Ed Broadbent consistently outpolled Turner and even Mulroney, except in Quebec.

The Liberals responded by using their large Senate majority, built up over years of Liberal majorities in the Commons, to stall Mulroney&#x27;s legislation. In addition, a group of young Liberal MPs, known as the &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, pestered Mulroney at every turn. The group included Sheila Copps, Brian Tobin, Don Boudria, and John Nunziata.

Turner&#x27;s leadership was frequently questioned, and in the lead up to the 1986 Liberal convention, a vote of confidence loomed large. The popular Jean Chrétien resigned his seat, creating a stir in caucus. Keith Davey publicly voiced his concerns with Turner&#x27;s leadership, which coincided with backroom struggles involving Chrétien&#x27;s supporters. The public conflict is said to have influenced many Liberals to support Turner, and he ended up getting a little over 75% of the delegate vote.
The Liberals faced more internal conflict in the next few years, but polls frequently had them in front of the Progressive Conservatives (however, with Turner last in preferred prime minister categories). The upcoming Canada–US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Meech Lake Accord threatened to divide the party until Turner took the position of being pro-Meech Lake and against the FTA. Turner asked the Liberal Senators to hold off on passing the legislation to implement the agreement until an election was held. It was later revealed that Mulroney planned to have an election called, anyway.

===1988 federal election===

When the election was called for November 21, 1988, the Liberals had some early struggles, notably during one day in Montreal where 3 different costs were given for the proposed Liberal daycare program. The campaign was also hampered by a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report that stated there was a movement in the backroom to replace Turner with Chrétien.

Turner campaigned rallying support against the proposed FTA, an agreement that he said would lead to the abandonment of Canada&#x27;s political sovereignty to the United States. His performance in the debate and his attacks on Mulroney and the FTA, where he accused the Progressive Conservative Prime Minister of selling Canada out with one signature of a pen, raised his poll numbers, and soon the Liberals were hoping for a majority. This prompted the Progressive Conservatives to stop the relatively calm campaign they had been running, and go with Allan Gregg&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;bombing the bridge&quot; that joined anti-FTA voters and the Liberals; Turner&#x27;s backbone. The ads focused on Turner&#x27;s leadership struggles, and combined with over $6 million in pro-FTA ads, stopped Turner&#x27;s momentum. Also not helping the Liberals was that the NDP had opposed the FTA as well (though not as vocally); this likely resulted in vote-splitting between the opposition parties. Although most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal.

The Liberals more than doubled their representation to 83 seats, and kept their role as the Official Opposition; the NDP had also made gains but finished a distant third with 43 seats. The Progressive Conservatives won a reduced majority government with 169 seats.

The election loss seemed to confirm Turner&#x27;s fate; he announced he was standing down from the party leadership in May 1989, officially resigning in June 1990. Turner resigned as Official Opposition leader, while still holding the Liberal leadership, so Herb Gray became the caucus leader in the interim. Chrétien won that year&#x27;s leadership convention over Paul Martin. Although not officially endorsed by Turner himself, Martin was widely the favourite of Turner&#x27;s supporters.

Turner continued to represent Vancouver Quadra in the House of Commons before retiring from politics in the 1993 election.

==After politics==

In 1990, Turner returned to practising law, this time working for Miller Thomson LLP, while he continued serving as an MP for another three years. He eventually became head of the firm’s scholarships program. Turner was also a board member for several corporations.

Turner was a member of the Canadian delegation that monitored the runoff vote in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election.

Turner voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organization which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

In 2017, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Turner lived in the Deer Park neighbourhood of Toronto.

== Death and state funeral ==
Turner died on September 19, 2020, at age 91, from congestive heart failure. A state funeral was held for Turner on October 6, 2020, at St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral Basilica in Toronto. The ceremony was scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic with masking and social distancing protocols in place and attendance to be limited to 160 guests with no lying in state being possible. Turner was buried in a private service at Mount Pleasant Cemetery. Turner and Mackenzie King are two former Prime Ministers interred at Mount Pleasant.

==Honours==


According to Canadian protocol, as a former prime minister, he was styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

Turner was ranked 18th out of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through Jean Chrétien) by a survey of Canadian historians in 1999. The survey was used in the book &quot;Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada&#x27;s Leaders&quot; by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer.

Turner was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on October 19, 1994, and was invested on May 3, 1995. His citation reads: He became Canada&#x27;s seventeenth Prime Minister, crowning a distinguished parliamentary career during which he held several key Cabinet portfolios. Parallel to his political life, he has been a respected member of the law profession and supporter of many charitable organizations, in particular Mount Sinai Hospital and the Community Foundation of Toronto. His passion for his country is admired by all Canadians.

<doc id="63403" wikidata="Q128563" url="?curid=63403" title="Brian Mulroney">
<text>Martin Brian Mulroney (March 20, 1939 – February 29, 2024) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman, and politician who served as the 18th prime minister of Canada from 1984 to 1993.

Born in the eastern Quebec city of Baie-Comeau, Mulroney studied political science and law. He then moved to Montreal and gained prominence as a labour lawyer. After placing third in the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election, he was appointed president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada in 1977. He held that post until 1983, when he became leader of the Progressive Conservatives. He led the party to a landslide victory in the 1984 federal election, winning the second-largest percentage of seats in Canadian history (at 74.8 percent) and receiving over 50 percent of the popular vote. He later won a second majority government in 1988.

Mulroney&#x27;s tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms, such as the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, the goods and services tax (GST) that was created to replace the manufacturers&#x27; sales tax, and the privatization of 23 of 61 Crown corporations including Air Canada and Petro-Canada. However, he was unsuccessful in reducing Canada&#x27;s chronic budget deficit. Mulroney sought Quebec&#x27;s endorsement of the 1982 constitutional amendments by first introducing the Meech Lake Accord and then the Charlottetown Accord. Both proposed recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, extending provincial powers, and extensively changing the constitution. Both of the accords failed to be ratified, and the Meech Lake Accord&#x27;s demise revived Quebec separatism, leading to the rise of the Bloc Québécois. In foreign policy, Mulroney strengthened Canada&#x27;s ties with the United States and opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa, leading an effort within the Commonwealth to sanction the country. Mulroney&#x27;s tenure was marked by the Air India Flight 182 bombing, the largest mass killing in Canadian history, though his response to the attack came under criticism. Mulroney made environmental protection a priority by securing a treaty with the United States on acid rain, making Canada the first industrialized country to ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity, adding significant national parks, and passing the &quot;Environmental Assessment Act&quot; and the &quot;Environmental Protection Act&quot;.

The unpopularity of the GST and the controversy surrounding its passage in the Senate, combined with the early 1990s recession, the collapse of the Charlottetown Accord, and growing Western alienation that triggered the rise of the Reform Party, caused a stark decline in Mulroney&#x27;s popularity, which induced him to resign and hand over power to his cabinet minister Kim Campbell in June 1993. In the election later that year, the Progressive Conservatives were reduced from a majority government of 156 seats to two, with its support being eroded by the Bloc and Reform parties. In his retirement, Mulroney served as an international business consultant and sat on the board of directors of multiple corporations. Although he places above average in rankings of Canadian prime ministers, his legacy remains controversial. He was criticized for his role in the resurgence of Quebec nationalism and accused of corruption in the Airbus affair, a scandal that came to light only several years after he left office.

== Early life (1939–1955) ==
Mulroney was born on March 20, 1939, in Baie-Comeau, Quebec, a remote and isolated town of the Côte-Nord region, in the eastern part of the province. He was the son of Irish Canadian Catholic parents, Mary Irene (née O&#x27;Shea) and Benedict Martin Mulroney, who was a paper mill electrician. As there was no English-language Catholic high school in Baie-Comeau, Mulroney completed his high school education at a Roman Catholic boarding school in Chatham, New Brunswick, operated by St. Thomas University. In 2001, St. Thomas University named its newest academic building in his honour. Benedict Mulroney worked overtime and ran a repair business to earn extra money for his children&#x27;s education, and he encouraged his oldest son to attend university.

Mulroney would frequently tell stories about newspaper publisher Robert R. McCormick, whose company had founded Baie-Comeau. Mulroney would sing Irish songs for McCormick, and the publisher would slip him $50. Mulroney grew up speaking English and French fluently.

== Family ==
On May 26, 1973, Mulroney married Mila Pivnički, the daughter of a Serbian-Canadian doctor, , from Novi Bečej. Many PC campaign buttons featured both Mulroney&#x27;s face and hers, and Ontario Premier Bill Davis commented to Brian, &quot;Mila will get you more votes for you than you will for yourself.&quot;

The Mulroneys have four children: Caroline, Benedict (Ben), Mark and Nicolas. Caroline unsuccessfully ran for the 2018 Ontario PC leadership race and represents the party in the provincial legislature as the member for York—Simcoe. She served as Ontario&#x27;s minister of transportation and minister of Francophone affairs. She moved from transportation to being President of the Treasury Board while continuing on as the minister of Francophone affairs. Ben was the host of the CTV morning show &quot;Your Morning&quot; from June 2016 to October 2021. Ben is married to stylist Jessica, and their three children served as page boys and bridesmaids during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19, 2018. Mark and Nicolas both work in the financial industry in Toronto.

== Education (1955–1964) ==
Mulroney entered St. Francis Xavier University in the fall of 1955 as a 16-year-old first-year student. His political life began when he was recruited to the campus Progressive Conservative group by Lowell Murray and others early in his first year. Murray, who was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1979, became Mulroney&#x27;s close friend, mentor, and adviser. Mulroney made other important, lasting friendships with Gerald Doucet, Fred Doucet, Sam Wakim, and Patrick MacAdam. Mulroney enthusiastically embraced political organization and assisted the local PC candidate in his successful 1956 Nova Scotia provincial election campaign; the PCs, led provincially by Robert Stanfield, won a surprise victory.

Mulroney became a youth delegate and attended the 1956 leadership convention in Ottawa. While initially undecided, Mulroney was captivated by John Diefenbaker&#x27;s powerful oratory and easy approachability. Mulroney joined the Youth for Diefenbaker committee, which was led by Ted Rogers, a future scion of Canadian business. Mulroney struck an early friendship with Diefenbaker (who won the leadership) and received telephone calls from him.

Mulroney won several public speaking contests at St. Francis Xavier University, was a star member of the school&#x27;s debating team, and never lost an inter-university debate. He was also very active in campus politics, serving with distinction in several Model Parliaments, and was campus prime minister in a Maritimes-wide Model Parliament in 1958.

Mulroney assisted with the 1958 national election campaign at the local level in Nova Scotia. This campaign led to the largest majority in the history of the Canadian House of Commons. After graduating from St. Francis Xavier with a degree in political science in 1959, Mulroney at first pursued a law degree from Dalhousie Law School in Halifax. It was around this time that Mulroney also cultivated friendships with the Tory premier of Nova Scotia, Robert Stanfield, and his chief adviser Dalton Camp. In his role as an advance man, Mulroney assisted with Stanfield&#x27;s successful 1960 re-election campaign. Mulroney neglected his studies, fell seriously ill during the winter term, was hospitalized, and, despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness, left his program at Dalhousie after the first year. He then applied to Université Laval in Quebec City and continued his legal studies there later in 1960.

In Quebec City, Mulroney befriended future Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson Sr. and frequented the provincial legislature, making connections with politicians, aides, and journalists. At Laval, Mulroney built a network of friends, including Lucien Bouchard, Bernard Roy, Michel Cogger, Michael Meighen, and Jean Bazin, that would play a prominent role in Canadian politics for years to come.

Mulroney secured a temporary appointment in Ottawa during the summer of 1962 as the executive assistant to Alvin Hamilton, minister of agriculture. Then, a federal election was called. Hamilton took Mulroney with him on the campaign trail, where the young organizer gained valuable experience.

== Labour lawyer (1964–1976) ==
After graduating from Laval in 1964, Mulroney moved to Montreal to join the law firm Howard, Cate, Ogilvy et al. The firm at the time was the largest law firm in the Commonwealth of Nations. Despite twice failing his bar exams, the firm kept him due to his charming personality. Mulroney finally passed the exam and was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1965, after which he began practising as a labour lawyer. He worked on Laurent Picard&#x27;s Commission of Inquiry on the St. Lawrence Ports. He was noted for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront, where he met fellow lawyer W. David Angus of Stikeman Elliott, who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaigns. In addition, he met fellow then Stikeman Elliott lawyer Stanley Hartt, who later played a vital role assisting him during his political career as Mulroney&#x27;s Chief of Staff.

In 1966, Dalton Camp, who by then was president of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker&#x27;s leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out of the spotlight. With Camp&#x27;s narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a 1967 leadership convention in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister E. Davie Fulton. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to Robert Stanfield, who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.

Mulroney&#x27;s professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot;. In doing so, Mulroney and the paper&#x27;s owner, Canadian business mogul Paul Desmarais, became friends. After his initial difficulties, Mulroney&#x27;s reputation in his firm steadily increased, and he was made a partner in 1971.

Mulroney&#x27;s big break came during the Cliche Commission in 1974, which was set up by Quebec premier Robert Bourassa to investigate the situation at the James Bay Project, Canada&#x27;s largest hydroelectric project. Violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa, the Liberal premier, placed Robert Cliche, a former leader of the provincial New Democratic Party in charge. Cliche asked Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative and a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney asked Lucien Bouchard to join as counsel. The committee&#x27;s proceedings, which showed Mafia infiltration of the unions, made Mulroney well known in Quebec, as the hearings were extensively covered in the media. The Cliche Commission&#x27;s report was largely adopted by the Bourassa government. A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec when it emerged that Paul Desrochers, Bourassa&#x27;s special executive assistant, had met with the union boss André Desjardins, known as the &quot;King of Construction,&quot; to ask for his help with winning a by-election in exchange guaranteeing that only companies employing workers from his union would work on the James Bay project. Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of &#x27;executive privilege.&#x27; Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for re-election in 1988.

=== 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election ===
The Stanfield-led Progressive Conservatives lost the 1974 election to the Pierre Trudeau-led Liberals, leading to Stanfield&#x27;s resignation as leader. Mulroney, despite never having run for elected office, entered the contest to replace him. Mulroney and provincial rival Claude Wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the party&#x27;s standing in Quebec, which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. Mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting Wagner to the PC party a few years earlier, and the two wound up as rivals for Quebec delegates, most of whom were snared by Wagner, who even blocked Mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention. In the leadership race, Mulroney spent an estimated $500,000, far more than the other candidates, and earned himself the nickname &#x27;Cadillac candidate.&#x27; At the 1976 leadership convention, Mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind Wagner. His expensive campaign, slick image, lack of parliamentary experience, and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates, and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses, and his campaign finished deeply in debt.

== Business leadership (1976–1983) ==
Mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983, Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaller. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company&#x27;s executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards.

== Opposition leader (1983–1984) ==
Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative party to a minority government in the 1979 federal election, which ended 16 years of continuous Liberal rule. The government fell after a successful no-confidence motion over his minority government&#x27;s budget in December 1979. The PCs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to Trudeau and the Liberals. Many Tories were also annoyed with Clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in June 1979. By late 1982, Joe Clark&#x27;s leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many Tory members of Parliament, despite his solid national lead over Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in opinion polls.

Mulroney, while publicly endorsing Clark at a press conference in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party&#x27;s leadership review. Clark&#x27;s key Quebec organizer, Rodrigue Pageau, was, in fact, a double agent, working for Mulroney, undermining Clark&#x27;s support. When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 percent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in Winnipeg, he resigned and ran to regain his post at the 1983 leadership convention. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, &quot;Where I Stand&quot;, published in 1983.

Mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec. Pundits noted that a poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark&#x27;s home province of Alberta and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney&#x27;s home province of Quebec. Mulroney&#x27;s strong showing amongst Ontario delegates (65 percent to 35 percent) seemed to account for most of his margin of victory. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1984 argued that Mulroney was elected from &quot;the right-wing elements&quot; within the party. Tasha Kheiriddin, writing in &quot;La Presse&quot;, argued that &quot;Brian Mulroney&#x27;s injuries to Joe Clark in 1983 took more than 15 years to heal, as various factions continued to compete for leadership roles in the field and youth wings.&quot;

Two months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for Central Nova in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat after Elmer MacKay stood aside in his favour. The Progressive Conservatives only had one seat in Mulroney&#x27;s home province of Quebec at the time.

Throughout his political career, Mulroney&#x27;s fluency in English and French, with Quebec roots in both cultures, gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive.

By the start of 1984, as Mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken for granted that Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney in the general election due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February and was succeeded as Liberal leader and prime minister by his former finance minister, John Turner, in June. The Liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as prime minister, Turner called a general election for September. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.

In the early days of the campaign, Mulroney made several gaffes regarding patronage, including the reference to Ambassador Bryce Mackasey as &quot;there&#x27;s no whore like an old whore&quot;. Most of the campaign is best remembered for his attacks on a raft of Liberal patronage appointments. In his final days in office, Trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators, judges, and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards, widely seen as a way to offer &#x27;plum jobs&#x27; to loyal members of the Liberal Party. Upon assuming office, Turner had been under pressure to advise Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would then have required Sauvé to do. Turner did not, instead appointing several more Liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with Trudeau.

Ironically, Turner had planned to attack Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory. In a televised leaders&#x27; debate, Turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on Mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old Union Nationale in Quebec. Mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of Liberal patronage appointments. He demanded that Turner apologize to the country for making &quot;these horrible appointments.&quot; Turner replied that, &quot;I had no option&quot; except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:

You had an option, sir. You could have said, &#x27;I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.&#x27; You had an option, sir—to say &#x27;no&#x27;—and you chose to say &#x27;yes&#x27; to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians.

Turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney. He could repeat only, &quot;I had no option.&quot; A visibly angry Mulroney called this &quot;an avowal of failure&quot; and &quot;a confession of non-leadership.&quot; The exchange led most papers the next day, with most of them paraphrasing Mulroney&#x27;s counterattack as &quot;You had an option, sir—you could have said &#x27;no.&#x27;&quot; Many observers believe that at this point, Mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister.

On September 4, Mulroney and the Tories won the second largest majority government (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian history, winning 74.8 percent of seats in the House of Commons (behind the Tories&#x27; 1958 landslide in which they won 78.5 percent of seats). They took 211 seats, three more than their previous record in 1958 and the highest number of seats ever won by any party in Canadian history. The Liberals won only 40 seats, which, at the time, was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in Canadian history. The Progressive Conservatives won just over half of the popular vote (compared to 53.4 percent in 1958) and led in every province, emerging as a national party for the first time since 1958. Especially important was the Tories&#x27; performance in Mulroney&#x27;s home province, Quebec. The Tories had only won the most seats in that province once since 1896 – the 1958 Tory landslide. Largely out of anger at Trudeau and Mulroney&#x27;s promise of a new deal for Quebec, the province swung over dramatically to support him. The Tories had only won one seat out of 75 in 1980 but took 58 seats in 1984. Mulroney yielded Central Nova back to MacKay and instead ran and won in the eastern Quebec riding of Manicouagan, which included Baie-Comeau.

In 1984, the Canadian Press named Mulroney &quot;Newsmaker of the Year&quot; for the second straight year, making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister (the other being Lester Pearson).

== Prime Minister (1984–1993) ==
The first Conservative majority victory in 26 years—and only the second in 54 years—initially seemed to give Mulroney a very formidable position. The Tories had won just over half the popular vote, and no other party crossed the 50-seat mark. He had wide discretion to take Canada in virtually any direction he wanted. His position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest. Mulroney&#x27;s support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the West, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Such diverse interests became difficult for him to juggle.

Most of Mulroney&#x27;s ministers had little government experience, resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals. Many Tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government. Mulroney included a large number of Westerners in his Cabinet (including Clark as minister of external affairs). He was not completely successful, even aside from economic and constitutional policy. For example, he moved CF-18 servicing from Manitoba to Quebec in 1986, even though the Manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated. Mulroney also received death threats for exerting pressure on Manitoba over French language rights.

=== Economic policy ===

==== Social programs and spending ====

Despite Mulroney referring to social programs as a &quot;sacred trust&quot; when he was Opposition leader in 1983, he began to reduce expenditures on the programs when he came into office. In terms of old age security, Mulroney&#x27;s government gradually reduced its benefits at middle-income levels and above. Mulroney&#x27;s government cut spending for unemployment insurance (UI) and reduced the range of workers covered by the benefits from the program. In their first budget in 1985, the Mulroney government announced that Registered home ownership savings plan (RHOSP) contributions would not be deductible if made after May 22, 1985, (funds left in the RHOSP after this date could be withdrawn tax-free, &quot;regardless of the use&quot;) and no contribution could be made after December 31, 1985; the government also announced that income earned in an RHOSP after December 31, 1985, was to be included in the owner&#x27;s taxable income, effectively ending the last desirable feature of RHOSPs. In 1990, the government limited cost-sharing under the Canada Assistance Plan in three provinces in response to their concerns that unemployed workers would apply for cost-shared provincial social assistance (as a result of rising unemployment). Also in 1990, Mulroney&#x27;s government eliminated its financial contribution to UI, making all UI costs covered by worker and employer contributions. In Spring 1993, the government lowered benefits for unemployed Canadians and eliminated benefits for the unemployed who failed to prove the reason they left their job.

In 1985, Mulroney&#x27;s government introduced a four-year plan to restructure family benefits. Starting in 1986, family allowances were partially indexed to the cost of living. For three years, from 1986 to 1988, the refundable child tax credits were increased to $549 per year. Starting in 1989, the tax credits were partially indexed in the same manner as family allowances. That same year, as part of the government&#x27;s program to target social benefits to low or middle-income Canadians, universal family allowances ended as high-income parents were required to repay all of their benefits at tax-filing time. This system maintained and increased a tax deduction for childcare expenses, benefiting high-income families the most. In 1992, the government replaced family allowances with a new Child Tax Benefit that included the family allowance, the Refundable Child Tax Credit, and a non-refundable child tax credit. The new benefit paid a maximum of $85 per month per child up to the age of 18 and was tax-free. It was income-tested on the net family income reported in the preceding year&#x27;s income tax returns.

Mulroney&#x27;s government reduced the federal workforce by 1 percent each year from 1986 to 1991, resulting in the laying off of 11,000 federal employees. Mulroney&#x27;s government transferred the costs of universal health care and higher education to the provinces, breaking the tradition of the two levels of government splitting the costs. As a result, some provinces had to drop insurance coverage for certain medical procedures and drugs. Mulroney&#x27;s government eliminated subsidies to government-owned passenger rail and postal services, resulting in the closing of post offices in some small towns and the elimination of certain train routes. The government also introduced fees for forwarding misdirected letters. Under Mulroney, military spending growth was reduced to 1.5 percent per year and foreign aid growth was reduced to 3 percent per year. Mulroney also put spending limits on medicare.

==== Deficit ====

One of Mulroney&#x27;s priorities was to lower the deficit, which under Pierre Trudeau had increased from $667 million in the 1968 budget to $37.2 billion in the 1984 budget. By 1988, Mulroney&#x27;s government cut the deficit to $28 billion, though it would never decrease beyond that point and the deficit would instead increase. The Progressive Conservatives&#x27; final budget in 1993 produced a deficit of $38.5 billion, about the same level that it was when Trudeau left office. As a percent of GDP, the deficit was reduced from 8.3 percent to 5.6 percent during Mulroney&#x27;s tenure.

The worldwide recession of the early 1990s significantly damaged the government&#x27;s financial situation. Mulroney&#x27;s inability to improve the government&#x27;s finances, as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the Western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his &#x27;pro-business&#x27; plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100 percent of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada&#x27;s international credit rating.

==== Taxation ====

Mulroney&#x27;s government de-indexed personal income tax brackets and eliminated open corporate tax loopholes. The government also increased taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline. In 1988, Mulroney&#x27;s government reduced the corporate income tax from 36 percent to 28 percent. That year, his government increased the capital gains tax inclusion rate from 50 percent to 66.67 percent before increasing it to 75 percent in 1990.

Mulroney&#x27;s government passed a major tax reform bill, Bill C-139, which was made effective on January 1, 1988. It included reforms for personal and corporate income taxes. The bill expanded the tax base for personal and corporate income; lowered rates applicable to taxable income; supplanted exemptions with credits; and removed certain deductions for personal income tax. The bill replaced the 1987 rate schedule of 10 brackets (with rates ranging from 6 to 34 percent) with a schedule of only three brackets (with rates of 17 percent, 26 percent, and 29 percent). The bill also limited the lifetime capital gains exemption to $100,000; lowered capital cost allowances; established limitations on deductible business expenses; and cut the dividend tax credit.

In August 1989, Mulroney&#x27;s government announced the introduction of a nine percent national sales tax, the goods and services tax (GST), to replace the hidden 13.5 percent manufacturers&#x27; sales tax (MST). The government argued that the MST damaged the Canadian economy&#x27;s competitiveness as it only applied to domestically manufactured goods, as opposed to the new GST, which applied to domestic and imported goods. The GST did not apply to basic groceries, prescription drugs, health and dental care, educational services, daycare, and legal aid. Following public backlash, Mulroney&#x27;s government changed the tax rate to seven percent. Although the government argued the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many polls showed that as many as 80 percent of Canadians were opposed to the tax. Two Progressive Conservative MPs from Alberta, David Kilgour and Alex Kindy, left the party in protest of the tax. The Senate with a Liberal majority refused to pass the GST. Mulroney used Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little-known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint eight new senators. On September 27, 1990, at the Queen&#x27;s approval, Mulroney added the eight new senators, thus giving the Tories their first majority in the Senate in nearly 50 years. In December 1990, the GST was passed in the Senate and was made effective on January 1, 1991. Mulroney&#x27;s use of an &quot;emergency&quot; clause in the constitution was controversial and contributed to his decline in popularity.

One of the causes of the early 1990s recession was several tax increases instituted by Mulroney&#x27;s government between 1989 and 1991. The introduction of the goods and services tax and increases related to excise and payroll taxes were modelled to have reduced real GDP growth by 1.6, 2.4 and 5.1 percentage points in 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively. Had these tax increases had not been implemented, the national debt would have increased significantly.

==== Privatizations ====

Mulroney&#x27;s government privatized many of Canada&#x27;s crown corporations. In 1984, the Government of Canada held 61 crown corporations. Under Mulroney, it sold off 23 of them, including Air Canada, which was completely privatized by 1989, although the &quot;Air Canada Public Participation Act&quot; continued to make certain requirements of the airline. Mulroney&#x27;s government also privatized Connaught Laboratories in 1984 through two public issues (one in 1984 and one in 1987) and Petro-Canada in 1991.

==== Energy policy ====

On June 1, 1985, Mulroney&#x27;s government negotiated the Western Accord on Energy with the governments of the oil-producing provinces. It permitted the full deregulation of oil prices and allowed the market forces of international and local supply and demand to determine prices. This accord abolished the National Energy Program, which was a policy of Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government that was highly unpopular in the Western provinces.

=== Environmental policy ===

The environment was a key focus of Mulroney&#x27;s government. His government added eight new national parks (including Bruce Peninsula and South Moresby), and passed the &quot;Canadian Environmental Assessment Act&quot; and &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;.

In 1987, Mulroney hosted an international climate conference in Montreal, Quebec. There, 46 nations signed the Montreal Protocol to limit the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); this agreement came after the discovery that CFCs were burning a hole through the ozone layer.

Mulroney secured the U.S.–Canada Air Quality Agreement, an environmental treaty on acid rain, with United States President George H. W. Bush in 1991. Both nations committed to reducing the emissions of the air pollutants (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide) that caused acid rain through a cap-and-trade system. Negotiations began in 1986 when Mulroney first discussed the issue with then-president Ronald Reagan. Mulroney repeatedly pressed the issue in public meetings with Reagan in 1987 and 1988.

Under Mulroney, Canada became the first industrialized country to ratify the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Conference experts claimed that Canada&#x27;s signing of the treaty motivated the United Kingdom and Germany to pledge their support and thus avoid the convention&#x27;s defeat. The conference also introduced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to an environmentally friendly level; Canada was the first Group of Seven (G7) nation to sign the treaty. At the convention, Mulroney pledged $260 million from Canada toward advancing sustainable development for developing nations; this included an offer to forgive $145 million in debts owed to Canada by Latin American nations on the condition that the sum of money be used for sustainable development and social programs. At the end of the conference, Mulroney stated, &quot;I leave this conference believing we have a better chance of saving the world than we had when we came here.&quot;

By 1992, Newfoundland and Labrador cod of breeding age dropped to one percent of its estimated peak. Concerned about the overfishing of cod stocks off the coast of the province, Mulroney&#x27;s government, in the summer of that year imposed a moratorium on cod fishing; they initially set the ban for a minimum of two years, but later expanded it indefinitely. This resulted in the layoff of 30,000–40,000 workers. Mulroney&#x27;s government introduced the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program (NCARP) that provided unemployment insurance payments and retraining to workers; most of the workers viewed this as insufficient. In the first decade of the ban, Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s population fell by 10 percent as people left to search for work.

=== Social policy ===

On September 22, 1988, Mulroney issued an official apology on behalf of the Canadian government for Japanese Canadian internment during World War II. Mulroney&#x27;s government provided a 300 million dollar compensation package, which included $21,000 to each of the remaining 13,000 survivors, $12 million for a Japanese community fund, and $24 million to create a Canadian race relations foundation.

Mulroney argues he set up the Deschênes Commission of inquiry on Nazi war criminals soon after he was first elected in 1984, even though it was controversial among &quot;communities where Nazi criminals posed as respectable citizens.&quot;

On issues of abortion, Mulroney declared he was opposed to &quot;abortion on demand&quot; but gave no details on what that meant legally. In the Spring of 1988, the Mulroney government offered a compromise solution that would give easy access to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and criminalize late-term ones. The law in the House of Commons was defeated 147 to 76 in a free vote, voted against by both MPs who opposed easy access to abortions and those who opposed adding any abortion rules to the Criminal Code. Some pro-life social conservatives who played a role in Mulroney&#x27;s 1984 landslide were disappointed by this move, as they were in favour of outlawing abortion completely, regardless of the circumstance. In 1989, the government introduced a much stricter bill. If enacted, it would ban all abortions unless a doctor ruled the woman&#x27;s life or health would be threatened. Anyone found in violation of the law could be imprisoned for up to two years. In another free vote, the House of Commons passed the new bill by nine votes. A few months later, the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. Under the rules of the Senate, a tie meant the measure was defeated. This was the last time the federal government attempted to enact abortion laws. Today, abortion in Canada remains completely legal at all stages of pregnancy, regardless of the reason.

In 1991, &quot;Frank&quot; magazine ran a satirical advertisement for a contest inviting young Tories to &quot;Deflower Caroline Mulroney.&quot; Her father was incensed and threatened physical harm toward those responsible before joining several women&#x27;s groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to rape on national television. Frank&#x27;s editor Michael Bate, called the spoof, intended to mock her unpopular father for bringing her to public adult-oriented events, &quot;clumsy&quot; but had no regrets. Bate also shared sympathy toward her father&#x27;s reaction over the spoof.

=== Attempted constitutional reform ===

==== Meech Lake Accord ====

A major undertaking by Mulroney&#x27;s government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity. In 1981, Quebec Premier René Lévesque, leader of the Quebec nationalist Parti Québécois government, had been the only provincial premier not to agree to the package of constitutional amendments which patriated the Constitution of Canada. In the 1985 Quebec provincial election, the Parti Québécois government suffered a landslide defeat to the Liberals led by Robert Bourassa. Some believed that the new Quebec government&#x27;s moderate stance on nationalism would allow the province to formally endorse the constitution. Mulroney wanted Quebec to endorse the constitution and wanted to include Quebec in a new agreement with the rest of Canada. In August 1986, Mulroney met with provincial premiers in Edmonton, Alberta, where the ministers agreed to the &quot;Edmonton Declaration&quot;. It stated that a &quot;Quebec Round&quot; of constitutional talks based on Bourassa&#x27;s five conditions that would have to be met for Quebec&#x27;s endorsement of the constitution (recognition of Quebec&#x27;s distinct character (as primarily Catholic and French-speaking); a veto for Quebec in constitutional matters; input from Quebec into the appointment of Supreme Court justices; entrenchment of Quebec&#x27;s role in immigration; and a limit on the federal spending power) would occur before further reforms would be undertaken.

Mulroney called a First Ministers&#x27; conference with the ten provincial premiers for April 30, 1987, at Willson House, located on the shores of Meech Lake, Quebec, in the Gatineau Hills. During the conference, Mulroney negotiated the Meech Lake Accord, a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy Quebec&#x27;s demand for recognition as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. The Accord also devolved some powers to the provinces such as giving provinces a role in nominating people to serve in some federal institutions (e.g. the Senate and Supreme Court of Canada); allowing provinces to withdraw from federally-financed social programs on the conditions that the province establish its own program that meets national standards; giving constitutional status to federal–provincial immigration agreements; and mandating annual First Ministers&#x27; conferences (the Accord also required that Senate reform and fisheries be discussed at the conferences), which made the federal-provincial consultative process constitutional. At a final roll call at 4:45 a.m. on June 3, 1987, hours before the signing ceremony, Mulroney knowingly breached convention by taking the vote in reverse order around the table instead of the traditional order of a province&#x27;s entry into confederation. At the symbolic signing ceremony, the premiers signed the Accord. The agreement would have changed the constitution&#x27;s amending formula. It therefore needed to be ratified by the federal parliament and the legislatures of all ten provinces. As well, other parts of the Accord were made under the general amendment provision. That meant that there was a three-year deadline for those amendments to pass. On June 23, 1987, Quebec became the first province to approve of the Accord, triggering the three-year time limit provided for by the Section 39(2) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;; this meant that June 22, 1990, would be the last possible day the Accord could pass.

Opinion polls showed that a majority of Canadians supported the Accord. Some believed the Accord would weaken Quebec separatism. Critics believed the Accord would weaken the federal government&#x27;s authority, and some from English Canada argued the &quot;distinct society&quot; clause would give Quebec special status and not make it equal to the other nine provinces. Mulroney told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;You can have the old style of warring federalism, or you can have genuine co-operative federalism, on which we&#x27;re trying to build a new country.&quot; As criticism grew, support for the Accord declined outside of Quebec; some there feared its failure would spark a backlash in the province and damage national unity.

A commission headed by Mulroney&#x27;s former cabinet minister, Jean Charest, recommended a companion accord that would address the concerns of other provinces, assert that the distinct society clause would be subject to the &quot;Charter&quot;, and would feature greater protections for minority language rights in the provinces. Mulroney&#x27;s environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, viewed the companion accord as a betrayal of Meech and subsequently praised the Parti Québécois in a telegram. Mulroney reportedly demanded Bouchard clarify the remark or resign, and Bouchard supplied a lengthy letter of resignation on May 22, 1990. Mulroney claimed he fired Bouchard. Bouchard left the Progressive Conservatives soon afterward. After the failure of the Accord, Bouchard convinced several other Tories and Liberals to join him to form the Bloc Québécois, a pro-sovereigntist party.

In early June 1990, all premiers finally agreed to ratify the Accord provided there be further constitutional discussions revolving around an elected Senate, the amending formula, equality, and Indigenous issues. Around that time, New Brunswick agreed to ratify the agreement. Manitoba and, Newfoundland, and Labrador remained the only provinces to have not ratified it; they only had a few weeks left. Unanimous support from every member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly was required to bypass the necessary public consultations in the assembly and proceed with ratification. On June 12, 1990, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba Elijah Harper announced his opposition to the Accord on the grounds that Indigenous groups had not been consulted. Harper&#x27;s opposition prevented the amendment from proceeding; thus, the Accord failed to pass in the legislature. This allowed the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Clyde Wells (who revoked the province&#x27;s previous assent though reluctantly agreed to ratify the Accord in June 1990), to excuse himself from bringing the Accord to a vote in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The Accord failed to be ratified as Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador did not approve of it by the June 23, 1990, deadline.

==== Charlottetown Accord ====

Following the Meech Lake failure, Mulroney sought a second attempt to get Quebec&#x27;s endorsement of the constitution. He appointed his foreign minister, Joe Clark, as the first minister responsible for constitutional affairs on April 21, 1991. Clark was responsible for establishing a new accord to end the constitutional deadlock with Quebec. Mulroney&#x27;s government appointed two Quebec bodies (the Allaire Committee and the Belanger-Campeau Committee) and two national bodies (the Beaudoin-Edwards Committee and the Spicer Commission) to engage in discussions regarding constitutional reform. These bodies generated various reports, including the federal document titled &quot;Shaping Canada&#x27;s Future Together&quot;. The Mulroney government then held five national conferences to discuss the proposals in the document. The conferences led to another federal report titled &quot;A Renewed Canada.&quot;. Afterward, negotiations between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments occurred. Unlike the Meech Lake Accord, Indigenous peoples were included in the discussions. Quebec was included in the final stages. The negotiations culminated in the Charlottetown Accord, which was unveiled in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on August 28, 1992.

The Accord gave provinces jurisdiction over foresty, mining, cultural affairs, and other areas; required the federal government to negotiate policy with the provinces in certain areas such as telecommunications, labour and training, regional development, and immigration; abolished disallowance (which gives the federal Cabinet power to overrule provincial legislation within one year of it being passed); and required provincial consent for the federal government gaining power over provincial infrastructure projects. The Accord allowed provinces to create their own social programs and mandated the federal government to compensate provinces as long as the provincial social programs met national standards. It also mandated the federal government to compensate provinces that withdrew from any constitutional amendment that transferred provincial powers to the federal government; the compensation would allow provinces to fund their own programs. In addition, the Accord addressed Indigenous self-government and contained the &quot;Canada Clause&quot; that determines Canadian values including egalitarianism, multiculturalism, and recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. Finally, the Accord entrenched the structure and appointment process for the Supreme Court of Canada in the constitution; changed the Senate into a Triple-E Senate with reduced powers (such as requiring a majority of all senators and a majority of Francophone senators in certain votes); increased the number of seats in the House of Commons; guaranteed Quebec at least a quarter of the Commons&#x27; seats; and increased the number of matters that require unanimous approval for a constitutional amendment.

The Accord was supported by the federal government and all ten provincial governments. Although it could have been ratified as a constitutional amendment, Mulroney&#x27;s government insisted on holding a national referendum to avoid a repetition of the criticism that the Meech Lake Accord was agreed upon without public approval. On October 26, 1992, two referendums, one national (without Quebec) and one in Quebec, were held, asking if Canadians agreed with the Charlottetown Accord. Nationally, 54.3 percent opposed the Accord. In Quebec, 56.7 percent opposed it. Many saw the Accord&#x27;s defeat as a protest against Mulroney&#x27;s government, which was heavily unpopular due to the failure of the previous Meech Lake Accord, the introduction of the GST, and the early 1990s recession.

=== Foreign policy ===

As prime minister, Mulroney strengthened Canada&#x27;s relations with the United States, moving away from Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Third Option policy of reducing American influence on Canada. Mulroney established a close relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. On March 17 and 18, 1985, the &quot;Shamrock Summit&quot; between Mulroney and Reagan was held in Quebec City. The summit gained its name from the two leaders&#x27; Irish background, and because the meeting started on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. In the summit, Mulroney and Reagan sang &quot;When Irish Eyes are Smiling&quot;; this signified the camaraderie between the two leaders and a turning point in Canada–United States relations.

The Air India Flight 182 bombing, which originated in Montreal, occurred on June 23, 1985. This was the largest terrorist act before the September 11 attacks, with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, sparking an uproar in Canada since he did not call the families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Furthermore, there were several warnings from the Indian government to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats toward Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.

In November 1984, Mulroney sent his newly appointed Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, Stephen Lewis, to the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City to persuade the General Assembly to take action against the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Days later, the UN and Red Cross launched an effort to save seven million starving Ethiopians and 22 million others in Africa. The Mulroney government&#x27;s efforts to aid Ethiopia differed Canada from the United States and the United Kingdom, two Western nations which avoided taking action against the famine due to Ethiopia&#x27;s Marxist regime. Mulroney&#x27;s foreign affairs minister, Joe Clark, became the first senior Western official to visit Ethiopia during the famine, ahead of UN officials. Mulroney&#x27;s government spent tens of millions of dollars to match private donations to combat the famine. Canada contributed to over 10 percent of international aid to Ethiopia. After the famine, Mulroney&#x27;s government increased aid and development funding to Africa.

On December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.

==== Apartheid ====

Mulroney&#x27;s government opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa. Beginning in 1985, Mulroney led an effort within the Commonwealth to sanction the South African government with the goal of pressuring them to end apartheid and release anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison. This put Mulroney at odds with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who opposed apartheid but believed the sanctions would hurt Britain (which had economic ties with South Africa) and that the measures would hurt South Africans and cause job losses. United States President Ronald Reagan also opposed sanctions, believing that Mandela and other leaders of the African National Congress were communists. At an October 23, 1985, United Nations General Assembly meeting, Mulroney stated, &quot;if there is no progress in the dismantling of apartheid, [Canada]&#x27;s relations with South Africa may have to be severed completely&quot;; he restored this line in his speech after he originally removed it at the advice of External Affairs. After an August 1986 meeting in London, Canada, along with other Commonwealth nations, implemented 11 new sanctions on South Africa including bans on new air links, new investment, promotion of tourism, and imports of South African coal, metals and agricultural goods.

The day after Mandela was released on February 11, 1990, he spoke with Mulroney through the telephone, thanking him for his efforts to end apartheid. Mandela made the Parliament of Canada his first legislature in the world to make a speech. On June 18 that year, Mandela spoke in the House of Commons of Canada, where he thanked Mulroney and Canadians. The two remained in contact after they left politics; during his annual business trips to South Africa, Mulroney visited Mandela.

==== Free trade and 1988 re-election ====
Critics noted that Mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the 1983 leadership campaign though the 1985 report of the MacDonald Commission suggested free trade as an idea to him. Negotiations between Canada and the United States for a free trade treaty started in May 1986. In October 1987, a deal was reached; the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) stated that all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by 1998. This deal was achieved not least because of Mulroney&#x27;s close relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This agreement was controversial; while Mulroney used his massive majority in the House of Commons to pass the bill, the Liberal-dominated Senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote. This induced Mulroney to ask Governor General Jeanne Sauvé on October 1 to dissolve Parliament and call an election for November 21.

The trade deal was the main issue of the election, with the Liberals and New Democratic Party (NDP) opposing it; Liberal leader John Turner (who was preparing for his second campaign after Mulroney defeated him in 1984) believed that the agreement would &quot;Americanize&quot; Canada and cost many Canadian jobs. A week after the October 25 debate, the Liberals were six points ahead of the PCs. To combat this Liberal surge, the PCs began running a more negative campaign, capitalizing on the perceived lack of public confidence in Turner, his perceived inability to lead the Liberal Party, and arguing that he only opposed free trade because of political opportunism. The Progressive Conservatives poll numbers began to rebound, and they were re-elected with a greatly reduced majority, winning 169 out of 295 seats and 43 percent of the popular vote. Mulroney became the first and only federal Canadian Conservative party leader since John A. Macdonald to lead his party to a second majority government. The trade deal gained the support of Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, which helped the PCs maintain their standing in Quebec. In this election, Mulroney transferred to another eastern Quebec seat, Charlevoix.

Also on November 21, Mulroney made a controversial Order in Council which allowed the establishment of the AMEX Bank of Canada (owned by American Express), despite Finance Minister Michael Wilson rejecting AMEX&#x27;s application to open a Canadian bank in 1986. The Amex Bank of Canada started operating on July 1, 1990. Toronto-Dominion Bank chairman Richard Thomson accused Mulroney&#x27;s government of favouritism toward Amex as its Chief Executive Officer, James Robinson, supported free trade.

The government implemented the deal; it was made effective on January 1, 1989. In 1994, CUSFTA was replaced by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now included Mexico.

====Gulf War====
In the early 1990s, Mulroney played a vital part in upholding international law to stop Saddam Hussein&#x27;s aggression in Kuwait. Along with Ambassador Yves Fortier, Mulroney was instrumental in drafting UNSCR 678 which later led to the war when Iraq failed to heed the resolution, and Canada supported the armed UN coalition during the 1991 Gulf War through Operation SCIMITAR and through Operation FRICTION. When the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a CF-18 squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of The Royal Canadian Regiment to safeguard these ground elements. The Canadian Forces code-named Canada&#x27;s participation Operation Friction. In August, Mulroney sent the destroyers HMCS &quot;Terra Nova&quot; and HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot; to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship HMCS &quot;Protecteur&quot; was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the air war began, Canada&#x27;s planes were integrated into the coalition force and, provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the fighting on Cyprus in 1974 that Canadian forces participated directly in combat operations.

=== Unpopularity and retirement ===

==== Fracturing of electoral coalition ====

In late 1987, the Western Canada-based right-wing populist Reform Party of Canada was founded. The creation of the party was motivated by Western Canadian discontent with Mulroney&#x27;s government and the Progressive Conservatives in general. The Reform Party opposed the Mulroney government&#x27;s promotion of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords as well as their introduction of the goods and services tax. Although the party won only 2 percent of the popular vote and no seats in the 1988 election, it won its first seat in the Commons on the May 6, 1989, by-election in the Alberta riding of Beaver River, where Reform candidate Deborah Grey defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Dave Broda by a nearly 20 percent margin. This was the first sign that Mulroney&#x27;s coalition was fracturing; the PCs had dominated Alberta&#x27;s federal politics since the 1958 election.

In June 1991, the pro-Quebec sovereigntist Bloc Québécois was founded by Mulroney&#x27;s former environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard. The party&#x27;s foundation was motivated by the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord, which would have benefited Quebec if it had been ratified. The party attracted a few other PC and Liberal members of parliament.

==== Resignation ====

Widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax, the early 1990s recession, the fracturing of his political coalition, and his lack of results regarding the Quebec situation caused Mulroney&#x27;s popularity to decline severely during his second term. Mulroney entered 1993 facing a statutory general election. By this time, his approval ratings had dipped into the tens, and were at 12 percent in a 1992 Gallup poll, making him the most unpopular prime minister since opinion polling began in Canada in the 1940s.

On February 24, 1993, Mulroney announced his intention to resign as prime minister and retire from politics. In his announcement, Mulroney stated, &quot;Whether you agree with our solutions or not, none will accuse us, I think, of having chosen to evade our responsibilities by sidestepping the most controversial issues of our time.&quot; Mulroney claimed his resignation was not related to the consensus that he would be heavily defeated by Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberals if he led the Tories into the next election and rather argued he could defeat the Liberals if he sought another term. The last Gallup Poll taken before Mulroney&#x27;s announcement of resignation showed the PCs&#x27; polling numbers had rebounded to 21 percent. In his final days in office, Mulroney conducted a European &quot;farewell&quot; tour using Canadian federal funds. On June 13, 1993, Mulroney was replaced as leader of the Progressive Conservatives by Defence Minister Kim Campbell. On June 25, 1993, Mulroney resigned as prime minister and chose not to run for reelection at the Commons.

==== Aftermath ====
In the October 25, 1993, election, the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced from 156 seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level in Canada. The Tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the House of Commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is 12. As an example of the antipathy toward Mulroney, his former riding fell to the Bloc by a lopsided margin; the Tory candidate finished a distant third, with only 6,800 votes out of nearly 40,000 cast. The more right-wing Reform Party won over alienated Western Canadians and replaced the PCs as the major conservative party in Canada; they won 52 seats and 18.7 percent of the popular vote, which was greater than the PCs (which won 16 percent of the popular vote). The Bloc replaced Mulroney&#x27;s voting base in Quebec, becoming the Official opposition (at 54 seats). In the election, Chrétien&#x27;s Liberals won a strong majority government. Mulroney claimed he was not responsible for the obliteration of the PCs, and instead blamed Campbell and her relationship with her boyfriend. In &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot;, it was revealed Mulroney said of Campbell, &quot;Throughout the whole goddam thing she&#x27;s been screwing around with this Russian guy. The guy was sneaking into hotel rooms and the campaign bus&quot;; he also said it was &quot;the most incompetent campaign I&#x27;ve seen in my life.&quot; In the following 1997 and 2000 elections, the Progressive Conservatives would continue being the smallest party in the House of Commons, holding on to fifth-place status though regaining official party status. In 2003, the party merged with Reform&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance, to create today&#x27;s Conservative Party of Canada.

== After politics (1993–2024) ==
After leaving office, Mulroney served as an international business consultant and was a partner with the law firm Norton Rose. He, up until his death in 2024, sat on the board of directors of multiple corporations, including The Blackstone Group, Barrick Gold, Quebecor Inc., Archer Daniels Midland, Cendant Corp. (New York), AOL Latin America, Inc. (New York), Cognicase Inc. (Montreal) and Acreage Holdings, one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies in the United States. He was a senior counsellor to Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, a global private equity fund in Dallas, chairman of Forbes Global (New York), and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for Karl-Heinz Schreiber beginning in 1993. He was also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies, including Power Corp. (Montreal), Bombardier (Montreal), the China International Trust and Investment Corp. (Beijing), J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. (New York), Violy, Byorum and Partners (New York), VS&amp;A Communications Partners (New York), Independent Newspapers (Dublin) and General Enterprise Management Services Limited (British Virgin Islands).

In 1998, Mulroney was accorded Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour when he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.
In 2003, Mulroney received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution at a ceremony in Montreal. The award was in recognition of his career in politics.

In January 2004, Mulroney delivered a keynote speech in Washington, D.C., celebrating the tenth anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In June 2004, Mulroney presented a eulogy for former U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter&#x27;s state funeral. Two years later, at the request of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Mulroney travelled to Washington, D.C., along with Michael Wilson, Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, as Canada&#x27;s representatives at the state funeral of former president Gerald Ford.

In February 2005, as part of a physical examination, a CT scan revealed two small lumps in one of Mulroney&#x27;s lungs. In his youth, Mulroney had been a heavy smoker. His doctors performed a biopsy, which ruled out cancer (his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing). He recovered well enough to tape a speech for the Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s 2005 Policy Convention in Montreal in March, though he could not attend in person. He later developed pancreatitis, and he remained in hospital for several weeks. It was not until April 19 that his son, Ben Mulroney, announced he was recovering and would soon be released.

On September 12, 2005, veteran writer and former Mulroney confidant Peter C. Newman released &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes: Unguarded Confessions of a Prime Minister&quot;. Based largely on remarks from the former prime minister, which Newman had taped with Mulroney&#x27;s knowledge, the book set off national controversy. Newman had been given unfettered access to Mulroney for a thorough biography and claims Mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers. This led Mulroney to respond at the annual Press Gallery Dinner, which is noted for comedic moments, in Ottawa on October 22, 2005. The former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night: &quot;Peter Newman: Go fuck yourself. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and good night.&quot;

In 2014, Mulroney became the chairman of Quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and CEO Pierre Karl Péladeau.

On December 5, 2018, Mulroney presented a eulogy for former U.S. President George H. W. Bush during the latter&#x27;s state funeral.

=== Airbus/Schreiber affair ===
On September 29, 1995, the Canadian Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the RCMP, sent a Letter of Request to the Swiss Government asking for information related to allegations that Mulroney was involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada. The investigation pertained to &quot;improper commissions&quot; allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber (or to companies controlled by him), Brian Mulroney and former Newfoundland premier Frank Moores in exchange for three government contracts. These contracts involved the purchase of Airbus Industrie aircraft by Air Canada; the purchase of helicopters by the Canadian Coast Guard from Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB) in 1986; and the establishment of a manufacturing plant for Thyssen Light Armoured Vehicles (Bear Head Project) in the province of Nova Scotia, a project which Mulroney as prime minister had cancelled.

This Letter of Request (LOR) &quot;and its contents were to be kept confidential&quot; but the letter was leaked to the media. As a result, Mulroney launched a $50 million libel lawsuit against the Government of Canada and the RCMP on November 20, 1995. On January 5, 1997, Mulroney agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $2.1 million with the Government of Canada and the RCMP. The Oliphant Commission Report in 2010 stated that Mulroney accepted $225 000 from Schreiber, and former justice minister Allan Rock said he would have used a different litigation strategy in the libel case had he known about these payments.

Mulroney did not disclose that he had received money from Schreiber (which Schreiber alleges was a total of $300,000 in instalments of $100,000 in three separate occurrences between 1993 and 1994 given to Mulroney under the code name &quot;Britan&quot; in brown paper envelopes/bags in denominations of $1,000 during secret hotel exchanges). Later, on February 2, 1998, Schreiber met with Mulroney at Mulroney&#x27;s invitation to the hotel Savoy in Zurich, where, before a spread of smoked salmon and appetizers, Mulroney tried to get Schreiber to verify that nothing could connect Mulroney to the money. Later on, when further information was leaked to the public, Mulroney stated that there was nothing wrong with accepting envelopes of $1,000 bills (which he put into safes and safe deposit boxes without reporting tax on it as income for years after). The Oliphant Commission, presided over by Justice Jeffrey Oliphant, reported on May 31, 2010, that Mulroney &quot;failed to live up to the standard of conduct that he himself adopted in the 1995 ethics code. Oliphant J. said he could not accept Mulroney&#x27;s testimony that his acceptance of $225,000 cash was an error in judgment. Rather, it was an attempt to hide the transactions.

=== Conservative Party of Canada ===
Mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger of the Canadian Alliance (successor of the Reform Party) with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative Party of Canada; Mulroney joined the new party upon its formation in 2003. This distinguished him from other prominent PC politicians, such as former prime ministers Joe Clark and Kim Campbell, who became independents as they believed that the Conservative Party was too right-wing and drifting toward social conservatism.

According to press reports, Mulroney&#x27;s membership lapsed in 2006. In early 2009, Mulroney &quot;called a high-ranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists&quot; due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs, although he denies this claim. A Mulroney confidant, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the party&#x27;s claims preposterous. &quot;He&#x27;s part of the history of this party; you can&#x27;t rewrite history. If they&#x27;re worried about branding, then shut the inquiry down. They&#x27;re the ones who called the inquiry.&quot;

Months before the 2015 federal election, Mulroney endorsed Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Mulroney campaigned for Conservative Leader Erin O&#x27;Toole in the run-up of the 2021 Canadian election. Just a month and a bit later, Mulroney criticized him on the matter of COVID-19 vaccinations, stating that he should show &quot;leadership&quot; and expel unvaccinated MPs from the Conservative caucus. In October 2022, Mulroney said he supported the Conservatives&#x27; new leader, Pierre Poilievre, but urged him to move closer to the political centre.

=== Other political interventions ===

In 2003, Mulroney criticized the Chrétien government&#x27;s foreign policy. He expressed his disappointment with the Liberals strengthening relations with China, Russia, and Germany. Instead, he voiced his support for the United States, stating, &quot;I want to stick with my old friends and allies.&quot; He also voiced his support for the Iraq War and said Canada would have supported the United States in Iraq if he was still prime minister.

In June 2023, Mulroney praised Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s handling of negotiations of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Trudeau&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mulroney also criticized former US President Donald Trump, saying that he &quot;was out to sabotage Canada.&quot;

=== Memoir ===
Mulroney&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was released on September 10, 2007. Mulroney criticizes Pierre Elliot Trudeau for avoiding military service in World War II, and favourably references sources that describe the young Trudeau as holding anti-Semitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators. Tom Axworthy, a prominent Liberal strategist, responded that Trudeau should be judged on his mature views. Historian and former MP and Trudeau biographer John English said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations.&quot;

=== Death and state funeral ===

Mulroney had suffered several years of declining health leading up to his death. He had been hospitalized as the result of a fall at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and died on February 29, 2024, at the age of 84.

Mulroney&#x27;s remains were repatriated on March 8, 2024, at Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport. A tribute in the House of Commons of Canada was held on March 18, after MPs agreed to suspend sitting. Mulroney lay in state at the Sir John A. Macdonald Building in Ottawa on March 19–20, before laying in repose at St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, Montreal on March 21–22. A state funeral was held at the Notre-Dame Basilica on March 23 and was attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well as former prime ministers Jean Chrétien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, hockey player Wayne Gretzky, former UK Prime Minister John Major, Sarah, Duchess of York, and actor Ryan Reynolds. He was buried at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

== Legacy ==
Mulroney&#x27;s legacy as prime minister is considered to be mixed. Mulroney made the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regarded this as vindication. His deputy prime minister, Don Mazankowski, said that his greatest accomplishment would be seen as &quot;dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century&quot;. His legacy in Canada is associated mostly with the 1989 Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Mulroney argued his government&#x27;s economic policies helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit. During his announcement of his intention to resign as prime minister, Mulroney responded to criticism of his policies: &quot;I tried to do what I thought would be right for Canada in the long term, not what I thought would be politically popular in the short term.&quot; In &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot;, it was revealed he said of his accomplishments: &quot;You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none.&quot;

Mulroney&#x27;s intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many Conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years. His government had flirted with 10 percent approval ratings in the early 1990s when Mulroney&#x27;s honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media, by Canadians in general and by his political colleagues. In the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced to two seats, which was seen as partially due to a backlash against Mulroney, as well as due to the fracturing of his &quot;Grand Coalition.&quot; In the 1993 election, nearly all of the Tories&#x27; Western support shifted to Reform, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing force in Canada. The Tories only won two seats west of Quebec in the next decade and kept remaining in fifth (last) place. The Canadian right was not reunited until the PCs merged with Reform&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance, in December 2003 to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.

In her memoirs, &quot;Time and Chance&quot;, and in her response in the &quot;National Post&quot; to &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot;, Kim Campbell said that Mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the Tories&#x27; reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off. Campbell claimed Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a &quot;scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity&quot; rather than a true successor. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Campbell described Mulroney as &quot;a pragmatist, not an ideologue.&quot; Former Ontario Premier David Peterson, who supported both of Mulroney&#x27;s attempts at constitutional reform while premier, told journalist Peter C. Newman of Mulroney, &quot;I would never trust or respect him. He is a pathological liar. In fairness, I don&#x27;t believe he knows he&#x27;s lying ... Oh God, you couldn&#x27;t take anything he said at face value. His essential Achilles heel is his baloney.&quot;

In 2006, Mulroney was named the &quot;greenest&quot; Prime Minister in Canadian history by a 12-member panel at an event organized by &quot;Corporate Knights&quot; magazine. Military historians Norman Hillmer and J. L. Granatstein ranked Mulroney eighth out of 20 among Canada&#x27;s prime ministers in their 1999 book &quot;Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada&#x27;s Leaders&quot;. In 2018, CAQ MNA and then Journal de Montreal journalist, Sylvain Lévesque, referred to Mulroney as a political influence when criticizing the relatability of progressive decisions made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In that same year, former Bloc Québécois leader Michel Gauthier said he considered Mulroney to be the greatest prime minister of the last 50 years. In 2019, St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia inaugurated the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government, a $100-million initiative designed to provide undergraduates with degrees in public policy and governance.

== Supreme Court appointments ==
Mulroney chose the following jurists to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council to be puisne justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, one of whom, Beverley McLachlin, was subsequently elevated to Chief Justice of Canada:
* Gérard La Forest (January 16, 1985 – September 30, 1997)
* Claire L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé (April 15, 1987 – July 1, 2002)
* John Sopinka (May 24, 1988 – November 24, 1997)
* Charles Gonthier (February 1, 1989 – August 1, 2003)
* Peter Cory (February 1, 1989 – June 1, 1999)
* Beverley McLachlin (March 30, 1989 – December 15, 2017; subsequently appointed Chief Justice of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, from January 7, 2000)
* William Stevenson (September 17, 1990 – June 5, 1992)
* Frank Iacobucci (January 7, 1991 – June 30, 2004)
* John C. Major (November 13, 1992 – December 25, 2005)

Mulroney also advised the appointment of Antonio Lamer (as Chief Justice, July 1, 1990 – January 6, 2000. Lamer had been appointed a Puisne Justice on the advice of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, March 28, 1980).

<text>Charles Joseph Clark (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th prime minister of Canada from 1979 to 1980.

Despite his relative inexperience, Clark rose quickly in federal politics, entering the House of Commons in the 1972 election and winning the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1976. He won a minority government in the 1979 election, defeating the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau and ending sixteen years of continuous Liberal rule. Taking office the day before his 40th birthday, Clark is the youngest person to become prime minister.

Clark&#x27;s tenure was brief as the minority government was brought down by a non-confidence vote on his first budget in December 1979. The budget defeat triggered the 1980 election. Clark and the Progressive Conservatives lost the election to Trudeau and the Liberals, who won a majority in the Commons and returned to power. Clark lost the leadership of the party to Brian Mulroney in 1983.

Clark returned to prominence from 1984 to 1993 as foreign minister then constitutional affairs minister in Mulroney&#x27;s cabinet. Clark retired from politics by not standing for re-election for the House of Commons in 1993. He made a political comeback in 1998 to lead the Progressive Conservatives in their last general election before the party&#x27;s eventual dissolution, serving his final term in Parliament from 2000 to 2004. After the Progressive Conservatives merged with the more right-wing Canadian Alliance to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, Clark instead sat as an independent Progressive Conservative, criticizing the merger as what he described as an &quot;Alliance take-over&quot;, believing that the new party was drifting towards social conservatism. Clark today serves as a university professor and as president of his own consulting firm.

==Early years==

Charles Joseph Clark was born on June 5, 1939, in High River, Alberta, the son of Grace Roselyn (née Welch) and local newspaper publisher Charles A. Clark.

Clark attended local schools and the University of Alberta, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history (1960) and a master&#x27;s degree in political science (1973). While in high school, he gained journalism experience with the &quot;High River Times&quot; and the &quot;Calgary Albertan&quot;. In his first year at the University of Alberta, Clark joined the staff of the campus newspaper, &quot;The Gateway&quot;, and eventually became its editor-in-chief. Clark was also a member of the University of Alberta Debate Society (UADS). He later worked one summer at the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; where he met his future biographer, David L. Humphreys.

Clark then attended Dalhousie Law School. However, he spent more time with the Dalhousie Student Union, Progressive Conservative politics and the &quot;Dalhousie Gazette&quot;, than on his courses. After leaving Dalhousie, he unsuccessfully pursued first-year law studies at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in Vancouver. He then worked full-time for the Progressive Conservative Party.

In 1973, Clark married law student Maureen McTeer. McTeer has developed her own career as a well-known author and lawyer and caused controversy by keeping her maiden name after marriage, a practice less common at the time. Their daughter, Catherine has pursued a career in broadcasting.

==Early political career==
Clark became politically active while at university, although he had been aware from a young age of politics in Canada. He competed with the University of Alberta Debate Society. He served as president of the University of Alberta Young Progressive Conservatives and eventually served as national president for the Young PCs group. Clark sparred with future political rival Preston Manning in debate forums on campus between the Young PCs and the Youth League of the Alberta Social Credit Party. Clark encountered another future rival when he met Brian Mulroney at a national Young PCs meeting in 1958.

Clark spent time in France to improve his fluency in the French language and took courses in French while he was living in Ottawa. He eventually became comfortable speaking and answering questions in French.

Clark entered politics at age 28 but was unsuccessful as candidate for the provincial Progressive Conservatives in the 1967 provincial election. He served as a chief assistant to provincial opposition leader and future Premier Peter Lougheed and served in the office of federal opposition leader Robert Stanfield, learning the inner workings of Parliament. Clark unsuccessfully ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1971 provincial election. He then successfully ran in the federal election held a year later and was elected to Parliament as the MP for Rocky Mountain, a largely rural riding in southwestern Alberta.

Clark had initially been viewed with suspicion, but over time won over senior members of the party. Robert Stanfield initially thought Clark not to be fit for politics, but over time came to view him as leadership material. Erik Nielsen viewed Clark as fiercely partisan, but was impressed by Clark&#x27;s questioning the government.

Clark&#x27;s social liberalism put him at odds with the right-wing members of his caucus, several of whom were not afraid to confront him. For example, in the lead-up to the 1979 election, the bulk of Clark&#x27;s riding was merged into the newly created riding of Bow River during a redistribution of ridings. Fellow Tory MP Stanley Schumacher had much of his old riding of Palliser merged into Bow River as well. Even though Clark was now party leader, Schumacher refused to step aside in Clark&#x27;s favour, forcing Clark to run in nearby Yellowhead.

==Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1976==
Following the resignation of PC party leader Robert Stanfield, Clark sought and won the leadership of the PC Party at the 1976 leadership convention. Initially, the favourite among Red Tories was Flora MacDonald; however, she did worse than expected, while Clark placed a surprising third in a field of eleven on the first ballot of convention delegates, behind only Claude Wagner and Brian Mulroney. MacDonald dropped off after the second ballot, encouraging her supporters to support Clark, who quickly became the compromise Red Tory candidate. The party&#x27;s right-wing rallied behind Wagner. Mulroney, a Quebec businessman with no elected political experience, was unable to expand his base of support significantly. As other Red Tory candidates were eliminated during the first four ballots, Clark gradually overtook Mulroney and then Wagner to emerge as the victor on the fourth ballot, by 1,187 votes to 1,122.

Clark, who won the Tory leadership at age 36, remains the youngest leader of a major federal party in the history of Canadian politics. With many veteran Tories having been defeated in the 1968 election, the party effectively skipped a generation by selecting Clark as its new leader.

==Opposition Leader, 1976–1979==
Joe Clark&#x27;s rapid rise from a relatively unknown Alberta MP to the Leader of the Opposition took much of Canada by surprise. &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; announced Clark&#x27;s victory with a headline that read &quot;Joe Who?&quot;, giving Clark a nickname that stuck for years. His clumsiness and awkward mannerisms were mocked by some political commentators, such as cartoonist Andy Donato who typically drew Clark with mittens on strings hanging from his suit sleeves.

However, Clark hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office. He improved his party&#x27;s standing in national opinion polls. Clark gradually earned the respect of some political observers, including his own caucus, and benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977. Some observers noted that Clark, despite being perceived by many people as something of a square, showed biting wit at times while in Opposition. One of his most famous quips was: &quot;A recession is when your neighbour loses his job. A depression is when you lose your job. Recovery is when Pierre Trudeau loses his job.&quot; Television broadcasts of Question Period in the House of Commons served to build Clark and the Tories up as an alternative to the Liberals.

===1979 election===
Large budget deficits, high inflation, and high unemployment made the Liberal government unpopular. Trudeau had put off asking the Canadian Governor General to call an election as long as possible, in the hope that his party could recover popular support but it backfired, as there was growing public antipathy towards his perceived arrogance. Clark campaigned on the slogans, &quot;Let&#x27;s get Canada working again&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s time for a change—give the future a chance!&quot;

In the latter half of the campaign, the Liberals focused their attacks on Clark&#x27;s perceived inexperience. Their advertisements declared &quot;This is no time for on-the-job training&quot;, and &quot;We need tough leadership to keep Canada growing. A leader must be a leader.&quot; Clark played into their hands by appearing bumbling and unsure in public.

When Clark undertook a tour of the Middle East in order to show his ability to handle foreign affairs issues, his luggage was lost, and Clark appeared to be uncomfortable with the issues being discussed. That incident was widely lampooned by Toronto Sun cartoonist Andy Donato. During the same tour, while inspecting a military honour guard, Clark turned too soon and nearly bumped into a soldier&#x27;s bayonet; one of the first major media reports on the incident claimed, with some exaggeration, that he had nearly been beheaded.

Despite Clark being bilingual, the Tories were unable to make much headway in Quebec, which continued to be federally dominated by the Liberals. While Clark&#x27;s 1976 leadership rivals were prominent in that province, Claude Wagner had left politics (he died shortly after the election), while Brian Mulroney was still bitter about his loss and turned down an offer to serve under Clark.

Nonetheless, Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives won 136 seats to end sixteen continuous years of Liberal rule in the election for the 31st Canadian Parliament. Despite receiving fewer votes than the Liberals nationally, the Progressive Conservatives won the popular vote in seven provinces. They also made gains in Ontario, particularly in the Toronto suburbs, winning many seats by narrow margins, offsetting a large Liberal win in Quebec. The Tories were only able to win two seats in Quebec, leaving them six seats short of a majority. The Liberals lost 27 seats, including several high-profile cabinet ministers, and Trudeau announced his intention to step down as party leader.

==Prime minister (1979–1980)==

On June 4, 1979, the day before his 40th birthday, Clark was sworn in as Canada&#x27;s 16th prime minister, steering the first Tory government since the defeat of John Diefenbaker in the 1963 election. He was Canada&#x27;s youngest prime minister, and the first to be born in Western Canada.

With a minority government in the House of Commons, Clark had to rely on the support of the Social Credit Party, with its six seats, or the New Democratic Party (NDP), with its 26 seats. At the time, Opposition leader Trudeau said that he would allow the Progressive Conservatives a chance to govern, though he warned the Prime Minister against dismantling Petro-Canada, which was unpopular in Clark&#x27;s home province of Alberta.

Social Credit was below the 12 seats needed for official party status in the House of Commons. However, the six seats would have been just enough to give Clark&#x27;s government a majority had the Progressive Conservatives formed a coalition government with Social Credit, or had the two parties otherwise agreed to work together. Clark managed to lure Socred MP Richard Janelle to the government caucus, but this still left the Tories five seats short of a majority. Clark however decided that he would govern as if he had a majority, and refused to grant the small Socred official party status, form a coalition, or co-operate with the party in any way.

Clark was unable to accomplish much in office because of the tenuous situation of his minority government. However, historians have credited Clark&#x27;s government with making access to information legislation a priority. The Clark government introduced Bill C-15, the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, which established a broad right of access to government records, an elaborate scheme of exemptions, and a two-stage review process. The legislation was debated at second reading at the end of November 1979 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Within days the minority Conservative government was unseated; the legislation died on the order paper. The re-elected Trudeau government subsequently based its &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; on the Clark government&#x27;s Bill C-15. The &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; received royal assent in July 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The public now has the legal right of access to government records in some 150 federal departments and agencies.

Though the election had been held in May, Parliament did not resume sitting until October, one of the longest break periods in Confederation. The gas tax in the budget soured Clark&#x27;s relationship with Ontario Premier Bill Davis, even though both were Red Tories. 

During the campaign, Clark committed to move Canada&#x27;s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and re-affirmed this promise shortly after taking office. The move proved somewhat contentious within the cabinet, in part due to economic concerns that might have come about from the move. Moreover, it proved a perilous situation as moving the embassy risked a negative economic response, or a violent one from terrorists, and not doing so would make Clark look indecisive. Ultimately, the Clark government backed off from doing so on October 29, 1979, until Jerusalem&#x27;s status could be clarified with Israel&#x27;s neighbors. 

Internationally, Clark represented Canada in June 1979 at the 5th G7 summit in Tokyo. Clark reportedly had a good relationship with US President Jimmy Carter, who phoned Clark to thank him personally for his role in the Canadian Caper.

===Fall of government===
During the 1979 election campaign, Clark had promised to cut taxes to stimulate the economy. However, once in office, the 1979 budget he proposed was designed to curb inflation by slowing economic activity. The budget also proposed a 4-cent per litre (18-cent per gallon) tax on gasoline in order to reduce the budgetary deficit. Finance Minister John Crosbie touted the budget as &quot;short term pain for long term gain&quot;. Though Clark had hoped this change in policy would work to his advantage, it actually earned him widespread animosity as a politician who could not keep his promises, even in such a short period.

Clark&#x27;s refusal to work with the Socreds, combined with the gasoline tax, came back to haunt him when the budget came before the House of Commons in December 1979. On December 12, NDP Finance Critic Bob Rae proposed a subamendment to the budget motion, stating that the House of Commons did not approve of the budget. The Liberals supported the NDP subamendment. The five Socred MPs had demanded the gas tax revenues be allocated to Quebec and abstained when Clark turned them down. On December 13, the subamendment passed on a 139–133 vote.

Clark was criticized for his &quot;inability to do math&quot; in failing to predict the outcome, not only because he was in a minority situation, but also because three members of his caucus would be absent for the crucial budget vote. One was ill and two were stuck abroad on official business. The Liberals by contrast had assembled their entire caucus, save one, for the occasion.

=== 1980 election===
When a new election was called, Clark expected his party would be able to defeat the demoralized and leaderless Liberals easily, since Trudeau had announced his intention to step aside and the Liberals had yet to hold a leadership convention. However, the Progressive Conservatives had misjudged the electorate, since they had not commissioned any polls since August. A November Gallup poll published eight days before the December 11 budget reported that their popularity was down from 36% during the summer to 28%, with the party 19 points behind the Liberals, giving the latter the popular support to initiate the non-confidence motion. After the government fell, Clark&#x27;s party was caught off guard when Pierre Trudeau quickly rescinded his resignation from the Liberal leadership to lead his party into the subsequent election.

Clark&#x27;s Tories campaigned under the slogan, &quot;Real change deserves a fair chance.&quot; Trudeau swept the Liberals back into power in the February 1980 election with 147 seats, against 103 for the Progressive Conservatives. Davis&#x27; criticism of the gas tax was used in the Liberals&#x27; Ontario television ads. The Tories lost 19 seats in that province, which ultimately proved to be decisive in the campaign.

Clark&#x27;s government would last a total of nine months less a day. As Clark&#x27;s Finance Minister, John Crosbie, famously described it in his own inimitable way: &quot;Long enough to conceive, just not long enough to deliver.&quot;

===Supreme Court appointments===
Clark chose Julien Chouinard to be appointed as a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General, who served from September 24, 1979, to February 6, 1987.

===Relationship between Trudeau and Clark===
Trudeau commented in his memoirs, published in 1993, that Clark was much more tough and aggressive than past Tory leader Robert Stanfield, noting that those qualities served Clark well in his party winning the 1979 election victory. Trudeau also complimented Clark as a respectable leader and a better choice over Brian Mulroney, who had defeated Clark at the leadership convention in 1983. Trudeau told his friends that the Tories had chosen the wrong man.

==Opposition leader, 1980–1983==
Opposition to Clark&#x27;s leadership began to grow after the fall of the PC minority government, and the party&#x27;s defeat by a resurgent Liberal Party. There were frequent rumors that several potential challengers were covertly undermining Clark&#x27;s leadership. Though in 1982 Brian Mulroney deliberately appeared at a press conference with Clark to say that he was not seeking the leadership of the PC party, he was in fact conspiring to oust Clark.

The Liberal Party had regained national prominence by leading the &quot;No&quot; side to victory in the 1980 Quebec referendum and the Constitution patriation. While Trudeau&#x27;s National Energy Program was hugely unpopular in Western Canada, especially Alberta, it was able to shore up Liberal support in the voter-rich Eastern Canada, particularly Ontario and Quebec, generally having the opposite effect of Clark&#x27;s proposed gas tax. Difficult budgets and the economic recession resulted in Trudeau&#x27;s approval ratings declining after the bounce from the 1982 Constitution patriation and showed his party headed for certain defeat by early 1984, prompting him to retire. However, Clark was unable to stay on as Progressive Conservative leader long enough to regain the Prime Ministership.

On February 28, 1981, during the party&#x27;s national convention, 33.5% of the delegates supported a leadership review; they felt that Clark would not be able to lead the party to victory again but Clark considered two thirds of delegates voting no to be an endorsement. At the January 1983 convention in Winnipeg, 33.1% supported a review. This was also considering that the governing Liberals under Pierre Trudeau were slipping in polls, and although the PCs had built up a substantial lead in popularity, Trudeau was expected to retire before the election and a new Liberal leader could have been able to pull off a victory. Moreover, some in the party felt Clark to be too liberal and would be a liability come election time.

===1983 leadership convention===
In 1983, after declaring that an endorsement by 66.9% of delegates at the party&#x27;s biennial convention was not enough, Clark called a leadership convention to decide the issue. (In December 2007, German-Canadian businessman and lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber told the House of Commons Ethics Committee that he and other Germans, including Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss, and Austrian-Canadian entrepreneur Walter Wolf, had contributed significant funds to finance Quebec delegates to vote against Clark at Winnipeg, denying him the mandate he sought. A public inquiry on these matters, and on other business dealings between Mulroney and Schreiber, was called for early 2008 by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. This led further to the 2009 Oliphant Commission.

Clark immediately nominated to keep his leader&#x27;s post, and retained support from most of the Red Tories and other party members who were opposed to the public attacks on his leadership by others in the party. Clark already had most of a campaign team up and running by the time he called the leadership convention, as he had mobilized support to help gain in the convention&#x27;s leadership review. However, Mulroney and John Crosbie had been laying the groundwork for a campaign for some time, with Crosbie expecting Clark to lose or resign soon, and Mulroney supportive of the anti-Clark movement.

In a rematch of the 1976 convention, Mulroney emerged as the main challenger, gaining the support of the party&#x27;s right wing, which viewed Clark as too progressive and opposed his continued leadership. Other party members felt that the federal Liberal Party&#x27;s stranglehold on Quebec seats (they held all but one of the province&#x27;s 75 seats) could only be broken by a native from that province, which gave Mulroney considerable support. Media coverage emphasized the pro-business and neo-liberal bent of most of the candidates as a &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot; within the PC party from their more classical conservative and moderate elements. Clark&#x27;s campaign countered this by trying to polarize the election between right wingers and a centrist who had been able to win before. The Mulroney campaign responded by continuing their pro-business line.

Several candidates agreed to an &quot;ABC&quot; (Anybody But Clark) strategy for the convention and when news of that back-room deal broke out, support was expected to rally around the party&#x27;s embattled leader. During delegate voting, Clark won the first ballot, but only won 36.5% of the vote, well short of the 50% required. His support dwindled over the next two ballots. Mulroney, who was endorsed by all but two candidates, defeated Clark on the fourth ballot. Clark urged his supporters to leave the convention united behind Mulroney, and agreed to serve under him.

Many political observers and analysts have questioned Clark&#x27;s rationale for the decision. One famous incident involved a 1987 official dinner held for Prince Charles at Rideau Hall. When the Prince met Clark in the receiving line at the function, he asked to Clark: &quot;why wasn&#x27;t two thirds enough?&quot; Clark&#x27;s wife, Maureen McTeer, elaborated on Clark&#x27;s decision in her 2003 autobiography, &quot;In My Own Name&quot;. McTeer suggested that for her husband, anything less than a 75% endorsement would not have been a clear enough mandate to forge onwards from the party membership. Clark feared that the 34% of PC members who did not support him would become his most vocal critics in the upcoming election campaign, and that his continued leadership would have led to fractures in the party. Clark was convinced that he could win another leadership race and gain a clear level of support, once his qualities were compared against the handful of politically inexperienced challengers who coveted his position and who were covertly undermining his leadership.

==Member of Mulroney cabinet==

===Secretary of State for External Affairs (Minister of Foreign Affairs)===

The Progressive Conservatives, led by Mulroney, went on to win a huge victory in the 1984 election, and Mulroney became prime minister.

Despite their personal differences, Clark ably served in Mulroney&#x27;s cabinet as the Secretary of State for External Affairs, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs was known before 1993.

Some of Clark&#x27;s accomplishments and bold moves in this role included:
*convincing Mulroney to recommend the appointment of Stephen Lewis as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations – who later became the UN special envoy on the AIDS crisis; many believe Lewis&#x27; appointment was Clark&#x27;s price to serve under Mulroney;
*in 1984, being the very first developed nation foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated Ethiopia to lead the Western response to the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia; Canada&#x27;s response was overwhelming, and led the United States and Great Britain to follow suit almost immediately – an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs to that time, since Ethiopia had a Marxist one-party state and had previously been wholly isolated by &quot;the West&quot;;
*taking a strong stand against apartheid and for economic sanctions against South Africa at a time when Canadian allies Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher opposed such sanctions;
*taking a strong stand against American intervention in Nicaragua;
*accepting refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala;
*managing nonetheless to maintain extremely strong ties with the US, helping steer the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations to a final agreement.

During his term as External Affairs minister, Clark championed Canada&#x27;s unabashed disapproval of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Canada was the only G7 nation to take such a resolute stance against the apartheid regime during the 1980s. He also took on the difficult Constitution ministerial portfolio after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, and vigorously pursued his task.

Clark maintained Canada&#x27;s independent voice politically and socially at a time of increasing economic integration with the US and the rise of more socially conservative right-wing politics there.

===Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs===

Clark later served as the President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

With Quebec&#x27;s constitutional status within Canada a rising issue, he shifted to become the Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs. The latter position saw him play a leading role in the drafting of the Charlottetown Accord, which was decisively rejected in a nationwide referendum and further hurt the standing of the PC party in polls.

===First retirement from Canadian politics===
Clark retired from politics in 1993, side-stepping the near annihilation of the PC party in the 1993 election under the leadership of Mulroney&#x27;s successor Kim Campbell.

Clark was appointed as Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Cyprus from 1993 to 1996. In 1993, he founded his own consulting firm, Joe Clark and Associates, Ltd., which he still heads. Clark has also served on the boards of directors or advisory boards of several Canadian companies.

During the 1993–1994 academic year, Clark served as a Regents&#x27; Lecturer in the Canadian Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1994, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Also in 1994, he wrote the book &quot;A Nation Too Good to Lose: Renewing the Purpose of Canada&quot;. This book was also published in a French translation.

The 1995 Quebec referendum saw the federal side win by less than one percent of the vote. It was widely seen as being the failure of the Charlottetown and prior Meech Lake accords that had caused it to be so close.

==Progressive Conservative leadership, 1998–2003==
One of the two PC candidates to survive the 1993 wipe-out, Jean Charest, became leader of the PC party following Campbell&#x27;s resignation. After leading the party to a modest resurgence in the 1997 election, winning 20 seats, Charest bowed to tremendous public pressure and left federal politics to become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party (unaffiliated with the federal Liberals). The party had no obvious candidate to fill Charest&#x27;s shoes, and turned to Clark once again in 1998. He was elected by a teleconference of PC members from around the country in which each of the party&#x27;s riding associations was allocated 100 points. The points for each riding were then assigned on the basis of each candidate&#x27;s share of votes within each riding association. Clark defeated Hugh Segal, free-trade opponent David Orchard, former Manitoba cabinet minister Brian Pallister, and future Senator Michael Fortier for the leadership of the PC Party.

It took two years for Clark to return to Parliament. He was elected for Kings—Hants, Nova Scotia, in a by-election on September 11, 2000, after the incumbent MP, Scott Brison, stood down in his favour. This is common practice when a newly elected party leader does not already have a seat in Parliament. For the general election held two months later, Clark yielded Kings-Hants back to Brison and was elected as the MP for Calgary Centre, by then deep in the heart of Canadian Alliance territory.

Clark ran on his previous experience as prime minister and External Affairs Minister. However, he faced a difficult task, with critics and opponents attacking him and the PC Party as a &quot;vote for the past&quot;. Jean Chrétien&#x27;s governing Liberals were running on their successful economic record, and they were poised to regain the support that they lost in 1997, threatening the PC&#x27;s 1997 gains in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces. The PC party lost ground in Quebec (due in part to the departure of Jean Charest to provincial politics), which resulted in three members of the PC caucus defecting to join the Liberal Party prior to the election. However, Clark was judged by audiences to be the best speaker during the 2000 election debates. The party lost seats to the Liberals, though it managed to hang onto the minimum 12 seats necessary to be recognized in the House of Commons as an official party and therefore qualify for research funding, committee memberships, and minimum speaking privileges. Aside from Clark&#x27;s Calgary seat (one of only three Alberta seats that did not go to the Canadian Alliance), and one each in Manitoba and Quebec, the party&#x27;s seats were concentrated in Tory bastions in the Atlantic provinces. Clark continually promoted the idea that the PCs would eventually retake Ontario and form a federal government again. His vision for the party was one that was to the left of the Alliance, but to the right of the Liberals.

He soon realized that there was no chance of dislodging the Liberals as long as the centre-right remained split. However, he wanted a merger on his terms. He got his chance in 2001, when several dissident Alliance MPs, the most prominent one being Alliance deputy leader and party matriarch Deborah Grey, left the Alliance caucus. The dissidents felt that Alliance leader Stockwell Day had not learned from mistakes made in the last election. While some of them rejoined the Alliance later, seven of them, led by Chuck Strahl of British Columbia and including Grey, refused and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. The DRC quickly formed a joint caucus with the Tories with Clark as leader.

This lasted until 2002, when Stephen Harper ousted Day as Alliance leader. Harper wanted a closer union with the PCs, but Clark turned the offer down in April 2002, and all but two of the DRC members rejoined the Alliance. One of the two, Inky Mark, eventually joined the PCs. Two by-election victories later in 2002 increased the PC caucus to 15 members and fourth place in the Commons.

Clark was selected by the media and many parliamentarians for three years in a row to be Canada&#x27;s most effective opposition leader between 2000 and 2002, pursuing the Liberal government on issues such as Shawinigate and the Groupaction scandal. In his final mandate, Jean Chrétien repeatedly referred to Clark as the Leader of the Opposition (Clark was not), much to the chagrin of the Canadian Alliance politicians who occupied the Opposition Leader&#x27;s chair during the same period. Indeed, Chrétien and Clark had been fellow parliamentarians since the 1970s and they shared a mutual respect despite sitting on opposite benches.

Clark&#x27;s personal popularity grew as, once again, scandal enveloped Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal government. Clark was widely trusted by Canadians, but this, in his own words, did not translate into more votes and additional seats. Citing this, Clark announced his intention to step down as PC leader on August 6, 2002, at the PC Party&#x27;s Edmonton policy convention. It was expected that a pro-Alliance merger candidate would succeed Clark, but Clark was instead replaced by Peter MacKay on May 31, 2003. MacKay had signed a controversial deal with Red Tory rival David Orchard, promising not to merge the PC Party with the Alliance. Clark had always encouraged MacKay to keep Orchard and his followers within the PC camp.

MacKay immediately reversed his position on seeking a merger, and in 2003, 90% of PC Party delegates voted in favor of a merger with the Canadian Alliance. Orchard unsuccessfully tried to block the merger and later joined the Liberal Party.

===Legacy of second PC leadership===
In May 2003, the party finally overtook the New Democratic Party as the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons, after by-election wins in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario.

At the same time, the party was still $10 million in debt from the 2000 election. The PC Party&#x27;s membership had also dropped from 100,000 in 1998 to 45,000 card carrying PCs in May 2003. Clark&#x27;s leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was also the subject of criticism from many United Alternative supporters, who argued that his staunch opposition to a merger with the Reform/Alliance parties helped divide the &quot;conservative&quot; vote during the tenure of Jean Chrétien. Some critics accused Clark of being more interested in helping the interests of his own party and own career than the Canadian conservative movement in general. Others attacked Clark&#x27;s goal of the PC party regaining its former power as unrealistic.

==Progressive Conservative–Canadian Alliance merger==
On December 8, 2003, the day that the PC Party and the Canadian Alliance were dissolved and the new Conservative Party of Canada registered, Clark was one of three MPs—the other two were André Bachand and John Herron—to announce that they would not join the new caucus. MP Scott Brison had already joined the Liberals.

Clark announced that he would continue to sit for the remainder of the session as an independent Progressive Conservative MP, and retired from Parliament at the end of the session.

Later, Clark openly criticized the new Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2004 election. He gave a tepid endorsement to the Liberal Party in the 2004 election, calling Paul Martin &quot;the devil we know&quot;. He criticized the new Conservative Party as an &quot;Alliance take-over&quot;, and speculated that eastern Canada would not accept the new party or its more socially conservative policies against gay marriage and abortion. Clark endorsed former NDP leader Ed Broadbent and other Liberals and Conservatives as individuals, saying that the most important thing was to have &quot;the strongest possible House of Commons of Canada&quot; since neither large party offered much hope. Clark was criticized by some for dismissing the new Conservative Party outright rather than helping to steer it towards a moderate path.

==Post-politics, 2004–present==

Clark continues to apply his experience in foreign affairs. Clark served as Public Policy Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He served as Distinguished Statesman in Residence, School of International Service, and Senior Fellow, Center for North American Studies, both at the American University, Washington, D.C. In addition to teaching classes at the American University in Washington, Clark has written several op-ed pieces for several of Canada&#x27;s national newspapers since his retirement. In October 2006, Clark took a position at McGill University as a professor of Practice for Public-Private Sector Partnerships at the McGill Institute for the Study of International Development. He serves with the Jimmy Carter Center, routinely travelling overseas as part of the centre&#x27;s international observing activities.

Joe Clark is vice-chairman and a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization that works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them. He is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.

Clark sat on the International Advisory Board of Governors of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, before 2012.

Clark was attacked while walking down the street in Montreal in mid-November 2007. The attacker first asked him if he was the former prime minister, and when Clark answered that he was, the man struck him and fled. Clark sustained a bloody nose but was not seriously hurt.

He published the book &quot;How We Lead: Canada in a Century of Change&quot; in 2013.

In March 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Clark special envoy for Canada&#x27;s bid for a UN Security Council seat. Clark travelled to Algeria, Bahrain, Qatar and Egypt in an effort to seek votes for Canada.

==Honours==



As a former prime minister, Clark is entitled to carry &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; designation for life. Clark was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He is a member of the Alberta Order of Excellence. He was honoured as Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre de la Pleiade from La Francophonie. He also holds the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977), 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal (1992), Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002), Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012) and the Alberta Centennial Medal (2005). Clark was the first recipient of the Vimy Award. He is Honorary Chief Bald Eagle of the Samson Cree Nation.

In 2004, Clark&#x27;s lifetime achievements were recognized with the Award for Excellence in the Cause of Parliamentary Democracy by Canada&#x27;s Churchill Society for the Advancement of Parliamentary Democracy.

On Tuesday, May 27, 2008, Clark&#x27;s official parliamentary portrait was unveiled during a reception ceremony to be hung in Centre Block alongside Canada&#x27;s past prime ministers.

In a 1999 survey of Canadian historians Clark was ranked No.15 out of the first 20 prime ministers through Jean Chrétien. The survey was used in the book &quot;Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada&#x27;s Leaders&quot; by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer.

École Joe Clark School in High River, Alberta, is named in honour of Clark.

<text>The Sinclair C5 is a small one-person battery electric recumbent tricycle, technically an &quot;electrically assisted pedal cycle&quot;. It was the culmination of Sir Clive Sinclair&#x27;s long-running interest in electric vehicles. Although widely described as an &quot;electric car&quot;, Sinclair characterised it as a &quot;vehicle, not a car&quot;.

Sinclair had become one of the UK&#x27;s best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, on the back of the highly successful Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but the development of the follow-up C10 and C15 models never progressed further than the drawing board, mostly due to the poor public response to the C5.

On 10 January 1985, the C5 was unveiled at a glitzy launch event, but it was received less than enthusiastically by the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations. The vehicle&#x27;s limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only , a battery that ran down quickly and a lack of weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people&#x27;s needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair&#x27;s optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.

The C5 has been described as &quot;one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry&quot; and a &quot;notorious ... example of failure&quot;. Despite its commercial failure, the C5 went on to become a cult item for collectors. Thousands of unsold C5s were purchased by investors and sold for hugely inflated prices, as much as £6,000 compared to the original retail value of £399. Enthusiasts have established owners&#x27; clubs and some have modified their vehicles substantially, adding bigger wheels, jet engines, and high-powered electric motors to propel their C5s at speeds of up to .

==Design==
The C5 is made predominantly of polypropylene, measuring long, wide, and high. It weighs approximately without a battery and with one. The chassis consists of a single Y-shaped steel component with a cross-section of about The vehicle has three wheels, one of diameter at the front and two of at the rear.

The driver sits in a recumbent position in an open cockpit, steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees. A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on the handlebar. As a supplement to or replacement for electric power, the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit. The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is . At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres (1 cu ft). As the C5 does not have a reverse gear, reversing direction is done by getting out, picking up the front end and turning it around by hand.

The C5 is powered by a 12-volt lead–acid electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor would not be able to move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair&#x27;s tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor&#x27;s load is constantly monitored by the C5&#x27;s electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.

Although it was usually billed as an electric vehicle, the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power. The vehicle&#x27;s battery is designed to provide 35 amps for an hour when fully charged or half that for two hours, giving the C5 a claimed range of . A display in the cockpit uses green, amber, and red LEDs to display the state of the battery charge. The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left. The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left, after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals. Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.

The C5 was initially sold at a cost of £399, but to keep the cost under the £400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories. These included indicator lights, mirrors, mud flaps, a horn, and a &quot;High-Vis Mast&quot; consisting of a reflective strip on a pole, designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic. Sinclair&#x27;s C5 accessories brochure noted that &quot;the British climate isn&#x27;t always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving&quot; and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle&#x27;s open cockpit. Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.

==History==

===Origins===
Sir Clive Sinclair&#x27;s interest in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solartron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was the head of his own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.

Sinclair took the view that an electric vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor was the key to the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child&#x27;s scooter, with a button on the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair&#x27;s development of the first &quot;slimline&quot; pocket calculator – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for most of the rest of the 1970s.

===Early development: the C1===
It was not until late 1979 that Sinclair returned to electric vehicle development. Around Christmas that year, he approached Tony Wood Rogers, an ex-Radionics employee, to carry out consultancy work on &quot;a preliminary investigation into a personal electric vehicle&quot;. The brief was to assess the options for producing a one-person vehicle which would be a replacement for a moped and would have a maximum speed of . Although Wood Rogers was initially reluctant, he was intrigued by the idea of an electric vehicle and agreed to help Sinclair. The vehicle was dubbed the C1 (the C standing for Clive). He built a number of prototypes to demonstrate various design principles and clarify the final specifications.

A specification of the C1 emerged by the end of the year. It would address short-distance transportation needs, with a minimum range of on a fully charged battery. This reflected official figures showing that the average daily car journey was only , while the average moped or pedal cycle journey was just . The users were envisaged as being housewives, urban commuters, and young people, who might otherwise use cycles or mopeds to travel. The electric vehicle would be safer, more weather-proof, and would offer space to carry items. It would be easy to drive and park and for the driver to enter or exit, and it would require minimum maintenance. The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using injection-moulded plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing £500 () at the most.

One area of development that Sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology. Electric vehicles powered by lead–acid batteries had once actually outnumbered internal combustion engine vehicles; in 1912 nearly 34,000 electric cars were registered in the U.S. However, the efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly, leading to petrol and diesel-driven vehicles dominating the market. By 1978, out of 17.6 million registered vehicles on Britain&#x27;s roads, only 45,000 were electric vehicles in day-to-day use and of those, 90% were milkfloats. Sinclair chose to rely on existing lead–acid battery technology, avoiding the great expense of developing a more efficient type. His rationale was that if the electric vehicle market took off, battery manufacturers would step up to develop better batteries. Wood Rogers recalls:

The development programme moved to the University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised at an early stage that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle&#x27;s efficiency. By March 1982, the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle&#x27;s approach was not to Sinclair&#x27;s liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair&#x27;s desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair that it would not be fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.

To meet the steadily escalating development costs of the vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling some of his own shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles&#x27; new head office was established in Coventry in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.

The project&#x27;s prospects were boosted by changes in the British government&#x27;s approach to electric vehicles. In March 1980, it had abolished Vehicle Excise Duty for electric vehicles and by the start of 1983, the Department of Transport was working on legislation that would introduce a new category of vehicle – the &quot;electrically assisted pedal cycle&quot;. This had a number of significant advantages from Sinclair&#x27;s point of view. Such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax, and the user would not need a driving licence or a helmet, all of which were required for mopeds. The legislation, which was passed in August 1983, was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as Raleigh who wanted to sell electric bicycles.

Sinclair realised that his electric vehicle design could easily be adapted to meet the new legislation. As the &quot;electrically assisted pedal cycle&quot; category was so new, there were no existing vehicles on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation. However, it imposed a number of restrictions that limited the performance of any vehicle that would qualify under the new standards. The maximum legal speed of the vehicle would be limited to only ; it could not weigh any more than , including the battery; and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts.

Despite these limitations, the vehicle was seen as only the first step in a series of increasingly ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist. However, Sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle; as the director of the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage &quot;purely on the convictions of Sir Clive&quot;.

===Development and design===

With Sinclair&#x27;s new specifications in hand, Ogle worked on a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle&#x27;s handlebar steering was the brainchild of Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver to get in and out easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that &quot;putting the bars at the driver&#x27;s sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural&quot;. A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle&#x27;s detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association&#x27;s proving ground in Leicestershire.

Further aerodynamic refinements were carried out in Exeter with the development of new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle&#x27;s drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell&#x27;s appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair&#x27;s Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats&#x27; first project but, as he later said, &quot;day one of my working life&quot;, when he turned up at Sinclair&#x27;s premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a &quot;proper&quot; electric car. He said later that he thought &quot;the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features.&quot; Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, &quot;asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications ...&quot;. It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as &quot;convert[ing] an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device&quot;.

The chassis of the C5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Philips. Although it was later said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5&#x27;s electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead–acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.

The bodywork was made from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was &quot;one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world&quot;. The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair&#x27;s ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The two parts of the shell were joined by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe&#x27;s most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this did not happen, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant&#x27;s closure.

Instead, the work of assembling the C5 was given to The Hoover Company in the spring of 1983. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) approached Hoover to ask them if they would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, &quot;who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly.&quot; The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at Merthyr Tydfil, situated in the economically depressed South Wales Valleys. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair&#x27;s projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover&#x27;s plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.

===Production, distribution and support===
The C5 was produced in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work was carried out by a small team of people in a sealed room, but as production ramped up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by a tunnel. A rolling testing stand was located at the end of the production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing and the vehicle&#x27;s brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.

Distribution centres were set up in Hayes in Middlesex, Preston in Lancashire and Oxford to handle the C5s. Hoover arranged for 19 of its service offices around the UK – responsible for maintaining customers&#x27; vacuum cleaners and washing machines – to also maintain C5s and provide spare parts. The C5&#x27;s major consumable item, the battery, was to be supported by 300 branches of Comet and Woolworths.

Hoover trained its engineers to produce C5s and tested its manufacturing processes by assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s. Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured. Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover were capable of producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.

===Launch===

The news of Sinclair&#x27;s C5 project came as a surprise when it became public and attracted considerable interest, as well as scepticism. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported in June 1983 that carmakers were &quot;startled&quot; but cautious about Sinclair&#x27;s prospects; as one competitor put it, &quot;If it were anyone but Sinclair, we&#x27;d say he was bonkers&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; asked, &quot;Can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers, and could double it on flatscreen televisions, be that crazy?&quot; and wondered whether he was &quot;making a ghastly mistake&quot;, a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely.

The C5 was launched on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair&#x27;s usual glitzy style, with women handing out press packs and a variety of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by women dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.

Sinclair issued a glossy sales brochure characterising the vehicle as a part of an ongoing exercise in &quot;cutting giants down to size, turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants&quot;. The brochure highlighted Sinclair&#x27;s achievements in producing affordable pocket calculators, home computers, and pocket televisions and declared, &quot;with the C5, Sinclair Vehicles puts personal, private transport back where it belongs – in the hands of the individual.&quot; The photographs accompanying the text showed housewives and teenagers driving the C5 to shops, railway stations, and sports fields – in the words of technology writers Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy, &quot;a blue-sky suburbia exclusively populated by electric trikes and their drivers&quot;.

The press was given an opportunity to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, &quot;an unqualified disaster&quot;. A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called the C5 a &quot;Formula One bath-chair&quot;; its reporter &quot;had travelled five yards outdoors when everything went phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, while &quot;Your Computer&quot; found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: &quot;The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive &quot;peep, peep&quot; noise signalling that the engine had overheated.&quot; Even the former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that while he had started out well, &quot;a jaunty smile on [his] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath&quot;, he ran into problems when he reached a hill: &quot;It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating.&quot;

The timing and location of the launch event – in the middle of winter, on the top of a snow- and ice-covered hill – later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; called it &quot;the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle&quot;. Sinclair&#x27;s biographer Rodney Dale describes it as &quot;a calculated (or miscalculated) risk&quot;, observing that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and &quot;the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day&quot;. He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 &quot;as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good&quot;. Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair&#x27;s development funds were running low.

===Reviews===

It soon became apparent that the C5 faced more serious problems with public perception than merely a botched launch event. Media reactions to the C5 were generally negative when the first reviews appeared over the following days. As the &quot;Financial Times&quot; observed, &quot;the few hardy journalists who ventured out on the roads returned shivering and dubious about the C5&#x27;s abilities in such harsh conditions.&quot;

A common concern was that it was simply too vulnerable in traffic. &quot;Your Computer&quot; commented that &quot;a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; motoring correspondent wrote of her &quot;grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic ... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver&#x27;s sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic.&quot; Another &quot;Guardian&quot; writer wrote that he &quot;would not want to drive [the] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut&#x27;s tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me.&quot; Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5&#x27;s industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver&#x27;s seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.

As teenagers were among the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy&#x27;s words) &quot;packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s&quot;. The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of &quot;kids us[ing] them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down.&quot; Sinclair dismissed such concerns – &quot;I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these&quot;. Teenagers interviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it was fun to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.

Sinclair&#x27;s claims to have revolutionised the electric vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers; &quot;Your Computer&quot; called the C5 &quot;more of a toy than the &#x27;ideal solution for all types of local journey&#x27; which the brochure claims&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; motoring correspondent also characterised it as &quot;a delightful toy&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;a cleverly-designed &#x27;fun&#x27; machine that can hardly be regarded as serious, everyday all-weather transport&quot;, while &quot;The Engineer&quot; viewed it as &quot;a smashing big boy&#x27;s toy, tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for the Sunday papers&quot;.

On the plus side, the C5&#x27;s handling characteristics were praised by reviewers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;very easy to master once you have become familiar with the under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; described the arrangement as &quot;surprisingly easy&quot; to master, although it cautioned that &quot;on full speed and on full lock it&#x27;s very easy to tip it onto two wheels.&quot; The &quot;Daily Express&quot; motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 &quot;stable, comfortable and easy to handle&quot;.

The verdict from motoring organisations, road safety groups, and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed the C5&#x27;s fate. The British Safety Council (BSC) tested the C5 at Sinclair Vehicles&#x27; headquarters in Warwick and issued a highly critical report to its 32,000 members. Sinclair was furious and announced that he would sue the BSC and its chairman, James Tye, for defamation (although nothing came of it) after Tye told the press: &quot;I am shattered that within a few days 14-year-old children will be allowed to drive on the road in this Doodle Bug without a licence ... without insurance and without any form of training.&quot; Several years later, Tye was happy to take responsibility for the C5&#x27;s failure, describing himself as &quot;the man entirely to blame for the failure of the Sinclair C5&quot;.

===Sales history===

Despite the problems of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5&#x27;s short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; fewer than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair&#x27;s computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.

The C5&#x27;s users were an eclectic group. They included holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one to drive around Kensington Palace before they were old enough to drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as &quot;The Times&quot; reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle&#x27;s limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.

Although the C5 reached retail stores at the start of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of teenagers to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;we haven&#x27;t done ... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off.&quot; Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for &quot;a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting&quot;. Matters did not improve; three decades later, the C5&#x27;s failure was attributed in &quot;Wallpaper&quot; to there being no market, insofar as &quot;global warming hadn&#x27;t been invented then&quot;. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.

Adding to Sinclair&#x27;s problems, production of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing the performance of their vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles. Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to &quot;adjust stocks&quot; in the light of the C5&#x27;s poor sales. When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.

Sinclair tried to put a brave face on it, admitting that &quot;sales have not been entirely up to expectations&quot; but claiming to be &quot;confident of a high level of demand for the vehicle&quot;. A spokesman told the media that &quot;we expect a rapid rise in sales now that the weather is improving&quot;. Possible sales opportunities were explored in mainland Europe, Asia, and the United States, with Sinclair claiming that he had found &quot;very big&quot; levels of interest. Hoover were sufficiently persuaded to allow Sinclair to divert 10 of their employees to modify C5s for overseas export. The bid to sell the C5 abroad failed; the Dutch National Transport Service told Sinclair that the C5 was not suitable for Dutch roads without improvements to its braking system, the addition of more reflectors, and the inclusion of the High-Vis Mast as part of the basic package. Most of the other ten countries that Sinclair inquired of demanded similar changes.

The C5&#x27;s reputation received a further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations. The Automobile Association questioned many of Sinclair&#x27;s claims in a report published at the start of May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about rather than the promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5&#x27;s battery ran flat after only on a cold day. The C5&#x27;s running speed was more usually around than the claimed , while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped. The stability, general roadworthiness, and especially the safety of the C5 were questioned, and the AA suggested that the High-Vis Mast should be included as part of the standard package. It concluded:

The Consumers&#x27; Association published a critical report on the C5 in the June issue of its magazine &quot;Which?&quot;, concluding that the vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money. All three of the C5s that it tested broke down with a &quot;major gearbox fault&quot; and their High-Vis Masts snapped. The longest run between battery charges was only , and a more realistic achievable range was . It also echoed the AA&#x27;s concerns about the C5&#x27;s safety and the omission of the High-Vis Mast from the standard package. The magazine also called the C5 &quot;too easy to steal&quot;, hardly surprising considering that while a security lock could be used to prevent it being driven away, the C5 was light enough that a would-be thief could simply pick it up and carry it off.

As the summer of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 remained far below Sinclair&#x27;s predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In the middle of that month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company&#x27;s claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle&#x27;s price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 but by the end of the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.

Production was terminated in August 1985, by which time 14,000 C5s had been assembled. Cashflow problems caused by the paucity of sales caused relations to break down between Sinclair Vehicles and Hoover. In June 1985, Hoover obtained a writ against Sinclair for unpaid debts of over £1.5 million, relating to work carried out over the previous eight months. It did not actually serve the writ but entered negotiations with Sinclair. In mid-August, it publicly announced that it was ceasing production of the C5. A Sinclair spokesman told the media that the halt in production was &quot;due to a shortage of certain components which are unable to be re-ordered while a financial settlement is pending. Once this has been concluded production is envisaged to recommence.&quot;

===Demise of Sinclair Vehicles===

Production did not recommence and the Hoover production line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles changed its name to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company&#x27;s hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.

On 5 November, TPD was formally liquidated at a creditors&#x27; meeting. It was revealed, to the anger of the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.

Many reasons have been suggested for the failure of Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls &quot;the jigsaw of the C5&#x27;s disappointment&quot;. One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: &quot;It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything.&quot; Ellar&#x27;s director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles&#x27; remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as &quot;a sophisticated toy&quot;: &quot;If you were a little boy, wouldn&#x27;t you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?&quot; His strategy was successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.

Some commentators attributed the C5&#x27;s failure to problems with Sinclair&#x27;s marketing strategy; only a year after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper called it &quot;one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry&quot;. Andrew P. Marks of Paisley College of Technology criticised Sinclair&#x27;s marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a suburban road, and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be &quot;trying to grasp at two different markets&quot; but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks&#x27; view, as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.

The design researcher and academic Nigel Cross calls the C5 a &quot;notorious ... example of failure&quot; and describes its basic concept as &quot;wrong&quot;. He said the marketing research for the C5 was carried out &quot;after&quot; the vehicle&#x27;s concept had already been decided, observing that it appears to have been intended &quot;mainly to aid promotion&quot; rather than to guide development. Gus Desbarats, the C5&#x27;s industrial designer, attributes the vehicle&#x27;s flawed concept to Sinclair operating in a &quot;bubble&quot; and believes that Sinclair &quot;failed to understand the difference between a new market, computing, and a mature one, transport, where there were more benchmarks to compare against&quot;. He comments that the experience of working on the C5 convinced him of the need for industrial designers such as himself to get &quot;involved early in the innovation process, shaping basic configurations, never again [being] satisfied to simply decorate a fundamentally bad idea&quot;.

Sinclair himself said in 2005 that the C5 &quot;was early for what it was. People reacted negatively and the press didn&#x27;t help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press.&quot; Sam Dawson of &quot;Classic and Sport Car Magazine&quot; described the C5 as &quot;incredibly fun to drive&quot;, suggesting that the safety concerns &quot;could have been addressed if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that it was already doomed as a national joke.&quot; He noted the disconnect between the media&#x27;s expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called &quot;just a fun way of getting around&quot;. Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: &quot;In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren&#x27;t used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future.&quot;

===Sinclair&#x27;s other electric vehicles===

Sinclair envisaged producing follow-up vehicles such as the C10, a two-seater city car, and the C15, a three-seater capable of travelling at . As Wills put it at the launch event, &quot;We&#x27;re developing a family of traffic-compatible, quiet, economic and pollution-free vehicles for the end of the &#x27;80s.&quot; The C5 was described as &quot;the baby of the family&quot;. The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, &quot;it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too.&quot; The design is strikingly similar to the modern Renault Twizy electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that &quot;you could put the C10 into production today and it would still look contemporary.&quot;

At the time of the C5&#x27;s launch, Sinclair described the C15 as having &quot;a futuristic design with an elongated &#x27;tear-drop&#x27; shape, a lightweight body made of self-coloured polypropylene and a single, possibly &#x27;roller&#x27; type rear wheel&quot;. It would have been launched at the 1988 International Motor Show in Birmingham following a development programme costed at £2 million. Unlike the relatively conventional technology used in the C5, Sinclair intended to use sodium sulphur batteries with four times the power-to-weight ratio of lead–acid batteries to give the C15 much greater speed and range – over on a single charge. It would have had approximately the same dimensions as a conventional small car, measuring long, high, and wide. However, it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise. In the event they did not, the project could not continue, due to thermal problems. Neither the C10 nor the C15 ever left the drawing board.

Although Sinclair went on to produce more (but much smaller) electric vehicles (including the Sinclair Zike in 1992) the C5 debacle did lasting damage to the reputation of subsequent EVs in the UK, which the media routinely compared to the C5. It was not until a highly regarded manufacturer, Toyota, launched a serious and well-received vehicle in the 1990s, the Prius, that the C5 &quot;jinx&quot; was finally laid to rest.

In 2017 Sir Clive&#x27;s nephew Grant Sinclair presented what he called an updated version of the Sinclair C5 called the Iris eTrike.

===From flop to cult===
Despite its lack of commercial success when it was first released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.

C5 owners began modifying their vehicles to achieve levels of performance far beyond anything envisaged by Sinclair. Adam Harper used one C5 as a stunt vehicle, driving it through a tunnel of fire, and adapted another to run at , aiming to break a world land speed record for a three-wheeled electric vehicle and the British record for any type of electric vehicle. He said later: &quot;Up to 100 mph [160 km/h] it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re running on rails, it&#x27;s really stable. Then at about 110 to 120 mph [180–195 km/h] it starts getting tricky. At that point if a tire blew up or something happened you would be surely dead&quot;.

As quoted in the 1987 &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; under battery powered vehicle: &quot;John W. Owen and Roy Harvey travelled 919 miles (1479 km) from John O&#x27;Groats to Land&#x27;s End in a Sinclair C5 in 103 hr 15 min on 30 Apr-4 May 1985&quot; ( average).

Chris Crosskey, an engineer from Abingdon, set a record for the longest journey completed on a C5 on a trip to Glastonbury – away (&quot;I nearly died of exhaustion&quot;) – and tried three times to drive one from Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats, a distance of . Another engineer, Adrian Bennett, fitted a jet engine to his C5, while plumber and inventor Colin Furze turned one into a &quot;monster trike&quot; with wheels and a petrol engine capable of propelling it at .

The singer John Otway has used a C5 in his stage show and publicity.

<text>Paris (), also known as Alexander (), is a mythological figure in the story of the Trojan War. He appears in numerous Greek legends and works of Ancient Greek literature such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In myth, he is prince of Troy, son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, and younger brother of Prince Hector. His elopement with Helen sparks the Trojan War, during which he 
fatally wounds Achilles.

== Name ==

The is probably of Luwian origin, and is comparable to &quot;Parizitis&quot;, attested as a Hittite scribe&#x27;s name. The name is etymologically unrelated to that of France&#x27;s capital city, derived from the Gallic Parisii tribe.

== Description ==
Paris was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;well-grown, sturdy, white, good nose, good eyes, black pupils, black hair, incipient beard, long-faced, heavy eyebrows, big mouth, charming, eloquent, agile, an accurate archer, cowardly, hedonist&quot;. Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, he was illustrated as &quot;fair, tall, and brave. His eyes were very beautiful, his hair soft and blond, his mouth charming, and his voice pleasant. He was swift, and eager to take command.&quot;

== Family ==
Paris and the nymph Oenone had a son, Corythus. By Helen, he had Bunomus, Aganus (&quot;gentle&quot;), Idaeus and a daughter also called Helen.

== Mythology ==

===Childhood===
Paris was a child of Priam and Hecuba (see the List of children of Priam). Just before his birth, his mother dreamed that she gave birth to a flaming torch. This dream was interpreted by the seer Aesacus as a foretelling of the downfall of Troy, and he declared that the child would be the ruin of his homeland. On the day of Paris&#x27;s birth, it was further announced by Aesacus that the child born of a royal Trojan that day would have to be killed to spare the kingdom, being the child that would bring about the prophecy. Though Paris was indeed born before nightfall, he was spared by Priam. Hecuba was also unable to kill the child, despite the urging of the priestess of Apollo, one Herophile. Instead, Paris&#x27;s father prevailed upon his chief herdsman, Agelaus, to remove the child and kill him. The herdsman, unable to use a weapon against the infant, left him exposed on Mount Ida, hoping he would perish there (cf. Oedipus). He was, however, suckled by a she-bear. Returning after nine days, Agelaus was astonished to find the child still alive and brought him home in a backpack (Greek &quot;pḗra&quot;, hence by folk etymology Paris&#x27;s name) to rear as his own. He returned to Priam bearing a dog&#x27;s tongue as evidence of the deed&#x27;s completion.

Paris&#x27;s noble birth was betrayed by his outstanding beauty and intelligence. While still a child, he routed a gang of cattle-thieves and restored the animals they had stolen to the herd, thereby earning the surname Alexander (&quot;protector of men&quot;). It was at this time that Oenone became Paris&#x27;s first lover. She was a nymph from Mount Ida in Phrygia. Her father was Cebren, a river-god or, according to other sources, she was the daughter of Oeneus. She was skilled in the arts of prophecy and medicine, which she had been taught by Rhea and Apollo, respectively. Through her ability to see the future, she foresaw Paris leaving her but loved him deeply even so. When Paris later left her for Helen, she told him that if he ever was wounded, he should come to her, for she could heal any injury, even the most serious wounds.

Paris&#x27;s chief distraction at this time was to pit Agelaus&#x27;s bulls against one another. One bull began to win these bouts consistently. Paris began to set it against rival herdsmen&#x27;s own prize bulls and it defeated them all. Finally, Paris offered a golden crown to any bull that could defeat his champion. Ares responded to this challenge by transforming himself into a bull and easily winning the contest. Paris gave the crown to Ares without hesitation. It was this apparent honesty in judgment that prompted the gods of Olympus to have Paris arbitrate the divine contest among Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena.

===Judgment of Paris===
In celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, Lord Zeus, father of the Greek pantheon, hosted a banquet on Mount Olympus. Every deity and demi-god had been invited, except Eris, the goddess of strife (no one wanted a troublemaker at a wedding). For revenge, Eris threw the golden Apple of Discord inscribed with &quot;For the most beautiful&quot; () into the party, provoking a squabble among the attendant goddesses over for whom it had been meant.

The goddesses thought to be the most beautiful were Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, and each one claimed the apple. They started a quarrel so they asked Zeus to choose one of them. Knowing that choosing any of them would bring him the hatred of the other two, Zeus did not want to take part in the decision. He thus appointed Paris to select the most beautiful.

Escorted by Hermes, the three goddesses bathed in the spring of Mount Ida and approached Paris as he herded his cattle. Paris was frightened at the appearance of the deities, but Hermes assured him it was the will of Zeus. Some artistic depictions have the goddesses appear unclad before the mortal. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses attempted to bribe him to choose among them. Hera offered ownership of all of Europe and Asia. Athena offered skill in battle, wisdom and the abilities of the greatest warriors. Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful woman on Earth: Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Helen and thereby Aphrodite.

However, Helen was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta (a fact Aphrodite neglected to mention). When Menelaus was away from home, Paris seduced Helen into running away with him. In the Iliad, Helen notes how she had followed Paris to Troy, and Apollodorus describes the pair taking valuables together. Some sources claim Paris had to raid Menelaus&#x27;s house to steal Helen from him, but others say he was first welcomed in.

The Spartans&#x27; expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. This triggered the war because Helen was famous for her beauty throughout Achaea (ancient Greece), and had many suitors of extraordinary ability. Therefore, following Odysseus&#x27;s advice, her father Tyndareus made all suitors promise to defend Helen&#x27;s marriage to the man he chose for her. When Paris took her to Troy, Menelaus invoked this oath. Helen&#x27;s other suitors, who between them represented most of Achaea&#x27;s strength, wealth, and military prowess, were obliged to help bring her back. Thus, the whole of Greece moved against Troy in force and the Trojan War began.

===Trojan War===

Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; casts Paris as unskilled and cowardly. Although Paris readily admits his shortcomings in battle, his brother Hector scolds and belittles him after he runs away from a duel with Menelaus that was to determine the end of the war. His preference for bow and arrow emphasizes this, since he does not follow the code of honor shared by the other heroes.

Early in the epic, Paris and Menelaus duel in an attempt to end the war without further bloodshed. Menelaus easily defeats Paris, though Aphrodite spirits him away before Menelaus can finish the duel. Paris is returned to his bedchambers, where Aphrodite forces Helen to be with him.

Paris&#x27;s second attempt at combat is equally fated: rather than engage the Greek hero Diomedes in hand-to-hand combat, Paris wounds Diomedes with an arrow through the foot.

Later, after slaying Hector and other heroes, Achilles dies by an arrow of Paris with Apollo&#x27;s help. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 107) Apollo disguised himself as Paris.

Later in the war, after Philoctetes mortally wounds Paris, Helen makes her way to Mount Ida where she begs Paris&#x27;s first wife, the nymph Oenone, to heal him. Still bitter that Paris had spurned her for his birthright in the city and then forgotten her for Helen, Oenone refuses. Helen returns alone to Troy, where Paris dies later the same day. In another version, Paris himself, in great pain, visits Oenone to plead for healing but is refused and dies on the mountainside. When Oenone hears of his funeral, she runs to his funeral pyre and throws herself in its fire.

After Paris&#x27;s death, his brother Deiphobus married Helen and was then killed by Menelaus in the sack of Troy.

<doc id="63417" wikidata="Q540237" url="?curid=63417" title="Fountains Abbey">
<text>Fountains Abbey is one of the largest and best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries in England. It is located approximately south-west of Ripon in North Yorkshire, near to the village of Aldfield. Founded in 1132, the abbey operated for 407 years, becoming one of the wealthiest monasteries in England until its dissolution, by order of Henry VIII, in 1539.

In 1983, Studley Royal Park including the ruins of Fountains Abbey was purchased by the National Trust. The abbey is maintained by English Heritage.

==Foundation==
After a dispute and riot in 1132 at the Benedictine house of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York, 13 monks were expelled, among them Saint Robert of Newminster. They were taken under the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, who provided them with land in the valley of the River Skell, a tributary of the Ure. The enclosed valley had all the natural features needed for the creation of a monastery, providing shelter from the weather, stone and timber for building, and a supply of running water. The six springs that watered the site inspired the monks to give it the name of Fountains.

After enduring a harsh winter in 1133, the monks applied to join the Cistercian order, which since the end of the previous century had been a fast-growing reform movement and by the beginning of the 13th century had more than 500 houses. In 1135 Fountains became the second Cistercian house in northern England, after Rievaulx. The monks of Fountains became subject to Clairvaux Abbey in Burgundy, which was under the rule of St Bernard. Under the guidance of Geoffrey of Ainai, a monk sent from Clairvaux, the group learned how to celebrate the seven Canonical Hours according to Cistercian usage and were shown how to construct wooden buildings in accordance with Cistercian practice.

==Consolidation==
According to archaeologist Glyn Coppack, after Henry Murdac was elected abbot in 1143 the small stone church and timber claustral buildings were replaced; the new church was similar in plan to the church at Vauclair Abbey that Murdac had previously commissioned. Within three years an aisled nave had been added to the stone church, and the first permanent claustral buildings, built in stone and roofed in tile, had been completed.

In 1146 an angry mob, annoyed at Murdac because of his role in opposing the election of William FitzHerbert as archbishop of York, attacked the abbey and burned down all but the church and some surrounding buildings. The community recovered swiftly from the attack and founded four daughter houses. Henry Murdac resigned as abbot in 1147 upon becoming archbishop of York. He was replaced first by Maurice, Abbot of Rievaulx (1147-8), then, on the resignation of Maurice, by Thorald (1148–50). Thorald was forced by the now archbishop, Henry Murdac, to resign after two years in office.

The next abbot, Richard, who held the post until his death in 1170, restored the abbey&#x27;s stability and prosperity. During his 20 years as abbot he supervised an extensive building programme that involved completing repairs to the damaged church and building more accommodation for the increasing number of recruits. At his death, the chapter house was completed, and the new church almost finished. The work was continued by his successor, Robert of Pipewell. Pipewell was considered a benevolent and virtuous abbot by William Grainge, writing in the nineteenth century.

The next abbot was William of Newminster, a noted ascetic, who presided over the abbey from 1180 to 1190. He was succeeded by Ralph Haget, who had entered Fountains at the age of 30 as a novice after pursuing a military career. Prior to his abbacy at Fountains, from 1182 to 1190/1 he was abbot of Kirkstall Abbey. During the European famine of 1194 the abbey provided support for six months to local people in the form of food, shelter and spiritual care. Famine was joined by the spread of disease, and the abbey helped those who needed treatment. During the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the north of England was subject to increased taxation, Fountains Abbey included. According to William Grainge, writing in &quot;Annals of a Yorkshire Abbey: A Popular History of the Famous Monastery of Fountains,&quot; the taxation of temporal goods had reduced from £343 in 1292, to £243 in 1318. Grainge interprets this reduction as evidence for detriment to the estate of the abbey. By 1330s, the abbey was no longer working to surplus, but having to borrow money.

During the first half of the 13th century Fountains increased in reputation and prosperity under the next three abbots, John of York (1203–1211), John of Hessle (1211–1220) and John of Kent (1220–1247). These three abbots managed to complete another expansion of the abbey&#x27;s buildings, which included enlarging the church and building an infirmary.

==Difficulties==
By the second half of the 13th century the abbey was in more straitened circumstances. It was presided over by eleven abbots, and became financially unstable largely due to forward selling its wool crop, and the abbey was criticised for its dire material and physical state when it was visited by Archbishop John le Romeyn in 1294. The run of disasters that befell the community continued into the early 14th century when northern England was invaded by the Scots and there were further demands for taxes. The culmination of these misfortunes was the Black Death of 1348–1349. The loss of manpower and income due to the ravages of the plague was almost ruinous.

A further complication arose as a result of the Papal Schism of 1378–1409. Fountains Abbey and other English Cistercian houses were told to break off contact with the mother house of Citeaux, which supported a rival pope. This resulted in the abbots forming their own chapter to rule the order in England. They became increasingly involved in internecine politics. In 1410, following the death of Abbot Burley of Fountains, the community was riven by several years of turmoil over the election of his successor. Contending candidates John Ripon - Abbot of Meaux and Roger Frank a monk of Fountains, were locked in conflict until 1416 when Ripon was finally appointed, ruling until his death in 1434.

Fountains regained some stability and prosperity under abbots John Greenwell (1442–1471), Thomas Swinton (1471–1478), and John Darnton (1478–1495), who undertook some much needed restoration of the fabric of the abbey, including notable work on the church. During Greenwell&#x27;s abbacy, he reduced the debts of the abbey by 100 marks, and survived what was characterised as a poisoning attempt by a monk called William Downom. Swinton kept a detailed &#x27;Memorandum Book&#x27;, which provides exceptional detail on the life of the abbey during his abbacy. Marmaduke Huby (1495–1526) expanded the number of monks from twenty-two to fifty-two, and undertook a building programme which included a new tower at the north end of the transept and extending the infirmary. Known to visitors as Huby&#x27;s Tower, it was decorated with the abbot&#x27;s insignia, as well as religious texts.

At Abbot Huby&#x27;s death he was succeeded by William Thirsk, who was accused by the royal commissioners of immorality and inadequacy, was dismissed as abbot, retired to Jervaulx Abbey, and was later hanged for his involvement in the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was replaced by Marmaduke Bradley, a monk of the abbey who had reported Thirsk&#x27;s supposed offences and testified against him. Furthermore Bradley paid 600 marks to essentially buy the abbacy for himself. In 1539 it was Bradley who surrendered the abbey when its seizure was ordered under Henry VIII at the dissolution of the monasteries.

==Abbots of Fountains==
==Architecture==

The abbey precinct covered surrounded by an wall built in the 13th century, some parts of which are visible to the south and west of the abbey. The area consists of three concentric zones cut by the River Skell flowing from west to east across the site. The church and claustral buildings stand at the centre of the precinct north of the Skell. The inner court containing the domestic buildings stretches down to the river and the outer court housing the industrial and agricultural buildings lies on the river&#x27;s south bank. The early abbey buildings were added to and altered over time, resulting in deviations from the strict Cistercian type. Outside the walls were the abbey&#x27;s &quot;home granges&quot;.

The original abbey church was built of wood and &quot;was probably&quot; two storeys high; it was, however, quickly replaced in stone. The church was damaged in the attack on the abbey in 1146 and was rebuilt, in a larger scale, on the same site. Building work was completed . This structure, completed around 1170, was long and had 11 bays in the side aisles. A lantern tower was added at the crossing of the church in the late 12th century. The presbytery at the eastern end of the church was much altered in the 13th century. The church&#x27;s greatly lengthened choir, commenced by Abbot John of York, 1203–11 and carried on by his successor, terminates, like that of Durham Cathedral, in an eastern transept, the work of Abbot John of Kent, 1220–47. Similarities to the choir at Beverley Minster have been drawn by architectural historian Lawrence Hoey. The tower, which was added not long before the dissolution, by Abbot Huby, 1494–1526, is in an unusual position at the northern end of the north transept and bears Huby&#x27;s motto: &quot;Soli Deo Honor et Gloria&quot;. The sacristry adjoined the south transept.

The cloister, which had arcading of black marble from Nidderdale and white sandstone, is in the centre of the precinct and to the south of the church. The three-aisled chapter-house and parlour open from the eastern walk of the cloister, with the monks&#x27; dormitory above; along the cloister&#x27;s southern walk are, from east to west, the warming house with muniment room above, the refectory, and the kitchens. Parallel with the western walk is an immense, vaulted substructure known as the cellarium (divided into sections serving as cellars and store-rooms, and with the lay brothers&#x27; refectory at its southern end, next to the kitchens), which supported the dormitory of the &quot;conversi&quot; (lay brothers) above. This building extended across the river and at its south-west corner were the latrines, built above the swiftly flowing stream.

The infirmary is located to the east of the latrine block, where portions of it are suspended on arches over the River Skell. It was built in the mid-12th century as a modest single-storey structure, then, from the 14th century, underwent extensive expansion and remodelling to end up in the 16th century as a grand dwelling with fine bay windows and large fireplaces. The great hall was an expansive room , &quot;one of the largest aisled halls ever built in mediaeval England&quot;. The infirmary had its own oratory or chapel, , and a kitchen, .

To the west of the cloister was the lay brothers&#x27; infirmary, and beyond that the two guest houses still visible, and a large guest hall to the north of them. Only the base of a pier and a table leg survive of the guest hall, but its plan has been established by geophysical survey.

To the east of the abbey, north of the infirmary, is the monks&#x27; cemetery. It was long known to exist, but its extent and arrangement were only discovered in 2016, when a partnership between the National Trust, the University of Bradford, Geoscan Research, Magnitude Surveys and Guideline Geo used ground penetrating radar which discovered several hundred graves in a careful and orderly arrangement.
==Endowments and economy==
Medieval monasteries were sustained by landed estates that were given to them as endowments and from which they derived an income from rents. They were the gifts of the founder and subsequent patrons, but some were purchased from cash revenues. At the outset, the Cistercian order rejected gifts of mills and rents, churches with tithes and feudal manors as they did not accord with their belief in monastic purity, because they involved contact with laymen. When Archbishop Thurstan founded the abbey he gave the community of land at Sutton north of the abbey and at Herleshowe to provide support while the abbey became established. In the early years the abbey struggled to maintain itself because further gifts were not forthcoming. Thurstan could not help further because the lands he administered were not his own, but part of the diocesan estate. After several years of impoverished struggle to establish the abbey, the monks were joined by Hugh, a former dean of York Minster, a rich man who brought a considerable fortune as well as furniture and books to start the library.

By 1135 the monks had acquired only another at Cayton, given by Eustace fitzJohn of Knaresborough &quot;for the building of the abbey&quot;. Shortly after the fire of 1146, the monks had established granges at Sutton, Cayton, Cowton Moor, Warsill, Dacre and Aldburgh all within of Fountains. In the 1140s the water mill was built on the abbey site, so that the grain from the granges could be brought to the abbey for milling.

In October 2021, the National Trust announced that they had uncovered the foundations of a 12th- to 13th-century tannery at the abbey, described as being of &quot;industrial&quot; scale. The foundations, located close to the River Skell, were discovered using ground-penetrating radar, revealing a number of previously-unknown monastic buildings along a long, &quot;bowling alley-type extension&quot; whose use had long been unknown.

Further estates were assembled in two phases, between 1140 and 1160 then 1174 and 1175, from piecemeal acquisitions of land. Some of the lands were grants from benefactors but others were purchased from gifts of money to the abbey. Roger de Mowbray granted large areas of Nidderdale and William de Percy and his tenants granted substantial estates in Craven which included Malham Moor and the fishery in Malham Tarn. After 1203 the abbots consolidated the abbey&#x27;s lands by renting out more distant areas that the monks could not easily farm themselves, and exchanging and purchasing lands that complemented their existing estates. Fountains&#x27; holdings both in Yorkshire and beyond had reached their maximum extent by 1265, when they were an efficient and very profitable estate. Their estates were linked in a network of individual granges which provided staging posts to the most distant ones. They had urban properties in York, Yarm, Grimsby, Scarborough and Boston from which to conduct export and market trading and their other commercial interests included mining, quarrying, iron-smelting, fishing and milling.

Apart from the renting out of land, the monks themselves and their laybrothers, numerous in the early period, were committed on a large scale to its efficient development and the management of the landscape, not least the watercourses and woods.

The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was a factor that led to a downturn in the prosperity of the abbey in the early fourteenth century. Areas of the north of England as far south as York were looted by the Scots. Then the number of lay-brothers being recruited to the order reduced considerably. The abbey chose to take advantage of the relaxation of the edict on leasing property that had been enacted by the General Chapter of the order in 1208 and leased some of their properties. Others were staffed by hired labour and remained in hand under the supervision of bailiffs. In 1535 Fountains had an interest in 138 vills and the total taxable income of the Fountains estate was £1,115, making it the richest Cistercian monastery in England.

==After the Dissolution==

The Abbey buildings and land were seized by the Crown, and sold on 1 October 1540 to Sir Richard Gresham, at the time a Member of Parliament (MP) and previously Lord Mayor of London, the father of Sir Thomas Gresham. It was Richard Gresham who had supplied Cardinal Wolsey with the tapestries for his new residence of Hampton Court and who paid for the Cardinal&#x27;s funeral.

In 1597 the site was acquired by Sir Stephen Proctor, who built Fountains Hall. Between 1627 and 1767 the estate was owned by the Messenger family. They sold it to William Aislabie who was responsible for combining it with the Studley Royal Estate.

==Current status==

The abbey is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust and is part of the designated &quot;Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The archaeological excavation of the site began under the supervision of John Richard Walbran, a Ripon antiquary who, in 1846, had published a paper &quot;On the Necessity of clearing out the Conventual Church of Fountains&quot;. In 1966, the Abbey was placed in the guardianship of the Department of the Environment and the estate was purchased by the West Riding County Council, who transferred ownership to North Yorkshire County Council in 1974. The National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983.

=== World Heritage Site designation ===
In 1986 the parkland in which the abbey is situated and the abbey was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It was recognised for fulfilling the criteria of &quot;being a masterpiece of human creative genius&quot;, and &quot;an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history.&quot;

=== National Trust ownership ===
Fountains Abbey is owned by the National Trust and maintained by English Heritage. The trust also owns Studley Royal Park, and Fountains Hall, and manages St Mary&#x27;s Church, designed by William Burges and built around 1873 (owned by English Heritage). All of these are significant features of the World Heritage Site. In January 2010, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal became two of the first National Trust properties to be included in Google Street View, using the Google Trike.

=== Exhibition and display ===

Fountains Mill is the former corn mill, built in the mid-twelfth century by the community. It is the most substantial Cistercian mill to survive. There were two waterwheels installed, run from a leat taken from the Rover Skell. It was later used as a sawmill, and in 1928 a turbine was installed to convert the building to the production of electricity. The turbine installation ended the building&#x27;s over 800 years of continuous use as a mill. It has previously housed refugees and been used as a stonemason&#x27;s workshop. It was refurbished and opened as an exhibition space in 2000. During 2022 the temporary exhibition was of work by the Yorkshire-based photographer Joe Cornish.

The Porter&#x27;s Lodge, which was once the gatehouse to the abbey, houses a modern exhibition area with displays about the history of Fountains Abbey and how the monks lived. The centrepiece of the display is a scale model of the abbey at the time of the Dissolution. Following a suggestion by Commander Clare George Vyner, it was designed by the architect and artist Arthur Edward Henderson (1870–1956), and constructed from plastic by P Kemp and E Wilson at workshops in Surbiton. The model, measuring some 10 feet by 7 feet and weighing about a ton, was donated on 23 April 1952. Henderson&#x27;s book on Fountains Abbey compares photographs of various parts of the ruin with his drawings of how that section would have looked originally.

=== Climate crisis ===
Since 2006 assessment of the impact of climate change has been an essential requirement for the management of World Heritage Sites. In early 2021 a National Trust press release stated that the abbey &quot;is at risk of being irreparably damaged by flooding, with several instances in recent years [particularly in 2007] when the 12th-century ruins and water garden have been deluged by water&quot;. Funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund was subsequently awarded and was intended to help finance the Skell Valley Scheme, which would &quot;rejuvenate 12 miles of the River Skell&quot; to help minimize the risk of flooding.

==Cultural significance==

=== On screen ===

During the cold winter of December 1981 Fountains Abbey was used as a location by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for the music video of their single &quot;Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)&quot;.

In 1972 the abbey was the setting for Alan Bennett&#x27;s first televised play, &quot;A Grand Day Out.&quot; In 1980, the final scenes of &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot; were filmed there. Other film productions that have used locations at the abbey include the films &quot;Life at the Top&quot;, both &quot;The Secret Garden (1993)&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden (2020)&quot;, and &quot;The History Boys&quot;.

In October and November 2020, a number of scenes of the second season of the Netflix original &quot;The Witcher&quot; were filmed in the abbey and its surroundings. The TV programmes &quot;Flambards&quot;, &quot;A History of Britain&quot;, &quot;Terry Jones&#x27; Medieval Lives&quot;, &quot;Cathedral&quot;, &quot;Treasure Hunt,&quot; and &quot;Gunpowder,&quot; have also been filmed there.

=== In literature ===
Fountains Abbey features twice in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Books with poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. In the 1833 edition to a painting of the ruins by N. W. Hook and in the 1836 edition to a view of the interior vaults by Nathaniel Whittock.

<doc id="63420" wikidata="Q1196571" url="?curid=63420" title="MOS Technology 6507">
<text>The 6507 (typically &quot;&quot;sixty-five-oh-seven&quot; or &quot;six-five-oh-seven&quot;&quot;) is an 8-bit microprocessor from MOS Technology, Inc. It is a version of their 40-pin 6502 packaged in a 28-pin DIP, making it cheaper to package and integrate in systems. The reduction in pin count is achieved by reducing the address bus from 16 bits to 13 (limiting the available memory range from 64KB to 8KB) and removing a number of other pins used only for certain applications.

To do this, A15 to A13 and some other signals such as the interrupt lines are not accessible. As a result, it can only address 8KB of memory, which for some applications at the time (1975) was acceptable and not overly restrictive. The entire 6500 CPU family was originally conceived as a line of very low-cost microprocessors for small-scale embedded systems.

The 6507 and 6502 chips use the same underlying silicon layers, and differ only in the final metallisation layer. This ties the interrupt lines to their inactive level so they are not vulnerable to generating spurious interrupts from noise. The first three digits of the chip identifier are part of the silicon layers, and the final digit is in the metallisation layer. Micro-photography of the 6502 and 6507 shows this difference.
The 6507 is widely used in two applications: the best-selling Atari 2600 video game console and peripherals for the Atari 8-bit computers including the 850 Serial &amp; Parallel Interface, and the 810 and 1050 disk drives. In the 2600, the system is further limited by the design of the ROM cartridge slot, which only allows for 4KB of the external memory to be addressed. The other 4KB is reserved for the internal RAM and I/O chips, using a minimal-cost partial decoding technique that causes the RAM and peripheral device registers to appear at multiple aliased addresses throughout the 4K address space.

Most other machines, notably home computers based on the 650x architecture, use either the standard 6502 or extended versions of it, in order to allow for more memory.

By the time the 6502 line was becoming widely used around 1980, ROM and RAM semiconductor memory prices had fallen to the point where the 6507 was no longer a worthwhile simplification. Its use in new designs ceased at that point, though the Atari 2600 that contains it continued to be sold into the early 1990s, as it was not discontinued until January 1, 1992. However, late-model Atari 2600 consoles do not necessarily contain a discrete 6507 chip.

== Pin configuration ==

The 6507 uses a 28-pin configuration, with 13 address pins (A0..A12) and 8 data pins (D0..D7). The seven remaining pins are used for power (Vss, Vcc), the CPU timing clock (φ0, φ2), to reset the CPU (the /RES pin), to request a CPU wait state during its next memory read access (the RDY pin), and for the CPU to indicate if a read or write memory (or MMIO device) access is being performed (the R/W pin). There is no IRQ or NMI pin on the processor.

The RDY pin is not included on all other 28-pin cut-down versions of the 6502. Within the Atari 2600, RDY is used to synchronise the CPU to the television video lines. This function is essential for the &#x27;racing the beam&#x27; method used by the 6502 and Atari Television Interface Adaptor chip to generate the television video signal. In response to a specific address access, the TIA will assert RDY to halt the CPU until the end of the current video scan line.

<text>The Little Prince (, ) is a novella written and illustrated by French writer and military pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; makes observations about life, adults, and human nature.

&quot;The Little Prince&quot; became Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history. The book has been translated into over 505 different languages and dialects worldwide, being the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible. &quot;The Little Prince&quot; has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, cinema television, ballet, and opera.

== Plot ==

The book begins with the then six year old narrator. To determine if grownups are as enlightened as a child, the narrator shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The adults always reply that the picture represents a hat. Upon making a second drawing depicting the elephant inside the boa constrictor, the adults tell him to study things of &quot;importance.&quot; He learns to only talk of &quot;reasonable&quot; things to them, rather than the fanciful.

The narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator must fix his airplane before his supply of water runs out. Here, he is greeted by a young boy named &quot;the little prince.&quot;

The prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator&#x27;s surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a crate, claiming the sheep is inside. Surprisingly, this drawing delights the little prince.

Over the course of days, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He used to live on a house-sized asteroid known on Earth as &quot;B 612&quot;. The narrator recounts a story of a Turkish astronomer who, after discovering asteroid B 612, gave a presentation on his findings, but was ignored. After dressing in European garments, however, his discoveries were accepted. The asteroid has three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and various plants.

The prince used to clean the volcanoes and weed unwanted seeds and sprigs that infested his soil, pulling out baobab trees that were constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.

The prince met a rose that grew on the asteroid. The rose exaggerated ailments to have the prince care for her. The prince made a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watered her, and kept the caterpillars off.

Despite falling in love with the rose, the prince also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon saying their goodbyes, the rose apologized for failing to show that she loved him. She wished him well and turned down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she would protect herself. The prince laments that he does not understand how to love his rose while being with her.

The prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by one adult. They include:

* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that will be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.
* A conceited man who only wants to be the most admired person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.
* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.
* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogs them in order to &quot;own&quot; them all.
* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life following orders to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet&#x27;s day and night. Despite this, the little prince notes that he wishes he could have stayed on his planet the most.
* An elderly geographer who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records. He persuades the prince to visit Earth next.

Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished that. The prince next met a flower, who said she had only seen a few men in that part of the world, and they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of someone boring who only repeats words.

The prince encountered a row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his rose was unique and thinking she had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thought of as common. He started weeping until a fox came along.

The fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary or commonplace to being special and unique.

From the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed special because she was the object of the prince&#x27;s love and time; he had &quot;tamed&quot; her, and now she was more precious than all of the other roses. Upon their departure, the fox says that important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.

The prince then met two people from Earth:

* A railway switchman who described how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows.
* A merchant who spoke about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.

Eight days after the plane crash, the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince becomes morose and longs to return home and see his flower.

The prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, worrying that she has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body is too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince&#x27;s side. The prince says that the narrator only needs to look at the stars to think of the prince&#x27;s laughter and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away and allows the snake to bite him, falling down.

The next morning, the narrator cannot find the prince&#x27;s body. Managing to repair his airplane, he leaves the desert. The narrator requests to be contacted by anyone in that area who encounters a boy like the prince.

== Tone and writing style ==
The story of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, &quot;a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.&quot; &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was created when Saint-Exupéry was &quot;an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.&quot; According to one analysis, &quot;the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements... You can&#x27;t ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.&quot;

An exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages &quot;covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...&quot; He worked &quot;long hours with great concentration.&quot; According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author&#x27;s style: &quot;Behind Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.&quot; The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt &quot;free&quot; and able to concentrate, &quot;writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy&quot;, until he instantaneously dozed off. He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.

A native speaker of French, Saint-Exupéry was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Adèle Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (&quot;For Miss Adèle Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language&quot;), related her experiences with her famous student as &quot;Saint-Exupéry in America, 1942–1943: A Memoir&quot;, published in 1971.

&quot;Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something &#x27;very hard&#x27;. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined &quot;carnet&quot; (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming &#x27;enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable&#x27;.&quot;

== Inspirations ==
=== Events and characters ===
In &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; (original French: ).

On 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert. They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a &quot;raid&quot;, that had a prize of 150,000 francs. Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.

Both miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day&#x27;s worth of liquid. They both began to see vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s and Prévot&#x27;s lives.

In the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author&#x27;s intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves. The novella&#x27;s iconic phrase, &quot;One sees clearly only with the heart&quot; is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.

The fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet. The little prince&#x27;s reassurance to the pilot that the prince&#x27;s body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine&#x27;s dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m all right. I can&#x27;t help it. It&#x27;s my body&quot;.

=== Rose ===

Many researchers believe that the prince&#x27;s kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry, with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano. Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince&#x27;s rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.

This interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was &quot;the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. &quot;I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words&quot;, says the prince. &quot;She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.&quot;

=== Prince ===
Saint-Exupéry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince&#x27;s character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him &quot;le Roi-Soleil&quot; (&quot;the Sun King&quot;) because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.

Some have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and &quot;believes in a life after death&quot;, subsequently returning to his personal heaven. When &quot;Life&quot; photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: &quot;I asked him who he was&quot;, he replied. &quot;I&#x27;m the Little Prince&quot; was the reply.

One of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;, the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings:

== Background ==
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France&#x27;s highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force). After France&#x27;s defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.

An earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

He wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author&#x27;s neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France. Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: &quot;He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.&quot; However, the period was to be both a &quot;dark but productive time&quot; during which he created three important works.

Between January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South, then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.

The couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided. During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.

After returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed to work on a children&#x27;s book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children&#x27;s story would help. The author wrote and illustrated &quot;The Little Prince&quot; at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.

Although the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City&#x27;s noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut, they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, &quot;I wanted a hut, and it&#x27;s the Palace of Versailles.&quot; As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become &quot;a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.&quot; He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts, usually starting at about 11 pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife&#x27;s Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air. De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, &quot;The Tale of the Rose&quot;, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry.

While the author&#x27;s personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s original manuscript in 1968, stated: &quot;On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren&#x27;t quite right&quot;, eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length. The story, the curator added, was created when he was &quot;an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.&quot;

The large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table. It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset &quot;is move your chair a few steps.&quot;

=== Manuscript ===

The original 140-page autograph manuscript of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author&#x27;s close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library &amp; Museum) in Manhattan, New York City. It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work. The manuscript&#x27;s pages include large amounts of the author&#x27;s prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella&#x27;s publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author&#x27;s birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s literary works. Physically, the manuscript&#x27;s onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.

The story&#x27;s keynote aphorism, (&quot;One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye&quot;) was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exupéry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist. His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00 a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.

Many pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story&#x27;s theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince&#x27;s vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince&#x27;s planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting &quot;On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...&quot;, with the story&#x27;s pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: &quot;he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.&quot; The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella&#x27;s printing.

In April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an &quot;ambassador of the human spirit&quot;. The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: &quot;I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means &#x27;gargling&#x27; &quot;, he says. Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be &quot;guerre&quot; (or &quot;war&quot;). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as &#x27;to gargle&#x27; in French is an informal reference to &#x27;honour&#x27;, which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.

=== Dedication ===

Saint-Exupéry met Léon Werth (1878–1955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery&#x27;s closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exupéry.

Saint-Exupéry dedicated two books to him, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Letter to a Hostage&quot;) and &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; (&quot;The Little Prince&quot;), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, Saint-Exupéry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was &quot;alone, cold and hungry&quot;, a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exupéry dedicates the book to him:

Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend&#x27;s disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exupéry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him. At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry did not live to see, Werth said: &quot;Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exupéry) isn&#x27;t entirely peace.&quot; Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend&#x27;s death, when Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.

=== Illustrations ===

All of the novella&#x27;s simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist – which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella&#x27;s introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice. As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew. Two or three original &quot;Little Prince&quot; drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell. One rare original &quot;Little Prince&quot; watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.

An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Keep On Truckin&quot;&#x27; of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher&#x27;s office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as &quot;...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as &quot;the little prince&quot;, and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.&quot; His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a &quot;realistic ideal&quot;. Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One &quot;most striking&quot; illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince&#x27;s arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s editing process.

To mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of &quot;The Little Prince&#x27;s&quot; publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot. Hamilton&#x27;s black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince&#x27;s sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince. Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story&#x27;s desert fox and its tiger. A museum representative stated that the novella&#x27;s final drawings were lost.

Seven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum&#x27;s exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince&#x27;s home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story&#x27;s narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a &#x27;literalness&#x27; that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library&#x27;s staff. According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, &quot;[t]he image evokes Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.&quot; Another reviewer noted that the author &quot;chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate.&quot; Not a single drawing of the story&#x27;s narrator–pilot survived the author&#x27;s editing process; &quot;he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story&quot;.

In 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author&#x27;s own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force).

=== Post-publication ===

Stacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, &quot;rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince&quot;, and remarking of their dual fates, &quot;the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky&quot;. Another noted that the novella&#x27;s mystique was &quot;enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.&quot;

Only weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife&#x27;s pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.

As part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying. He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.

=== Reception ===

Many of the book&#x27;s initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable&#x27;s multi-layered story line and its morals, perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France&#x27;s leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children&#x27;s nor adults&#x27; literature classification. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote shortly before its publication &quot;What makes a good children&#x27;s book? ... &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, something that exists on two levels&quot;; &quot;Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?&quot; Notwithstanding the story&#x27;s duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still &quot;capture the imagination of any child.&quot; Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned &quot;it&#x27;s the new book by Saint-Exupéry&quot;, adding to its dustcover &quot;There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.&quot;

Others were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated that the story possessed &quot;...large portions of the Saint-Exupéry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it&#x27;s a sort of credo.&quot; P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series of children books, wrote in a &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; review: &quot;&quot;The Little Prince&quot; will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.&quot;

British journalist Neil Clark, in &quot;The American Conservative&quot; in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s overall work by commenting that it provides a &quot;…bird&#x27;s eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written&quot;, and that the author&#x27;s novella &quot;doesn&#x27;t merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.&quot;

The book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for only two weeks, as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; which remained on the same list for nearly five months. As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to &quot;The Little Prince&quot; include one from &quot;The New York Times&quot; that describes it as &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;fabulistic&quot;.

== Literary translations and printed editions ==


In April 2017, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; became the world&#x27;s most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages. This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.

Katherine Woods (1886–1968) produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors. Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Wood&#x27;s almost &quot;poetic&quot; English translation has long been admired by many &quot;Little Prince&quot; lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy. at least seven additional English translations have been published:
* Irene Testot-Ferry, (, 1st ed. 1995)
*T.V.F. Cuffe, (, 1st ed. 1995)
* Alan Wakeman, (, 1st ed. 1995)
* Richard Howard, (, 1st ed. 2000)
* Ros and Chloe Schwartz, (, 1st ed. 2010)
* David Wilkinson, (bilingual English-French student edition, , 1st ed. 2011)
* Michael Morpurgo, (, 1st ed. 2018)
* Guillain Méjane, (translated via the PoesIA project, a convolutional neural network, , 1st ed. 2020)

The Little Prince was also translated by Bonnie Greer for a BBC radio adaptation in 1999.
*Bonnie Greer, BBC Radio 4, broadcast 25 December 1999.

Each translation approaches the essence of the original with an individual style and focus.

&quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; is often used as a beginner&#x27;s book for French-language students, and several bilingual and trilingual translations have been published. As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian, the constructed international languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006), or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910–2002) and as in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. A translation of the book was published as &quot;U&#x27;cc priinsâž&quot; in Skolt Sámi translated by Skolt Sámi author Kati-Claudia Fofonoff in 2000, a language spoken in Sápmi. Which, at the time, was spoken by less than 500 people making it the smallest language with a translation of &quot;Le Petit Prince.&quot; In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as . It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is &quot;nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology&quot;.

Linguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in Korean, and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled &quot;Prince From a Star&quot;, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.

The first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after the German occupation of France ended. Prior to France&#x27;s liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s works were made available only by means of secret print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller , describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.

Commemorating the novella&#x27;s 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, Éditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s original handwritten manuscript entitled , edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).

A Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gráfica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world&#x27;s largest book published. The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10 ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.

It has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by Éabhloid publishers in 2015.

=== Spanish editions ===
After being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was first published in Spanish as in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emecé Editores. Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, , a Spanish translation by José María Francés. Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fernández in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990.
The book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacería (as ) or the Madrid slang Cheli (as ).

=== Bavarian editions ===
&quot;The Little Prince&quot; has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exupéry.

=== Chinese editions ===

&quot;The Little Prince&quot; is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella. According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exupéry-d&#x27;Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years. Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.

=== Extension of copyrights in France ===

Due to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation (English: &quot;Died for France&quot;), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law&#x27;s provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright; thus most of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.

The book will remain under copyright in the US until 2039 and will remain in copyright in France until 2033 or 2045.

== Adaptations and sequels ==

The wide appeal of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s novella has led to it being adapted into numerous forms over the decades. Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group. He has also been portrayed as a &quot;virtual ambassador&quot; in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group, and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;.

The multi-layered fable, styled as a children&#x27;s story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed &quot;The Little Prince&quot; to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:
* Vinyl record, cassette and CD: as early as 1954 several audio editions in multiple languages were created on vinyl record, cassette tape and much later as a CD, with one English version narrated by Richard Burton.
* Radio broadcasts: radio plays were produced in the United States, with Raymond Burr, in 1956, and most recently in the United Kingdom on BBC in a 1999 dramatization by Bonnie Greer, produced by Pam Fraser Solomon.
* Film and TV: the story has been created as a movie as early as 1966 in a Soviet-Lithuanian production, with its first English movie version in 1974 produced in the United States featuring Bob Fosse, who choreographed his own dance sequence as &quot;The Snake&quot;, and Gene Wilder as &quot;The Fox&quot;. In 1987, a Turkish version was adopted into a direct-to-video film by Remzi Aydin Jonturk. Starting in 2010, a three-season-long animated series was made that expanded upon the book. In 2015, a major 3D film, combining computer animation and stop motion animation, was released as &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in English and &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; in French. A 2D-animated series was released in 2023.
* Stage: &quot;The Little Prince&#x27;s&quot; popular appeal has lent itself to widespread dramatic adaptations in live stage productions at both the professional and amateur levels. It has become a staple of numerous stage companies, with dozens of productions created.
* Graphic novel: a new printed version of the story in comic book form, by Joann Sfar in 2008, drew widespread notice.
* Pop-Up Book: a new printed edition, using the original text (as translated by Richard Howard in 2000) and St. Exupery&#x27;s original drawings as the basis for elaborate pop-up illustrations, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (, 1st ed. 2009).
* Opera and ballet: several operatic and ballet versions of the novella have been produced as early as the Russian &quot;Malen′kiy prints&quot; by Lev Knipper, first performed in 1978 with a symphony score composed in the 1960s.
* Concert music: Concert Suite on &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; for solo violin, solo harp and chamber orchestra by Jean-Pascal Beintus (premiered by the DSO Berlin – Kent Nagano – 2008)

* Anime: a Japanese animation TV series was made in 1978, &quot;Hoshi no Ōjisama: Petit Prince&quot;, containing 39 episodes that do not follow the plot of the original novella. Each episode contains an adventure on a planet, usually Earth, where the little prince meets different people each time and makes friends. Some key elements of the original story have been kept. Namely, the little prince&#x27;s golden hair, his scarf, laughter, his planet name (B-612), the rose and the three volcanoes. The anime had been aired and dubbed into several languages including Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The English dub&#x27;s title is &quot;The Adventures of the Little Prince&quot;.
* Other: a number of musical references, game boards and a video game version of the novella have been released.

In 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, entitled &quot;Le petit prince retrouvé&quot; (&quot;The Little Prince Returns&quot;). In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep. Another sequel titled &quot;The Return of the Little Prince&quot; was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry.

== Honours and legacy ==
=== Museums and exhibits ===
==== Morgan exhibitions ====
New York City&#x27;s Morgan Library &amp; Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story&#x27;s 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author&#x27;s centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella&#x27;s 70th anniversary.

The 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum&#x27;s art historian Ruth Kraemer, as well as a number of the story&#x27;s watercolours drawn from the Morgan&#x27;s permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, &quot;My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exupéry&quot;, narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin, along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, and several international editions in other languages.

In January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella&#x27;s creative origins and its history. The major showing of &quot;The Little Prince: A New York Story&quot; celebrated the story&#x27;s 70th anniversary. It examined both the novella&#x27;s New York origins and Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book&#x27;s highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.

The new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work&#x27;s original 140 handwritten manuscript pages, with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto &#x27;Fidelity&#x27; watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella&#x27;s first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story&#x27;s illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media. One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation. Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton&#x27;s grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing&#x27;s progressive refinement. The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella&#x27;s first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s work.

Shortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a &quot;rumpled paper bag&quot;, placed onto her home&#x27;s entryway table, offering, &quot;I&#x27;d like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have&quot;. Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks. The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author&#x27;s personal letters from the Saint-Exupéry-d&#x27;Gay Estate, as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France. Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sís on his new work &quot;The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&quot;,

Additional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exupéry by &quot;Life&quot; photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author&#x27;s New York area homes, an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney, as well as one of the few signed copies extant of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, gifted to Hamilton&#x27;s 12-year-old son.

==== Permanent exhibits ====
* In Le Bourget, Paris, France, the Air and Space Museum of France established a special exhibit honoring Saint-Exupéry, and which displays many of his literary creations. Among them are various early editions of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. Remnants of the Free French Air Force P-38 Lightning in which he disappeared, and which were recovered from the Mediterranean in 2004, are also on view.
* In Hakone, Japan there was the Museum of The Little Prince featuring outdoor squares and sculptures such as the B-612 Asteroid, the Lamplighter Square, and a sculpture of the Little Prince. The museum grounds additionally featured a &quot;Little Prince Park&quot; along with the &quot;Consuelo Rose Garden&quot;. The museum permanently closed in March 2023.
* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, there is an imitation French village, Petite France, which has adapted the story elements of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; into its architecture and monuments. There are several sculptures of the story&#x27;s characters, and the village also offers overnight housing in some of the French-style homes. Featured are the history of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, an art gallery, and a small situated in the middle of the village for musicians and other performances. The enterprise&#x27;s director stated that in 2009 the village received a half million visitors.

==== Special exhibitions ====
* In 1996 the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiøt unveiled an artistic arrangement consisting of seven blocks of granite asteroids &#x27;floating&#x27; in a circle around a 2-metre tall planet Earth. The artistic universe was populated by bronze sculpture figures that the little prince met on his journeys. As in the book, the prince discovers that &quot;the essential is invisible to the eye, and only by the heart can you really see&quot;. The work was completed at the start of 1996 and placed in the central square of Fuglebjerg, Denmark, but was later stolen from an exhibition in Billund in 2011.
* During 2009 in São Paulo, Brazil, the giant Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The displays covered over 10,000 square metres on four floors, examining Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, different worlds, stars and the cosmos. The ground floor of the exhibit area was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author and Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of his Caudron Simoun, crashed in a simulated Sahara Desert.
* In 2012 the Catalan architect Jan Baca unveiled a sculpture in Terrassa, Catalonia showing the Little Prince along with the sentence, &quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye&quot;.
* In February 2022, nearly eight decades after it was written, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; arrived in Paris. The exhibit began on February 17 and ended on June 26. It contained 600 items, including photographs, poems, and newspaper clippings relating to &quot;The Little Prince.&quot;

===Places===

==== Playground ====

* One of the &quot;story playgrounds&quot; – a series of playgrounds themed after famous children&#x27;s stories in Holon, Israel – is themed after &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. It features sculptures and play structures depicting scenes and characters from the book.

==== Schools ====
* &quot;L&#x27;école Le Petit Prince&quot; is the public elementary school in the small community of Genech in northern France, dedicated in 1994 upon the merger of two former schools. With nine classrooms and a library, its building overlooks the village&#x27;s &quot;Place Terre des Hommes&quot;, a square also named in tribute to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 1939 philosophical memoir, &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;.
* A K–6 elementary school on Avro Road in Maple, Ontario, Canada, was also opened in 1994 as &quot;L&#x27;école élémentaire catholique Le Petit Prince&quot;. Its enrollment expanded from 30 students in its first year to some 325 children by 2014. One of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s colourful paintings of the prince is found on its website&#x27;s welcome page.

==== Avenue ====
* In southern Brazil, in the city of Florianópolis, there is the &quot;Avenida Pequeno Príncipe&quot; (Little Prince Avenue in Portuguese), whose name is a tribute to Saint-Exupéry, who passed through the city during his aviator career, an event that became part of the local culture.
* At 972 Fifth Avenue in New York City, a bronze statue was unveiled of the &quot;Little Prince&quot; by French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna in September 2023. The project to create the sculpture was initiated by the American Society of Le Souvenir Français, in partnership with the Antoine de Saint Exupéry Youth Foundation. The sculpture sits outside the headquarters of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, overlooking the pedestrians on Fifth Avenue. The four-foot-tall sculpture, created by Jean-Marc de Pas, was carved from clay and cast in bronze in one single piece in his studio in Normandy.

=== Insignia and awards ===
* Prior to its decommissioning in 2010, the (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exupéry flew with, adopted the image of the &quot;Little Prince&quot; as part of the squadron and tail insignia of its Dassault Mirage fighter jets. Some of the fastest jets in the world were flown with The Prince gazing over their pilots&#x27; shoulders.
* &quot;The Little Prince Literary Award&quot; for Persian fiction by writers under the age of 15, commemorating the title of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s famous work, was created in Iran by the Cheragh-e Motale&#x27;eh Literary Foundation. In 2012, some 250 works by young authors were submitted for first stage review according to the society&#x27;s secretary Maryam Sistani, with the selection of the best three writers from 30 finalists being conducted in Tehran that September.
* Several other Little Prince Awards have also been established in Europe, meant to promote achievement and excellence in a variety of fields such as in assistance to autistic children, child literacy, children&#x27;s literature (by adults), Puppetry theatre and theatre arts.

=== Numismatics and philatelic ===
* Before France adopted the euro as its currency, Saint-Exupéry and drawings from &quot;The Little Prince&quot; were on the 50-franc banknote; the artwork was by Swiss designer Roger Pfund. Among the anti-counterfeiting measures on the banknote was micro-printed text from &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot;, visible with a strong magnifying glass. Additionally, a 100-franc commemorative coin was also released in 2000, with Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s image on its obverse, and that of the Little Prince on its reverse.
* In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer&#x27;s untimely death, Israel issued a stamp honoring &quot;Saint-Ex&quot; and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in 1994. Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 24 other countries as of 2011.

=== Astronomy ===

* The B612 Foundation is a private foundation created to track Near-Earth objects that might pose a threat to Earth, and is dedicated to protecting the planet from asteroid strikes, similar to the Tunguska event of 1908. The private foundation was founded by a group of U.S. scientists and astronauts, including Clark Chapman, Piet Hut, Rusty Schweickart and Ed Lu in October 2002. The non-profit organization is named in honour of the prince&#x27;s home asteroid.
* An asteroid discovered in 1975, 2578 Saint-Exupéry, was also named after the author of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.
* Another asteroid discovered in 1993 was named 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for &quot;B six twelve&quot;. The asteroid&#x27;s number, 46610, becomes codice_1 in hexadecimal notation. B-612 was the name of the prince&#x27;s home asteroid.
* In 2003 a small asteroid moon, Petit-Prince, discovered earlier in 1998, was named in part after &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

=== Professional wrestling===
French professional wrestler Daniel Dubail was billed as Le Petit Prince.
Pakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince.

=== The Little Prince Day ===

Since 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.

=== Merchandise and collaboration ===
In 2023, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; inspired a collaboration with Chinese toy brand Pop Mart and artist Hideaki Kawashima’s &quot;Hirono&quot; series. Titled &quot;Pop Mart x Le Petit Prince – La Nouvelle Série de Figurines par Hirono&quot;, the collection features reinterpretations of characters from the novella, including the Little Prince, the Rose, and the Fox. The figurines depict scenes such as the Little Prince standing atop his asteroid B612 and interacting with the Fox under a starry sky. The collaboration was marketed as a celebration of the story’s themes of love, friendship, and exploration.

<text>Thomas Middleton (baptised 18 April 1580 – July 1627; also spelt &quot;Midleton&quot;) was an English Jacobean playwright and poet. He, with John Fletcher and Ben Jonson, was among the most successful and prolific of playwrights at work in the Jacobean period, and among the few to gain equal success in comedy and tragedy. He was also a prolific writer of masques and pageants.

==Life==
Middleton was born in London and baptised on 18 April 1580. He was the son of a bricklayer, who had raised himself to the status of a gentleman and owned property adjoining the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch. Middleton was five when his father died and his mother&#x27;s subsequent remarriage dissolved into a 15-year battle over the inheritance of Thomas and his younger sister – an experience that informed him about the legal system and may have incited his repeated satire against the legal profession.

Middleton attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, matriculating in 1598, but he did not graduate. Before he left Oxford sometime in 1600 or 1601, he wrote and published three long poems in popular Elizabethan styles. None of them appears to have been especially successful, and one, &quot;&quot;, ran foul of an Anglican church ban on verse satire and was burned. Nevertheless, his literary career was launched.

In the early 17th century, Middleton made a living writing topical pamphlets, including one – &quot;Penniless Parliament of Threadbare Poets&quot; – that was reprinted several times and became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. At the same time, records in the diary of Philip Henslowe show that Middleton was writing for the Admiral&#x27;s Men. Unlike Shakespeare, Middleton remained a free agent, able to write for whichever company hired him. His early dramatic career was marked by controversy. His friendship with Thomas Dekker brought him into conflict with Ben Jonson and George Chapman in the War of the Theatres. The grudge against Jonson continued as late as 1626, when Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;The Staple of News&quot; indulges in a slur on Middleton&#x27;s great success, &quot;A Game at Chess&quot;. It has been argued that Middleton&#x27;s &quot;Inner Temple Masque&quot; (1619) sneers at Jonson (then absent in Scotland) as a &quot;silenced bricklayer&quot;.

In 1603, Middleton married. In the same year an outbreak of the plague forced the London theatres to close, while James I came to the English throne. These events marked the beginning of Middleton&#x27;s greatest period as a playwright. Having passed the time during the plague composing prose pamphlets (including a continuation of Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;), he returned to drama with great energy, producing almost a score of plays for several companies and in several genres, notably city comedy and revenge tragedy. He continued to collaborate with Dekker: the two produced &quot;The Roaring Girl&quot;, a biography of the contemporary thief Mary Frith.

In the 1610s, Middleton began a fruitful collaboration with the actor William Rowley, producing &quot;Wit at Several Weapons&quot; and &quot;A Fair Quarrel&quot;. Working alone in 1613, Middleton produced a comic masterpiece: &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot;. He also became increasingly involved with civic pageants, and in 1620 became officially appointed as chronologist to the City of London, a post he held until his death in 1627, when it passed to Jonson.

Such official duties did not interrupt Middleton&#x27;s dramatic writing; the 1620s saw the production of his and Rowley&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Changeling&quot;, and of several tragicomedies. In 1624, he reached a peak of notoriety when his dramatic allegory &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; was staged by the King&#x27;s Men. The play used the conceit of a chess game to present and satirise the recent intrigues surrounding the Spanish Match. Though Middleton&#x27;s approach was strongly patriotic, the Privy Council silenced the play after nine performances, having received a complaint from the Spanish Ambassador. Middleton faced an unknown, probably frightening degree of punishment. Since no play later than &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; is recorded, it has been suggested that the sentence included a ban on writing for the stage.

==Death==
Middleton died at his home at Newington Butts in Southwark in 1627, and was buried on 4 July in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard. The old church of St Mary&#x27;s was demolished in 1876 for road-widening. Its replacement elsewhere in Kennington Park Road was destroyed in the Second World War, but rebuilt in 1958. The old churchyard where Middleton was buried survives as a public park in Elephant and Castle.

==Reputation==
Middleton&#x27;s work has long been praised by literary critics, among them Algernon Charles Swinburne and T. S. Eliot. The latter thought Middleton was second only to Shakespeare.

Middleton&#x27;s plays were staged throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, each decade offering more productions than the last. Even some less familiar works of his have been staged: &quot;A Fair Quarrel&quot; at the National Theatre, and &quot;The Old Law&quot; by the Royal Shakespeare Company. &quot;The Changeling&quot; has been adapted for film several times. The tragedy &quot;Women Beware Women&quot; remains a stage favourite. &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; was adapted for Alex Cox&#x27;s film &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot;, the opening credits of which attribute the play&#x27;s authorship to Middleton.

==Works==
Middleton wrote in many genres, including tragedy, history and city comedy. His best-known plays are the tragedies &quot;The Changeling&quot; (with William Rowley) and &quot;Women Beware Women&quot;, and the cynically satirical city comedy &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot;. Earlier editions of &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; attributed the play to Cyril Tourneur, or refused to arbitrate between Middleton and Tourneur. However, since the statistical studies by David Lake and MacDonald P. Jackson, Middleton&#x27;s authorship has not been seriously contested, and no further scholar has defended the Tourneur attribution. The Oxford Middleton and its companion piece, &quot;Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture&quot;, offer extensive evidence both for Middleton&#x27;s authorship of &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, for his collaboration with Shakespeare on &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and for his adaptation and revision of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. It has also been argued that Middleton collaborated with Shakespeare on &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. However, these latter collaborative attributions are not universally accepted by scholars.

Middleton&#x27;s work is diverse even by the standards of his age. He did not have the kind of official relationship with a particular company that Shakespeare or Fletcher had. Instead he appears to have written on a freelance basis for any number of companies. His output ranges from the &quot;snarling&quot; satire of &quot;Michaelmas Term&quot; (performed by the Children of Paul&#x27;s) to the bleak intrigues of &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (performed by the King&#x27;s Men). His early work was informed by the flourishing of satire in the late Elizabethan period, while his maturity was influenced by the ascendancy of Fletcherian tragicomedy. His later work, in which his satirical fury is tempered and broadened, includes three of his acknowledged masterpieces. &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot;, produced by the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men, skilfully combines London life with an expansive view of the power of love to effect reconciliation. &quot;The Changeling&quot;, a late tragedy, returns Middleton to an Italianate setting like that of &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, except that here the central characters are more fully drawn and more compelling as individuals. Similar development can be seen in &quot;Women Beware Women&quot;.

Middleton&#x27;s plays are marked by often amusingly presented cynicism about the human race. True heroes are a rarity: almost every character is selfish, greedy and self-absorbed. &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot; offers a panoramic view of a London populated entirely by sinners, in which no social rank goes unsatirised. In the tragedies &quot;Women Beware Women&quot; and &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, amoral Italian courtiers endlessly plot against each other, resulting in a climactic bloodbath. When Middleton does portray good people, the characters have small roles and are shown as flawless.

Due to a theological pamphlet attributed to him, Middleton is thought by some to have been a strong believer in Calvinism.

<text>The Atari 8-bit computers, formally launched as the Atari Home Computer System, are a series of home computers introduced by Atari, Inc., in 1979 with the Atari 400 and Atari 800. The architecture is designed around the 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 CPU and three custom coprocessors which provide support for sprites, smooth multidirectional scrolling, four channels of audio, and other features. The graphics and sound are more advanced than most of its contemporaries, and video games are a key part of the software library. The 1980 first-person space combat simulator &quot;Star Raiders&quot; is considered the platform&#x27;s killer app.

The Atari 800 was positioned as a high-end model and the 400 as more affordable. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with a non-upgradable of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard, a second cartridge slot, and allows easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both use identical 6502 CPUs at ( for PAL versions) and coprocessors ANTIC, POKEY, and CTIA/GTIA. The plug-and-play peripherals use the Atari SIO serial bus, and one of the SIO developers eventually went on to co-patent USB (Universal Serial Bus). The core architecture of the Atari 8-bit computers was reused in the 1982 Atari 5200 game console, but games for the two systems are incompatible.

The 400 and 800 were replaced by multiple computers with the same technology and different presentation. The 1200XL was released in early 1983 to supplant the 800. It was discontinued months later, but the industrial design carried over to the 600XL and 800XL released later the same year. After the company was sold and reestablished, Atari Corporation released the 65XE (sold as the 800XE in some European markets) and 130XE in 1985. The XL and XE are lighter in construction, have two joystick ports instead of four, and Atari BASIC is built-in. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. In 1987, after the Nintendo Entertainment System reignited the console market, Atari Corporation packaged the 65XE as a game console, with an optional keyboard, as the Atari XEGS. It is compatible with 8-bit computer software and peripherals.

The 8-bit computers were sold both in computer stores and department stores such as Sears using a demo to attract customers. Two million Atari 8-bit computers were sold during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985. The primary global competition came when the similarly equipped Commodore 64 was introduced in 1982. In 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for the 8-bit line.

== History ==

Design of the &quot;Home Computer System&quot; started at Atari as soon as the Atari Video Computer System was released in late 1977. While designing the VCS in 1976, the engineering team from Atari Grass Valley Research Center (originally Cyan Engineering) said the system would have a three-year lifespan before becoming obsolete. They started blue sky designs for a new console that would be ready to replace it around 1979.

They developed essentially a greatly updated version of the VCS, fixing its major limitations but sharing a similar design philosophy. The newer design has better speed, graphics, and sound. Work on the chips for the new system continued throughout 1978 and focused on much-improved video coprocessor known as the CTIA (the VCS version was the TIA).

During the early development period, the home computer era began in earnest with the TRS-80, PET, and Apple II—what &quot;Byte&quot; magazine dubbed the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot;. Nolan Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications for in 1976 to fund the launch of the VCS. In 1978, Warner hired Ray Kassar to become the CEO of Atari. Kassar said the chipset should be used in a home computer to challenge Apple. To adapt the machine to this role, it needed character graphics, some form of expansion for peripherals, and run the then-universal BASIC programming language.

The VCS lacks bitmap graphics and a character generator. All on-screen graphics are created using sprites and a simple background generated by data loaded by the CPU into single-scan-line video registers. Atari engineer Jay Miner architected the two video chips for the Atari 8-bit computers. The CTIA chip includes sprites and background graphics, but to reduce load on the main CPU, loading video registers and buffers is delegated to a dedicated microprocessor, the Alphanumeric Television Interface Controller or ANTIC. CTIA and ANTIC work together to produce a complete display, with ANTIC fetching scan line data from a framebuffer and sprite memory in RAM, plus character set bitmaps for character modes, and feeding these to the CTIA. CTIA processes the sprite and playfield data in the light of its own color, sprite, and graphics registers to produce the final color video output.

The resulting system was far in advance of anything then available on the market. Commodore was developing a video driver at the time, but Chuck Peddle, lead designer of the MOS Technology 6502 CPU used in the VCS and the new machines, saw the Atari work during a visit to Grass Valley. He realized the Commodore design would not be competitive but he was under a strict non-disclosure agreement with Atari, and was unable to tell anyone at Commodore to give up on their own design. Peddle later commented that &quot;the thing that Jay did, just kicked everybody&#x27;s butt.&quot;

=== Development ===

Management identified two sweet spots for the new computers: a low-end version known internally as &quot;Candy&quot;, and a higher-end machine known as &quot;Colleen&quot; (named after two Atari secretaries). Atari would market Colleen as a computer and Candy as a game machine or hybrid game console. Colleen includes user-accessible expansion slots for RAM and ROM, two 8 KB ROM cartridge slots, RF and monitor output (including two pins for separate luma and chroma suitable for superior S-Video output) and a full keyboard. Candy was initially designed as a game console, lacking a keyboard and input/output ports, although an external keyboard was planned for joystick ports 3 and 4. At the time, plans called for both to have a separate audio port supporting cassette tapes as a storage medium.

A goal for the new systems was user-friendliness. One executive stated, &quot;Does the end user care about the architecture of the machine? The answer is no. &#x27;What will it do for me?&#x27; That&#x27;s his major concern. ... why try to scare the consumer off by making it so he or she has to have a double E or be a computer programmer to utilize the full capabilities of a personal computer?&quot; For example, cartridges were expected to make the computers easier to use. To minimize handling of bare circuit boards or chips, as is common with other systems of that period, the computers were designed with enclosed modules for memory, ROM cartridges, with keyed connectors to prevent them being plugged into the wrong slot. The operating system boots automatically, loading drivers from devices on the serial bus (SIO). The disk operating system for managing floppy storage was menu-driven. When no software is loaded, rather than leaving the user at a blank screen or machine language monitor, the OS goes to the &quot;Memo Pad&quot; which is a built-in full-screen editor without file storage support.

As the design process for the new machines continued, there were questions about what the Candy should be. There was a running argument about whether the keyboard would be external or built-in. By the summer of 1978, education had become a focus for the new systems. The Colleen design was largely complete by May 1978, but in early 1979 the decision was made that Candy would also be a complete computer, but intended for children. As such, it would feature a new keyboard designed to be resistant to liquid spills.

Atari intended to port Microsoft BASIC to the machine as an 8 KB ROM cartridge. However, the existing 6502 version from Microsoft was around 7,900 bytes, leaving no room for extensions for graphics and sound. The company contracted with local consulting firm Shepardson Microsystems to complete the port. They recommended writing a new version from scratch, resulting in Atari BASIC.

=== FCC issues ===

Televisions of the time normally had only one signal input, which was the antenna connection on the back. For devices like a computer, the video is generated and then sent to an RF modulator to convert it to antenna-like output. The introduction of many game consoles during this era had led to situations where poorly designed modulators would generate so much signal as to cause interference with other nearby televisions, even in neighboring houses. In response to complaints, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced new testing standards which are extremely exacting and difficult to meet.

Other systems avoided the problem by using built-in composite monitors, such as the PET and TRS-80. The TRS-80 has a slightly modified black and white television as a monitor. It was notorious for causing interference, and production was canceled when the more stringent FCC requirements came into effect on January 1, 1981. Apple Computer left off the modulator and sold them under a third party company as the Sup&#x27;R&#x27;Mod so they did not have to be tested.

In a July 1977 visit with the engineering staff, a Texas Instruments salesman presented a new possibility in the form of an inexpensive fiber-optic cable with built-in transceivers. During the meeting, Joe Decuir proposed placing an RF modulator on one end, thereby completely isolating any electrical signals so that the computer would have no RF components. This would mean the computer would not have to meet the FCC requirements, yet users could still attach a television simply by plugging it in. His manager, Wade Tuma, later refused the idea saying &quot;The FCC would never let us get away with that stunt.&quot; Unknown to Atari, TI used Decuir&#x27;s idea. As Tuma had predicted, the FCC rejected the design, delaying that machine&#x27;s release. Texas Instruments shipped early machines with a custom television as the testing process dragged on.

To meet the off-the-shelf requirement while including internal TV circuitry, both new machines were built around cast aluminum shields forming a partial Faraday cage, with the various components screwed down onto this internal framework. This resulted in a sturdy computer, at the disadvantage of added manufacturing expense and complexity.

The FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which would allow RF leakage. This eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside world via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the Serial Input/Output (SIO) computer bus, a system for daisy-chaining multiple, auto-configuring devices to the computer through a single shielded connector. The internal slots were reserved for ROM and RAM modules; they did not have the control lines necessary for a fully functional expansion card, nor room to route a cable outside the case to communicate with external devices.

=== 400 and 800 release ===


After Atari announced its intent to enter the home computer market in December 1978, the Atari 400 and Atari 800 were presented at the Winter CES in January 1979 and shipped in November 1979.

The names originally referred to the amount of memory: 4 KB RAM in the 400 and 8 KB in the 800. By the time they were released, RAM prices had started to fall, so the machines were both released with 8 KB, using 4kx1 DRAMs. The user-installable RAM modules in the 800 initially had plastic casings but this caused overheating issues, so the casings were removed. Later, the expansion cover was held down with screws instead of the easier-to-open plastic latches. The computers eventually shipped with maxed-out RAM: 16k and 48k, respectively, using 16kx1 DRAMs.

Both models have four joystick ports, permitting four simultaneous players, but only a few games (such as &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;) use them all. Paddle controllers are wired in pairs, and &quot;Super Breakout&quot; supports eight players. The Atari 400, with a membrane keyboard and single internal ROM slot, outsold the Atari 800 by a 2-to-1 margin. Only one cartridge for the 800&#x27;s right slot was produced by March 1983, and later machines in the series have only one slot.

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; mentioned the Atari machines in an April 1979 overview of the CES show. Calling Atari &quot;the videogame people&quot;, it stated they came with &quot;some fantastic educational, entertainment and home applications software&quot;. In an August 1979 interview Atari&#x27;s Peter Rosenthal suggested that demand might be low until the 1980–81 time frame, when he predicted about one million home computers being sold. The April 1980 issue compared the machines with the Commodore PET, focused mostly on the BASIC dialects. Ted Nelson reviewed the computer in the magazine in June 1980, calling it &quot;an extraordinary graphics box&quot;. Describing his and a friend&#x27;s &quot;shouting and cheering and clapping&quot; during a demo of &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, Nelson wrote that he was so impressed that &quot;I&#x27;ve been in computer graphics for twenty years, and I lay awake night after night trying to understand how the Atari machine did what it did&quot;. He described the machine as &quot;something else&quot; but criticized the company for a lack of developer documentation. He concluded by stating &quot;The Atari is like the human body – a terrific machine, but (a) they won&#x27;t give you access to the documentation, and (b) I&#x27;d sure like to meet the guy that designed it&quot;. &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; wrote in September 1980 that the Atari 800 &quot;looks deceptively like a video game machine, [but had] the strongest and tightest chassis I have seen since Raquel Welch. It weighs about ten pounds ... The large amount of engineering and design in the physical part of the system is evident&quot;. The reviewer praised the documentation as &quot;show[ing] the way manuals should be done&quot;, and the &quot;excellent &#x27;feel of the keyboard. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; favorably reviewed the 800&#x27;s performance, graphics, and ROM cartridges, but disliked the documentation and cautioned that the unusual right Shift key location might make the computer &quot;unsuitable for serious word processing&quot;. There is an &quot;Atari key&quot; between the and shift, whereas a typical keyboard would extend the shift key into this area. Noting that the amount of software and hardware available for the computer &quot;is no match for that of the Apple II or the TRS-80&quot;, the magazine concluded that the 800 &quot;is an impressive machine that has not yet reached its full computing potential&quot;.

=== Sweet/Liz project ===

Though planning an extensive advertising campaign for 1980, Atari found difficult competition from Commodore, Apple, and Tandy. By mid-1981, it had reportedly lost $10 million on sales of $10–13 million from more than 50,000 computers.

In 1982, Atari started the Sweet 8 (or Liz NY) and Sweet 16 projects to create an upgraded set of machines that were easier to build and less costly to produce. Atari ordered a custom 6502, initially labelled 6502C, but eventually known as SALLY to differentiate it from a standard 6502C. A 6502C was simply a version of the 6502 able to run up to 4 MHz. The A models run at 1 MHz, and the B&#x27;s at 2 MHz. The basis for SALLY is a 6502B. SALLY was incorporated into late-production 400 and 800 models, all XL/XE models, and the Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 consoles. SALLY adds logic to disable the clock signal, called codice_1, which ANTIC uses to shut off the CPU to access the data/address bus.

Mirroring the 400/800, two systems were planned, the 1000 with 16 KB and the 1000X with 64 KB, each expandable via a Parallel Bus Interface slot on the back of the machine.

=== 1200XL===
The original Sweet 8/16 plans were dropped and only one machine using the new design was released. Announced at a New York City press conference on December 13, 1982, the 1200XL was presented at the Winter CES on January 6–9, 1983. It shipped in March 1983 with 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, a redesigned keyboard (with four function keys and a HELP key), and redesigned cable port layout. The number of joystick ports was reduced from 4 to 2. There is no PAL version of the 1200XL.

Announced at a retail price of $1000, the 1200XL was released at . This is $100 less than the announced price of the Atari 800 at its release in 1979, but by this time the 800 was priced much lower.

The system uses the SIO port again instead of the Parallel Bus Interface. The +12V pin in the SIO port is not connected, which prevents a few devices from working. The +12V was typically used to power RS-232 devices, which now required an external power source. An improved video circuit provides more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line is not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. The operating system has compatibility problems with some older software.

The 1200XL was discontinued in June 1983.

&quot;Compute!&quot; stated in an early 1983 editorial that the 1200XL was too expensive; John J. Anderson of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; agreed. Bill Wilkinson, author of Atari BASIC, co-founder of Optimized Systems Software, and columnist for &quot;Compute!&quot;, criticized the computer&#x27;s features and price. He wrote that the 1200XL was a &quot;terrific bargain&quot; if sold for less than $450, but that if it cost more than the 800, &quot;buy an 800 quick!&quot;

=== 600XL and 800XL ===

In May 1981, the Atari 800&#x27;s price was , but by mid-1983, because of price wars in the industry, it was and the 400 was under , down from under in 1982. The 1200XL was a flop, and the earlier machines were too expensive to produce to be able to compete at the rapidly falling price points.

A new lineup was announced at the 1983 Summer CES, closely following the original Sweet concepts. The 600XL is essentially the Liz NY model and the spiritual successor of the 400, and the 800XL would replace both the 800 and 1200XL. The machines follow the styling of the 1200XL but are smaller from back to front, and the 600XL is more so.

Atari had difficulty in transitioning manufacturing to Asia after closing its US factory in 1983. Originally intended to replace the 1200XL in mid-1983, the new models did not arrive until late that year. Although the 600XL/800XL were well positioned in terms of price and features, during the critical Christmas season they were available only in small numbers while the Commodore 64 was widely available. Brian Moriarty stated in &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; that Atari &quot;fail[ed] to keep up with Christmas orders for the 600 and 800XLs&quot;, reporting that as of late November 1983 the 800XL had not appeared in Massachusetts stores while 600XL &quot;quantities are so limited that it&#x27;s almost impossible to obtain&quot;.

After losing in the first nine months of the year, Atari that month announced that prices would rise in January, stating that it &quot;has no intention of participating in these suicidal price wars.&quot; The 600XL and 800XL&#x27;s prices in early 1984 were $50 higher than for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64.

&quot;ANALOG Computing&quot;, writing about the 600XL in January 1984, stated that &quot;the Commodore 64 and Tandy CoCo look like toys by comparison.&quot; The magazine approved of its not using the 1200XL&#x27;s keyboard layout, and predicted that the XL&#x27;s parallel bus &quot;actually makes the 600 &quot;more&quot; expandable than a 400 or 800.&quot; While disapproving of the use of an operating system closer to the 1200XL&#x27;s than the 400 and 800&#x27;s, and the &quot;inadequate and frankly disappointing&quot; documentation, &quot;ANALOG&quot; concluded that &quot;our first impression ... is mixed but mostly optimistic.&quot; The magazine warned, however, that because of &quot;Atari&#x27;s sluggish marketing&quot;, unless existing customers persuaded others to buy the XL models, &quot;we&#x27;ll all end up marching to the beat of a drummer whose initials are IBM.&quot; By March 1984, all of Atari&#x27;s computer models were produced in Hong Kong by the Atari-Wong joint venture.

=== Unreleased XL models ===

The high-end 1400XL and 1450XLD were announced alongside the 600XL and 800XL. They added a built-in 300 baud modem and a voice synthesizer, and the 1450XLD has a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive in an enlarged case, with a slot for a second drive. Atari BASIC is built into the ROM and the PBI at the back for external expansion.

The 1400XL and the 1450XLD had their delivery dates pushed back, and in the end, the 1400XL was canceled outright, and the 1450XLD so delayed that it would never ship. Other prototypes which never reached market include the 1600XL, 1650XLD, and 1850XLD. The 1600XL was to have been a dual-processor model capable of running 6502 and 80186 code, and the 1650XLD is a similar machine in the 1450XLD case. These were canceled when James J. Morgan became CEO and wanted Atari to return to its video game roots. The 1850XLD was to have been based on the Lorraine chipset which became the Amiga.

=== Tramiel takeover, declining market ===

Commodore founder Jack Tramiel resigned in January 1984 and in July, he purchased the Atari consumer division from Warner for an extremely low price. No cash was required, and instead Warner had the right to purchase in long-term notes and warrants, and Tramiel had an option to buy up to in Warner stock. When Tramiel took over, the high-end XL models were canceled and the low-end XLs were redesigned into the XE series. Nearly all research, design, and prototype projects were canceled, including the Amiga-based 1850XLD. Tramiel focused on developing the 68000-based Atari ST computer line and recruiting former Commodore engineers to work on it.

Atari sold about 700,000 computers in 1984 compared to Commodore&#x27;s two million. As his new company prepared to ship the Atari ST in 1985, Tramiel stated that sales of Atari 8-bit computers were &quot;very, very slow&quot;. They were never an important part of Atari&#x27;s business compared to video games, and it is possible that the 8-bit line was never profitable for the company though almost 1.5 million computers had been sold by early 1986.

By that year, the Atari software market was decreasing in size. &quot;Antic&quot; magazine stated in May 1985 that it had received many letters complaining that software companies were ignoring the Atari market, and urged readers to contact the companies&#x27; leaders. &quot;The Atari 800 computer has been in existence since 1979. Six years is a pretty long time for a computer to last. Unfortunately, its age is starting to show&quot;, &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; wrote in February 1986. The magazine stated that while its software library was comparable in size to that of other computers, &quot;now—and even more so in the future—there is going to be less software being made for the Atari 8-bit computers&quot;, warning that 1985 only saw a &quot;trickle&quot; of major new titles and that 1986 &quot;will be even leaner&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; that month stated &quot;games don&#x27;t come out for the Atari first anymore&quot;. In April, the magazine published a survey of ten game publishers which found that they planned to release 19 Atari games in 1986, compared to 43 for Commodore 64, 48 for Apple II, 31 for IBM PC, 20 for Atari ST, and 24 for Amiga. Companies stated that one reason for not publishing for Atari was the unusually high amount of software piracy on the computer, partly caused by the Happy Drive. The magazine warned later that year, &quot;Is this the end for Atari 800 games? It certainly looks like it might be from where I write&quot;. In 1987, MicroProse confirmed that it would not release &quot;Gunship&quot; for the Atari 8-bits, stating that the market was too small.

=== XE series ===
The 65XE and 130XE (XE stands for XL-Compatible Eight-bit) were announced in 1985 at the same time as the Atari 520ST, and they visually resemble the ST. The 65XE has 64 KB of RAM and is functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 130XE has 128 KB of memory, accessible through bank switching. The additional 64K can be used as a RAM drive.

The 130XE includes the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), which is almost compatible with the Parallel Bus Interface, but physically smaller and located next to the standard 400 and 800 compatible cartridge slot. It provides only those signals that do not exist in the latter. ECI peripherals were expected to plug into both the standard Cartridge Interface and the ECI port. Later revisions of the 65XE contain the ECI port.

The 65XE was sold as the 800XE in Germany and Czechoslovakia to ride on the popularity of the 800XL in those markets. All 800XE units contain the ECI port.

=== XE Game System ===

The Atari XEGS (XE Game System) was launched in 1987. A repackaged 65XE with a removable keyboard, it boots to the 1981 port of &quot;Missile Command&quot; instead of BASIC if the keyboard is disconnected.

== Design ==
The Atari machines consist of a 6502 as the main processor, a combination of ANTIC and GTIA chips to provide graphics, and the POKEY chip to handle sound and serial input/output. These support chips are controlled via a series of registers that can be user-controlled via memory load/store instructions running on the 6502. For example, the GTIA uses a series of registers to select colors for the screen; these colors can be changed by inserting the correct values into its registers, which are mapped into the address space that is visible to the 6502. Some of the coprocessors use data stored in RAM, such as ANTIC&#x27;s display buffer and display list, and GTIA&#x27;s Player/Missile (sprite) information.

The custom hardware features enable the computers to perform many functions directly in hardware, such as smooth background scrolling, that would need to be done in software in most other computers. Graphics and sound demos were part of Atari&#x27;s earliest developer information and used as marketing materials with computers running in-store demos.

=== ANTIC ===

ANTIC is a microprocessor which processes a sequence of instructions known as a display list. An instruction adds one row of the specified graphics mode to the display. Each mode varies based on whether it represents text or a bitmap, the resolution and number of colors, and its vertical height in scan lines. An instruction also indicates if it contains an interrupt, if fine scrolling is enabled, and optionally where to fetch the display data from memory.

Since each row can be specified individually, the programmer can create displays containing different text or bitmapped graphics modes on one screen, where the data can be fetched from arbitrary, non-sequential memory addresses.

ANTIC reads this display list and the display data using DMA (Direct Memory Access), then translates the result into a pixel data stream representing the playfield text and graphics. This stream then passes to GTIA which applies the playfield colors and incorporates Player/Missile graphics (sprites) for final output to a TV or composite monitor. Once the display list is set up, the display is generated without any CPU intervention.

There are 15 character and bitmap modes. In low-resolution modes, 2 or 4 colors per display line can be set. In high-resolution mode, one color can be set per line, but the luminance values of the foreground and background can be adjusted. High resolution bitmap mode (320x192 graphics) produces NTSC composite artifact colors; these colors do not occur on PAL machines.

For text modes, the character set data is pointed to by a register. It defaults to an address in ROM, but if pointed to RAM then a programmer can create custom characters. Depending on the text mode, this data can be on any 1K or 512 byte boundary. Additional registers flip all characters upside down and toggle inverse video.

The ANTIC chip allows a variety of Playfield modes and widths, and the original Atari Operating System included with the Atari 800/400 computers provides easy access to a subset of these graphics modes. These are exposed to users through Atari BASIC via the &quot;GRAPHICS&quot; command and to some other languages via similar system calls. The later version of the OS used in the XL/XE computers added support for most of these &quot;missing&quot; graphics modes.

ANTIC text modes support soft, redefineable character sets. ANTIC has four different methods of glyph rendering related to the text modes: Normal, Descenders, Single color character matrix, and Multiple colors per character matrix.

The ANTIC chip uses a display list and other settings to create these modes. Any graphics mode in the default CTIA/GTIA color interpretation can be freely mixed without CPU intervention by changing instructions in the display list.

The actual ANTIC screen geometry is not fixed. The hardware can be directed to display a narrow Playfield (128 color clocks/256 hi-res pixels wide), the normal width Playfield (160 color clocks/320 hi-res pixels wide), and a wide, overscan Playfield (192 color clocks/384 hi-res pixels wide) by setting a register value. The operating system&#x27;s default height for creating graphics modes is 192 scan lines, and ANTIC can display vertical overscan up to 240 TV scan lines tall by creating a custom display list.

The display list capabilities provide horizontal and vertical coarse scrolling requiring minimal CPU direction. Furthermore, the ANTIC hardware supports horizontal and vertical fine scrolling—shifting the display of screen data incrementally by single pixels (color clocks) horizontally and single scan lines vertically.

The system CPU clock and video hardware are synchronized to one-half the NTSC clock frequency. Consequently, the pixel output of all display modes is based on the size of the NTSC color clock which is the minimum size needed to guarantee correct and consistent color regardless of the pixel location on the screen. The fundamental accuracy of the pixel color output allows horizontal fine scrolling without color &quot;strobing&quot;—unsightly hue changes in pixels based on horizontal position caused when signal timing does not provide the TV/monitor hardware adequate time to reach the correct color.

=== CTIA/GTIA ===

The Color Television Interface Adaptor (CTIA) is the graphics chip originally used in the Atari 400 and 800. It is the successor to the TIA chip of the 1977 Atari VCS. According to Joe Decuir, George McLeod designed the CTIA in 1977. It was replaced with the Graphic Television Interface Adaptor (GTIA) in later revisions of the 400 and 800 and all later 8-bit models. GTIA, also designed by McLeod, adds three new playfield graphics modes to ANTIC which enable more colors.

The CTIA/GTIA receives Playfield graphics information from ANTIC and applies colors to the pixels from a 128 or 256 color palette depending on the color interpretation mode in effect. CTIA/GTIA controls Player/Missile Graphics (sprites) including collision detection between players, missiles, and the playfield; display priority for objects; and color/luminance control of all displayed objects. CTIA/GTIA outputs separate digital luminance and chroma signals, which are mixed to form an analog composite video signal.

CTIA/GTIA reads the joystick triggers and the Option, Select and Start keys, and controls the keyboard speaker in the Atari 400 and 800. In later computer models the audio output for the keyboard speaker is mixed with the audio out for transmission to the TV/video monitor.

=== POKEY ===

POKEY is a custom chip used for reading the keyboard, generating sound and serial communications (in conjunction with the Peripheral Interface Adapter chip) commands and IRQs, plus controlling the 4 joystick movements on the 400 and 800 models, and later RAM banks or ROM (OS/BASIC/Self-test) enables for XL/XE lines. It provides timers, a random number generator for generating acoustic noise and random numbers, and maskable interrupts. POKEY has four semi-independent audio channels, each with its own frequency, noise and volume control. Each 8-bit channel has its own audio control register which select the noise content and volume. For higher sound frequency resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (frequency can be defined with 16-bit value instead of usual 8-bit). The name POKEY comes from the words &quot;POtentiometer&quot; and &quot;KEYboard&quot;, which are two of the I/O devices that POKEY interfaces with (the potentiometer is the mechanism used by the paddle). The POKEY chip—and its dual- and quad-core versions—was used in many Atari coin-op arcade machines of the 1980s, including &quot;Centipede&quot; and &quot;Millipede&quot;, &quot;Missile Command&quot;, &quot;Asteroids Deluxe&quot;, &quot;Major Havoc&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

=== Models ===

Atari, Inc. shipped three updated versions of the 400/800 using the same chipset and with a different case aesthetic: the short-lived 1200XL, then the 600XL and 800XL. Numerous other, wide-ranging projects to develop successors to the 8-bit line were cancelled. After the re-establishment of Atari as Atari Corporation, three more systems were released using largely the same technology as earlier machines: the 65XE and 128 KB 130XE in 1985, and finally the game console inspired Atari XEGS in 1987.

* 400 and 800 (1979) – original machines in beige cases. Both have 4 joystick ports below the keyboard and a cartridge slot covered by a door on the top of the machine. The 400 has a membrane keyboard. The 800 has full-travel keys, a second, rarely used, cartridge slot, and monitor output. Both have expandable memory (up to 48 KB); the RAM slots are easily accessible in the 800. Later PAL versions have the 6502C processor.
* 1200XL (1983) – new aluminum and smoked plastic case. Includes 64 KB of RAM, two joystick ports, a Help key, and four function keys. Some older software was incompatible with the new OS. Starting with the 1200XL, the single cartridge slot is on the side of the case, and there are only 2 joystick ports.
* 600XL and 800XL (1983) – the 600XL has 16 KB of memory and PAL versions have a monitor port. The 800XL has 64 KB and monitor output. Both have built-in BASIC and a Parallel Bus Interface (PBI) expansion port. The last produced PAL units contain the Atari FREDDIE chip and Atari BASIC revision C.
* 65XE and 130XE (1985) – the 65XE has 64 KB of RAM. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM and an Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI) instead of a PBI. The first revisions of the 65XE have no ECI or PBI, and the later ones contain the ECI. The 65XE was relabelled as 800XE due to the local popularity of the 800XL, and was mostly sold in Central Europe.
* XE Game System (1987) – a 65XE styled as a game console. The basic version of the system shipped without the detachable keyboard. With the keyboard it operates just like other Atari 8-bit computer models. The cartridge slot is on the top, like other consoles.

===Production timeline===
The production timeline is from 1979 to 1987.

=== Prototypes and vaporware ===
* 1400XL: similar to the 1200XL but with a PBI, FREDDIE chip, built-in modem and a Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip. Cancelled.
* 1450XLD: a 1400XL with built-in ″ disk drive and expansion bay for a second ″ disk drive. Code named &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Made it to pre-production, but was abandoned by Tramiel.
* 1600XL: codenamed &quot;Shakti&quot;, this was dual-processor system with 6502 and 80186 processors and two built-in ″ floppy disk drives.
* 1850XL: codenamed &quot;Mickey&quot;, this was to use the &quot;Lorraine&quot; (aka &quot;Amiga&quot;) custom graphics chips
* 65XEM: 65XE with AMY sound synthesis chip. Cancelled.
* 65XEP: &quot;portable&quot; 65XE with &quot; disk drive, 5&quot; green CRT and battery pack.

==Peripherals==

During the lifetime of the 8-bit series, Atari released a large number of peripherals including cassette tape drives, 5.25-inch floppy drives, printers, modems, a touch tablet, and an 80-column display module.

Atari&#x27;s peripherals use the proprietary Atari SIO port, which allows them to be daisy chained together. A primary goal of the Atari computer design was user-friendliness which was assisted by the SIO bus. Since only one kind of connector plug is used for all devices the Atari computer was easy for novice users to expand. Atari SIO devices use an early form of plug-n-play. Peripherals on the bus have their own IDs, and can deliver downloadable drivers to the Atari computer during the boot process. The additional electronics in these peripherals made them cost more than the equivalent &quot;dumb&quot; devices used by other systems of the era.

==Software==
Atari did not initially disclose technical information for its computers, except to software developers who agreed to keep it secret, possibly to increase its own software sales. Cartridge software was so rare at first that &quot;InfoWorld&quot; joked in 1980 that Atari owners might have considered turning the slot &quot;into a fancy ashtray&quot;. The magazine advised them to &quot;clear out those cobwebs&quot; for Atari&#x27;s &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, which became the platform&#x27;s killer app, akin to VisiCalc for the Apple II in its ability to persuade customers to buy the computer.

Chris Crawford and others at Atari published detailed technical information in &quot;De Re Atari&quot;. In 1982, Atari published both the &quot;Atari Home Computer System Hardware Manual&quot; and an annotated source listing of the operating system. These resources resulted in many books and articles about programming the computer&#x27;s custom hardware.

Because of graphics superior to those of the Apple II and Atari&#x27;s home-oriented marketing, games dominated its software library. A 1984 compendium of reviews used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others.

===Built-in operating system===
The Atari 8-bit computers have an operating system built into the ROM. The Atari 400 and 800 have two versions:
*OS Rev. A – 10 KB ROM (3 chips) early machines
*OS Rev. B – 10 KB ROM (3 chips) most common

The XL/XE all have OS revisions, which created compatibility issues with certain software. Atari responded with the Translator Disk, a floppy disk which loads the older 400 and 800 Rev. &#x27;B&#x27; or Rev. &#x27;A&#x27; OS into the XL/XE computers.
*OS Rev. 10 – 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev A
*OS Rev. 11 – 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev B (bug fixes)
*OS Rev. 1 – 16 KB ROM for 600XL
*OS Rev. 2 – 16 KB ROM for 800XL
*OS Rev. 3 – 16 KB ROM for 800XE/130XE
*OS Rev. 4 – 32 KB ROM (16 KB OS + 8 KB BASIC + 8 KB Missile Command) for XEGS

The XL/XE models that followed the 1200XL also have the Atari BASIC ROM built-in, which can be disabled at startup by holding down the silver codice_2 key. Originally this was revision B, which has some serious bugs. Later models have revision C.

===Disk Operating System===
The standard Atari OS only contains low-level routines for accessing floppy disk drives. An extra layer, a disk operating system, is required to assist in organizing file system-level disk access. Atari DOS has to be booted from floppy disk at every power-on or reset. Atari DOS is entirely menu-driven.

*DOS 1.0
*DOS 2.0S – Improved over DOS 1.0; became the standard for the 810 disk drive.
*DOS 3.0 – Came with 1050 drive. Uses a different disk format which is incompatible with DOS 2.0, making it unpopular.
*DOS 2.5 – Replaced DOS 3.0 with later 1050s. Functionally identical to DOS 2.0S, but able to read and write enhanced density disks.
*DOS XE – Designed for the Atari XF551 double-density drive.

Third-party replacement DOSes were also available.

== Legacy ==

At the beginning of 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for all the 8-bit computers. In 2006, Curt Vendel, who designed the Atari Flashback, claimed that Atari released the 8-bit chipset into the public domain. There is agreement in the community that Atari authorized the distribution of the Atari 800&#x27;s ROM with the Xformer 2.5 emulator, which makes the ROM legally available today as freeware.

On March 29, 2024, Atari SA and Retro Games Ltd, via the distributor Plaion, released the Atari 400 Mini, at a cost of £99.99 (€119.99 / $119.99). It is a half-sized scale-model microconsole emulation of the Atari 400, preloaded with 25 games. It comes with an updated Atari CX40 joystick with additional buttons.

<doc id="63433" wikidata="Q754477" url="?curid=63433" title="Treebeard">
<text>Treebeard, or Fangorn in Sindarin, is a tree-giant character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He is an Ent and is said by Gandalf to be &quot;the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth.&quot; He lives in the ancient Forest of Fangorn, to which he has given his name. It lies at the southern end of the Misty Mountains. He is described as being about 14 feet (4.5 m) in height, and in appearance similar to a beech or an oak.

In &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Treebeard meets with Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took, two Hobbits of the Shire. This meeting proves to have consequences that contribute significantly to the story and enables the events that occur in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

== Fangorn&#x27;s forest ==

The Forest of Fangorn was at the south-eastern end of the Misty Mountains near the Gap of Rohan. The mountains formed the western border of Fangorn. At the end of the mountain range stood Saruman&#x27;s stronghold of Isengard near the southwestern corner of the forest. To the east and south of Fangorn was the land of Rohan, and Lothlórien lay to the north and slightly east. Fangorn Forest stretched for many miles and held many paths.

Two significant rivers ran through the forest. To the north the Limlight flowed from the woods and then formed the northern border of Rohan. The river then merged into the larger Anduin. In the south, the Entwash spread deep into the forest arriving from Methedras, a mountainous region located near the Misty Mountains. The river then flowed through Rohan to the great river, the Anduin. The valley of Derndingle was to the south-west. There was a path where the Entwash passed into a region called Wellinghall with one of Treebeard&#x27;s homes.

Fangorn Forest was said to be humid, and trunks and branches of many kinds of tree grew thick, allowing little light to penetrate. Huorns also lived deep within the forest, like Ents but more discreet. The Ents and Huorns drank from the river Entwash, and from it the Ents brewed their legendary drink, the Ent-draughts.

== Fictional biography ==

Ents were created in the Elder Days to be the &quot;Shepherds of the Trees&quot; and protect trees from the anticipated destruction that Dwarves would cause. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Treebeard recounts to the hobbits Merry and Pippin how the Ents were &quot;awakened&quot; and taught to speak by the Elves. He says that only three Ents remain from the Elder Days: himself, Leaflock and Skinbark. He recalls when he could walk through the woods of Middle-earth for days. He sings a song about roaming the woods of Middle-earth, naming regions of Beleriand which were destroyed in the war with Morgoth and now lie &quot;beneath the waves.&quot; He says there are valleys in Fangorn forest where the Great Darkness, the period of Morgoth&#x27;s rule before the arising of the Moon and Sun, never lifted, and the trees are older than he.

Treebeard is described in some detail:

Treebeard learns that the hobbits think that Gandalf is dead, though apparently he knows otherwise. He takes them to a place called Wellinghall, where the hobbits tell him their adventures and of Saruman&#x27;s treachery. Treebeard replies that there is &quot;something very big going on, that I can see&quot;, and comments that the hobbits &quot;seem to be caught up in a great storm.&quot;

Treebeard muses, &quot;I must do something, I suppose.&quot; He recalls although he told Saruman many things, Saruman never told him anything. He realizes that Saruman is plotting to be &quot;a Power&quot;, and wonders what evil he is really doing: why has Saruman taken up with Orcs, why there are so many Orcs in his woods, and why these Orcs are able to bear sunlight. He is angered by trees being felled &quot;to feed the fires of Orthanc&quot;. He overcomes his anger and then, thinking aloud, begins to make plans for the next day, and tells Merry and Pippin about the Entwives. 

The next day, Treebeard announces that he has been busy, and they will drink and then go to the Entmoot, a gathering of Ents. He carries them there; the gathering lasts three days. It ends with all the Ents shouting, and then singing a marching song and striding to Isengard with Treebeard in the lead: &quot;the last march of the Ents&quot;, as Treebeard calls it. Huorns follow, marching, as they later discover, to the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep.

The Ents arrive at Isengard as Saruman&#x27;s army is leaving, and they wait until it has gone. Treebeard bangs on the gates and shouts for Saruman to come forth. Saruman refuses, and the Ents attack. They reduce the outer walls to rubble and destroy much of what is inside. Treebeard gets the Ents to divert the river Isen, drowning the ruined fortress and its underground furnaces and workshops. Saruman is left in the impregnable tower, surrounded by water and watchful Ents.

A delegation led by Gandalf arrives at Isengard and, except for Gandalf, are amazed that it has been destroyed. Treebeard promises that Saruman will remain in the tower.

Treebeard is still at Isengard, now renamed the Treegarth of Orthanc, when a group led by Aragorn, King of Gondor, arrives after the victory over Sauron, made possible partly because the Ents had helped to destroy Saruman&#x27;s forces. Treebeard admits that he had let Saruman go. Gandalf gently chastises him, saying that Saruman might have persuaded Treebeard to let him go by &quot;the poison of his voice.&quot; Treebeard delivers the keys of Orthanc to the King, who gives the valley of Orthanc to Treebeard and his ents.

== Analysis ==

=== In-fiction origins ===

In Sindarin, one of Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish languages, &quot;Fangorn&quot; is a compound of &quot;fanga&quot;, &quot;beard&quot;, and &quot;orne&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, so it is the equivalent of the English &quot;Treebeard&quot;. The Riders of Rohan called Fangorn Forest the &quot;Entwood&quot;, the wood of the Ents. Treebeard gave it various names in Quenya, another Elvish language: &quot;Ambaróna&quot; means &quot;uprising, sunrise, orient&quot; from &quot;amba&quot;, &quot;upwards&quot; and &quot;róna&quot;, &quot;east&quot;. &quot;Aldalómë&quot; means &quot;tree twilight&quot; from &quot;alda&quot;, &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;lómë&quot;, &quot;dusk, twilight&quot;. &quot;Tauremorna&quot; means &quot;gloomy forest&quot; from &quot;taur&quot;, &quot;forest&quot;, and &quot;morna&quot;, &quot;gloomy&quot;. &quot;Tauremornalómë&quot; means &quot;gloomy twilight forest&quot;. 

=== Medieval echoes ===

The word &quot;Ent&quot; was taken from the Old English &quot;&quot; or &quot;eoten&quot;, meaning &quot;giant&quot;. Tolkien borrowed the word from a phrase in the Anglo-Saxon poems &quot;The Ruin&quot; and &quot;Maxims II&quot;, &quot;orþanc enta geweorc&quot; (&quot;cunning work of giants&quot;), which describes Roman ruins in Britain.

The philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that Treebeard says farewell to the elf-rulers Celeborn and Galadriel &quot;with great reverence&quot; and the words &quot;It is long, long since we met by stock or by stone&quot;, in words which echo a line in the Middle English poem &quot;Pearl&quot;: &quot;We meten so selden by stok other stone&quot;. Where in &quot;Pearl&quot; the mention of stock and stone means in earthy reality, Shippey writes, the phrase fits the Fangorn context well, since Treebeard&#x27;s &quot;sense of ultimate loss naturally centres on felled trees and barren ground.&quot;

=== Environmentalism ===

Matthew T. Dickerson and Jonathan Evans see Treebeard as vocalizing a vital part of Tolkien&#x27;s environmental ethic, the need to preserve and look after every kind of wild place, especially forests. Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth writes that &quot;A deep feeling for trees is Tolkien&#x27;s most distinctive response to the natural world.&quot;

=== Professorial figure ===

Shippey, who like Tolkien had been a university professor, writes that Fangorn&#x27;s explanations are &quot;authoritative and indeed .. &#x27;professorial&#x27;. They admit no denial.&quot; Tolkien&#x27;s biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, wrote that Treebeard&#x27;s deep booming voice with his &quot;hrum, hoom&quot; mannerism was based on that of Tolkien&#x27;s friend, fellow-Inkling, and professor of English at the University of Oxford, C. S. Lewis.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

Treebeard has inspired artists and illustrators such as Inger Edelfeldt, John Howe, Ted Nasmith, Anke Eißmann, and Alan Lee. In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, John Westbrook provided the voice of Treebeard. Stephen Thorne voiced the character in BBC Radio&#x27;s 1981 serialization.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s films &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also portrays Gimli. Jackson&#x27;s interpretation of Treebeard makes him far more suspicious of the Hobbits (as possible Orcs) than Tolkien does, and far more reluctant to go to war with Saruman until he sees the damage done to the forest.

A 6-metre-high sculpture of Treebeard by Tolkien&#x27;s great-nephew Tim Tolkien received planning permission in Birmingham, where Tolkien grew up. On The Tolkien Ensemble&#x27;s album &quot;At Dawn in Rivendell&quot;, Treebeard is voiced by Christopher Lee.

<doc id="63435" wikidata="Q7684474" url="?curid=63435" title="Three men's morris">
<text>Three men&#x27;s morris is an abstract strategy game played on a three by three board (counting lines) 
that is similar to tic-tac-toe. It is also related to six men&#x27;s morris and nine men&#x27;s morris. A player wins by forming a mill, that is, three of their own pieces in a row.

== Rules ==
Each player has three pieces. The winner is the first player to align their three pieces on a line drawn on the board. There are 3 horizontal lines, 3 vertical lines and 2 diagonal lines.

The board is empty to begin the game, and players take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections. Once all pieces are placed (assuming there is no winner by then), play proceeds with each player moving one of their pieces per turn. A piece may move to any vacant point on the board, not just an adjacent one.

According to H. J. R. Murray’s &quot;A History of Chess&quot;, there is an alternative version in which pieces may not move to any vacant point, but only to any &quot;adjacent&quot; linked empty position, i.e. from a corner to the middle of an adjacent edge, from the middle of an edge to the center or an adjacent corner, or from the center to the middle of an edge. Murray calls the first version &quot;nine holes&quot; and the second version &quot;three men&#x27;s morris&quot; or &quot;the smaller merels&quot;.
In this variant of the game, there is a winning strategy for the player who goes first, unless the first player is not allowed to place the first piece in the centre, in which case neither player has a winning strategy.

== History ==
According to R. C. Bell, the earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was &quot;cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt&quot;; he estimated a date for them of  BCE. However, Friedrich Berger wrote that some of the diagrams at Kurna include Coptic crosses, making it &quot;doubtful&quot; that the diagrams date to 1400 BCE. Berger concluded, &quot;certainly they cannot be dated.&quot; When played on this board, the game is called &quot;tapatan&quot; in the Philippines and &quot;luk tsut k&#x27;i&quot; (&#x27;six man chess&#x27;) in China. It is thought that &quot;luk tsut k&#x27;i&quot; was played during the time of Confucius, c. 500 BCE. Centuries later, the game was mentioned in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot;, according to R. C. Bell. In book III (c. 8 CE), after discussing , a popular board game, Ovid wrote:
This, translated, says:

There is another game divided into as many parts as there are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a girl not to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play. Boards were carved into the cloister seats at the English cathedrals at Canterbury, Gloucester, Norwich, Salisbury and Westminster Abbey; the game was quite popular in England in the 13th century. These boards used holes, not lines, to represent the nine spaces on the board—hence the name &quot;nine-holes&quot;—and forming a diagonal row did not win the game.

The name of the game may be related to Morris dances (and hence to Moorish). However, according to Daniel King, &quot;the word &#x27;morris&#x27; has nothing to do with the old English dance of the same name. It comes from the Latin word , which means a counter or gaming piece.&quot;

==Related games==
* Six men&#x27;s morris and nine men&#x27;s morris use six and nine pieces, respectively, and are played on different boards.
* In tic-tac-toe, pieces are placed (or marks are made) until the board is full; if neither player has an orthogonal or diagonal line at this point, the game is a draw.
* Extended tic-tac-toe, like the three men&#x27;s morris game, each player has three pieces, but when moving pieces, players must first move their first pieces, then the second pieces, then the third pieces, then the first pieces, and so on. This game is harder than both tic-tac-toe and three men&#x27;s morris, but the first player has a way to win by taking the edge first. Alternatively, by taking the center or corner first, the game will be drawn.
* &quot;Tapatan&quot;, from Philippine, the same game with additional rule that pieces can only move to adjacent spaces.
* &quot;Marelle&quot;, from France, the same game with additional rule that pieces can only move to adjacent spaces and the center space (central intersection point) cannot be used until after each player drops their first piece.
* &quot;Tant Fant&quot;, from India, the same game with additional rule that pieces can only move to adjacent spaces and the pieces are already dropped before the game is started.
* &quot;Achi&quot;, from Ghana, the same game with additional rule that pieces can only move to adjacent spaces, and each player has four (instead of three) pieces.
* &quot;Picaria&quot;, a Native American variation invented in New Mexico, adds diagonal attachments to the central edge points, yielding four additional interior points each located between the center and corner points, may have 9 or 13 spaces, the center space (central intersection point) cannot be used until after each player drops their first piece (a variant is the center space cannot be used after all pieces are dropped).
