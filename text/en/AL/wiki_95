<text>The Amiga 600, also known as the A600, and full title Commodore Amiga 600, is a home computer introduced in March 1992. It is the final Amiga model based on the Motorola 68000 and the 1990 Amiga Enhanced Chip Set. A redesign of the Amiga 500 Plus, it adds the option of an internal hard disk drive and a PCMCIA port. Lacking a numeric keypad, the A600 is only slightly larger than an IBM PC keyboard, weighing approximately 6 pounds (2.72kg). It shipped with AmigaOS 2.0, which was considered more user-friendly than earlier versions of the operating system.

Like the A500, the A600 was aimed at the lower end of the market. Commodore intended it to revitalize sales of the A500-related line before the introduction of the 32-bit Amiga 1200. According to Dave Haynie, the A600 &quot;was supposed to be cheaper than the A500, but it came in at about that much more expensive.&quot; The A600 was originally to have been numbered the A300, positioning it as a lower-budget version of the Amiga 500 Plus.

An A600HD model was sold with an internal 2.5&quot; ATA hard disk drive of either 20 or 40 MB.

Due to the inclusion of Kickstart 2.05, many software titles made for A1000 or A500 do not work on A600. A program, Relokick, was released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a Kickstart 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing most incompatible software to run. Because Relokick itself occupies 512 KB of memory, some titles would not work unless the A600 was fitted with a 1 MB trapdoor memory expansion.

==Development and release==
Commodore Business Machines began the process of drastically changing its management in late 1990, when Irving Gould, its CEO and chairman, laid off six of its high-level executives. In the spring of 1991, Mehdi Ali, a former investment banker at Prudential Investments, was promoted to president of Commodore, and continued a program he started in 1989 involving cuts to the budget and staff, mostly from the sales and manufacturing divisions.

After the release of the Amiga 3000T, Commodore&#x27;s next project was a next-generation Amiga chipset, which became the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA). Concurrently, engineers Dave Haynie, Jeff Porter, and Eric Lavitsky began work on Amiga 3000+, which would have been the first computer to use the AGA chipset, and Joe Augenbraun was behind the Amiga 1000+, which also would have used the chipset. Meanwhile, George Robbins designed another low-end project called the Amiga 300. The computer, codenamed &quot;June Bug&quot;, had a floppy drive built in and was roughly the same size and weight as a Commodore 64. Development took a turn on all three projects when Ali dismissed the engineering management team and appointed former IBM executive Bill Sydnes as the company&#x27;s engineering manager. Sydnes canceled the A1000+ and A3000+ models and delayed the AGA chipset, but simply changed the A300&#x27;s design goals.

The model was launched in mid-March 1992 as the Amiga 600, superseding the A500. Units were manufactured in Commodore&#x27;s production plants in Irvine, Scotland; Braunschweig, Germany; Kwai Chung, Hong Kong; and the Philippines. In the United States, it and its hard disk drive variant, the Amiga 600HD, sold for and , respectively, the former of which was about $50 more than an A500 while the two systems were on sale, although the A600 was supposed to be sold for about that much less. Snydes canceled the still-popular A500 that year to ensure demand for the new system, and development on the Amiga series stalled for the first six months as he and Ali focused on targeting the PC marketplace while selling the new model. The Amiga 600 was discontinued in late 1993.

The machine is reported to have sold 193,000 units in Germany.

===Bundled software===
In addition to the stock A600, mouse, power supply, and Workbench disk package, the A600 was available with the following software and hardware bundles:

*&#x27;Lemmings&#x27; bundle (1992): &quot;Lemmings&quot; and the Electronic Arts graphics package &quot;Deluxe Paint III&quot;
*&#x27;Robocop 3D&#x27; bundle (1992): &quot;Robocop 3D&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Beast III&quot;, &quot;Graphic Workshop&quot; and &quot;Microtext&quot;
*&#x27;Wild, Weird and Wicked&#x27; bundle (late 1992, £349 launch price): &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Pushover&quot;, &quot;Putty&quot; and &quot;Deluxe Paint III&quot;
* A600HD &#x27;Epic/Language&#x27; bundle (late 1992, £499 launch price): including an internal 20 MB hard disk drive, &quot;Deluxe Paint III&quot;, a word processor, &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Epic&quot;

==Technical information==
The A600 shipped with a Motorola 68000 CPU, running at 7.09 MHz (PAL) or 7.16 MHz (NTSC) and 1 MB &quot;chip&quot; RAM with 80 ns access time.

===Graphics and sound===
The A600 is the last Amiga model to use Commodore&#x27;s Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), which can address 2 MB of Amiga Chip RAM and adds higher resolution display modes. The so-called Super Agnus display chip can drive screen modes varying from 320×200 pixels to 1280×512 pixels, with different frequency sync. As with the original Amiga chipset, up to 32 colors can be displayed from a 12-bit (4096 color) palette at lower display resolutions. An extra-half-bright mode offers 64 simultaneous colors by allowing each of the 32 colors in the palette to be dimmed to half brightness. Additionally, a 4096-color &quot;HAM&quot; mode can be used at lower resolutions. At higher resolutions, such as 800×600i, only 4 simultaneous colors can be displayed.

Sound was unchanged from the original Amiga design, namely, 4 DMA-driven 8-bit channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.

The A600 was the first Amiga model with built-in color composite video (RCA), which allowed the A600 to be used with a standard CRT television without the need for a Commodore A520 RF Modulator adaptor.

===Peripherals and expansion===
The A600 features Amiga-specific connectors including two DB9M ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin RS-232 serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, the A600 is compatible with many peripherals available for earlier Amiga models, such as MIDI, sound samplers and video-capture devices.

Expansion capabilities new to the Amiga line were the PCMCIA Type II slot and the internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers. Both interfaces are controlled by the &#x27;Gayle&#x27; custom chip. The A600 has internal housing for one 2.5&quot; internal hard disk drive connecting to the ATA controller.

The A600 is the first of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This connector allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop-computer market, although only 16-bit PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit PC Card (CardBus) peripherals are incompatible. Mechanically, only Type I and Type II cards fit in the slot; thicker Type III cards will not fit (although they may connect if the A600 is removed from its original case). The port is also not fully compliant with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM cards, CD-ROM controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore&#x27;s expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and CompactFlash adapters.

===Operating system===
The A600 shipped with AmigaOS 2.0, consisting of Workbench 2.0 and a Kickstart ROM revision 37.299, 37.300 or 37.350 (Commodore&#x27;s internal revision numbers). Confusingly, all three ROM revisions were officially designated as version &quot;2.05&quot;. Some early A600s shipped with Kickstart 37.299, which had neither support for the internal ATA controller, nor for the PCMCIA interface. Although it is possible to load the necessary drivers from floppy disk, it is not possible to boot directly from ATA or PCMCIA devices. Models fitted with Kickstart 37.300 or 37.350 can utilize those devices at boot time. Version 37.350 improved compatibility with ATA hard disks by increasing the wait time for disks to spin up during boot.

==Upgrades==

===CPU===
Despite that the 68000 is soldered to the motherboard, unofficial CPU upgrades include the Motorola 68000 (at higher clock speeds than the default 7.16 MHz or 7.09 MHz), 68010, 68020 (at up to 25 MHz), 68030 (at up to 50 MHz) and FPGA-based processors which are programmed to utilize the Motorola 680x0 instruction set. The processor is upgraded not by replacing the 68000, but rather by fitting a connector over the CPU and commandeering the system bus. 

===Memory===
RAM can be upgraded to a maximum of 2 MB Chip RAM using the trap-door expansion slot. An additional 4 MB of Fast RAM can be added in the PC Card slot using a suitable SRAM card to reach a capacity of 6 MB. However, additional Fast RAM can be added with unofficial memory or CPU upgrades. For example, the A608 board adds up to a maximum of 8 MB additional RAM by connecting over the original 68000. Likewise, CPU upgrades can accommodate up to 512 MB.

===Operating system===
It is possible to upgrade the A600 to Workbench 2.1. This features a localization of the operating system in several languages and has a &quot;CrossDOS&quot; driver providing read/write support for FAT (MS-DOS)-formatted media such as floppy disks or hard drives. Workbench 2.1 was a software only update which runs on all Kickstart ROMs of the 2.0x family.

Following the release of AmigaOS 3.1 in 1994 it is possible to upgrade the A600 by installing a compatible revision 40.63 Kickstart ROM.

The A600 also supports AmigaOS 3.2.x, which is maintained by Hyperion Entertainment. This requires the installation of a compatible revision 47.96 Kickstart ROM and additional memory over and above the default 1 MB.

===Other===
The FPGA-driven Apollo Vampire V2 adds 128 MB Fast RAM, HDMI output, SD card for HDD storage and a 64-bit core with full 32-bit compatibility.

Additionally, the Apollo Manticore (Apollo Vampire V4) adds 512 MB DD3 RAM (500Mb Fast RAM and 12Mb Chip RAM), HDMI output, SD card for HDD storage (this device cannot be booted from), 64-bit &quot;68080&quot; core with full 32-bit compatibility, 2 x USB ports, 8/16-bit, 56 kHz, 24-bit audio with 16 DMA voices, 44-pin FastIDE for Compact Flash or 2.5&quot; IDE hard disk support, 10/100 RJ45 Ethernet port, RTC support and RTG video capable of 3D graphics up to 1920x1080 resolution at 60Hz. The Apollo Manticore also includes a &quot;Super AGA&quot; FPGA-driven chipset. Apart from providing RTG, it allows the Amiga 600 to run AGA software titles which would normally only run on the Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000 or Amiga 4000T.

==Reception==
Contemporaneous reviews of the Amiga 600 were mixed. The magazine &quot;Amazing Computing&quot; called it &quot;an Amiga Warrior that offers an enormous opportunity to Amiga computing and the consumer market&quot;, saying that it struck a balance between two markets of cartridge-based game consoles and home and business computers. It wrote that the changes to the model were incremental, rather than revolutionary, as only its design was substantially revised and not the Amiga computer itself—an important consideration for potential buyers who already owned an Amiga 500. The decision to solder all circuitry other than the ROM chip on the motherboard, it said, allowed Commodore to manufacture a model that was more compact and more reliable, albeit with new hurdles on internal upgrading. The PCMCIA slot was viewed as an advantageous measure eliminating almost all possibilities of software piracy, and while the magazine noted that a majority of expansion hardware for the A500 would not work with this model, it believed the same community that reversed the expansion hardware&#x27;s A1000 ports for use by A500 systems would supply the A600 with many peripherals.

&quot;Amiga Computing&quot; reviewed the original and hard drive models and was more favorable to the latter. It found that the A600 model performed about as fast as an Amiga 500 Plus computer, but it praised the A600HD variant&#x27;s use of a hard drive as offering the user more storage space and functionality than any other low-end Amiga model. Regarding both models, it praised the addition of an RF port, but criticized the power supply brick as the only impediment to the computers&#x27; advertised portability. It considered compatibility issues arising from software requiring the numeric keypad to be insignificant. However, while writing that the move to use surface-mounted technology made the computer more reliable and less prone to error, it conceded that it also meant that attempts to upgrade it internally had more obstacles. It also criticized the lack of the DMA expansion slot. Nevertheless, the magazine predicted that the A600HD model would capture the hobbyist market and stimulate the production of hard drive-installable games.

Conversely, editor-in-chief of &quot;Amiga World&quot; Doug Barney took a more negative stance on the A600. He similarly criticized the need for the power brick, and also questioned Commodore&#x27;s design choices, in particular, removing the expansion slot, retaining the Motorola 68000 processor, and replacing an A501 connector with an A601 one, although not minding the loss of the numeric keypad. He further took issue with the barriers to upgrading the machine internally. He said the model was best suited for users who needed to travel with it and are not interested in expanding their systems but saw no incentive for users who wanted upgradeability.

Internal reception among Commodore employees was also negative. The managing director of Commodore UK, David Pleasance, described the A600 as a &quot;complete and utter screw-up&quot;. Disgruntled Commodore engineers nicknamed the model the &quot;Amiga Junior&quot;, a reference to Sydnes&#x27; previous project of which he was in charge while at IBM, the IBM PCjr, which was a critical and commercial failure. Nonetheless, in Germany, it became the second-best-selling Amiga model, with 193,000 units sold. Dave Haynie, who worked as a senior engineer for Commodore, described the new features the A600 provided as bloat and noted its compatibility issues with A500 peripherals and lack of numeric keypad. Another Commodore engineer Bil Herd, pointed to a disconnect between the company&#x27;s design team, its marketing team, and the demands of the marketplace. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; considers it to be the worst of Commodore&#x27;s Amiga models, citing its higher price and fewer features compared to the Amiga 500, while also noting that markets were overstocked with A600 units at the same time that the more popular A500 and A1200 models were under-manufactured.

<text>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation that are excessive and pervasive, impairing in multiple contexts, and developmentally inappropriate. ADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction.

Impairments resulting from deficits in self-regulation such as time management, inhibition, task initiation, and sustained attention can include poor professional performance, relationship difficulties, and numerous health risks, collectively predisposing to a diminished quality of life and a reduction in life expectancy. It is associated with other mental disorders as well as non-psychiatric disorders, which can cause additional impairment. The disorder costs society hundreds of billions of US dollars each year, worldwide.

While people with ADHD often struggle to initiate work and persist on tasks with delayed consequences, this may not be evident in contexts they find intrinsically interesting and immediately rewarding, a symptom colloquially known as hyperfocus. This mental state is often hard to disengage from and is related to risks such as for internet addiction.

ADHD can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions. It represents the extreme lower end of the continuous dimensional trait (bell curve) of executive functioning and self-regulation, which is supported by twin, brain imaging and molecular genetic studies.
The precise causes of ADHD are unknown in most individual cases. Meta-analyses have shown that the disorder is primarily genetic with a heritability rate of 70-80%, where risk factors are highly accumulative. The environmental risks are not related to social or familial factors; they exert their effects very early in life, in the prenatal or early postnatal period. However, in rare cases, ADHD can be caused by a single event including traumatic brain injury, exposure to biohazards during pregnancy, or a major genetic mutation. As it is a neurodevelopmental disorder, there is no biologically distinct adult-onset ADHD except for when ADHD occurs after traumatic brain injury.

==Signs and symptoms==

Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD. Academic difficulties are frequent, as are problems with relationships. The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.

According to the fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) and its text revision (DSM-5-TR), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age. This requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least five symptoms for those 17 years or older. The symptoms must be present in at least two settings (e.g., social, school, work, or home), and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning. Additionally, several symptoms must have been present before age 12. The DSM-5 &#x27;s required age of onset of symptoms is 12 years. However, research indicates the age of onset should not be interpreted as a prerequisite for diagnosis given contextual exceptions.

=== Presentations ===

ADHD is divided into three primary presentations:
* predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)
* predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)
* combined presentation (ADHD-C).

The table &quot;Symptoms&quot; lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD-HI from two major classification systems. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for that person. In DSM-5, subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change over time.
Girls and women with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms of inattention and distractibility.

Symptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages. Hyperactivity tends to become less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness, difficulty relaxing or remaining still, talkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with ADHD. Impulsivity in adulthood may appear as thoughtless behaviour, impatience, irresponsible spending and sensation-seeking behaviours, while inattention may appear as becoming easily bored, difficulty with organization, remaining on task and making decisions, and sensitivity to stress.

====Characteristics in childhood====
Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD, as are delays in speech, language and motor development. Poorer handwriting is more common in children with ADHD. Poor handwriting can be a symptom of ADHD in itself due to decreased attentiveness. When this is a pervasive problem, it may also be attributable to dyslexia or dysgraphia. There is significant overlap in the symptomatologies of ADHD, dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and 3 in 10 people diagnosed with dyslexia experience co-occurring ADHD. Although it causes significant difficulty, many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting.

===Emotional dysregulation===
Although not listed as an official symptom, emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally understood to be a common symptom of ADHD.

===Relationship difficulties===
People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills, such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. This is true for all presentations. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They may also drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills.

===Hyperfocus===
An association between ADHD and hyperfocus, a state characterised by intense and narrow concentration on a specific stimulus, object or task for a prolonged period of time, has been widely reported in the popular science press and media. The phenomenon generally occurs when an individual is engaged in activities they find highly interesting, or which provide instant gratification, such as video games or online chatting. Hyperfocus is not a recognised symptom of ADHD in diagnostic manuals, but is frequently referred to as a symptom of ADHD in academic literature and commonly reported in patients with ADHD in clinical practice. There is a lack of research into hyperfocus in ADHD. Studies in 2016, 2019 and 2024 found that individuals with ADHD diagnoses or self-reported ADHD symptoms experience hyperfocus more often, or more acutely. A 2020 study did not find a higher frequency of hyperfocus in adults with ADHD, although it reported a positive correlation with self-reported ADHD traits. The discrepancy with other studies may reflect varying definitions and conceptions of hyperfocus.

A state of hyperfocus has been hypothesised as being beneficial, allowing individuals to focus on tasks for much longer than is typical. Conversely, it can be difficult to disengage from and shift attention to other stimuli or tasks, leading to excessively prolonged attention. It is related to risks such as internet addiction (see ) and to some types of offending behaviour. Recent research has linked hyperfocus to the psychological concepts of flow, an enjoyable experience of deep engagement in an activity, and perseveration, difficulty disengaging or switching from an activity.

===IQ test performance===
Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over-represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures. However, other studies contradict this, saying that in individuals with high intelligence, there is an increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in said individuals.

Studies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems.

==Comorbidities==

===Psychiatric comorbidities===
In children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time.

Other neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), co-occurring at a rate of 21% in those with ADHD, affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and interests. Learning disabilities have been found to occur in about 20–30% of children with ADHD. Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders, and academic skills disorders. ADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes academic difficulties. Intellectual disabilities and Tourette&#x27;s syndrome are also common.

ADHD is often comorbid with disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) occurs in about 25% of children with an inattentive presentation and 50% of those with a combined presentation. It is characterised by angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are age-inappropriate. Conduct disorder (CD) is another common comorbid disorder of adolescents with ADHD, and occurs in 25% of individuals with combined presentation. It is characterised by aggression, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft and violations of rules. Adolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. Brain imaging supports that CD and ADHD are separate conditions: conduct disorder was shown to reduce the size of one&#x27;s temporal lobe and limbic system, and increase the size of one&#x27;s orbitofrontal cortex, whereas ADHD was shown to reduce connections in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex more broadly. Conduct disorder involves more impairment in motivation control than ADHD. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by sudden and disproportionate outbursts of anger and co-occurs in individuals with ADHD more frequently than in the general population.

Anxiety and mood disorders are frequent comorbidities. Anxiety disorders have been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population, as have mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder). Boys diagnosed with the combined ADHD subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder. Adults and children with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder, which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions.

Sleep disorders and ADHD commonly co-exist. They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat ADHD. In children with ADHD, insomnia is the most common sleep disorder with behavioural therapy being the preferred treatment. Problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning. Melatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia. Restless legs syndrome has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to iron deficiency anemia. However, restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder is also a common comorbidity.

Individuals with ADHD are at increased risk of substance use disorders. This is most commonly seen with alcohol or cannabis. The reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of ADHD individuals, self-treatment and increased psychosocial risk factors. This makes the evaluation and treatment of ADHD more difficult, with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks. Other psychiatric conditions include reactive attachment disorder, characterised by a severe inability to appropriately relate socially, and cognitive disengagement syndrome, a distinct attention disorder occurring in 30–50% of ADHD cases as a comorbidity, regardless of the presentation; a subset of cases diagnosed with ADHD-PIP have been found to have CDS instead. Individuals with ADHD are three times more likely to be diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without ADHD; conversely, individuals with eating disorders are two times more likely to have ADHD than those without eating disorders.

===Trauma===
ADHD, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences are also comorbid, which could in part be potentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses. The symptoms of ADHD and PTSD can have significant behavioural overlap—in particular, motor restlessness, difficulty concentrating, distractibility, irritability/anger, emotional constriction or dysregulation, poor impulse control, and forgetfulness are common in both. This could result in trauma-related disorders or ADHD being mis-identified as the other. Additionally, traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for ADHD; they can lead to structural brain changes and the development of ADHD behaviours. Finally, the behavioural consequences of ADHD symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual experiencing trauma (and therefore ADHD leads to a concrete diagnosis of a trauma-related disorder).

===Non-psychiatric===
Some non-psychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of ADHD. This includes epilepsy, a neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures. There are well established associations between ADHD and obesity, asthma and sleep disorders, and an association with celiac disease. Children with ADHD have a higher risk for migraine headaches, but have no increased risk of tension-type headaches. Children with ADHD may also experience headaches as a result of medication.

A 2021 review reported that several neurometabolic disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered central in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment. This highlights the importance of close collaboration between health services to avoid clinical overshadowing.

In June 2021, &quot;Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews&quot; published a systematic review of 82 studies that all confirmed or implied elevated accident-proneness in ADHD patients and whose data suggested that the type of accidents or injuries and overall risk changes in ADHD patients over the lifespan. In January 2014, &quot;Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention&quot; published a meta-analysis of 16 studies examining the relative risk of traffic collisions for drivers with ADHD, finding an overall relative risk estimate of 1.36 without controlling for exposure, a relative risk estimate of 1.29 when controlling for publication bias, a relative risk estimate of 1.23 when controlling for exposure, and a relative risk estimate of 1.86 for ADHD drivers with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder comorbidities.

===Problematic digital media use===

===Suicide risk===
Systematic reviews in 2017 and 2020 found strong evidence that ADHD is associated with increased suicide risk across all age groups, as well as growing evidence that an ADHD diagnosis in childhood or adolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor. Potential causes include ADHD&#x27;s association with functional impairment, negative social, educational and occupational outcomes, and financial distress. A 2019 meta-analysis indicated a significant association between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours (suicidal attempts, ideations, plans, and completed suicides); across the studies examined, the prevalence of suicide attempts in individuals with ADHD was 18.9%, compared to 9.3% in individuals without ADHD, and the findings were substantially replicated among studies which adjusted for other variables. However, the relationship between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours remains unclear due to mixed findings across individual studies and the complicating impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders. There is no clear data on whether there is a direct relationship between ADHD and suicidality, or whether ADHD increases suicide risk through comorbidities.

==Causes==
ADHD arises from brain maldevelopment especially in the prefrontal executive networks that can arise either from genetic factors (different gene variants and mutations for building and regulating such networks) or from acquired disruptions to the development of these networks and regions involved in executive functioning and self-regulation. Their reduced size, functional connectivity, and activation contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD, as well as imbalances in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems that mediate these brain regions.

Genetic factors play an important role; ADHD has a heritability rate of 70-80%. The remaining 20-30% of variance is mediated by de-novo mutations and non-shared environmental factors that provide for or produce brain injuries; there is no significant contribution of the rearing family and social environment. Very rarely, ADHD can also be the result of abnormalities in the chromosomes.

=== Genetics ===
In November 1999, &quot;Biological Psychiatry&quot; published a literature review by psychiatrists Joseph Biederman and Thomas Spencer found the average heritability estimate of ADHD from twin studies to be 0.8, while a subsequent family, twin, and adoption studies literature review published in &quot;Molecular Psychiatry&quot; in April 2019 by psychologists Stephen Faraone and Henrik Larsson that found an average heritability estimate of 0.74. Additionally, evolutionary psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse has argued that the 5:1 male-to-female sex ratio in the epidemiology of ADHD suggests that ADHD may be the end of a continuum where males are overrepresented at the tails, citing clinical psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen&#x27;s suggestion for the sex ratio in the epidemiology of autism as an analogue.

Natural selection has been acting against the genetic variants for ADHD over the course of at least 45,000 years, indicating that it was not an adaptive trait in ancient times. The disorder may remain at a stable rate by the balance of genetic mutations and removal rate (natural selection) across generations; over thousands of years, these genetic variants become more stable, decreasing disorder prevalence. Throughout human evolution, the executive functions involved in ADHD likely provide the capacity to bind contingencies across time thereby directing behaviour toward future over immediate events so as to maximise future social consequences for humans.

ADHD has a high heritability of 74%, meaning that 74% of the presence of ADHD in the population is due to genetic factors. There are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person having ADHD; it is polygenic and thus arises through the accumulation of many genetic risks each having a very small effect. The siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder.

The association of maternal smoking observed in large population studies disappears after adjusting for family history of ADHD, which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for the confluence of smoking and ADHD.

ADHD presents with reduced size, functional connectivity and activation as well as low noradrenergic and dopaminergic functioning in brain regions and networks crucial for executive functioning and self-regulation. Typically, a number of genes are involved, many of which directly affect brain functioning and neurotransmission. Those involved with dopamine include DAT, DRD4, DRD5, TAAR1, MAOA, COMT, and DBH. Other genes associated with ADHD include SERT, HTR1B, SNAP25, GRIN2A, ADRA2A, TPH2, and BDNF. A common variant of a gene called latrophilin 3 is estimated to be responsible for about 9% of cases and when this variant is present, people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication. The 7 repeat variant of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4–7R) causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with ADHD. The DRD4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The DRD4–7R mutation results in a wide range of behavioural phenotypes, including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention. The DRD4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD. The genes GFOD1 and CDH13 show strong genetic associations with ADHD. CDH13&#x27;s association with ASD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression make it an interesting candidate causative gene. Another candidate causative gene that has been identified is ADGRL3. In zebrafish, knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral diencephalon and the fish display a hyperactive/impulsive phenotype.

For genetic variation to be used as a tool for diagnosis, more validating studies need to be performed. However, smaller studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in genes related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission or the SNARE complex of the synapse can reliably predict a person&#x27;s response to stimulant medication. Rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance (the chance of developing the disorder) tends to be much higher. However their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD. ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both common and rare levels of genetic variation.

=== Environment ===

In addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD. Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include ADHD or symptoms like it. Children exposed to certain toxic substances, such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls, may develop problems which resemble ADHD. Exposure to the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not conclusive. Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk.

Extreme premature birth, very low birth weight, and extreme neglect, abuse, or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood. These infections include, among others, various viruses (measles, varicella zoster encephalitis, rubella, enterovirus 71). At least 30% of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop ADHD and about 5% of cases are due to brain damage.

Some studies suggest that in a small number of children, artificial food dyes or preservatives may be associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms, but the evidence is weak and may apply to only children with food sensitivities. The European Union has put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns. In a minority of children, intolerances or allergies to certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms.

Individuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having ADHD, raising the possibility that a subtype of ADHD has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a novel way. The sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconate.
Research does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar, watching too much television, bad parenting, poverty or family chaos; however, they might worsen ADHD symptoms in certain people.

In some cases, an inappropriate diagnosis of ADHD may reflect a dysfunctional family or a poor educational system, rather than any true presence of ADHD in the individual. In other cases, it may be explained by increasing academic expectations, with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to obtain extra financial and educational support for their child. Behaviours typical of ADHD occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse.

== Pathophysiology ==
Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain&#x27;s neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. The dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes. The dopamine pathways and norepinephrine pathways which project to the prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for modulating executive function (cognitive control of behaviour), motivation, reward perception, and motor function; these pathways are known to play a central role in the of ADHD. Larger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed.

=== Brain structure ===

In children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided prefrontal cortex. The posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in individuals with ADHD compared to controls. Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD.

The subcortical volumes of the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen appears smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls. Structural MRI studies have also revealed differences in white matter, with marked differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry between ADHD and typically developing youths.

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed a number of differences between ADHD and control brains. Mirroring what is known from structural findings, fMRI studies have shown evidence for a higher connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions, such as between the caudate and prefrontal cortex. The degree of hyperconnectivity between these regions correlated with the severity of inattention or hyperactivity Hemispheric lateralization processes have also been postulated as being implicated in ADHD, but empiric results showed contrasting evidence on the topic.

=== Neurotransmitter pathways ===
Previously, it had been suggested that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology, but it appears the elevated numbers may be due to adaptation following exposure to stimulant medication. Current models involve the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway and the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system. ADHD psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. There may additionally be abnormalities in serotonergic, glutamatergic, or cholinergic pathways.

=== Executive function and motivation ===
ADHD arises from a core deficit in executive functions (e.g., attentional control, inhibitory control, and working memory), which are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviours that facilitate the attainment of one&#x27;s chosen goals. The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organised, time keeping, procrastination control, maintaining concentration, paying attention, ignoring distractions, regulating emotions, and remembering details. People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long-term memory, and deficits in long-term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory. Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older, ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood. Conversely, brain maturation trajectories, potentially exhibiting diverging longitudinal trends in ADHD, may support a later improvement in executive functions after reaching adulthood.

ADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to focus on long-term over short-term rewards, and exhibit impulsive behaviour for short-term rewards.

=== Paradoxical reaction to neuroactive substances ===
Another sign of the structurally altered signal processing in the central nervous system in this group of people is the conspicuously common paradoxical reaction ( of patients). These are unexpected reactions in the opposite direction as with a normal effect, or otherwise significant different reactions. These are reactions to neuroactive substances such as local anesthetic at the dentist, sedative, caffeine, antihistamine, weak neuroleptics and central and peripheral painkillers. Since the causes of &quot;paradoxical reactions&quot; are at least partly genetic, it may be useful in critical situations, for example before operations, to ask whether such abnormalities may also exist in family members.

==Diagnosis==
ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a person&#x27;s behavioural and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications, and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms. ADHD diagnosis often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns. While many tools exist to aid in the diagnosis of ADHD, their validity varies in different populations, and a reliable and valid diagnosis requires confirmation by a clinician while supplemented by standardized rating scales and input from multiple informants across various settings.
The diagnosis of ADHD has been criticised as being subjective because it is not based on a biological test. The International Consensus Statement on ADHD concluded that this criticism is unfounded, on the basis that ADHD meets standard criteria for validity of a mental disorder established by Robins and Guze. They attest that the disorder is considered valid because: 1) well-trained professionals in a variety of settings and cultures agree on its presence or absence using well-defined criteria and 2) the diagnosis is useful for predicting a) additional problems the patient may have (e.g., difficulties learning in school); b) future patient outcomes (e.g., risk for future drug abuse); c) response to treatment (e.g., medications and psychological treatments); and d) features that indicate a consistent set of causes for the disorder (e.g., findings from genetics or brain imaging), and that professional associations have endorsed and published guidelines for diagnosing ADHD.

The most commonly used rating scales for diagnosing ADHD are the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) and include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) used for parents to rate their child&#x27;s behaviour, the Youth Self Report Form (YSR) used for children to rate their own behaviour, and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) used for teachers to rate their pupil&#x27;s behaviour. Additional rating scales that have been used alone or in combination with other measures to diagnose ADHD include the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Second Edition (BRIEF2), Revised Conners Rating Scale (CRS-R), Conduct-Hyperactive-Attention Problem-Oppositional Symptom scale (CHAOS), Developmental Behavior Checklist Hyperactivity Index (DBC-HI), Parent Disruptive Behavior Disorder Ratings Scale (DBDRS), Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA-L), Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Rating Scale (SWAN) and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale.

The ASEBA, BASC, CHAOS, CRS, and Vanderbilt diagnostic rating scales allow for both parents and teachers as raters in the diagnosis of childhood and adolescent ADHD. Adolescents may also self report their symptoms using self report scales from the ASEBA, SWAN, and the Dominic Interactive for Adolescents-Revised (DIA-R). Self-rating scales, such as the ADHD rating scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale, are used in the screening and evaluation of ADHD.

Based on a 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), rating scales based on parent report, teacher report, or self-assessment from the adolescent have high internal consistency as a diagnostic tool meaning that the items within the scale are highly interrelated. The reliability of the scales between raters (i.e. their degree of agreement) however is poor to moderate making it important to include information from multiple raters to best inform a diagnosis.

Imaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals; thus, they are only used for research purposes and not a diagnosis. Electroencephalography is not accurate enough to make an ADHD diagnosis. A 2024 systematic review concluded that the use of biomarkers such as blood or urine samples, electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and neuroimaging such as MRIs, in diagnosis for ADHD remains unclear; studies showed great variability, did not assess test-retest reliability, and were not independently replicable.

In North America and Australia, DSM-5 criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-10. The DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of ADHD is more likely to diagnose ADHD than is the ICD-10 criteria. ADHD is alternately classified as neurodevelopmental disorder or a disruptive behaviour disorder along with ODD, CD, and antisocial personality disorder. A diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorder.

Very few studies have been conducted on diagnosis of ADHD on children younger than 7 years of age, and those that have were found in a 2024 systematic review to be of low or insufficient strength of evidence.

===Classification===
====Diagnostic and Statistical Manual====
As with many other psychiatric disorders, a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the American Psychiatric Association in the DSM. Based on the DSM-5 criteria published in 2013 and the DSM-5-TR criteria published in 2022, there are three presentations of ADHD:

# ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation, presents with symptoms including being easily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganization, poor sustained attention, and difficulty completing tasks.
# ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, presents with excessive fidgeting and restlessness, hyperactivity, and difficulty waiting and remaining seated.
# ADHD, combined presentation, is a combination of the first two presentations.

This subdivision is based on presence of at least six (in children) or five (in older teenagers and adults) out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both. To be considered, several symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The symptoms must be inappropriate for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing impairment in multiple domains of life.

The DSM-5 and the DSM-5-TR also provide two diagnoses for individuals who have symptoms of ADHD but do not entirely meet the requirements. &quot;Other Specified ADHD&quot; allows the clinician to describe why the individual does not meet the criteria, whereas &quot;Unspecified ADHD&quot; is used where the clinician chooses not to describe the reason.

====International Classification of Diseases====
In the eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization, the disorder is classified as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (code 6A05). The defined subtypes are &quot;predominantly inattentive presentation&quot; (6A05.0); &quot;predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation&quot;(6A05.1); and &quot;combined presentation&quot; (6A05.2). However, the ICD-11 includes two residual categories for individuals who do not entirely match any of the defined subtypes: &quot;other specified presentation&quot; (6A05.Y) where the clinician includes detail on the individual&#x27;s presentation; and &quot;presentation unspecified&quot; (6A05.Z) where the clinician does not provide detail.

In the tenth revision (ICD-10), the symptoms of &quot;hyperkinetic disorder&quot; were analogous to ADHD in the ICD-11. When a conduct disorder (as defined by ICD-10) is present, the condition was referred to as &quot;hyperkinetic conduct disorder&quot;. Otherwise, the disorder was classified as &quot;disturbance of activity and attention&quot;, &quot;other hyperkinetic disorders&quot; or &quot;hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified&quot;. The latter was sometimes referred to as &quot;hyperkinetic syndrome&quot;.

====Social construct theory====
The social construct theory of ADHD suggests that, because the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviour are socially constructed (i.e. jointly created and validated by all members of society, and in particular by physicians, parents, teachers, and others), it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus, the number of people affected. Thomas Szasz, a supporter of this theory, has argued that ADHD was &quot;invented and then given a name&quot;.

===Adults===
Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. The individual is the best source for information in diagnosis, however others may provide useful information about the individual&#x27;s symptoms currently and in childhood; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis. While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults, they often present differently in adults than in children: for example, excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.

Worldwide, it is estimated that 2.58% of adults have persistent ADHD (where the individual currently meets the criteria and there is evidence of childhood onset), and 6.76% of adults have symptomatic ADHD (meaning that they currently meet the criteria for ADHD, regardless of childhood onset). In 2020, this was 139.84 million and 366.33 million affected adults respectively. Around 15% of children with ADHD continue to meet full DSM-IV-TR criteria at 25 years of age, and 50% still experience some symptoms. , most adults remain untreated. Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganised life, and some use non-prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism. Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities. Associated mental health problems include depression, anxiety disorders, and learning disabilities.

Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or may talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behaviour, and be short-tempered. Addictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are common. This led to those who presented differently as they aged having outgrown the DSM-IV criteria. The DSM-5 criteria does specifically deal with adults unlike that of DSM-IV, which does not fully take into account the differences in impairments seen in adulthood compared to childhood.

For diagnosis in an adult, having symptoms since childhood is required. Nevertheless, a proportion of adults who meet the criteria for ADHD in adulthood would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children. Most cases of late-onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of 12–16 and may therefore be considered early adult or adolescent-onset ADHD.

===Differential diagnosis===
The DSM provides differential diagnoses – potential alternate explanations for specific symptoms. Assessment and investigation of clinical history determines which is the most appropriate diagnosis. The DSM-5 suggests oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and other disorders such as stereotypic movement disorder and Tourette syndrome, in addition to specific learning disorder, intellectual disability, autism, reactive attachment disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, substance use disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, medication-induced symptoms, and neurocognitive disorders. Many but not all of these are also common comorbidities of ADHD. The DSM-5-TR also suggests post-traumatic stress disorder.

Symptoms of ADHD that particularly relate to disinhibition and irritability in addition to low-mood and self-esteem as a result of symptom expression might be confusable with dysthymia and bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder, however they are comorbid at a significantly increased rate relative to the general population. Some symptoms that are viewed superficially due to anxiety disorders, intellectual disability or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap to some extent with ADHD. These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD.

Primary sleep disorders may affect attention and behaviour and the symptoms of ADHD may affect sleep. It is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems. Sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes, to disinhibition and inattention. Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause ADHD-like symptoms.

In general, the DSM-5-TR can help distinguish between many conditions associated with ADHD-like symptoms by the context in which the symptoms arise. For example, children with learning disabilities may feel distractable and agitated when asked to engage in tasks that require the impaired skill (e.g., reading, math), but not in other situations. A person with an intellectual disability may develop symptoms that overlap with ADHD when placed in a school environment that is inappropriate for their needs. The type of inattention implicated in ADHD, of poor persistence and sustained attention, differs substantially from selective or oriented inattention seen in cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS), as well as from rumination, reexperiencing or mind blanking seen in anxiety disorders or PTSD.

In mood disorders, ADHD-like symptoms may be limited to manic or depressive states of an episodic nature. Symptoms overlapping with ADHD in psychotic disorders may be limited to psychotic states. Substance use disorder, some medications, and certain medical conditions may cause symptoms to appear later in life, while ADHD, as a neurodevelopmental disorder, requires for them to have been present since childhood.

Furthermore, a careful understanding of the nature of the symptoms may help establish the difference between ADHD and other disorders. For example, the forgetfulness and impulsivity typical of ADHD (e.g., in completing school assignments or following directions) may be distinguished from opposition when there is no hostility or defiance, although ADHD and ODD are highly comorbid. Tantrums may differ from the outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder if there is no aggression involved. The fidgetiness observed in ADHD may be differentiated from tics or stereotypies common in Tourette&#x27;s disorder or autism.

Also, the social difficulties often experienced by individuals with ADHD due to inattention (e.g., being unfocused during the interaction and therefore missing cues or being unaware of one&#x27;s behavior) or impulsivity (blurting things out, asking intrusive questions, interrupting) may be contrasted with the social detachment and deficits in understanding social cues associated with autism. Individuals with ADHD may also present signs of the social impairment or emotional and cognitive dysregulation seen in personality disorders, but not necessarily such features as a fear of abandonment, an unstable sense of self, narcissistic tendencies, aggressiveness, or other personality features.

While it is possible and common for many of these different conditions to be comorbid with ADHD, the symptoms must not be better explained by them, as per diagnostic criterion E in the DSM-5. The symptoms must arise early in life, appear across multiple environments, and cause significant impairment. Moreover, when some of these conditions are in fact comorbid with ADHD, it is still important to distinguish them, as each may need to be treated separately.

==Management==
The management of ADHD typically involves counseling or medications, either alone or in combination. While there are various options of treatment to improve ADHD symptoms, medication therapies substantially improve long-term outcomes, and while eliminating some elevated risks such as obesity, they do come with some risks of adverse events. Medications used include stimulants, atomoxetine, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, and sometimes antidepressants. In those who have trouble focusing on long-term rewards, a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task performance. Medications are the most effective treatment, and any side effects are typically mild and easy to resolve although any improvements will be reverted if medication is ceased. ADHD stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD. To quote one systematic review, &quot;recent evidence from observational and registry studies indicates that pharmacological treatment of ADHD is associated with increased achievement and decreased absenteeism at school, a reduced risk of trauma-related emergency hospital visits, reduced risks of suicide and attempted suicide, and decreased rates of substance abuse and criminality&quot;. Data also suggest that combining medication with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can have positive effects: although CBT is substantially less effective, it can help address problems that reside after medication has been optimised.
The nature and range of desirable endpoints of ADHD treatment vary among diagnostic standards for ADHD. In most studies, the efficacy of treatment is determined by reductions in symptoms. However, some studies have included subjective ratings from teachers and parents as part of their assessment of treatment efficacies.

===Behavioural therapies===

There is good evidence for the use of behavioural therapies in ADHD. They are the recommended first-line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or who are preschool-aged. Psychological therapies used include: psychoeducational input, behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, family therapy, school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioural peer intervention, organization training, and parent management training. Neurofeedback has greater treatment effects than non-active controls for up to 6 months and possibly a year following treatment, and may have treatment effects comparable to active controls (controls proven to have a clinical effect) over that time period. Despite efficacy in research, there is insufficient regulation of neurofeedback practice, leading to ineffective applications and false claims regarding innovations. Parent training may improve a number of behavioural problems including oppositional and non-compliant behaviours.

There is little high-quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD—but the existing evidence shows that it is similar to community care, and better than placebo. ADHD-specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD.

Social skills training, behavioural modification, and medication may have some limited beneficial effects in peer relationships. Stable, high-quality friendships with non-deviant peers protect against later psychological problems.

===Digital interventions===

Several clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics, particularly Akili Interactive Labs&#x27;s video game-based digital therapeutic AKL-T01, marketed as EndeavourRx. The pediatric STARS-ADHD randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial demonstrated that AKL-T01 significantly improved performance on the Test of Variables of Attention, an objective measure of attention and inhibitory control, compared to a control group after four weeks of at-home use. A subsequent pediatric open-label study, STARS-Adjunct, published in Nature Portfolio&#x27;s npj Digital Medicine evaluated AKL-T01 as an adjunctive treatment for children with ADHD who were either on stimulant medication or not on stimulant pharmacotherapy. Results showed improvements in ADHD-related impairment (measured by the Impairment Rating Scale) and ADHD symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, with effects persisting during a 4-week pause and further improving with an additional treatment period. Notably, the magnitude of the measured improvement was similar for children both on and off stimulants. In 2020, AKL-T01 received marketing authorization for pediatric ADHD from the FDA, becoming &quot;the first game-based therapeutic granted marketing authorization by the FDA for any type of condition.&quot;

In addition to pediatric populations, a 2023 study in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&quot; investigated the efficacy and safety of AKL-T01 in adults with ADHD. After six weeks of at-home treatment with AKL-T01, participants showed significant improvements in objective measures of attention (TOVA - Attention Comparison Score), reported ADHD symptoms (ADHD-RS-IV inattention subscale and total score), and reported quality of life (AAQoL). The magnitude of improvement in attention was nearly seven times greater than that reported in pediatric trials. The treatment was well-tolerated, with high compliance and no serious adverse events.

===Medication===
The medications for ADHD appear to alleviate symptoms via their effects on the pre-frontal executive, striatal and related regions and networks in the brain; usually by increasing neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine.

====Stimulants====
Methylphenidate and amphetamine or its derivatives are often first-line treatments for ADHD. About 70 per cent respond to the first stimulant tried and as few as 10 per cent respond to neither amphetamines nor methylphenidate. Stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with ADHD. Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD. A 2018 review found the greatest short-term benefit with methylphenidate in children, and amphetamines in adults. Studies and meta-analyses show that amphetamine is slightly-to-modestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms, and they are more effective pharmacotherapy for ADHD than α2-agonists but methylphenidate has comparable efficacy to non-stimulants such as atomoxetine.
In a Cochrane clinical synopsis, Dr Storebø and colleagues summarised their meta-review on methylphenidate for ADHD in children and adolescents. The meta-analysis raised substantial doubts about the drug&#x27;s efficacy relative to a placebo. This led to a strong critical reaction from the European ADHD Guidelines Group and individuals in the scientific community, who identified a number of flaws in the review. Since at least September 2021, there is a unanimous and global scientific consensus that methylphenidate is safe and highly effective for treating ADHD. The same journal released a subsequent systematic review (2022) of extended-release methylphenidate for adults, concluding similar doubts about the certainty of evidence. Other recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, however, find certainty in the safety and high efficacy of methylphenidate for reducing ADHD symptoms, for alleviating the underlying executive functioning deficits, and for substantially reducing the adverse consequences of untreated ADHD with continuous treatment. Clinical guidelines internationally are also consistent in approving the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate and recommending it as a first-line treatment for the disorder.

Safety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based international guidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the scientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line treatment for ADHD.
The likelihood of developing insomnia for ADHD patients taking stimulants has been measured at between 11 and 45 per cent for different medications, and may be a main reason for discontinuation. Other side effects, such as tics, decreased appetite and weight loss, or emotional lability, may also lead to discontinuation. Stimulant psychosis and mania are rare at therapeutic doses, appearing to occur in approximately 0.1% of individuals, within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy. The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear. Symptom improvement is not sustained if medication is ceased.

The long-term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined, although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to two years for children and adolescents. A 2022 meta-analysis found no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across age groups, although the study suggests further investigation is warranted for patients with preexisting CVD as well as long-term medication use. Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long-term treatment. There are indications suggesting that stimulant therapy for children and adolescents should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication, decrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance. Although potentially addictive at high doses, stimulants used to treat ADHD have low potential for abuse. Treatment with stimulants is either protective against substance abuse or has no effect.

The majority of studies on nicotine and other nicotinic agonists as treatments for ADHD have shown favorable results; however, no nicotinic drug has been approved for ADHD treatment. Caffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD but research indicates it has no significant effects in reducing ADHD symptoms. Caffeine appears to help with alertness, arousal and reaction time but not the type of inattention implicated in ADHD (sustained attention/persistence). Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine do not affect ADHD symptoms.

Modafinil has shown some efficacy in reducing the severity of ADHD in children and adolescents. It may be prescribed off-label to treat ADHD.

====Non-stimulants====
Two non-stimulant medications, atomoxetine and viloxazine, are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD.

Atomoxetine, due to its lack of addiction liability, may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use, although evidence is lacking to support its use over stimulants for this reason. Atomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake and by indirectly increasing dopamine in the pre-frontal cortex, sharing 70-80% of the brain regions with stimulants in their produced effects. Atomoxetine has been shown to significantly improve academic performance. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable efficacy, equal tolerability and response rate (75%) to methylphenidate in children and adolescents. In adults, efficacy and discontinuation rates are equivalent.

Analyses of clinical trial data suggests that viloxazine is about as effective as atomoxetine and methylphenidate but with fewer side effects.

Amantadine was shown to induce similar improvements in children treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD–related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics.

Bupropion is also used off-label by some clinicians due to research findings. It is effective, but modestly less than atomoxetine and methylphenidate.

There is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviours. Antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in ADHD.

Alpha-2a agonists

Two alpha-2a agonists, extended-release formulations of guanfacine and clonidine, are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD (effective in children and adolescents but effectiveness has still not been shown for adults). They appear to be modestly less effective than the stimulants (amphetamine and methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) at reducing symptoms, but can be useful alternatives or used in conjunction with a stimulant. These medications act by adjusting the alpha-2a ports on the outside of noradrenergic nerve cells in the pre-frontal executive networks, so the information (electrical signal) is less confounded by noise.

====Guidelines====
Guidelines on when to use medications vary by country. The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends use for children only in severe cases, though for adults medication is a first-line treatment. Conversely, most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age groups. Medications are especially not recommended for preschool children. Underdosing of stimulants can occur, and can result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness. This is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school-aged children, causing some practitioners to use weight-based or benefit-based off-label dosing instead.

=== Exercise ===
Exercise does not reduce the symptoms of ADHD. The conclusion by the International Consensus Statement is based on two meta-analyses: one of 10 studies with 300 children and the other of 15 studies and 668 participants, which showed that exercise yields no statistically significant reductions on ADHD symptoms. A 2024 systematic review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) identified seven studies on the effectiveness of physical exercise for treating ADHD symptoms. The type and amount of exercise varied widely across studies from martial arts interventions to treadmill training, to table tennis or aerobic exercise. Effects reported were not replicated, causing the authors to conclude that there is insufficient evidence that exercise intervention is an effective form of treatment for ADHD symptoms.

=== Diet ===
Dietary modifications are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality due to insufficient evidence.
A 2013 meta-analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see some improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased consumption of artificial food colouring. These benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with ADHD medications. This review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD. A 2014 review found that an elimination diet results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children, such as those with allergies. A 2016 review stated that the use of a gluten-free diet as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. A 2017 review showed that a few-foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication, while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. Chronic deficiencies of iron, magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms. There is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue zinc levels may be associated with ADHD. In the absence of a demonstrated zinc deficiency (which is rare outside of developing countries), zinc supplementation is not recommended as treatment for ADHD. However, zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD.

==Prognosis==
About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have ADHD in adulthood, with 2.58% of adults estimated to have ADHD which began in childhood. Children with ADHD have worse educational outcomes and a higher risk of unintentional injuries. In adults, hyperactivity is often replaced by inner restlessness, and adults affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature, thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms.

The negative impacts of ADHD symptoms contribute to poor health-related quality of life that may be further exacerbated by, or may increase the risk of, other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. Individuals with ADHD may also face misconceptions and stigma. A number of recent studies have found that ADHD is associated with a significant reduction in average life expectancy. A US study found rates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population. Positive effects of medication on functional impairment and quality of life (e.g. reduced risk of accidents) have been found across multiple domains.

Individuals with ADHD are significantly overrepresented in prison populations. Although there is no generally accepted estimate of ADHD prevalence among inmates, a 2015 meta-analysis estimated a prevalence of 25.5%, and a larger 2018 meta-analysis estimated the frequency to be 26.2%.

New research in 2025 indicates that adults diagnosed with ADHD may have a shorter lifespan compared to those without the condition. The study revealed that, on average, men with ADHD lived seven years less than men without ADHD, while women with ADHD had a lifespan nine years shorter than their peers. Although the study did not pinpoint exact causes of death, it highlighted that individuals with ADHD were more likely to engage in smoking, alcohol misuse, and face other health challenges such as depression, self-harm, or personality disorders. 

==Epidemiology==

ADHD is estimated to affect about 6–7% of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria. When diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria, rates in this age group are estimated around 1–2%. Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency. (The same publication which describes this difference also notes that the difference may be rooted in the available studies from these respective regions, as far more studies were from North America than from Africa and the Middle East.) it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally.

ADHD is diagnosed approximately twice as often in boys as in girls, and 1.6 times more often in men than in women, although the disorder is overlooked in girls or diagnosed in later life because their symptoms sometimes differ from diagnostic criteria. In 2014, Keith Conners, one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder, spoke out against overdiagnosis in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article. In contrast, a 2014 peer-reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is underdiagnosed in adults.

Studies from multiple countries have reported that children born closer to the start of the school year are more frequently diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD than their older classmates. Boys who were born in December where the school age cut-off was 31 December were shown to be 30% more likely to be diagnosed and 41% more likely to be treated than those born in January. Girls born in December had a diagnosis and treatment percentage increase of 70% and 77% respectively compared to those born in January. Children who were born at the last three days of a calendar year were reported to have significantly higher levels of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD than children born at the first three days of a calendar year. The studies suggest that ADHD diagnosis is prone to subjective analysis.

Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. Prior to 1970, it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD, while in the 1970s rates were about 1%. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in incidence. With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis, such as cultural norms.

Despite showing a higher frequency of symptoms associated with ADHD, non-White children in the US are less likely than White children to be diagnosed or treated for ADHD, a finding that is often explained by bias among health professionals, as well as parents who may be reluctant to acknowledge that their child has ADHD. Crosscultural differences in diagnosis of ADHD can also be attributed to the long-lasting effects of harmful, racially targeted medical practices. Medical pseudosciences, particularly those that targeted Black populations during the period of slavery in the US, lead to a distrust of medical practices within certain communities. The combination of ADHD symptoms often being regarded as misbehaviour rather than as a psychiatric condition, and the use of drugs to regulate ADHD, result in a hesitancy to trust a diagnosis of ADHD. Cases of misdiagnosis in ADHD can also occur due to stereotyping of people of color. Due to ADHD&#x27;s subjectively determined symptoms, medical professionals may diagnose individuals based on stereotyped behaviour or misdiagnose due to cultural differences in symptom presentation.

A 2024 study in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reports around 15.5 million U.S. adults have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, with many facing challenges in accessing treatment. One-third of diagnosed individuals had received a prescription for a stimulant drug in the past year but nearly three-quarters of them reported difficulties filling the prescription due to medication shortages.

==History==

ADHD was officially known as attention deficit disorder (ADD) from 1980 to 1987; prior to the 1980s, it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood. Symptoms similar to those of ADHD have been described in medical literature dating back to the 18th century. Sir Alexander Crichton describes &quot;mental restlessness&quot; in his book &quot;An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement&quot; written in 1798. He made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the &quot;fidgets&quot;. The first clear description of ADHD is credited to George Still in 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal College of Physicians of London.

The terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included: &quot;minimal brain dysfunction&quot; in the DSM-I (1952), &quot;hyperkinetic reaction of childhood&quot; in the DSM-II (1968), and &quot;attention-deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity&quot; in the DSM-III (1980). In 1987, this was changed to ADHD in the DSM-III-R, and in 1994 the DSM-IV in split the diagnosis into three subtypes: ADHD inattentive type, ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type, and ADHD combined type. These terms were kept in the DSM-5 in 2013 and in the DSM-5-TR in 2022. Prior to the DSM, terms included &quot;minimal brain damage&quot; in the 1930s.

ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been controversial since the 1970s. For example, positions differ on whether ADHD is within the normal range of behaviour, and to degree to which ADHD is a genetic condition. Other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children, the method of diagnosis, and the possibility of overdiagnosis. In 2009, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature.

Once neuroimaging studies were possible, studies in the 1990s provided support for the pre-existing theory that neurological differences (particularly in the frontal lobes) were involved in ADHD. A genetic component was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent, long-term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood. ADHD was split into the current three sub-types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues and published in 1994. In 2021, global teams of scientists curated the International Consensus Statement compiling evidence-based findings about the disorder.

In 1934, Benzedrine became the first amphetamine medication approved for use in the United States. Methylphenidate was introduced in the 1950s, and enantiopure dextroamphetamine in the 1970s. The use of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in 1937. Charles Bradley gave the children with behavioural disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behaviour.

== Research directions ==
===Possible positive traits ===
Possible positive traits of ADHD are a new avenue of research, and therefore limited.

A 2020 review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly divergent thinking and quantity of creative achievements, but not with the disorder of ADHD itself – i.e. it has not been found to be increased in people diagnosed with the disorder, only in people with subclinical symptoms or those that possess traits associated with the disorder. Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other and consider the issue from multiple perspectives. Those with ADHD symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention, allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration; flexible associative memory, allowing them to remember and use more distantly-related ideas which is associated with creativity; and impulsivity, allowing them to consider ideas which others may not have.

===Possible biomarkers for diagnosis===
Reviews of ADHD biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression, urinary norepinephrine, urinary MHPG, and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between ADHD individuals and non-ADHD controls. These measurements could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ADHD, but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility. Urinary and blood plasma phenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls. The two most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD, amphetamine and methylphenidate, increase phenethylamine biosynthesis in treatment-responsive individuals with ADHD. Lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals.

<text>The bird family Tytonidae, which includes the barn owls &quot;Tyto&quot; and the bay owls &quot;Phodilus&quot;, is one of the two families of owls, the other being the true owls or typical owls, Strigidae. They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long, strong legs with powerful talons. They also differ from the Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet.

The family is wide-ranging, although they are not very tolerant of severe winter cold, so are absent from northern areas of Europe, Asia, and North America; they are also absent from driest desert regions. They live in a wide range of habitats from semi-deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. Within these habitats, they live near agricultural areas with high amounts of human activity. The majority of the 20 living species of barn owls are poorly known. Some, like the red owl, have barely been seen or studied since their discovery, in contrast to the western barn owl &quot;Tyto alba&quot;, which is one of the best-known owl species in the world. However, some subspecies of the western barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species, but are very poorly known.

Five species of barn owl are threatened, and some island species went extinct during the Holocene or earlier (e.g., &quot;Tyto pollens&quot;, known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas, and possibly the basis for the mythical chickcharney). Barn owls are mostly nocturnal and generally non-migratory, living in pairs or singly.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

Barn owls consist of two extant subfamilies: the Tytoninae or &quot;Tyto&quot; owls (including the western barn owl) and the Phodilinae or bay owls. The modern genera &quot;Tyto&quot; and &quot;Phodilus&quot; are thought to have originated from a common ancestor from the Oligocene period. It is believed the modern genus &quot;Tyto&quot; descended from large nocturnal birds in the West Indies during the Quaternary. The systematics of this group began with the discovery of &quot;Tyto ostologa&quot; (now extinct), whose remains were found in north-central Haiti. This discovery led to the finding of &quot;Tyto pollens, Tyto noeli,&quot; and &quot;Tyto riveroi&quot; in nearby cave deposits, all of which are now extinct and were also considered giant. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, barn owls are a subfamily, Tytoninae. This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.

The ashy-faced owl (&quot;T. glaucops&quot;) was for some time included in &quot;T. alba&quot;. Based on DNA evidence, König, Weick &amp; Becking (2009) recognised the American barn owl (&quot;Tyto furcata&quot;) and the Curaçao barn owl (&quot;T. bargei&quot;) as separate species. They proposed that &quot;T. a. delicatula&quot; should be split off as a separate species, to be known as the eastern barn owl, which would include the subspecies &quot;T. d. delicatula&quot;, &quot;T. d. sumbaensis&quot;, &quot;T. d. meeki&quot;, &quot;T. d. crassirostris&quot;, and &quot;T. d. interposita&quot;. As of 2021, the International Ornithological Committee had not accepted the split of &quot;Tyto delicatula&quot; from &quot;T. javanica&quot;.

Some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species, a move which should await further research into barn owl phylogeography. According to Murray Bruce in &quot;Handbook of Birds of the World Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds&quot;, &quot;a review of the whole group [is] long overdue&quot;. Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows a separation of the species into two clades, an Old World &quot;alba&quot; and a New World &quot;furcata&quot;, but this study did not include &quot;T. a. delicatula&quot;, which the authors seem to have accepted as a separate species. Extensive genetic variation was found between the Indonesian &quot;T. a. stertens&quot; and other members of the &quot;alba&quot; clade, leading to the separation of &quot;stertens&quot; into &quot;Tyto javanica&quot;.

Twenty to thirty subspecies are usually recognized, varying mainly in body proportions, size, and colour. Barn owls range in colour from the almost beige-and-white nominate subspecies &quot;alba&quot;, &quot;erlangeri&quot;, and &quot;niveicauda&quot;, to the nearly black-and-brown &quot;contempta&quot;. Island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones, and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage and shorter wings than those living in open grasslands. Several subspecies are generally considered to be intergrades between more distinct populations.

===Extant genera===
Two extant genera are accepted:
* Genus &quot;Tyto&quot; – barn owls, grass owls and masked owls (18 species)
* Genus &quot;Phodilus&quot; – bay owls (2 species)

==== Genus &quot;Tyto&quot; ====

Some of the &quot;Tyto&quot; species that exist include the western barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), the American barn owl (&quot;Tyto furctata&quot;), and the eastern barn owl (&quot;T. javanica&quot;, including the Australian barn owl &quot;T. javanica delicatula&quot;). Within each of these species, there are many subspecies. Of the western barn owl there are 10 subspecies: &quot;T. a. alba, T. a. detorta, T. a. erlangeri, T. a. ernesti, T. a. gracilirostris, T. a. guttata, T. a. hypermetra, T. a. poensis, T. a. schmitzi, T. a. thomensis&quot;. Of the American barn owl, there are 10 subspecies: &quot;T. f. bargei, T. f. bondi, T. f. contempta, T. f. furcata, T. f. guatemalae, T. f. hellmayri, T. f. niveicauda, T. f. pratincola, T. f. punctatissima, T. f. tuidara&quot;. Of the Australian barn owl, there are 7 subspecies: &quot;T. j. crassirostris, T. j. delicatula, T. j. javanica, T. j. interposita, T. j. meeki, T. j. stertens, T. j. sumbaensis&quot;.

The western barn owl (&quot;T. alba&quot;) can be found in Africa and parts of Asia, including Eurasia. The American barn owl (&quot;T. furcata&quot;) can be found from North to South America. Lastly, the Australian barn owl (&quot;T. delicatula&quot;) can be found in Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, and Asia.
==== Genus &quot;Phodilus&quot; ====
This genus includes the Oriental bay owl (&quot;P. badius&quot;) and the Sri Lanka bay owl (&quot;P. assimilis&quot;). The genus has a much smaller distribution than &quot;Tyto&quot;, with Oriental bay owls found in tropical Asia and Sri Lanka bay owls found in Sri Lanka and southwestern India.

===Extinct genera===
The fossil record of barn owls goes back to the Eocene, with the family eventually losing ground to the true owls after the radiation of rodents and owls during the Neogene epoch. Two subfamilies are known only from the fossil record: the Necrobyinae and the Selenornithinae. At least four extinct genera of barn owls have been described:
* Genus &quot;Nocturnavis&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene) – includes &quot;Bubo incertus&quot;
* Genus &quot;Necrobyas&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene – Late Miocene, France) – includes &quot;Bubo arvernensis&quot; and &quot;Paratyto&quot;
* Genus &quot;Selenornis&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of Quercy, France) – includes &quot;Asio henrici&quot;
* Genus &quot;Prosybris&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of Quercy(?) – Early Miocene of France and Austria)

===Placement unresolved===
* Tytonidae gen. et sp. indet. &quot;TMT 164&quot; (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France) - &quot;Prosybris&quot;?
* Genus &quot;Palaeotyto&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene) from Quercy, France. Placement in this family is tentative, it may instead belong to the family Sophiornithidae.
* Genus &quot;Palaeobyas&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene) from Quercy, France. Placement in this family is tentative, it may instead belong to the family Sophiornithidae.

===Former genera===
The supposed &quot;giant barn owl&quot; &quot;Basityto&quot; from the Early Eocene of Grafenmühle (Germany) was actually a crowned crane (&quot;Balearica&quot;); the presumed &quot;Easter Island barn owl&quot;, based on subfossil bones found on Rapa Nui, has turned out to be a procellarid; and the specimen originally described as the fossilized Pliocene &quot;Lechusa stirtoni&quot; was later determined to be recent remains of a modern-day American barn owl.

==Description==
The main characteristic of the barn owls is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers which serve to amplify and locate the source of sounds when hunting. Further adaptations in the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying, aiding both the hearing of the owl listening for hidden prey and keeping the prey unaware of the owl. Barn owls overall are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although considerable variation is seen even within species.

Bay owls closely resemble the &quot;Tyto&quot; owls, but have a divided facial disc, ear tufts, and tend to be smaller.

==Distribution==
The barn owl is the most widespread landbird species in the world, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. Its range includes all of Europe (except Fennoscandia and Malta), most of Africa apart from the Sahara, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, many Pacific Islands, and North-, Central-, and South America. In general, it is considered to be sedentary, and, indeed, many individuals, having taken up residence in a particular location, remain there even when better nearby foraging areas are available. In the British Isles, the young seem largely to disperse along river corridors, and the distance travelled from their natal site averages about .

In continental Europe, the dispersal distance is greater, commonly somewhere between but exceptionally , with ringed birds from the Netherlands ending up in Spain and in Ukraine. In the United States, dispersal is typically over distances of , with the most travelled individuals ending up some from their points of origin. Dispersal movements in the African continent include , from Senegambia to Sierra Leone, and up to within South Africa. In Australia, there is some migration, as the birds move towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward in the wet season, as well as nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, some of these birds turn up on Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, or New Zealand, showing that crossing the ocean is within their capabilities. In 2008, barn owls were recorded for the first time breeding in New Zealand. The barn owl has been successfully introduced into the Hawaiian island of Kauai in an attempt to control rodents; distressingly, it has been found to also feed on native birds.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Hunting and feeding===
Hunting in twilight or at night, the barn owl can target its prey and dive to the ground. Its legs and toes are long and slender, which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. This bird hunts by flying slowly, quartering the ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It has long, broad wings that enable it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. It has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically, which improves detection of sound position and distance; the bird does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc helps with the bird&#x27;s hearing, as is shown by the fact that, with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still determine a sound source&#x27;s direction, although without the disc it cannot determine the source&#x27;s height. It may perch on branches, fence posts, or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, and this is the main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia.

Rodents and other small mammals may constitute over ninety percent of the prey caught. Birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians, fish, spiders, and insects. Even when they are plentiful, and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed. In North America and most of Europe, voles predominate in the diet, and shrews are the second most common food choice. In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl&#x27;s diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Mice and rats are the main foodstuffs in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, subtropics, and Australia. Gophers, muskrats, hares, rabbits, and bats are also preyed upon. Barn owls are usually specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in areas where prey is scarce. 

On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers, and pratincoles. On a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach&#x27;s storm petrel (&quot;Oceanodroma leucorhoa&quot;). On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include birds as some fifteen to twenty percent of its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae), or true crickets (Gryllidae). Smaller prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely, including bones and fur, while prey larger than about —such as baby rabbits, &quot;Cryptomys&quot; blesmols, or &quot;Otomys&quot; vlei rats—is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded.

Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Relative to its size, barn owls consume more rodents. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about fourteen percent of the bird&#x27;s bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nesting sites.

===Breeding===

Barn owls living in tropical regions can breed at any time of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, with the resultant temporary increase in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct, and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June, when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting, and, consequently, two broods are often raised in a good year, even in the cooler parts of the owl&#x27;s range.

===Moulting===

Feathers become abraded over time and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are particularly dependent on their ability to fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently. In temperate areas, the owls undergo a prolonged moult that lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her, so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is a central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7, and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird&#x27;s third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed, followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being shed the following year. 

The male owl moults rather later in the year than the female, at a time when there is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting, and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. Their moult follows a pattern similarly prolonged as that of the female. The first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics, and barn owls there usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.

===Predators and parasites===
Predators of the barn owl include large American opossums (&quot;Didelphis&quot;), the common raccoon, and similar carnivorous mammals, as well as eagles, larger hawks, and other owls. Among the latter, the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), in the Americas, and the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;B. bubo&quot;) are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming that there is little evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl&#x27;s diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principal predators of barn owls are Verreaux&#x27;s eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo lacteus&quot;) and Cape eagle-owls (&quot;B. capensis&quot;). In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle-owls, the chief diurnal predators are the northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;) and the common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;). About 12 other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the similar-sized Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;) and scarcely larger tawny owl (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;) to huge bald (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). As a result of improved conservation measures, the populations of the northern goshawk and eagle-owls are increasing, thus increasing the incidence of hunting on barn owls where the species coexist. 

When disturbed at its roosting site, an angry barn owl lowers its head and sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings outstretched and drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. Another defensive attitude involves lying flat on the ground or crouching with wings spread out.

Barn owls are hosts to a wide range of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites, and externally the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites, which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies, such as &quot;Ornithomyia avicularia&quot;, are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke &quot;Strigea strigis&quot;, the tapeworm &quot;Paruternia candelabraria&quot;, several species of parasitic round worm, and spiny-headed worms in the genus &quot;Centrorhynchus&quot;. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursa of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly &quot;Carnus hemapterus&quot;, which attacks nestlings.

===Lifespan===
Collision with road vehicles is another cause of death and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals. In some locations, road mortality rates can be particularly high, with collision rates being influenced by higher commercial traffic, roadside verges that are grass rather than shrubs, and where small mammals are abundant. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case in some parts of the world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds, and being shot accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.

==Status and conservation==
The barn owl is relatively common throughout most of its range and not considered globally threatened. If considered as a single global species, the barn owl is the second most widely distributed of all raptors, after only the peregrine falcon. It is wider-ranging than the also somewhat cosmopolitan osprey. Furthermore, the barn owl is likely the most numerous of all raptors, with the IUCN Red List assessor estimating a population possibly as large as nearly 10 million individuals. Severe local declines due to organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid 20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, they are not as common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the US, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri), and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern. 

In Canada, barn owls are no longer common and are most likely to be found in coastal British Columbia south of Vancouver, having become extremely rare in a previous habitat, southern Ontario. In spite of a Recovery Strategy, particularly in 2007–2010 in Ontario, only a handful of wild, breeding barn owls existed in the province in 2018. This is primarily because of disappearing grasslands where the bird hunted in the past, but according to a study, also because of &quot;harsh winters, predation, road mortality and use of rodenticides&quot;. The species is listed as endangered overall in Canada, due to loss of habitat and a lack of nesting sites.

In the Canary Islands, a somewhat larger number of these birds still seem to exist on the island of Lanzarote, but altogether this particular subspecies (&quot;T. a. gracilirostris&quot;, the Canary barn owl) is precariously rare: perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands, which are usually assigned to this subspecies, have severely declined, and wanton destruction of the birds seems to be significant. On Tenerife, they seem relatively numerous, but on the other islands, as on Fuerteventura, the situation looks bleak. Due to the assignment to this subspecies of birds common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened. 

Nest boxes are used primarily when populations suffer declines. Although such declines have many causes, among them are the lack of available natural nesting sites. Early successes among conservationists have led to the widespread provision of nest boxes, which has become the most used form of population management. The barn owl accepts the provided nest boxes and sometimes prefers them to natural sites. The nest boxes are placed under the eaves of buildings and in other locations. The upper bound of the number of barn owl pairs depends on the abundance of food at nesting sites. Conservationists encourage farmers and landowners to install nest boxes by pointing out that the resultant increased barn owl population would provide natural rodent control. In some conservation projects, the use of rodenticides for pest control was replaced by the installation of nest boxes for barn owls, which has been shown to be a less costly method of rodent control.

===Cultural aspects===
Common names such as &quot;demon owl&quot;, &quot;death owl&quot;, &quot;ghost owl&quot;, or &quot;lich owl&quot; (from &quot;lich&quot;, an old term for a corpse) show that rural populations in many places considered barn owls to be birds of evil omen. For example, the Tzeltal people in Mexico regard them as &quot;disease givers&quot;. These owls do not &quot;hoot&quot;, instead emitting raspy screeches and hissing noises, and their white face and underbelly feathers, visible as they fly overhead, make them look &quot;ghostly&quot;. Consequently, they were often killed by farmers who were unaware of the benefits these birds bring. Negative perceptions can also be attributed to the false belief that they could eat large animals, such as chickens and cats. In Thailand, people believe that when the barn owl flies over or perches on the roof of any house, the inhabitants of that house will die. In South Africa, barn owls are often associated with witchcraft and are persecuted. In some South African cultures, these owls are used in , a form of traditional medicine, and are believed to give special powers when consumed.

In India, Hindus consider the barn owl to be the mount and symbol of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth and fortune.

Mummified barn owls from Ancient Egypt have also been found.

<text>A boggart is a supernatural being from English folklore. The dialectologist Elizabeth Wright described the boggart as &#x27;a generic name for an apparition&#x27;; folklorist Simon Young defines it as &#x27;any ambivalent or evil solitary supernatural spirit&#x27;. Halifax folklorist Kai Roberts states that boggart ‘might have been used to refer to anything from a hilltop hobgoblin to a household faerie, from a headless apparition to a proto-typical poltergeist’. As these wide definitions suggest boggarts are to be found both in and out of doors, as a household spirit, or a malevolent spirit defined by local geography, a &quot;genius loci&quot; inhabiting topographical features. The 1867 book &quot;Lancashire Folklore&quot; by Harland and Wilkinson, makes a distinction between &quot;House boggarts&quot; and other types. Typical descriptions show boggarts to be malevolent. It is said that the boggart crawls into people&#x27;s beds at night and puts a clammy hand on their faces. Sometimes he strips the bedsheets off them. The household boggart may follow a family wherever they flee. One Lancashire source reports the belief that a boggart should never be named: if the boggart was given a name, it could neither be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive (see True name).

== Etymology ==
Boggart is written in many different forms: &quot;boggard&quot; (particularly in Yorkshire), &quot;baggard&quot;, &quot;bogerd&quot;, &quot;boggat&quot;, &quot;bogard&quot;, &quot;boggerd&quot;, &quot;boggert&quot;, &quot;bugart&quot;, &quot;buggard&quot;, and &quot;buggart&quot;. Boggart is ultimately the typical Lancashire dialect form. These forms all point to an origin with the Middle English word &quot;bugge&quot; (a spirit or monster) with an aggrandizing suffix making boggart, a great big &quot;bugge&quot;. This also makes boggart a close linguistic cousin of &quot;bogle&quot; (or boggle, a Scots variant), &#x27;bugaboo&#x27;, &quot;bugbear&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;bogeyman&quot; and &quot;bogie&quot;, all of which also derive from &quot;bugge&quot;. &quot;Bugge&quot; may, in turn, be related to other British and Irish supernatural terms like &quot;bucca&quot;, &quot;pwca&quot;, &quot;Puck&quot; and &quot;pooka&quot;, but this is uncertain.

== Dialect ==
In north-western dialects the word &#x27;boggart&#x27; was used in a number of sentences. In Lancashire, a skittish or runaway horse was said to have &quot;took boggarts&quot;—that is, been frightened by a, usually invisible, boggart. &#x27;Boggart muck&#x27; seems to have been a word for owl pellets in much of North West England.

==Appearance==
The recorded folklore of boggarts is remarkably varied as to their appearance and size. Many are described as relatively human-like in form, though usually uncouth, very ugly and often with bestial attributes. T. Sternberg&#x27;s 1851 book &quot;Dialect and Folk-lore of Northhamptonshire&quot; describes a certain boggart as &quot;a squat hairy man, strong as a six year old horse, and with arms almost as long as tacklepoles&quot;.

Other accounts describe boggarts as having more completely beast-like forms. The &quot;Boggart of Longar Hede&quot; from Yorkshire was said to be a fearsome creature the size of a calf, with long shaggy hair and eyes like saucers. It trailed a long chain after itself, which made a noise like the baying of hounds. The &quot;Boggart of Hackensall Hall&quot; in Lancashire had the appearance of a huge horse.

At least one Lancashire boggart was said to sometimes take the forms of various animals, or indeed more fearful creatures. The boggarts of Lancashire were said to have a leader, or master, called &#x27;Owd Hob&#x27;, who had the form of a satyr or archetypical devil: horns, cloven hooves and a tail.

The name of at least one Lancashire boggart was recorded, &quot;Nut-Nan&quot;, who flitted with a shrill scream among hazel bushes in Moston near Manchester. In Yorkshire, boggarts also inhabit outdoor locations, one is said to haunt Cave Ha, a limestone cavern at Giggleswick near Settle.
==Grizlehurst boggart (Lancashire)==
A piece of folklore concerning a Lancashire boggart was first published in 1861; the author, Edwin Waugh, had a conversation with an elderly couple one evening about their local boggart. They maintained that the boggart was buried at a nearby bend in the road under an ash tree, along with a cockerel with a stake driven through it. Despite being buried, the boggart was still able to create trouble. A farmer&#x27;s wife, the old couple claimed, just two weeks earlier had heard doors banging in her farmhouse at night, then loud laughter; she looked out to see three candles casting blue light and a creature with red burning eyes leaping about. The following morning many marks of cloven hooves were seen outside the house. The couple claimed that the boggart had unhitched their own horse and overturned their cart on occasion. &quot;Never name it [the boggart]&quot; the old woman repeated, and her husband stated that he would never dig near its grave.

==&quot;The Farmer and the Boggart&quot;==
In one old tale, said to originate from the village of Mumby in the Lincolnshire countryside, the boggart is described as being rather squat, hairy, and smelly. In the story, a farmer offers a deal to a boggart inhabiting his land; the boggart may choose either the part of the crop that grows above the ground or the part below it. When the boggart chooses the part below the ground, the farmer plants barley; at harvest time, the boggart is left with only stubble. The boggart then demands the part above ground instead, so the farmer plants potatoes. Once again left with nothing to show for his efforts, the enraged boggart leaves the area.

An alternative telling includes a third episode where the farmer and the boggart are to harvest the crop (wheat) from either side of the field, each getting what he harvests. However the farmer plants iron rods in the boggart&#x27;s half before the reaping, blunting his scythe, and allowing the farmer to harvest almost the entire field.

This story is identical to the European fable &quot;The Farmer and the Devil&quot;, cited in many seventeenth-century French works. (See Bonne Continuation, Nina M. Furry et Hannelore Jarausch).

==Distribution and place names==

The word &#x27;boggart&#x27; is especially associated with Lancashire. But distribution maps show that &quot;Boggartdom&quot; (the area in which stories of boggarts are found) extended to northern Cheshire, much of Derbyshire, northern Lincolnshire, the old West Riding of Yorkshire, parts of the North Riding, the fringes of Westmorland, and perhaps Nottinghamshire, and possibly, at one time, as far north as Cleveland and as far south as Skegness. In other parts of northern England and the Scottish Lowlands, alternative &#x27;bog&#x27; words were used such as &#x27;bogie&#x27; and &#x27;bogle&#x27;.

A variety of geographic locations and architectural landmarks have been named for the boggart. Most famously there is a large municipal park called Boggart Hole Clough, which is bordered by Moston and Blackley in Manchester. &quot;Clough&quot; is a northern dialect word for a steep-sided, wooded valley; a large part of Boggart Hole Clough is made up of these valleys and is said to be inhabited by boggarts. The clough is the setting for many boggart stories, including one of how a local farmer, George Cheetham, and his family were forced to leave their home due to the torment inflicted by a boggart. However, as they were taking their possessions away in a cart, the voice of the boggart was heard issuing from a milk-churn on the cart. Unable to escape the boggart, they returned to their farm.
There is a Boggart Stones on Saddleworth Moor where the Moors Murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, buried the bodies of Pauline Reade and Lesley Ann Downey, children they had abducted, in 1963 and 1964. The children&#x27;s bodies were buried just below the location, and in sight of, Boggart Stones (OS Map 1864). There is a Boggart Bridge in Burnley, Lancashire. Tradition says that whoever crosses the bridge must give a living thing to the boggart or forfeit his or her soul. Boggarts Roaring Holes are a group of potholes on the moors of Newby Moss near Clapham in the Yorkshire Dales. Legend has it that these potholes are the dwelling place of grotesque flesh-eating boggarts whose angry growls have allegedly been heard reverberating from the depths of the dark caverns beneath (hence the name). In the Seacroft area of Leeds in West Yorkshire there is a council estate named Boggart Hill; Boggart Hill Drive, Boggart Hill Gardens and Boggart Hill were all given the name of the estate area. Boggard Lane, between the villages of Oughtibridge and Worrall in South Yorkshire, is generally believed to derive from the term &quot;boggart&quot;. There is also a Boggart Lane at Skelmanthorpe.

On Puck, a moon of Uranus, there is a crater named Bogle, in deference to the system of nomenclature on this satellite, whose features are all named after various mischievous spirits.

== The Boggart Census ==
In 2019 folklorist Simon Young launched a survey to test modern understandings of the word &#x27;boggart&#x27; in England and particularly Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Young collected 1,100 accounts, including about 400 negatives (&#x27;from the middle-aged and the elderly saying that they had never heard of boggarts while growing up&#x27;). The census was released freely online by University of Exeter Press as an open access pdf.

==In popular culture==
=== Fiction ===
Boggarts feature prominently in a number of popular fantasy novels, in various incarnations. These include the boggart in Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Boggart&quot; and &quot;The Boggart and the Monster&quot;, the boggart in the Septimus Heap series, the boggarts in Joseph Delaney&#x27;s &quot;Spook&#x27;s&quot; series, and the boggart in William Mayne&#x27;s &quot;Earthfasts,&quot; and Tasha Tudor&#x27;s Corgi-related picture books.

A boggart appears in Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s novel &quot;Tamsin&quot;. He is described as a humanoid creature about a meter high who resents humans moving into his house and torments them with pranks and thievery. It seems he can become invisible at first, but it is later determined that he can hide in narrow cracks such as those between cupboards and under bathtubs. As are many magical creatures in the book, the boggart is mortally afraid of cats.

The boggarts in J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; are shape-shifters whose true form is unknown, that change shape to resemble their beholder&#x27;s worst fear (possibly inspired by the &quot;clutterbumph&quot; in Paul Gallico&#x27;s Manxmouse). They are unlike most boggarts of British folklore, whose appearance is fixed. Their closest parallel for a boggart able to change shape at will is probably to be found in a reference to a Lancashire boggart in the book &quot;Lancashire Folklore&quot; of 1867. 

In some contemporary fantasy fiction and films such as &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;, Mark Del Franco&#x27;s Convergent World books, and the fantasy writing of Juliana Horatio Ewing, boggarts are brownies who have been angered or become malevolent. This has been adopted into folklore studies but is not found in traditional sources.

=== Film and television ===
In the 2014 fantasy film &quot;Seventh Son&quot; an enormous malevolent boggart attacks the protagonists while they are on their journey to find the antagonist character. Boggarts also appear in the film&#x27;s original source material, &quot;The Spook&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. In the CITV children&#x27;s show &quot;The Treacle People&quot;, boggarts are furry, gremlin-like creatures that originate from the Treacle Mines. They are mischievous, frequently playfighting and causing a mess. They serve as pets, friends and pests to the townspeople. They have the ability to walk up walls and other inclined surfaces due to their feet, which resemble plungers. &quot;Kamen Rider Wizard&quot; features a villain of the week based on the boggart.

=== Games ===
In the &quot;&quot; card game&#x27;s Lorwyn block, the native goblins of the plane are called boggarts. In role-playing games, the boggart appeared as the immature form of a will-o&#x27;-wisp with shape-shifting abilities in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as well as Necromancer Games. A boggart appears in the game &quot;Home Safety Hotline&quot; 

== Boggarts and bogs ==
The connection between the word boggart and &#x27;bog&#x27; depends on folk etymology: there is no obvious association in many earlier sources between boggarts and the word &#x27;bog&#x27;; though this is frequent in post-war accounts. However, in Lincolnshire, the intimate connection of boggarts with marshland is attested in a 19th-century account. In this account the descriptive phrase &#x27;swamp bogles&#x27; is also employed. In 1882, the weekly journal &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, then edited by Charles Dickens Jr., describes a marsh-dwelling boggart, who milked farmers&#x27; cows at night. In Lancashire, when a person got lost in a marsh and was never seen again, the people were sure that a boggart had caught the poor unfortunate and devoured him.

<text>The Baloch ( ) or Baluch ( ; , plural ) are a nomadic, pastoral, ethnic group which speaks the Western Iranic Balochi language and is native to the Balochistan region of South and Western Asia, encompassing the countries of Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. There are also Baloch diaspora communities in neighbouring regions, including in Central Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula.

The majority of the Baloch reside within Pakistan. About 50% of the total Baloch population live in the Pakistani province of Balochistan, while 40% are settled in Sindh and a significant albeit smaller number reside in the Pakistani Punjab. They make up 3.6% of Pakistan&#x27;s total population, and around 2% of the populations of both Iran and Afghanistan and the largest non-Arab community in Oman.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the word &quot;Baloch&quot; is unclear. According to the Baloch historian Naseer Dashti (2012), the name of the ethnic group derives from &#x27;Balaschik&#x27; living in Balasagan, between the Caspian Sea and Lake Van in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the Sasanian times. The remnants of the original name such as &quot;Balochuk&quot; and &quot;Balochiki&quot; are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.

Some other writers suggest a derivation from Sanskrit words &quot;bal&quot;, meaning strength, and &quot;och&quot; meaning high or magnificent.

Regardless of its possible roots in ancient era, the ethnonym Baloch might be derived from a term cockscomb or crest used in Middle Persian that refer to the Baloch in Median kingdom and Kayanian dynasty who were part of the army of Astyages or Kay Khosrow troops. In ancient time, the Baloch wore distinctive helmets decorated with a cock&#x27;s comb. It is presumably indicated to Turban that known as the &quot;Paag&quot; in Balochi language. The Balochi traditionally wear various styles of the turban, wrapped around the head.

Ernst Emil Herzfeld believes that the word Baloch is derived from the Median term &quot;brza -vačiya&quot; meaning &quot;loud shouting&quot;.

An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Mihira Bhoja (r. 836–885), which says that the dynasty&#x27;s founder Nagabhata I repelled a powerful army of &quot;Valacha Mlecchas&quot;, translated as &quot;Baluch foreigners&quot; by D. R. Bhandarkar. The army in question is that of the Umayyad Caliphate after the conquest of Sindh.

==Language==

Balochi(, romanized: ) is an Indo-European language, spoken by the Baloch and belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the family. As an Iranian language, it is classified in the Northwestern group, spoken primarily in the Balochistan region of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. In addition, there are speakers in Oman, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Turkmenistan, East Africa and in diaspora communities in other parts of the world.

Uppsala University offers a course titled Balochi A, which provides basic knowledge of the phonetics and syntax of the Balochi language. Carina Jahani is a prominent Swedish Iranologist and professor of Iranian languages at Uppsala University, deeply researching in the study and preservation of the Balochi language.

There are a number of characteristic features that Balochi shares to Parthian and Median and close affinity with them.

The Balochi dialects are classified as:
*Eastern group (the Soleimani dialect group)
*Southern group or Makrani dialect (part of the Makrani dialect group)
*Western group (part of the Rakhshani dialect group)

Koroshi is also classified as Balochi.

Many Baloch are either bilingual or multilingual, speaking the language of their respective nation of origin, such as Urdu, Persian, and Arabic as a second language alongside their native Balochi, while those in diaspora communities often speak three or more languages.

==History==
===Antiquity===
During the rule of Achaemenid, The Baloch were among rebellious Medes and Parthians who supported Bardiya against Darius I and later allied with Darius III in The Battle of Gaugamela with Alexander.

Agha Mir Nasir Khan Ahmadzai the author of Seven-volume book on the history of Baloch and Balochistan, connects Balochs with Medes and considers them descendants of the Medes, the people of ancient Iran. He makes mention of all Baloch tribes are descendants of the Medes, who came to Balochistan and settled in ancient time.

Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr is a surviving Middle Persian text on Sasanian administrative geography and history, based on the source, Padishkhwārgar was a Sasanian province in Late Antiquity and People who contributed to building 21 cities in Padishkhwargar were Baloch.

Mansel Longworth Dames in 1902 stated that &quot;a theory of the origin of the Baloch people, the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they are of Median descent.&quot;

The Baloch were among Kay Khosrow allies and formed part of his army headed by General Ashkash. This is depicted in the mythological part of the Shahnamah a prose work written in Middle Persian.

Also in another piece of this pose which is depicted in the same work:
During the Sassanid era, Anoshervan and Ardashir fought against the Balochs and After initially sustaining a defeat, succeeded in subjugating the Baloch. The Baloch scattered in the Makran(modern-day Balochistan in Iran and Pakistan) and Kerman regions, areas that formed the southeastern frontier of the Sassanid Empire. Periodic uprisings or refusals to pay tribute might have been part of their interactions with the Sassanid kings.

===Medieval period===
According to Baloch lore, their ancestors hail from Aleppo in what is now Syria. After the fight against abbasid Caliph Harun under Ameer Hamza the Kharijites leader migrated to east or southeast of the central Caspian region, specially toward to east or southeast of the central Caspian region, specially toward Sistan, Iran.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the Western Iranian languages, the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central Caspian region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late Sasanian period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.

By the 9th century, Arab writers Istakhri, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Al-Muqaddasī refer to the Baloch as a distinct ethnical group living in the area between Kerman, Khorasan, Sistan, and Makran.
Ibn Khordadbeh, in Kitab al-Masalik wal-Mamalik, describes the geography of Makran, and mentions the Baloch as They are powerful, numerous, and engaged in animal husbandry, their houses are made of wood.
Al-Muqaddasī documented that Panjgur was the capital of Makran and that it was populated by people called Baloch.

The 12th century Seljuk invasion of Kerman seemed to have stimulated the further eastwards emigration of the Baloch, towards what is now the Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in the eastern parts of the Iranian Sistan-Baluchestan and Kerman provinces. By the 13th–14th centuries, waves of Baloch were moving into Sindh, and by the 15th century into the Punjab.

Dayaram Gidumal writes that a Balochi legend is backed up by the medieval Qarmatians. The fact that the Kalmatis were ethnic Baluchis is also confirmed by the Persian historian in the 16th century Muhammad Qasim Ferishta.

Traditionally, Jalal Khan was the ruler and founder of the first Baloch confederacy in 12th century. (He may be the same as Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu the last ruler of the Khwarezmian Empire.) Jalal Khan left four sons – Rind Khan, Lashar Khan, Hoth Khan, Korai Khan and a daughter, Bibi Jato, who married his nephew Murad.
Since 12th century Baloch chieftains ruled over most of Balochistan. Mir Jalal khan and Mir Chakar after the establishment of the Baloch Confederation, They extended their dominance on outside the borders of Balochistan, Mir Chakar seized control over Punjab and captured Multan. The great Baloch kingdom was based on tribal confederationn, Punjab and Balochistan remained under his rule for a period of time

According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, professor at University of Karachi, the Balochis migrated from Balochistan during the Little Ice Age and settled in Sindh and Punjab. The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, or alternatively, from about 1300 to about 1850.

The area where the Baloch tribes settled was disputed between the Persian Safavids and the Mughal emperors. Although the Mughals managed to establish some control over the eastern parts of the area, by the 17th century, a tribal Brahui leader named Mir Hasan established himself as the first &quot;Khan of the Baloch&quot;. In 1666, he was succeeded by Mir Aḥmad Khan Qambarani who established the Khanate of Kalat under the Ahmadzai dynasty. Originally in alliance with the Mughals, the Khanate lost its autonomy in 1839 with the signing of a treaty with the British colonial government and the region effectively became part of the British Raj.

===Safavid period===

The Baluch tribes revolted against the Safavid government. Engelbert Kaempfer writes about this: Despite their small numbers, they attacked Suleiman Shah with their fortifications.

During the Safavid dynasty sought to incorporate the Baloch regions into its administrative structure, the Baloch tribes maintained their autonomy through resistance, strategic alliances. In the reign of Soltan Hoseyn, a number of Baloch chiefs, ruling Balochistan and neighbouring areas.

===Afsharid period===

After the fall of the Safavids, Iran fell under the control of the Afsharid Empire ruled by Nader Shah. Nader Shah sought to consolidate and expand his empire, which brought him into contact with the Baloch.
Mohammad Khan Baloch became military commander in Afsharid Iran and Nader appointed Mohammad Khan Baloch the governor of fars, Kohgiluyeh and Khuzestan.
Many Baloch were moved to Khorasan in order to protect the eastern border from invading Afghans during the reign of afsharid dynasty.

===Khanate of Kalat===

The Khanate of Kalat founded in the 16th century by Mir Altaz Sani Khan Qambrani and played an important part of Baloch history. The major figure in its establishment was Mir Ahmad Khan, who, established his authority over Kalat. The dynasty established as a tribal confederacy of Baloch and Brahui tribes and emerged as a political entity that consolidated the power of these tribes under a single ruler, known as the Khan. Mir Ahmad Khan I was strong enough to capture Quetta, Mastung, and Pishin from the Mughal governor at Kandahar.

Nasir Khan I Ahmadzai the sixth ruler of kalat was one of the most prominent and influential rulers of the Khanate of Kalat. He played a crucial role in consolidating Baloch power, unifying the Baloch tribes, and shaping the political and administrative structure of the Khanate. 
The border of Balochestan in the reign of Nasir khan stretched from across modern-day Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. Northern Border in areas such as Helmand and parts of Kandahar (Balochistan, Afghanistan). In the East stretched as far as Punjab including Dera Ghazi Khan, in the south Makran coast along the Arabian Sea from Karachi to Bandar Abbas, in the western included Persian Balochistan (modern-day Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran), Kerman and Bandar abbas.

The Khanate of Kalat declined in the early 19th century, losing much of its territory to Qajar Iran, Emirate of Afghanistan and British Balochistan.

===Talpur period===
Talpur was a Baloch dynasty that originated in the modern-day Sindh region of Pakistan.

The Talpur ruled the Sindh until British conquest of Sindh in 1843.
The Talpur Baloch were a prominent Baloch tribe that rose to power in Sindh during the late 18th century and established their rule. The Battle of Miani (1843), took place near Hyderabad, Baloch forces under the last Talpur ruler Amir Nasir Khan Talpur defeated by the East India Company led by Charles Napier.

===Modern era===

For centuries, Balochistan was governed autonomously and local Baloch chieftains ruled Balochistan.
From 1666 Balochistan was continuously under the control of the Khanate of Kalat and ruled by confederacy of Baloch tribes, until the occupation of Balochistan by the British in 1839.

Baloch tribes in the Sarhad resisted the Persian government force. Gamshadzai, Yar Ahmadzai, Ismailzai and Kurd tribes fought against Persian force during 1888.
Sanjrani Baloch ruled Seistan with its capital at Chakansur in the early and late 19th century.
In 1897 the western regions of Balochistan were under the leadership of the chieftains of the Narui tribe.

Baloch nationalism in its modern form began in the form of the Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochan-wa-Balochistan based in Mastung in 1929, led by Yousaf Aziz Magsi, Abdul Aziz Kurd and others. In Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan province, insurgencies by Baloch nationalists have been fought in 1948-50, 1958–60, 1962–63 and 1973–1977, with an ongoing low-level insurgency beginning in 2003. The Baloch population in Pakistan has endured grave violations of human rights, which include extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture. These actions are purportedly perpetrated by state security forces and their associates.

The First Balochistan Conflict started when three of the princely states of Kalat acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after independence. 

During the Second Balochistan conflict The Baloch nationalist leader Nawab Nauroz Khan led an armed rebellion against the central government, demanding greater autonomy. This triggered a major armed conflict, with over 50,000 Baloch fighters resisting the Pakistani military.

The Third Balochistan conflict began and engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Pakistani military. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases. This insurgency ended in 1969, with the Baloch separatists agreeing to a ceasefire granting general amnesty to the separatists as well as freeing the separatists.

==Baloch communities==

=== Iran ===
Baloch in Iran are the majority ethnic inhabitants of the region of Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran.The town of Jask in neighbouring Hormozgan Province is also inhabited by Baloch people. Baloch people also make up a minority in the eastern parts of Kerman, Razavi Khorasan and South Khorasan (Khorasani Baloch) and are scattered throughout other provinces of Iran. They speak the Rakhshani and Sarawani dialects of Balochi, an Iranian language.

Sistan and Balochestan is one of the poorest and least developed provinces in Iran. Basic infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals, is lacking compared to other regions. The unemployment rate is disproportionately high, especially among Baloch youth. The majority of Iranian Baloch are Sunni Muslims, which distinguishes them from the predominantly Shia Muslim population of Iran. This religious difference has often contributed to tensions between the Baloch and the central government.

During the 1950s, tribal revolt led by a Baloch farmer Mir Daad Shah struck south eastern Iran. Elements of Baloch nationalism were present in this movement, he participated in a rebellion and armed insurgency against the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in the 1950s.

On September 30, 2022(Bloody Friday) in Zahedan a large number of Baloch civilians gathered for Friday prayers at the Grand Makki Mosque, the largest Sunni mosque in Iran, located in Zahedan.
After the prayers, peaceful demonstrations began, demanding justice for the sexual assault case of the alleged rape of a 15-year-old Baloch girl in June that by a commander of the police force in Chabahar. Iranian security forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and riot police, surrounded the area and opened fire on the protesters.
According to human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Baloch activist groups, at least 96 people were killed on the day of the massacre, and hundreds were injured.
Molavi Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi called the incident a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and demanded &quot;trial and punishment for those responsible for those who have killed people&quot;, adding that worshipers were shot in head and heart by snipers.
From this event, a picture of Khodanur Lojei, a Baloch protester whose hands were tied to a flagpole, with a cup of water put in front of him (but out of his reach) became a symbol in the ongoing protests.

Widely varying in purpose and style, among the Balochi folklore one will find stories about nature, anthropomorphic animals, love, heroes and villains, mythological creatures and everyday life. Baloch mythology often intertwines with their beliefs and geography, featuring supernatural. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like stories of Shahnameh and Iranian Mythology.
Ashkash is introduced in several verses in the Shahnameh as the commander of the Baloch army. This work has inspired Baloch heroic tales and has appeared in the works of Baloch writers and Baloch folklore.

===Music and Dance===
In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform dances and sing folk songs at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.

Zahīrōk is one of the musical forms of Baloch and in the beginning, was only sung by two groups of Baloch women.

Suroz and Ghaychak are popular instrument between Balochs such as craftspeople, folk artists, folk musicians and dance groups.

===Weaving===
Balochi weaving is renowned throughout the world, with fine specimens of both rugs and carpets. The most famous balochi rugs are those from Nimruz and Khorasan.
Wool is the primary material used, sourced from sheep and goats. In some cases, camel hair or a mix of natural fibers is also used.

In the case of Pakistan, breakdown by religious movements or sub-groups among the ethnic Baloch in the country as a whole is as following: 64.78% are Sunni-Deobandis, 33.38% are Sunni-Barelvis and 1.25% are Sunni-Ahl-i Hadith; Shia&#x27;s are 0.59%. Inside Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan province more specifically, the religious affiliation among the Baloch is: 68.75% Sunni-Deobandi, 30.38% Sunni-Barelvis, 0.79% Sunni-Ahl-i Hadith and 0.07% Shi&#x27;as.

==== Islamism ====
Although Baloch leaders, backed by traditional scholarship, have held that the Baloch people are secular, Christine Fair and Ali Hamza found during their 2017 study that, when it comes to Islamism, &quot;contrary to the conventional wisdom, Baloch are generally indistinguishable from other Pakistanis in Balochistan or the rest of Pakistan&quot;. There are virtually no statistically significant or substantive differences between Balochi Muslims and other Muslims in Pakistan in terms of religiosity, support for a sharia-compliant Pakistan state, liberating Muslims from oppression including Kashmir, etc.

==== Zikri sect ====

In 2020, 800,000 Pakistani Balochis were estimated to follow the Zikri sect.

Before the Islam era, the Baloch were the followers of Mazdakian and Manichean sects of Zoroastrian.

A number of Baloch tribes still preserve and adhere to pre-Islamic traditions, including the Nal oath (a type of oath to prove innocence by passing through fire) which is common among the Baloch around Taftan, and they are bilingual, speaking Parsiwani in addition to the Balochi language.

=== Hindu and Sikh minorities ===
A small number of Balochs are non-Muslims, particularly in the Bugti clan which has Hindu and Sikh members. 

Most of these Hindus or Sikhs are not ethnic Baloch, or not fully; for example, many Marathas were captured following their defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and were integrated within the Baloch tribal system (taking names like Bugti and more), their history having been covered in the 2023 Marathi movie &quot;Baloch&quot;.

Likewise, the Bhagnaris are a Hindu community living in India who trace their origin to southern Balochistan but migrated to India during the Partition. Numbering around 2,500 in Mumbai they identify as Sindhis in terms of ethnicity and speak Saraiki, a language close to Punjabi.

<text>Factsheet Five was a periodical mostly consisting of short reviews of privately produced printed matter along with contact details of the editors and publishers.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, its comprehensive reviews (thousands in each issue) made it the most important publication in its field, heralding the wider spread of what would eventually be called fanzine or zine culture. A number of underground artists and writers read or submitted their work to &quot;Factsheet Five&quot;, including Julie Doucet and Jonathan Lethem.

Before the widespread adoption of the web and e-mail beginning around 1994, publications such as &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; formed a vital directory for connecting like-minded people. It was the literary equivalent to such phenomena as &quot;International Sound Communication&quot; in the period of cassette culture. 
==History==
The magazine was originally published in 1982 by Mike Gunderloy on a spirit duplicator in his bedroom in a slanshack in Alhambra, California, though the first issue notes he was located at Hyde Park neighborhood in Boston. He started publishing this zine due to frustrations over the infrequent publication of &quot;The Stark Fist of Removal&quot;, of which he was a fan. The original focus was science fiction fanzines (the title comes from a short story by science fiction author John Brunner), but it included other reviews. Bob Grumman contributed a regular column on avant-garde poetry from 1987 to 1992.

Gunderloy later moved to Rensselaer, New York, where he continued to publish. By 1987, he was running a zine BBS, one of the first associated with an underground publication. In 1990, Cari Goldberg Janice and (briefly) Jacob Rabinowitz joined as co-editors. Gunderloy quit publishing &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; following the completion of Issue #44 in 1991.

Hudson Luce purchased the rights to &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; and published a single issue, Issue #45, with the help of BBS enthusiast Bill Paulouskas, cartoonist Ben Gordon, writer Jim Knipfel, and artist Mark Bloch, who had authored a mail art-related column called &quot;Net Works&quot; during the Gunderloy years.

R. Seth Friedman then published the magazine for five years in San Francisco, with the help of Christopher Becker, Miriam Wolf and Jerod Pore, until Issue #64 in 1998. Circulation grew to 16,000 during that time.

Gunderloy later worked as a computer programmer before retiring in 2020. He co-authored the book &quot;SQL Server 7 in Record Time.&quot;

== In other media ==
Jerod Pore collected articles and reviews from the print version of &quot;Factsheet Five&quot;, and with them produced &quot;Factsheet Five - Electric&quot;, one of the first zines to use the Usenet newsgroup alt.zines. Beginning in the late 1980s, Gunderloy and Pore also established a substantial online presence on the WELL, an influential, private dial-up BBS.
Three books were published based on &quot;Factsheet Five&quot;: &quot;How to Publish a Fanzine&quot; by Gunderloy (1988; Loompanics), &quot;The World of Zines&quot;, by Gunderloy and Janice (1992; Penguin), and &quot;The Factsheet Five Zine Reader&quot; by Friedman (1997, Three Rivers Press). Until 1989, Gunderloy collected and, in turn, made available several versions of the Gemstone File. A number of Gunderloy&#x27;s zine reviews from &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; also appeared in edited form in &quot;High Weirdness by Mail.&quot;
Mike Gunderloy&#x27;s Factsheet Five Collection of over 10,000 zines and mail art is now held at the New York State Library in Albany, New York, where it occupies . 
However, only about 4000 zines in the collection have been cataloged.

About 1/4 of the zines in the collection are listed on Excelsior, the New York State Library&#x27;s electronic catalog; staff of the Manuscripts &amp; Special Collection can help locate other items.

Two hundred and forty zines that R. Seth Friedman donated are in the collection of the San Francisco Public Library.

<text>The cassette culture (also known as the tape/cassette scene or cassette underground) is the amateur production and distribution of music and sound art on compact cassette that emerged in the mid-1970s. The cassette was used by fine artists and poets for the independent distribution of new work. An independent music scene based on the cassette burgeoned internationally in the second half of the 1970s.

==Background==
“Cassette culture” is an international music scene that developed in the wake of punk in the second half of the 1970s and continued through into the first half of the 1980s (the &quot;postpunk&quot; period), and in some territories into the 1990s, in which a large number of amateur musicians outside the established music industry, usually recording in their homes and usually recording to cassette-tape devices, produced music, very often of a non-mainstream or alternative character, that was then duplicated on cassette in very limited quantities and distributed free or sold at low cost to others involved in the scene and those who followed it. Often, these cassette-only albums of original music were completely self-produced by the artists, but small companies or labels also flourished during the period, producing cassette-only releases in small runs, both single-artist albums and compilations by various artists (in a few cases these labels also released vinyl). Numerous artists who first emerged at this time remain active today, some of them now releasing through commercial companies, others continuing with the DIY ethic of self-releasing on CD and the Internet. Since 2000 there has been a revival of the use of the cassette tape for the release of independent music (very often in conjunction with digital release) and a new “cassette scene” has sprung up.

==Initiating factors, historical background and periodization==
Technological factors enabled the rise of cassette culture. Improvement in the recording quality of cassettes and the availability of sophisticated cassette decks, as well as stereo &quot;boomboxes&quot;, in the late 1970s allowed &quot;recordists&quot; to record and duplicate high-quality copies of their music inexpensively. Bands did not need to go into expensive recording studios any longer. In addition, multi-track recording equipment was becoming affordable, portable and of fairly high quality in the early 1980s. Four-track cassette recorders developed by Tascam and Fostex allowed artists to record and get a reasonable sound at home. Electronic instruments, such as drum machines and synthesizers, became more compact and inexpensive. Therefore, it became increasingly feasible to construct home-recording studios, giving rise to the phenomenon of the &quot;home tapers&quot;. The recording and production qualities of much cassette-culture music means that it can often be described as lo-fi.

Particularly in North America, college radio played an important role, with stations broadcasting regular cassette-only radio shows that showcased and promoted the work of home-recording artists.

The cassette culture can be traced back to the early 1970s, when mail-artists and other artists and poets began making use of the cassette. Audio-art labels/publishers active in the early 1970s included Edition S-Press, Edition Amadulo and Black Box/Watershed. Balsam Flex was a London-based independent poetry-on-cassette label founded in 1972 by artist E.E. Vonna-Michell. It published work by experimental UK poets associated with the London-based Writers Forum and the so-called British Poetry Revival of the 1960s and 1970s, writers such as: Allen Fisher, Bob Cobbing, Peter Finch, Lawrence Upton, cris cheek and Ulli McCarthy/Freer. The British sculptor William Furlong&#x27;s &quot;Audio Arts&quot;, founded in 1973, was an arts magazine published on cassette and including sound art in addition to interviews with artists. The musical cassette scene was in part an offshoot of this earlier activity. Participants engaged in extensive tape trading in addition to selling their products. Advertising was done through fanzines and the circulation of photocopied catalogues, etc. The scene was also strongly stimulated by the DIY ethic of punk, and, free of commercial considerations, encouraged musical eclecticism, diversity and experimentation. Whilst distribution was mostly by mail, there were a few retail outlets that stocked independently produced cassette releases, such as (in the UK) Rough Trade and Falling A.

The &quot;cassette culture&quot; is a historical phenomenon, primarily in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Following the anti-establishment shock of punk a very creative period followed in popular music, the postpunk period (as documented in 
&quot;Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984&quot;, by Simon Reynolds). In the United Kingdom synth-pop was in the ascendant and industrial and postindustrial music was the vanguard of musical experimentation. Many (though by no means all) cassette artists, in Europe and elsewhere, drew on this new avant-garde for their inspiration. Popular-music papers such as &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; in the UK were marked by a new type of journalism, which discussed music (perhaps sometimes over-earnestly) as a serious art-form. In terms of broader developments, the Cold War and the nuclear arms-race were still a reality. In both the UK and the USA the political Right assumed power in the form of the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. In the UK this was accompanied by a widespread culture of opposition and dissent, often informed by radical Left ideology. The cassette-culture scene emerged in, was embedded in, this broader cultural landscape, enabled by new developments in electronic technology, and many of the artists shared a countercultural ethos in relation to the mainstream music of the time and towards contemporary society more broadly. The scene could not have existed before and the period of its flourishing gradually came to an end in the 1990s with the arrival of inexpensive digital technology for the production of both music and graphics and, of course, the arrival of the World Wide Web. Successor underground and DIY scenes have naturally arisen to take its place, but they are no more to be identified with the cassette culture that arose in the late 1970s than the postpunk revival is to be identified with the original postpunk period.

As with any other music scene, artists involved in the scene and others who followed it amassed, sometimes very substantial,
collections of independent cassette music. The sense of cassette culture in all its diversity as, nevertheless, a coherent international musical subculture has been reinforced since 2000 by a major revival of interest in the cassette artists of the 1970s and 1980s and the reissue of much music on LP and CD for a small but enthusiastic market (see below).

&quot;Cassette culture&quot; is a coinage that post-dates the scene itself. &quot;Cassette scene&quot; was a contemporary term.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom cassette culture was at its peak in what is known as the post-punk period, 1978–1984. UK cassette culture was championed by marginal musicians and performers such as Tronics, the Instant Automatons, Storm Bugs, Sean T. Wright, the insane picnic, the Cleaners from Venus, Nocturnal Emissions and Final Program, anarcho-punk groups such as the APF Brigade, The Crouches, The Apostles and Chumbawamba, and many of the purveyors of Industrial music, e.g. Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and Clock DVA. Artists self-releasing would often copy their music in exchange for &quot;a blank tape plus self-addressed envelope&quot;. But there also existed many small tape labels, such as Falling A Records, Sterile Records, Third Mind Records and Snatch Tapes, driven by enthusiasm rather than business principles, and in some cases consciously informed by anti-capitalist principles. There was great diversity amongst such labels, some were entirely &quot;bedroom based&quot;, utilizing domestic tape-copying technology, whilst others were more organized, functioning in a similar way to conventional record labels. Some also did vinyl releases, or later developed into vinyl labels. Many compilation albums were released, presenting samples of work from various artists. Two particularly ambitious compilation projects were the 5-volume &quot;Rising from the Red Sand&quot; (see below) and the 15-volume International Sound Communication series. It was not uncommon for artists who had a vinyl contract to release on cassette compilations, or to continue to do cassette-only album releases (of live recordings, work-in-progress material, etc.) after they had started releasing records. The cassette scene was, in other words, an integrated part of the alternative or underground music scene during the postpunk period.

Cassette culture received something of a mainstream boost when acknowledged by the major music press. The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;), &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;, the three main weekly music papers of the time in the UK, launched &quot;cassette culture&quot; columns, in which new releases would be briefly reviewed and ordering information given. In September 1982 the &quot;NME&quot; acknowledged the band Tronics for releasing in 1980 the first independent cassette album, entitled &quot;Tronics&quot;, to be nationally distributed. In the UK fanzines covering cassette culture included John Balance&#x27;s Stabmental.

Tim Naylor of Record Collector magazine has published articles in the 2000s on the cassette culture of the &#x27;70s/&#x27;80s, including &quot;C30, C60, C90, C21!&quot; (&quot;Record Collector&quot;, 393, September 2011) and &quot;Home Taping is Thrilling Music&quot; (&quot;Record Collector&quot;, 462, January 2017). Memoirs written by people involved in the UK cassette scene include &quot;Permanent Transience&quot; (2015), by Bendle of the band The Door and the Window, and &quot;The Luxury of Dreams: An Autobiography&quot; (2017), by Mark Automaton of the band The Instant Automatons.

==Continental Europe==

European artists involved in the cassette scene include: Esplendor Geométrico (Spain), Die Tödliche Doris (Germany), Maurizio Bianchi/M.B. (Italy), Ptôse (France), Absolute Body Control (Belgium), Clair Obscur (France), Non Toxique Lost (Germany), Giancarlo Toniutti (Italy).

Two of the more important cassette labels in Europe were Germany&#x27;s Datenverarbeitung, run by Andreas Müller, and Belgium&#x27;s Insane Music, run by Alain Neffe. Along with material recorded by himself in various configurations, Neffe curated and released numerous compilations featuring tracks sent to him from artists all over the world.

==United States==
In the US, cassette culture activity extended through the late 1980s and into the 1990s. Although larger operators made use of commercial copying services, anybody who had access to copying equipment (such as the portable tape-to-tape cassette players that became common in the early 1980s) could release a tape, and publicize it in the network of fanzines and newsletters that served the scene, such as &quot;OP Magazine&quot;, &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; and &quot;Unsound&quot;. The cassette culture became an inexpensive and democratic way for artists to make available music that was never likely to have mainstream appeal, and many found in the scene music that was more imaginative, challenging, beautiful, and groundbreaking than much of what was being released by the established music industry.

In the United States, cassette culture was associated with DIY sound collage, riot grrrl, and punk music and blossomed across the country on cassette labels such as: Psyclones, Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine, Randy Greif&#x27;s Swinging Axe Productions, Pass the Buck, E.F. Tapes, Mindkill, Happiest Tapes on Earth, Apraxia Music Research, and Sound of Pig (which released over 300 titles), From the Wheelchair to the Pulpit, Walls of Genius (which released over 30 titles, including their own, Architects Office and The Miracle), K Records, brown interior music. Artists such as PBK, Big City Orchestra, Alien Planetscapes, Don Campau, Ken Clinger, Dino DiMuro, Tom Furgas, The Haters, Zan Hoffman, If, Bwana, Hal McGee, Minóy, Dave Prescott, Dan Fioretti (who now identifies as female and goes by the name Dreamgirl Stephanie Ashlyn), Jim Shelley, Suburban Campers, The Silly Pillows, Linda Smith, Saboteur, and hundreds of others, recorded albums available only on cassette throughout the late 1980s and well into the 1990s.

The American cassette-culture scene has been quite well-served by documentary-makers, in contrast with the scenes in the UK and Europe. In 2009 Andrew Szava-Kovats, who was involved in the US scene under the name Data-Bank-A, released a 60-minute documentary &quot;Grindstone Redux: A Documentary About 1980&#x27;s Cassette Culture&quot; on the American cassette network, with contributions from many of those involved. In 2015 the independent filmmaker William Davenport released &quot;The Great American Cassette Masters&quot;, a 90-minute documentary interviewing many key US artists of the 1980s scene. &quot;Cassette: A Documentary Mixtape&quot; (2016), directed by Zack Taylor, George Petzold and Seth Smoot, is a 90-minute documentary which, as the title indicates, takes a broader view of the cassette format and its history and features the inventor of the cassette tape Lou Ottens. It examines nostalgia for the format and its return as a medium for contemporary independent musicians. In 2020 American author Jerry Kranitz published the highly illustrated book &quot;Cassette Culture: Homemade Music &amp; The Creative Spirit In The Pre-Internet Age&quot; (Vinyl On Demand).

==Other territories==

There were many cassette artists outside the United Kingdom, the US and Europe. There was a very active scene in Japan, as can be seen from the list of contributors to the International Sound Communication series of compilations.

==Creative packaging==
The packaging of cassette releases, whilst sometimes amateurish, was also an aspect of the format in which a high degree of creativity and originality were displayed. For the most part packaging relied on standard plastic cases with a photocopied &quot;J-card&quot; insert, but some made more of an effort. &quot;Anusol&quot; by the A Band, released on the Chocolate Monk label, came packaged with a &quot;suppository&quot; unique to each copy – one of which was a used condom wrapped in tissue. The BWCD label released a cassette by Japanese noise artist Aube that came attached to a blue plastic ashtray in the shape of a fish. EEtapes of Belgium&#x27;s 1995 release of This Window&#x27;s &quot;Extraction 2&quot; was packaged with an X-ray of a broken limb. The Barry Douglas Lamb album &quot;Ludi Funebres&quot; presented the cassette case in a tin, the tin filled with earth and the earth covered with leaves. Walls Of Genius went to great lengths, spray-painting abstract art on the cassette labels, affixing hand-made &quot;authentic&quot; stickers, painting cassette boxes (the &quot;white&quot; cassette, 1984), creating one-of-a-kind pinup covers (&quot;The Mysterious Case of Pussy Lust&quot;, 1985) and issuing &quot;Certificates of Genius&quot; to anybody discriminating enough to purchase one of their titles. The interested reader is referred to &quot;Tape-Mag.com&quot; (see below).

==Decline, revival of interest and the new cassette scene==
In the United Kingdom the cassette culture seemed to wane in the second half of the 1980s, and by the mid-1990s the scene in the United States was also in decline, with the appearance of new technologies and methods of distribution: CD-Rs and the widespread arrival of the Internet, MP3s and file sharing. However, the early 2000s saw a major revival of interest in the cassette culture of the late 1970s and 1980s, with many obscure tapes being made available on music blogs and the emergence of specialist labels, of which Vinyl On Demand is the best known, dedicated to reissuing on LP and CD material originally released on cassette. In October 2005 &quot;cassette_culture [c_c]&quot;, an international electronic mailing list, was established on Yahoo! Groups for discussion &quot;of all aspects of the DIY music scene, or cassette culture, of the late 1970s, 1980s, and into the 90s&quot;. Cassette releases have now been added to the Discogs database, and other databases, in great numbers. Cassette-culture releases can now fetch high prices (See Tim Naylor&#x27;s articles for Record Collector, mentioned above).

On 1 January 2018 Frank Bull of Vinyl On Demand Records launched &quot;Tape-Mag.com&quot;, a vast online database of cassette-culture and related material. Material, audio and visual, relating to the cassette culture of the 1970s and 1980s has become widely available on the Internet on platforms such as Bandcamp and Archive.org, and on social media.

Since the Millennium there has also been a revival in the use of the cassette by independent artists, with the rise of partly or wholly tape-based labels such as Burger Records, POST/POP, Memorials of Distinction, Tuff Enuff Records, Truant Recordings, First Base Tapes and Gnar Tapes. In 2007 (12–26 May) an exhibition was held at Printed Matter in New York City devoted to current American cassette culture entitled &quot;Leaderless: Underground Cassette Culture Now.&quot;

==Notable compilations since 2000==

A number of compilations devoted to or including significant representation of cassette-culture music of the 1970s and 1980s have been released since the revival of interest in the scene. The most ambitious collection of material is a trilogy from Cherry Red Records, each release comprising four CDs of material: &quot;Close to the Noise Floor: Formative UK Electronica 1975-1984&quot; (2016), &quot;Noise Reduction System: Formative European Electronica 1974-1984&quot; (2017), and &quot;Third Noise Principle: Formative North American Electronica 1975-1984&quot; (2019). In 2008 the Hyped To Death label released the CD &quot;Messthetics Greatest Hiss: Classics of the UK Cassette Culture DIY, 1979-1982&quot;. Perhaps the most significant British compilation of cassette-culture music released at the time was the 5-cassette &quot;Rising from the Red Sand&quot; (1983), on Third Mind Records (one of the more notable cassette labels), which contained 45 pieces of music. For many years this landmark collection was kept available (on cassette) by RRRecords, and in 2013 it was released on vinyl by Vinyl On Demand Records. Although not reissued since 1989, mention should also be made of 1983&#x27;s pioneering double-LP release &quot;The Elephant Table Album: a compilation of difficult music&quot;, a 21-track selection of work by British cassette-culture artists. The record was compiled by Dave Henderson, the cassette-culture reviewer for &quot;Sounds&quot; at the start of the 1980s. Henderson followed this with a sequel, &quot;Three Minute Symphony&quot;, another double LP, which threw the net wider to include European and US artists.

The interested reader is referred to the extensive output of vinyl editions for collectors released since 2004 on the German company Vinyl On Demand Records and the many CD releases of US and UK DIY music of the late &#x27;70s to early &#x27;80s released by the US label Hyped To Death.

<text>The Christian Democratic Appeal (, ; CDA) is a Christian democratic and conservative political party in the Netherlands.

Formed as a federation in 1975 by the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party, and the Christian Historical Union, it first participated in a general election in 1977 and unified into a single party in 1980. The party dominated Dutch politics from 1977 to 1994, becoming the largest party all but twice, with leaders Dries van Agt and Ruud Lubbers serving as prime minister.

The party faced a major defeat in the 1994 general election, after which the first two cabinets without its participation were formed. The CDA regained its status as the largest party between 2002 and 2010, during which leader Jan Peter Balkenende headed four cabinets. Between 2010 and 2023, the party saw further electoral decline under varied leadership, participating in three of four cabinets as a junior coalition partner. Following the 2023 general election, the party holds five seats in opposition, now led by Henri Bontenbal.

==History==

=== Founding ===
==== Predecessor parties ====

Since 1880, Catholics and the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) collaborated in the so-called Coalition. They shared a common goal of securing public funding for religious schools, which was achieved through the Pacification of 1917. In 1888, they established the first Christian democratic cabinet, the Mackay cabinet. This cooperation, however, was not without challenges, and in 1894, more anti-Catholic and aristocratic conservatives split from the ARP to form what would become the Christian Historical Union (CHU) in 1908. Within both parties, there remained a desire to reunite. Meanwhile, in 1904, the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses was formed, eventually evolving into the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP) in 1926 and later the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) in 1945.

During the Interwar period, all three parties remained continuously in government. After World War II, however, the KVP distanced itself from the CHU and especially the ARP, refraining from governing with them until 1952 and 1958, respectively, instead forming Roman/Red cabinets with the Labour Party (PvdA). Meanwhile, the parties began collaborating at the European level, with the CHU and ARP joining the KVP in the Nouvelles Equipes Internationale in 1953. Due to secularisation and depillarisation, the three parties lost their combined majority in the 1959 general election for the first time since 1918.

==== Merger talks ====
Influenced by the Second Vatican Council, the KVP published the report &quot;&quot; () and adopted its conclusions, which called for Christian democratic cooperation, in December 1966. The Night of Schmelzer in October 1966 exposed divisions both between and within the three parties, leading to disappointing election results for each. Consequently, the three parties accepted an ARP initiative to form the Group of Eighteen in April 1967, comprising six prominent politicians from each party, tasked with establishing a common foundation for Christian politics and, if successful, determining the best path forward.

Meanwhile, Christian-radical members within the three parties grew dissatisfied with their support in the 1967 general election, as they favored cooperation with progressive parties over alignment with the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the De Jong cabinet. To prevent this group from disrupting party cooperation, the leaders of the three parties announced on 14 February 1968 that in the next election, they would either unite into a single Christian party or only join the cabinet together. This announcement led a group of KVP radicals to leave the party the same month, founding the Political Party of Radicals (PPR). Two years later, a group of ARP radicals also left to establish the Evangelical Progressive Party (EVP).

In 1969, the Group of Eighteen proposed drafting a joint &quot;urgency programme,&quot; which the parties completed shortly before the 1971 general election, where they again lost seats. Following up on the Group of Eighteen, the Contact Council was established in 1972 to further develop their cooperation. Led by KVP Senator Piet Steenkamp, the council issued a memorandum in June 1972, advocating a single candidate list for the next election and the formation of a Christian democratic movement, with membership open to members of the three parties as well as direct members.

A month later, however, the first Biesheuvel cabinet collapsed, leaving insufficient time to prepare a single candidate list, resulting in another loss in the 1972 general election. As part of its polarisation strategy, the PvdA persuaded several KVP and ARP politicians to join its progressive Den Uyl cabinet during the 1972–1973 cabinet formation. This arrangement required their parliamentary groups to provide confidence and supply, while the CHU moved into opposition. This shift complicated the merger process, as the CHU stipulated that a joint list would depend on the &quot;actual parliamentary political situation&quot; (the so-called &quot;political mortgage&quot;).

==== Federation ====

Nevertheless, based on the memorandum, the Christian Democratic Appeal was officially formed as a pre-federation in 1973, with Steenkamp as its chairperson. It would employ a &quot;growth model&quot;, in which they would work out political and organizational details, while keeping the original parties until the last moment. Meanwhile discussions continued on the role of the Bible in the party and the political course. When the pre-federation was turned into a federation in 1975, some conservative members of the CHU and ARP left to form the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF).

===Van Agt cabinets, 1977–1982===

In 1976, the three parties announced that they would field a single candidate list at the 1977 general election, after their parliamentary groups had intensified cooperation. KVP minister of Justice Dries van Agt was the lead candidate. The election manifesto was titled &quot;Not by bread alone&quot; () and was progressive. The list was able to get one seat more than the three parties together five years earlier. Based on the results, a cabinet of PvdA, CDA and Democrats 66 (D66) was most likely and was discussed at the start of the 1977 cabinet formation. After seven months, the negotiations finally collapsed, after it had been suspended multiple times. Soon after, Van Agt was able to form the first Van Agt cabinet with the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).

Some progressive MPs nicknamed the loyalists, which included parliamentary leader Willem Aantjes, did not commit to support the cabinet, but only tolerated it. Their opposition forced the cabinet to compromise on the placement of nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. This issue would continue to divide the party until it was resolved in the 1980s and would contribute to the removal of loyalists Jan Nico Scholten and Stef Dijkman from the parliamentary group in 1983. Nevertheless, the first Van Agt cabinet was able to complete its term.

The federation was founding member of the European People&#x27;s Party on 8 July 1978. For the 1979 European Parliament election, they had first selected Wim Vergeer (KVP), but after Ruud Lubbers (KVP) had replaced Aantjes as parliamentary leader, Bouke Beumer (ARP) was selected. CDA won ten out of 25 seats and was the largest Dutch delegation to distribute the leadership between the parties.
On 11 October 1980, the three original parties ceased to exist and the CDA was founded as a unitary party. The differences between the groups would continue to exist for a long time within the party. It led to another group of members leaving the party and joining with the EPV to found the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party (EVP).

For the 1981 general election, Van Agt was reelected as lead candidate. Its election manifesto was titled &quot;For a meaningful existence&quot; () and compared to the previous manifesto shifted responsibility from the government to society. CDA became the largest party, despite losing a seat. Because CDA and VVD had lost their majority, the second Van Agt cabinet with PvdA and D66 was formed in the 1981 cabinet formation. Bad relations between PvdA and CDA led to crises from the start, and the cabinet fell within a year. Van Agt led the rump cabinet Van Agt III with D66 to prepare the next election.

===Lubbers cabinets, 1982–1994===

Van Agt was again lead candidate for the general election and its manifesto was the same as the previous year with an attachment. CDA lost three seats and ended second after PvdA. After the elections, Van Agt announced that he would leave politics and was succeeded as party leader by Lubbers. During the September–November 1982 cabinet formation, Lubbers would form the first Lubbers cabinet with the VVD. To combat the economic crisis, the cabinet implemented budget cuts, limited the welfare state and privatised state-owned companies. A major achievement was the Wassenaar Agreement in 1982, in which trade unions agreed to wage moderation in exchange for reduction of working hours by employers&#x27; organisations. This would be the start of the polder model, a concept in line with CDA&#x27;s principle of distributed responsibility.

The 1986 general election took place when the economy was improving, but the manifesto nevertheless focused on reducing the welfare state and shifting the responsibility to society. Given Lubber&#x27;s popularity for his &quot;no-nonsense approach&quot;, the slogan was &quot;Let Lubbers finish his job&quot; (). CDA won 54 seats, the highest a single party had ever won, mostly at the expense of the VVD. After the 1986 cabinet formation, the second Lubbers cabinet continuing with VVD as coalition partner. VVD felt like being in the supporting role, and finally brought down the cabinet in 1989 over the travel expenses allowance.

The manifesto for the 1989 general election built upon the previous with the addition of environmental management among the priorities. The CDA kept its 54 seats and after the 1989 cabinet formation the third Lubbers cabinet was formed with the PvdA. A notable reform in line with the CDA principle of distributed responsibility, was the privatization of the housing associations by CDA State Secretary for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment Enneüs Heerma, with which he started in 1989 and was finished in 1994.

===Opposition to Purple, 1994–2002===

In the run-up to the 1994 general election, Lubbers announced he would retire from Dutch politics and had named Elco Brinkman his successor. During the campaign, Lubbers appeared to distance himself from Brinkman. Furthermore, the freezing of pensions they had included in their manifesto proved unpopular with its elderly voters. CDA lost 20 of its 54 seats. The 1994 cabinet formation led to the first purple coalition, the first time since 1918 that CDA or its predecessors were not part of a cabinet. Enneüs Heerma succeeded Brinkman as parliamentary leader and attempted to be the voice of the opposition and bring the topic of family on the political agenda, but failed in both.

Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was selected as lead candidate for the 1998 general election. The election manifesto &quot;You don&#x27;t live together alone&quot; () differed from previous ones, focusing on communitarianism in contrast to the individualism of the purple coalition. However, De Hoop Scheffers was relatively unknown compared to his opponents, and the CDA, as a centrist party, struggled to simultaneously target both the left-wing PvdA and the right-wing VVD. It led to another loss of five seats and a continuation of the cabinet without CDA.

===Balkenende cabinets, 2002–2010===

In the run-up to the 2002 general election, a leadership crisis erupted between party leader De Hoop Scheffer and party chair Marnix van Rij, after which they both left. De Hoop Scheffer was succeeded as lead candidate by Jan Peter Balkenende. The campaign was dominated by the right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn and Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) with his critique of the purple cabinets. Fortuyn and Balkenende had agreed not to attack each other during the campaign. Near the end of the campaign, Fortuyn was assassinated, which led to civil unrest. In the election, many people voted for the CDA, hoping that it could bring stability and because it had not attacked Fortuyn like many other parties. CDA became the largest party with 43 seats, followed by LPF with 26 seats. In the 2002 cabinet formation, the first Balkenende cabinet was formed with CDA, VVD and LPF. The cabinet would fall after only three months due to struggles within the LPF.

CDA won another seat in the 2003 general election and remained the largest party. CDA started negotiations with PvdA in the 2003 cabinet formation, but after this failed, the second Balkenende cabinet was formed with VVD and D66. To comply with the deficit limits of the European Stability and Growth Pact, the cabinet cut back on social security, leading to protest within CDA. A major reform, which was started under the previous cabinet, was the introduction of a new system of health care insurance plan, which made an end to the distinction between public and private healthcare insurance funds, with the aim of reducing costs and waiting lists. The cabinet fell in 2006 after D66 left, leading to the formation of the third Balkenende cabinet as rump cabinet with VVD.

CDA lost three seats, but remained the largest party after the 2006 general election. In the cabinet formation it formed the fourth cabinet Balkenende with PvdA and the Christian Union (CU). The cabinet was confronted with the 2007–2008 financial crisis, leading to the nationalisation of some banks. CDA and PvdA disagreed a lot, and PvdA finally left the cabinet in 2010.

===Rutte cabinets, 2010–2023 ===

Despite open internal opposition, Balkenende was again selected as lead candidate for the 2010 general election, in which CDA lost half of its seats. Balkenende announced his resignation as party leader and was replaced by Maxime Verhagen. At first, Verhagen was aiming for opposition during the 2010 cabinet formation. However, after talks between purple plus collapsed, CDA entered negotiations with VVD and Party for Freedom (PVV), the latter would be providing confidence and supply. Within the party, some opposed a coalition with the radical right PVV. Verhagen&#x27;s co-negotiator Ab Klink resigned over the negotiations and two other MPs threatened to oppose the coalition, which would make it lose its majority. A was held to approve the result of the negotiations, which 68% of the record 4,700 members did. On 14 October, the first Rutte cabinet was sworn in with Verhagen as Deputy Prime Minister.
After the fall of the short-lived first Rutte cabinet in 2012, CDA held a leadership election, which was won by interim parliamentary leader Sybrand Buma, with runner-up Mona Keijzer receiving 26% of the votes. The election manifesto for the 2012 general election was titled &quot;Everyone&quot; () after a Strategic Deliberation had advised a position in the &quot;radical centre&quot;, focusing on all layers of society. In the election, CDA fell to 13 seats. CDA played no role in the 2012 cabinet formation which lead to the second Rutte cabinet and also stayed out of agreements the coalition made with opposition parties. In opposition, Buma followed a right-conservative line, embracing the &quot;angry citizen&quot; and focusing on norms and values.

Its manifesto for the 2017 general election, &quot;Choices for a better Netherlands&quot;, focused on norms and values, Dutch identity, insecurities and opposed excessive individualism. The CDA gained sixed seats and joined the third Rutte cabinet, with the VVD, D66 and CU.
Buma resigned in May 2019 and was succeeded temporarily by Pieter Heerma as parliamentary leader. A leadership election did not take place until July 2020. The chaotic election was narrowly won by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport Hugo de Jonge, with MP Pieter Omtzigt as runner-up. De Jonge withdrew as lead candidate in December, because he could not combine it with his duties as minister during the COVID-19 pandemic. In his place, the party board appointed Minister of Finance Wopke Hoekstra.

The party lost four seats in the March 2021 election. After the longest ever cabinet formation the party continued in fourth Rutte cabinet, which had the same composition as the previous. During the formation, Omtzigt had left the party, alleging he had been treated unfairly in the party, and later started the party New Social Contract (NSC). During the cabinet period, the party struggled with its position in the nitrogen crisis and the farmers&#x27; protests that followed. The party faced electoral competition from the new political party Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) on this issue.

=== Opposition, 2023–present ===

For the November 2023 general election, MP Henri Bontenbal was selected as party leader. The party received its worst result ever, securing only five seats.

==Political positions==
The CDA is a centre to centre-right Christian democratic party. It started relatively progressive compared to other European Christian democratic parties or secular conservative parties, but followed the general trend in Dutch politics in becoming more conservative and centre-right. The party had long been reluctant to call itself conservative, but it has been embraced by Bontenbal in 2023. It has become more communitarianist, in particular under Balkenende&#x27;s leadership, who was inspired by sociologist Amitai Etzioni.

The party has four main principles: stewardship, solidarity, distributed responsibility and public justice. Distributed responsibility refers to the way society should be organised: not one organisation should control all society, instead the state, the market, and social institutions, like churches and unions should work together. It is a combination of the neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty and the Catholic concept of subsidiarity.

=== Economic issues ===
==== Role of the government ====
Following the principles of distributed responsibility, CDA has always focused on a &quot;responsible society&quot;, where intervention by the government should be limited. To achieve this, CDA cherishes civil society. In its 1977 election manifesto, it ascertained that Dutch society was not yet a real responsible society, and that the government should help society achieve this. In the 1980s, CDA concluded that the government spending levels were unsustainable and focused on budgets cuts and reducing the welfare state. In the 1990s, its confidence in and expectations of society grew, as well in the responsibility of individual citizens. Notable reforms in this direction have been the privatisation of the housing associations in 1994 and the healthcare reform in 2006.

==== Environment ====
CDA supports the protection of the environment based on the principle of stewardship. It aims to reconcile the protection of the environment with economic growth, although the latter often prevailed.

=== Social issues ===
==== Abortion ====

CDA has always held a middle position in the debate on abortion in the Netherlands, advocating for &quot;no unless&quot;. CDA supports the right to abortion when the life of the woman is in danger. It has accepted since its creation that a majority in the Netherlands was in favor of abortion beyond that, arguing that their own ethical values should not be codified in law. CDA is however in favor of some limitations, including abortion being in the Criminal Code and a reflection period of five days. A majority of its representatives voted for the compromise abortion law in 1981, while a majority voted against the removal of the reflection period in 2021.

==== Family ====
Today, CDA supports same-sex marriage in the Netherlands, although it did not do so early on. From the start CDA opposed same-sex marriage, but supported the registration of other forms of cohabitation. This was more explicitly mentioned in election manifestos after its think thank published its report &quot;1+1=together&quot; in 1986. In 1997, CDA voted against a bill that would allow civil union for same-sex relationships, because it would also be open to opposite-sex relationships. In 2000, all but three CDA members of parliament voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage. Since then, CDA became more supportive of same-sex marriage, voting in favour of a law giving married lesbians the same parenting rights as opposite-sex parents.

=== International affairs ===
==== Europe ====
Based on the Chapel Hill expert survey (2014), CDA can be qualified as &quot;Eurorealist&quot;, while it had been more pro-European in the past. In its party manifesto in 1980, the CDA strived for a &quot;united Europe&quot; and in 1979 they had endorsed the EPP election manifesto which called for a federal Europe. In the early 2000s CDA started emphasizing the national identity, writing in its 2004 election manifesto it wanted &quot;to ensure that we do not lose our own Dutch identity in the larger Europe&quot;. A turning point was the 2005 referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which was voted down. CDA had officially endorsed the Treaty, but Balkenende was largely absent during the campaign. The focus shifted to the national interest in Europe. Around the same that the EPP started to distance itself from a federal Europe in its new party manifesto, CDA wrote in its manifesto for the 2014 European Parliament election the party &quot;is and remains against a federal Europe&quot;. It turned against enlargement of the European Union, which it had supported in the previous decade.

== Electorate ==
The core electorate of the CDA are church members, both Catholics and Protestants. Part of the electoral decline can be attributed to secularisation (9-10 seats in the period 1970-2010), while church members increasingly have been voting for other (mostly non-religious) parties (10-14 seats in the period 1970-2010). Non church members at times also vote for CDA, with a record during the 2002 general election. The CDA has been stated to be an issue owner of &quot;norms and values&quot;.

=== 2021–2023 ===
Voter surveys held after the March 2021 general election and the March 2023 provincial elections showed that the average CDA voter&#x27;s self-placement on a left-right axis was slightly to the right of the average voter. They were slightly less supportive of euthanasia and climate policy. CDA voters were more opposed to immigration than the average voter in 2021, but this difference had disappeared by 2023. 2023 CDA voters also had more trust in political parties than the average voter. The average CDA voter was older than the average voter, at 63 in 2021 (compared to 55 among all voters) and 61 in 2023 (compared to 56 among all voters). Around 60% of CDA voters described themselves as religious, a proportion twice as high as the proportion among all voters. Around 60 to 70% of CDA voters lived in rural areas, compared to roughly half of all voters. CDA voters felt considerably more connected to other people than voters of other parties and, in 2023, were slightly happier about their life.

== Organisation ==

=== Linked organisations ===
==== CDA Research Institute ====
The think tanks of CDA&#x27;s predecessors, &quot;Dr. Abraham Kuyperstichting&quot; (ARP), &quot;Centrum voor Staatkundige Vorming&quot; (KVP) and the &quot;Jhr.mr. A.F. de Savornin Lohmanstichting&quot; (CHU), started working together in 1972 and played a role in the Contact Council. On 15 December 1977, the &quot;Stichting Studiecentrum CDA&quot; was founded as a collaborative body for the three think tanks. The think tanks merged into the &quot;Stichting Studiecentrum CDA&quot; in 1980, when the parties merged, and in 1981 the name was changed to &quot;CDA Research Institute&quot; ().

==== Christian Democratic Youth Appeal ====
The youth wing of the CDA is the Christian Democratic Youth Appeal (CDJA). It was founded as a federation of the youth wings of its predecessors in 1977 and they merged in 1981. The CDJA has a seat in the Association Council of the CDA and is often active with motions and amendments in party conventions.

===International organisations===
====European People&#x27;s Party ====

The CDA is a founding member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and its parliamentary group in the European Parliament in 1976. For the establishment, CDA focused on the Christian democratic character it believed the party should have. This was explicit in its programme, but CDA believed it should also be visible in the name and membership of the party. In contrast, the more secular and antisocialist Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) wanted to include conservative parties, to become the largest group and form a front against socialism. As a compromise, the term &quot;Christian democratic&quot; would be included in the subtitle and non-Christian democratic parties would not be allowed to join.

CDA would for a long time oppose the membership of the Conservative Party (UK), Forza Italia and the return of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party. In 2019, called for the expulsion of the Hungarian Fidesz party, because of the rule of law and press freedom under its rule, which finally led Fidesz to leave in 2021. In the past, the Dutch parties 50PLUS and Christian Union were part of the EPP parliamentary group, but not of the party. The Dutch parties New Social Contract (NSC) and the Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) are since 2024 also member of the parliamentary group.

====Centrist Democrat International====
CDA is member of the Centrist Democrat International.

<text>Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. It occurs when skin cells grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors. The primary cause of skin cancer is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning devices. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin that may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.
More than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased, partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers, exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell skin cancers, total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with lighter skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy.
Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell skin cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may, less commonly, involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as fluorouracil. Treatment of melanoma may involve some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapy. In those people whose disease has spread to other areas of the body, palliative care may be used to improve quality of life. Melanoma has one of the higher survival rates among cancers, with over 86% of people in the UK and more than 90% in the United States surviving more than 5 years.
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, globally accounting for at least 40% of cancer cases. The most common type is nonmelanoma skin cancer, which occurs in at least 2–3 million people per year. This is a rough estimate; good statistics are not kept. Of nonmelanoma skin cancers, about 80% are basal-cell cancers and 20% squamous-cell skin cancers. Basal-cell and squamous-cell skin cancers rarely result in death. In the United States, they were the cause of less than 0.1% of all cancer deaths. Globally in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. White people in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. The three main types of skin cancer have become more common in the last 20 to 40 years, especially regions where the population is predominantly White.
== Classification ==

There are three main types of skin cancer: basal-cell skin cancer (basal-cell carcinoma) (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (squamous-cell carcinoma) (SCC) and malignant melanoma.
Basal-cell carcinomas are most commonly present on sun-exposed areas of the skin, especially the face. They rarely metastasize and rarely cause death. They are easily treated with surgery or radiation. Squamous-cell skin cancers are also common, but much less common than basal-cell cancers. They metastasize more frequently than BCCs. Even then, the metastasis rate is quite low, with the exception of SCC of the lip or ear, and in people who are immunosuppressed. Melanoma are the least frequent of the three common skin cancers. They frequently metastasize, and can cause death once they spread.

Less common skin cancers include: Merkel cell carcinoma, Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast, atypical fibroxanthoma, porocarcinoma, spindle cell tumors, sebaceous carcinomas, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and skin sarcomas, such as angiosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma.

BCC and SCC often carry a UV-signature mutation indicating that these cancers are caused by UVB radiation via direct DNA damage. However malignant melanoma is predominantly caused by UVA radiation via indirect DNA damage. The indirect DNA damage is caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Research indicates that the absorption of three sunscreen ingredients into the skin, combined with a 60-minute exposure to UV, leads to an increase of free radicals in the skin, if applied in too little quantity and too infrequently. However, the researchers add that newer creams often do not contain these specific compounds, and that the combination of other ingredients tends to retain the compounds on the surface of the skin. They also add that frequent re-application reduces the risk of radical formation.

== Signs and symptoms ==
There are a variety of different skin cancer symptoms. These include changes in the skin that do not heal, ulcering in the skin, discolored skin, and changes in existing moles, such as jagged edges to the mole, enlargement of the mole, changes in color, the way it feels or if it bleeds. Other common signs of skin cancer can be painful lesion that itches or burns and large brownish spot with darker speckles.

=== Basal-cell skin cancer ===
Basal-cell skin cancer (BCC) usually presents as a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, torso or shoulders. Sometimes small blood vessels (called telangiectasia) can be seen within the tumor. Crusting and bleeding in the center of the tumor frequently develops. It is often mistaken for a sore that does not heal. This form of skin cancer is the least deadly, and with proper treatment can be eliminated, often without significant scarring.

=== Squamous-cell skin cancer ===
Squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) is commonly a red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin. Some are firm hard nodules and dome shaped like keratoacanthomas. Ulceration and bleeding may occur. When SCC is not treated, it may develop into a large mass. Squamous-cell is the second most common skin cancer. It is dangerous, but not nearly as dangerous as a melanoma.

=== Melanoma ===
Most melanoma consist of various colours from shades of brown to black. A small number of melanoma are pink, red or fleshy in colour; these are called amelanotic melanoma and tend to be more aggressive. Warning signs of malignant melanoma include change in the size, shape, color or elevation of a mole. Other signs are the appearance of a new mole during adulthood or pain, itching, ulceration, redness around the site, or bleeding at the site. An often-used mnemonic is &quot;ABCDE&quot;, where A is for &quot;asymmetrical&quot;, B for &quot;borders&quot; (irregular: &quot;Coast of Maine sign&quot;), C for &quot;color&quot; (variegated), D for &quot;diameter&quot; (larger than 6 mm – the size of a pencil eraser) and E for &quot;evolving.&quot;

=== Other ===
Merkel cell carcinomas are most often rapidly growing, non-tender red, purple or skin colored bumps that are not painful or itchy. They may be mistaken for a cyst or another type of cancer.

== Causes ==
Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary environmental cause of skin cancer. This can occur in professions such as farming. Other risk factors that play a role include:
* Light skin color
* Age
* Smoking tobacco
* HPV infections increase the risk of squamous-cell skin cancer.
* Some genetic syndromes including congenital melanocytic nevi syndrome which is characterized by the presence of nevi (birthmarks or moles) of varying size which are either present at birth, or appear within 6 months of birth. Nevi larger than 20 mm (3/4&quot;) in size are at higher risk for becoming cancerous.
* Chronic non-healing wounds. These are called Marjolin&#x27;s ulcers based on their appearance, and can develop into squamous-cell skin cancer.
* Ionizing radiation such as X-rays, environmental carcinogens, and artificial UV radiation (e.g. tanning beds). It is believed that tanning beds are the cause of hundreds of thousands of basal and squamous-cell skin cancer. The World Health Organization now places people who use artificial tanning beds in its highest risk category for skin cancer.
* Alcohol consumption, specifically excessive drinking increase the risk of sunburns.
* The use of many immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of skin cancer. Cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor for example increases the risk approximately 200 times, and azathioprine about 60 times.
* Deliberate exposure of sensitive skin not normally exposed to sunlight during alternative wellness behaviors such as perineum sunning.

===UV-induced DNA damage===

UV-irradiation of skin cells causes damage to DNA through photochemical reactions. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formed by adjacent thymine bases, or by adjacent cytosine bases, are frequent types of DNA damage induced by UV. Human skin cells are capable of repairing most UV-induced damage by nucleotide excision repair, a process that protects against skin cancer, but may be inadequate at high levels of exposure.

== Pathophysiology ==

A malignant epithelial tumor that primarily originates in the epidermis, in squamous mucosa or in areas of squamous metaplasia is referred to as a squamous-cell carcinoma.

Macroscopically, the tumor is often elevated, fungating, or may be ulcerated with irregular borders. Microscopically, tumor cells destroy the basement membrane and form sheets or compact masses which invade the subjacent connective tissue (dermis). In well differentiated carcinomas, tumor cells are pleomorphic/atypical, but resembling normal keratinocytes from prickle layer (large, polygonal, with abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm and central nucleus).

Their disposal tends to be similar to that of normal epidermis: immature/basal cells at the periphery, becoming more mature to the centre of the tumor masses. Tumor cells transform into keratinized squamous cells and form round nodules with concentric, laminated layers, called &quot;cell nests&quot; or &quot;epithelial/keratinous pearls&quot;. The surrounding stroma is reduced and contains inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes). Poorly differentiated squamous carcinomas contain more pleomorphic cells and no keratinization.

A molecular factor involved in the disease process is mutation in gene PTCH1 that plays an important role in the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is by biopsy and histopathological examination.

Non-invasive skin cancer detection methods include photography, dermatoscopy, sonography, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, terahertz spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, the multispectral imaging technique, thermography, electrical bio-impedance, tape stripping and computer-aided analysis.

Dermatoscopy may be useful in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma in addition to skin inspection.

There is insufficient evidence that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful in diagnosing melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. OCT may have a role in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma but more data is needed to support this.

Computer-assisted diagnosis devices have been developed that analyze images from a dermatoscope or spectroscopy and can be used by a diagnostician to aid in the detection of skin cancer. CAD systems have been found to be highly sensitive in the detection of melanoma, but have a high false-positive rate. There is not yet enough evidence to recommend CAD as compared to traditional diagnostic methods.

High-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is of unclear usefulness in the diagnosis of skin cancer. There is insufficient evidence for reflectance confocal microscopy to diagnose basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma or any other skin cancers.

== Prevention ==
Sunscreen is effective and thus recommended to prevent melanoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. There is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal-cell carcinoma. Other advice to reduce rates of skin cancer includes avoiding sunburn, wearing protective clothing, sunglasses and hats, and attempting to avoid sun exposure or periods of peak exposure. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people between 9 and 25 years of age be advised to avoid ultraviolet light.

The risk of developing skin cancer can be reduced through a number of measures including decreasing indoor tanning and mid-day sun exposure, increasing the use of sunscreen, and avoiding the use of tobacco products.

It is important to limit sun exposure and to avoid tanning beds, because they both involve UV light. UV light is known to damage skin cells by mutating their DNA. The mutated DNA can cause tumors and other growths to form on the skin. Further, there are other risk factors beside just UV exposure. Fair skin, prolonged history of sunburns, moles, and family history of skin cancer are just a few.

There is insufficient evidence either for or against screening for skin cancers. Vitamin supplements and antioxidant supplements have not been found to have an effect in prevention. Evidence for reducing melanoma risk from dietary measures is tentative, with some supportive epidemiological evidence, but no clinical trials.

Zinc oxide and titanium oxide are often used in sunscreen to provide broad protection from UVA and UVB ranges.

Eating certain foods may decrease the risk of sunburns but this is much less than the protection provided by sunscreen.

A meta-analysis of skin cancer prevention in high risk individuals found evidence that topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion reduced the rate of appearance of basal cell carcinomas in people with xeroderma pigmentosum, and that acitretin taken by mouth may have a skin protective benefit in people following kidney transplant.

A paper published in January 2022 showed that a vaccine that stimulates the production of a protein critical to the skin&#x27;s antioxidant network could reinforce people&#x27;s defenses against skin cancer.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is dependent on the specific type of cancer, location of the cancer, age of the person, and whether the cancer is primary or a recurrence. For a small basal-cell cancer in a young person, the treatment with the best cure rate (Mohs surgery or CCPDMA) might be indicated. In the case of an elderly frail man with multiple complicating medical problems, a difficult to excise basal-cell cancer of the nose might warrant radiation therapy (slightly lower cure rate) or no treatment at all. Topical chemotherapy might be indicated for large superficial basal-cell carcinoma for good cosmetic outcome, whereas it might be inadequate for invasive nodular basal-cell carcinoma or invasive squamous-cell carcinoma. In general, melanoma is poorly responsive to radiation or chemotherapy.

For low-risk disease, radiation therapy (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate control of the disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, epidermal radioisotope therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage can be found in the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.

Mohs&#x27; micrographic surgery (Mohs surgery) is a technique used to remove the cancer with the least amount of surrounding tissue and the edges are checked immediately to see if tumor is found. This provides the opportunity to remove the least amount of tissue and provide the best cosmetically favorable results. This is especially important for areas where excess skin is limited, such as the face. Cure rates are equivalent to wide excision. Special training is required to perform this technique. An alternative method is CCPDMA and can be performed by a pathologist not familiar with Mohs surgery.

In the case of disease that has spread (metastasized), further surgical procedures or chemotherapy may be required.

Treatments for metastatic melanoma include biologic immunotherapy agents ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, cemiplimab; BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib; and a MEK inhibitor trametinib.

In February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first cancer treatment that uses tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, also called TIL therapy, specifically for melanomas that have not improved with other treatments. Additionally, scientists are testing a vaccine designed to match the unique genetic details of a patient&#x27;s cancer in an advanced clinical trial.

=== Reconstruction ===
Currently, surgical excision is the most common form of treatment for skin cancers. The goal of reconstructive surgery is the restoration of normal appearance and function. The choice of technique in reconstruction is dictated by the size and location of the defect. Excision and reconstruction of facial skin cancers are generally more challenging due to the presence of highly visible and functional anatomic structures in the face.

When skin defects are small in size, most can be repaired with simple repair where skin edges are approximated and closed with sutures. This will result in a linear scar. If the repair is made along a natural skin fold or wrinkle line, the scar will be hardly visible. Larger defects may require repair with a skin graft, local skin flap, pedicled skin flap, or a microvascular free flap. Skin grafts and local skin flaps are by far more common than the other listed choices.

Skin grafting is patching of a defect with skin that is removed from another site in the body. The skin graft is sutured to the edges of the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the graft for seven to ten days, to immobilize the graft as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness skin graft, a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh. The donor site regenerates skin and heals over a period of two weeks. In a full thickness skin graft, a segment of skin is totally removed and the donor site needs to be sutured closed.

Split thickness grafts can be used to repair larger defects, but the grafts are inferior in their cosmetic appearance. Full thickness skin grafts are more acceptable cosmetically. However, full thickness grafts can only be used for small or moderate sized defects.

Local skin flaps are a method of closing defects with tissue that closely matches the defect in color and quality. Skin from the periphery of the defect site is mobilized and repositioned to fill the deficit. Various forms of local flaps can be designed to minimize disruption to surrounding tissues and maximize cosmetic outcome of the reconstruction. Pedicled skin flaps are a method of transferring skin with an intact blood supply from a nearby region of the body. An example of such reconstruction is a pedicled forehead flap for the repair of a large nasal skin defect. Once the flap develops a source of blood supply form its new bed, the vascular pedicle can be detached.

== Prognosis ==
The mortality rate of basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinoma is around 0.3%, causing 2000 deaths per year in the US. In comparison, the mortality rate of melanoma is 15–20% and it causes 6500 deaths per year. Even though it is much less common, malignant melanoma is responsible for 75% of all skin cancer-related deaths.

The survival rate for people with melanoma depends upon when they start treatment. The cure rate is very high when melanoma is detected in early stages, when it can easily be removed surgically. The prognosis is less favorable if the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body. As of 2003 the overall five-year cure rate with Mohs&#x27; micrographic surgery was around 95 percent for recurrent basal cell carcinoma.

Australia and New Zealand exhibit one of the highest rates of skin cancer incidence in the world, almost four times the rates registered in the United States, the UK and Canada. Around 434,000 people receive treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers and 10,300 are treated for melanoma. Melanoma is the most common type of cancer in people between 15 and 44 years in both countries. The incidence of skin cancer has been increasing. The incidence of melanoma among Auckland residents of European descent in 1995 was 77.7 cases per 100,000 people per year, and was predicted to increase in the 21st century because of &quot;the effect of local stratospheric ozone depletion and the time lag from sun exposure to melanoma development.&quot;

== Epidemiology ==
Skin cancers result in 80,000 deaths a year as of 2010, 49,000 of which are due to melanoma and 31,000 of which are due to non-melanoma skin cancers. This is up from 51,000 in 1990.

More than 3.5 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States, which makes it the most common form of cancer in that country. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer at some point of their lives. The most common form of skin cancer is basal-cell carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Unlike for other cancers, there exists no basal and squamous cell skin cancers registry in the United States.

=== Melanoma ===
In the US in 2008, 59,695 people were diagnosed with melanoma, and 8,623 people died from it. In Australia more than 12,500 new cases of melanoma are reported each year, out of which more than 1,500 die from the disease. Australia has the highest per capita incidence of melanoma in the world.

Although the rates of many cancers in the United States is falling, the incidence of melanoma keeps growing, with approximately 68,729 melanomas diagnosed in 2004 according to reports of the National Cancer Institute.

Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK (around 13,300 people were diagnosed with melanoma in 2011), and the disease accounts for 1% all cancer deaths (around 2,100 people died in 2012).

=== Non-melanoma ===
Approximately 2,000 people die from basal or squamous cell skin cancers (non-melanoma skin cancers) in the United States each year. The rate has dropped in recent years. Most of the deaths happen to people who are elderly and might not have seen a doctor until the cancer had spread; and people with immune system disorders.

<text>Lodi ( , ; Ludesan: ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in Lombardy, northern Italy, primarily on the western bank of the River Adda. It is the capital of the province of Lodi.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Lodi was a Celtic village; in Roman times it was called, in Latin, Laus Pompeia (probably in honour of the consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo) and was known also because its position allowed many Gauls of &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; to obtain Roman citizenship. It was in an important position where a vital Roman road crossed the River Adda.

Lodi became the see of a diocese in the 3rd century. Saint Bassianus (San Bassiano) is the patron saint of the town.

===Middle Ages===
A free commune around 1000, it fiercely resisted the Milanese, who destroyed it in 1111. The old town corresponds to the modern Lodi Vecchio. Frederick Barbarossa rebuilt it on its current location in 1158.

From 1220, the &quot;Lodigiani&quot; (inhabitants of Lodi) spent decades in constructing a system of miles of artificial rivers and channels (called &quot;Consorzio di Muzza&quot;). It was created to give water to the countryside, turning arid areas into one of the region&#x27;s important agricultural areas.

===Renaissance===
From the 14th century Lodi was ruled by the Visconti family, who built a castle there. In 1413, the antipope John XXIII launched the bull by which he convened the Council of Constance from the Duomo of Lodi. The council marked the end of the Great Schism.

In 1454, representatives from all the regional states of Italy met in Lodi to sign the treaty known as the peace of Lodi, by which they intended to pursue Italian unification. This peace lasted 40 years.

The town was then ruled by the Sforza family, France, Spain and Austria.

===Early modern era===
In 1786, it became the eponymous capital of a province that between 1815 and 1859 included Crema.

On 10 May 1796, in the first major battle of his career as a general, the young Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Habsburg monarchy at the Battle of Lodi.

===Italy===
In the second half of the 19th century, Lodi began to expand outside the city walls and was boosted by economic expansion and the construction of railway lines that followed the unification of Italy.

In 1945, the Italian petrol company Agip, directed by Enrico Mattei, started extracting methane from its fields, and Lodi was the first Italian town with a regular domestic gas service.

The town is now at the heart of important communication routes, and is a technologically advanced industrial centre, maintaining, however, also its strong traditional ceramics tradition.

==Main sights==

==Economy==
In 1864 Tiziano Zalli founded the Banca Popolare di Lodi, the first Italian cooperative bank (now part of Banco Popolare group).

In 1945, the Italian petrol company Agip, directed by Enrico Mattei, started extracting methane from its fields, and Lodi was the first Italian town with a regular domestic gas service.

Zucchetti S.p.A., the first Italian software house, was founded in Lodi in 1978 and has its headquarters in the Zucchetti Tower.

L’Erbolario Società Benefit S.r.l., a company specialized in natural cosmetics and beauty products established in Lodi in 1978, has its production plant and logistics center in the city.

&quot;IBSA&quot; Institut Biochimique SA, a Swiss pharmaceutical multinational company, has its Italian headquarters in Lodi, as well as a production plant.

The Officine Meccaniche Lodigiane were also located in the city.

===Ceramics===

The production of ceramic in the Lodi area reached its artistic peak in the 18th century, with the production of fine, tin-glazed maiolica. The main factories were those of Coppellotti, Ferretti and Rossetti.

The best ceramics of the Coppellotti factory date from the period 1735–1740. Some are in monochromatic turquoise and are decorated with arabesques, draperies and geometric-floral compositions arranged in a radial pattern. Other ceramics represent local life and scenes, such as fruit, fish, landscapes, castles, peasants, wayfarers, music players, with dogs or birds; some represent oriental figures.

The Rossetti factory was active in Lodi between 1729 and 1736. Most of the Rossetti ceramics are in monochromatic turquoise and have decorations inspired by Roman art revisited in a Baroque style, such as pillars, balustrades, capitals, urns, shells, stylized leaves garlands, divinities and satyrs. Some ceramics feature landscapes in the center, with views of cities and castles, hills, lakes, clouds and birds.

The Ferretti factory was active in Lodi in the 18th century until the beginning of the 19th century. Ferretti ceramics are famous for the decoration with naturalistic flowers, with very bright and lively colours. Most frequently these were wild flowers, such as forget-me-not, buttercups, Centaurea cyanus, campanula, primroses and dog rose; but also cultivated roses, tulips and carnations were painted. Ferretti also painted other kind of decorations, such as Oriental figures, fruits, fish and still lifes.

A large exposition of Lodi ceramics could be visited in The Museo Civico di Lodi until its closure in 2011, when all its content was moved to long-term storage waiting for relocation.

<doc id="64998" wikidata="Q1065444" url="?curid=64998" title="Kaiju">
<text>is a Japanese term that is commonly associated with media involving giant monsters. Its widespread contemporary use is credited to &quot;tokusatsu&quot; (special effects) director Eiji Tsuburaya and filmmaker Ishirō Honda, who popularized the &quot;kaiju&quot; film genre by creating the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and its spin-offs. The term can also refer to the monsters themselves, which are usually depicted attacking major cities and battling either the military or other creatures.

&quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) is often regarded as the first &quot;kaiju&quot; movie. When developing it, Honda and Tsuburaya drew inspiration from the character of King Kong, both in its influential 1933 film and in the conception of a giant monster, establishing it as a pivotal precursor in the evolution of the genre. During its formative years, &quot;kaiju&quot; movies were generally neglected by Japanese critics, who regarded them as &quot;juvenile gimmick&quot;, according to authors Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski.

&quot;Kaiju&quot; are often somewhat metaphorical in nature; Godzilla, for example, initially served as a metaphor for nuclear weapons, reflecting the fears of post-war Japan following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the &quot;Lucky Dragon 5&quot; incident. Other notable examples of &quot;kaiju&quot; include Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Gamera.

== Origins ==

===Etymology===

The Japanese word &quot;kaijū&quot; originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient Japanese legends; it earlier appeared in the Chinese &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;. There are no traditional depictions of &quot;kaijū&quot; or &quot;kaijū&quot;-like creatures among the &quot;yōkai&quot; of Japanese folklore, although it is possible to find megafauna in their mythology (e.g., Japanese dragons). After &quot;sakoku&quot; ended and Japan was opened to foreign relations in the mid-19th century, the term &quot;kaijū&quot; came to be used to express concepts from paleontology and legendary creatures from around the world. For example, the extinct &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;-like cryptid featured in &quot;The Monster of &quot;Partridge Creek&quot;&quot; (1908) by French writer Georges Dupuy was referred to as &quot;kaijū&quot;. It is worthy to note that in the Meiji era, Jules Verne’s works were introduced to the Japanese public, achieving great success around 1890.

===Film genre===
Genre elements were present at the end of Winsor McCay&#x27;s 1921 animated short &quot;The Pet&quot; in which a mysterious giant animal starts destroying the city, until it is countered by a massive airstrike. It was based on a 1905 episode of McCay&#x27;s comic strip series &quot;Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;.

The 1925 film &quot;The Lost World&quot; (adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1912 novel of the same name), featured many dinosaurs, including a brontosaurus that breaks loose in London and destroys Tower Bridge. The dinosaurs of &quot; The Lost World&quot; were animated by pioneering stop motion techniques by Willis H. O&#x27;Brien, who would some years later animate the giant gorilla-like creature breaking loose in New York City in the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;. The enormous success of &quot;King Kong&quot; can be seen as the definitive breakthrough of monster movies. This influential achievement of King Kong paved the way for the emergence of the giant monster genre, serving as a blueprint for future kaiju productions. Its success reverberated in the film industry, leaving a lasting impact and solidifying the figure of the giant monster as an essential component in genre cinematography. RKO Pictures later licensed the King Kong character to the Japanese studio Toho, resulting in the co-productions &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962) and &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; (1967), both directed by Ishirō Honda.

Yoshirō Edamasa directed &quot;The Great Buddha Arrival&quot; in 1934. Although the original film is now lost, stills of the film have survived, and it is one of the earliest examples of a &quot;kaiju&quot; film in Japanese cinematic history. The 1934 film presumably influenced the production of the &quot;Ultraman&quot; franchise.

Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story published in the Saturday Evening Post, June 23, 1951 &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; served as the basis for the film &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;(1953), featuring a fictional dinosaur (animated by Ray Harryhausen), which is released from its frozen, hibernating state by an atomic bomb test within the Arctic Circle. The American movie was released in Japan in 1954 under the title &quot;The Atomic Kaiju Appears&quot;, marking the first use of the genre&#x27;s name in a film title. However, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, released in 1954, is commonly regarded as the first Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film. Tomoyuki Tanaka, a producer for Toho Studios in Tokyo, needed a film to release after his previous project was halted. Seeing how well the Hollywood giant monster movie genre films &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; had done in Japanese box offices, and himself a fan of these films, he set out to make a new movie based on them and created &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Tanaka aimed to combine Hollywood giant monster movies with the re-emerged Japanese fears of atomic weapons that arose from the Daigo Fukuryū Maru fishing boat incident; and so he put a team together and created the concept of a giant radioactive creature emerging from the depths of the ocean, a creature that would become the monster Godzilla. &quot;Godzilla&quot; initially had commercial success in Japan, inspiring other &quot;kaiju&quot; movies.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;kaijū&quot; translates literally as &quot;strange beast&quot;. &quot;Kaiju&quot; can be antagonistic, protagonistic, or a neutral force of nature, but are more specifically preternatural creatures of divine power. They are not merely &quot;big animals&quot;. Godzilla, for example, from its first appearance in the initial 1954 entry in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, has manifested all of these aspects. Other examples of &quot;kaiju&quot; include Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Anguirus, King Kong, Gamera, , Guilala, and Yonggary. There are also subcategories including &quot;Mecha&quot; &quot;Kaiju&quot; (Meka-Kaijū), featuring mechanical or cybernetic characters, including Moguera, Mechani-Kong, Mechagodzilla, and Gigan, which are an offshoot of &quot;kaiju&quot;. Likewise, the collective subcategory &quot;Ultra-Kaiju&quot; (Urutora-Kaijū) is a separate strata of &quot;kaijū&quot; that specifically originates in the long-running &quot;Ultra Series&quot; franchise but can also be referred to simply by &quot;kaijū&quot;. As a noun, &quot;kaijū&quot; is an &quot;invariant&quot;, as both the singular and the plural expressions are identical.

===&quot;Kaijin&quot;===
( lit. &quot;Strange person&quot;) refers to distorted human beings or humanoid-like creatures. The origin of &quot;kaijin&quot; goes back to the early 20th Century Japanese literature, starting with Edogawa Rampo&#x27;s 1936 novel, &quot;The Fiend with Twenty Faces&quot;. The story introduced Edogawa&#x27;s master detective, Kogoro Akechi&#x27;s arch-nemesis, the eponymous &quot;Fiend&quot;, a mysterious master of disguise, whose real face was unknown; the &quot;Moriarty&quot; to Akechi&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot;. Catching the public&#x27;s imagination, many such literary and movie (and later television) villains took on the mantle of &quot;kaijin&quot;. To be clear, &quot;kaijin&quot; is not an offshoot of &quot;kaiju&quot;. The first-ever kaijin that appeared on film was &quot;The Great Buddha Arrival&quot; a lost film, made in 1934. After the Pacific War, the term was modernized when it was adopted to describe the bizarre, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced evil humanoid spawn conceived for the &quot;Kamen Rider Series&quot; in 1971. This created a new splinter of the term, which quickly propagated through the popularity of superhero programs produced from the 1970s, forward. These &quot;kaijin&quot; possess rational thought and the power of speech, as do human beings. A successive &quot;kaijin&quot; menagerie, in diverse iterations, appeared over numerous series, most notably the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; programs premiering in 1975 (later carried over into &quot;Super Sentai&quot;″s English iteration as &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in the 1990s).

This created yet another splinter, as the &quot;kaijin&quot; of &quot;Super Sentai&quot; have since evolved to feature unique forms and attributes (e.g., gigantism), existing somewhere between &quot;kaijin&quot; and &quot;kaiju&quot;.

===&quot;Daikaiju&quot;===

&quot;Daikaijū&quot; () literally translates as &quot;giant &quot;kaiju&quot;&quot; or &quot;great &quot;kaiju&quot;&quot;. This hyperbolic term was used to denote greatness of the subject &quot;kaiju&quot;, the prefix &quot;dai-&quot; emphasizing great size, power, and/or status. The first known appearance of the term &quot;daikaiju&quot; in the 20th Century was in the publicity materials for the original 1954 release of &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Specifically, in the subtitle on the original movie poster, &quot;Suibaku Daikaiju Eiga&quot; (), lit. &quot;H-Bomb Giant Monster Movie&quot;. &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, the first film of the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise in 1965, also utilized the term where the Japanese title of the film is &quot;Daikaijū Gamera&quot; ().

===&quot;Seijin&quot;===
&quot;Seijin&quot; ( lit. &quot;star people&quot;), appears within Japanese words for extraterrestrial aliens, such as &quot;Kaseijin&quot; (), which means &quot;Martian&quot;. Aliens can also be called &quot;uchūjin&quot; () which means &quot;spacemen&quot;. Among the best known &quot;Seijin&quot; in the genre can be found in the &quot;Ultra Series&quot;, such as Alien Baltan from &quot;Ultraman&quot;, a race of cicada-like aliens who have gone on to become one of the franchise&#x27;s most enduring and recurring characters other than the Ultras themselves.

Toho has produced a variety of &quot;kaiju&quot; films over the years (many of which feature Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra), but other Japanese studios contributed to the genre by producing films and shows of their own: Daiei Film (Kadokawa Pictures), Tsuburaya Productions, and Shochiku and Nikkatsu Studios.

==Monster techniques==
Eiji Tsuburaya, who was in charge of the special effects for &quot;Godzilla&quot;, developed a technique to animate the &quot;kaiju&quot; that became known colloquially as &quot;suitmation&quot;. Where Western monster movies often used stop motion to animate the monsters, Tsubaraya decided to attempt to create suits, called &quot;creature suits&quot;, for a human (suit actor) to wear and act in. This was combined with the use of miniature models and scaled-down city sets to create the illusion of a giant creature in a city. Due to the extreme stiffness of the latex or rubber suits, filming would often be done at double speed, so that when the film was shown, the monster was smoother and slower than in the original shot. &quot;Kaiju&quot; films also used a form of puppetry interwoven between suitmation scenes for shots that were physically impossible for the suit actor to perform. From the 1998 release of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, American-produced &quot;kaiju&quot; films strayed from suitmation to computer-generated imagery (CGI). In Japan, CGI and stop-motion have been increasingly used for certain special sequences and monsters, but suitmation has been used for an overwhelming majority of &quot;kaiju&quot; films produced in Japan of all eras.

== Other appearances ==
* Steven Spielberg cited &quot;Godzilla&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), specifically &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956), which he saw in his youth. During its production, Spielberg described &quot;Godzilla&quot; as &quot;the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.&quot; One scene in the second movie (&quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;), the T-Rex is rampaging through San Diego. One scene shows Japanese businessmen fleeing. One of them states that they left Japan to get away from this, hinting that Godzilla shares the same universe as the Jurassic Park movies. &quot;Godzilla&quot; also influenced the Spielberg film &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975).
* The popular &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise has been inspired by &quot;kaiju&quot; culture since its inception, and many of its monster designs are based on &quot;kaiju&quot;. 
* In the Japanese-language original of the &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; anime series, Sakura&#x27;s brother Toya likes to tease her by regularly calling her &quot;kaiju&quot;, relating to her noisily coming down from her room for breakfast every morning.
* The Polish cartoon TV series &quot;Bolek and Lolek&quot; makes a reference to the &quot;kaiju&quot; film industry in the miniseries &quot;Bolek and Lolek&#x27;s Great Journey&quot; by featuring a robot bird (similar to Rodan) and a saurian monster (in reference to Godzilla) as part of a Japanese director&#x27;s monster star repertoire.
* The &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; film had Robo-Gadget attacking San Francisco à la &quot;kaiju&quot; monsters. In addition, similar to &quot;The Lost World&quot;, it shows a Japanese man while fleeing from Robo-Gadget declaring in his native tongue that he left Tokyo specifically to get away from this.
* Alternate versions of several &quot;kaiju&quot; – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera, King Ghidorah, and Daimajin – appear in the &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; &quot;Sumi-e&quot; story arc.
*In the second season of &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, there is a story arc composed of two episodes entitled &quot;The Zillo Beast&quot; and &quot;The Zillo Beast Strikes Back&quot;, mostly influenced by &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, in which a huge reptilian beast is transported from its homeworld Malastare to the city-covered planet Coruscant, where it breaks loose and goes on a rampage.
* In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the rancor was originally to be played by an actor in a suit similar to how &quot;kaiju&quot; films like &quot;Godzilla&quot; were made. However, the rancor was eventually portrayed by a puppet filmed in high speed.
* The &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Mecha-Streisand&quot; features parodies of Mechagodzilla, Gamera, Ultraman, and Mothra.
* &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; features the &quot;Insanoflex&quot;, a giant robot exercise machine rampaging downtown. 
* In the 2009 film &quot;&quot;, there is a sequence parodying &quot;kaiju&quot; films using the same practical effects techniques used for tokusatsu films such as miniatures and suitmation.
* The Japanese light novel series &quot;Gate&quot; makes use of the term &quot;kaiju&quot; as a term for giant monsters – specifically an ancient Fire Dragon – in the Special Region. Also, one of the Japanese protagonists refers to the JSDF&#x27;s tradition to fight such monsters in the films, as well as comparing said dragon with King Ghidorah at one point.
* Godzilla and Gamera had been referenced and appear many times throughout the Dr. Slump series.
* In &quot;Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero&quot;, there is a dimension that is filled with giant monsters that live on one island where they co-exist with humans that live on a city island.
* In the &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot; series &quot;kaiju&quot; are sent as a form of punishment for the breakage of everlasting laws of the world by the Goddesses of Fate.
* Batholith the Summit Kaiju (Japanese: バソリス) is a mountain (kaiju) originating from &quot;Summit Kaiju International&quot;, an American media company based in Denver, Colorado. Batholith was first introduced to Godzilla fan during G-Fest 2017, which is an annual convention devoted to the Godzilla film franchise. Batholith the Summit Kaiju has appeared in various print media, including Famous Monsters of Filmland &quot;Ack-Ives: Godzilla Magazine, MyKaiju Godzilla Magazine MyKaiju Godzilla Magazine, Summit Kaiju online video series, and other online media related to the Godzilla and &quot;kaiju&quot; genre.
* In the &quot;Nemesis Saga&quot; series of novels, Kaiju, also known as &quot;Gestorumque&quot;, are genetic weapons sent by an alien race.

<doc id="65001" wikidata="Q687240" url="?curid=65001" title="Gamera">
<text>is a fictional monster, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, originating from a series of Japanese films. Debuting in the 1965 film &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, the character and the first film were intended to compete with the success of Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series. Since then, Gamera has become a Japanese icon in his own right, appearing in a total of 12 films produced by Daiei Film and later by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Daiei Studio (Kadokawa Corporation) respectively, and various other media such as novelizations, manga, video games, and more.

Gamera is depicted as a giant, flying, fire-breathing, prehistoric turtle. In the series&#x27; first film, Gamera is portrayed as aggressive and destructive, though he also saves a child&#x27;s life. As the films progressed, Gamera took on a more benevolent role, becoming a protector of humanity, especially children, nature, and the Earth from extraterrestrial races and other giant monsters.

Despite its popularity and extensive social influences such as productions of &quot;Daimajin&quot; and &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;, contributions in the launches of two &quot;Kaiju Booms&quot; (jp)(jp) and the &quot;Yōkai Boom&quot;, references in numerous media globally, and naming of two species of prehistoric turtles (&quot;Sinemys gamera&quot; and &quot;Gamerabaena&quot;), expansion of the franchise and public recognition of the character were severely hindered by financial obstacles.

==Overview==
===Conception===

The name derives from the Japanese &quot;kame&quot; (&quot;turtle&quot;), and the suffix &quot;-ra&quot;, a suffix shared by such other &quot;kaiju&quot; characters as Godzilla (&quot;Gojira&quot;) and Mothra. Gamera&#x27;s name was spelled &quot;Gamela&quot; on a French newspaper in the 1965 film, and &quot;Gammera&quot; in the title of &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot;, the re-titled American release of the first film in the franchise, &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;. The naming of the character was by Masaichi Nagata, who pushed ahead the name to contend Godzilla, while other executives were against it for its resemblance to Godzilla, however others eventually didn&#x27;t come up with any sufficient names for the turtle kaiju along with their reluctances to resist the president.

The original idea for Gamera was developed by Yonejiro Saito (jp), Masaichi Nagata, Hidemasa Nagata, Niisan Takahashi, and Noriaki Yuasa. The character was created as a property of the production company Daiei Film, and was intended to compete with the &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series, owned by rival studio Toho. Prior to the idea of the flying turtle monster, there existed preceding concepts of an octopus kaiju called and the rat monsters.

There had been contradicting testimonies regarding the original conceptor and models of Gamera. Noriaki Yuasa believed it was Niisan Takahashi&#x27;s idea, while Takahashi noted that he heard Masaichi Nagata come up with the idea of a &quot;giant, flying turtle&quot;. There had also been rumors of &quot;lewd turtles&quot; as the model(s) of Gamera, either true stories or jokes, among Daiei staffs including Yonejiro Saito (jp) . Alternatively, Tomio Sagisu (jp) who was a student of Eiji Tsuburaya and had repeatedly associated with Daiei Film and crews of the &quot;Gamera&quot; and other Daiei tokusatsu productions, claimed that the concept of Gamera originates in his demo reel, while Yonesaburo Tsukiji, another student of Tsuburaya, declared it was Hidemasa Nagata&#x27;s idea.
Gamera&#x27;s turtle-like design may have been inspired by the Black Tortoise, one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations in East Asian mythology. The Black Tortoise is known as &quot;Genbu&quot; in Japanese, and is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. Each of the Four Symbols are said to act as guardians over each of the four cardinal directions: with the dragon &quot;Seiryu&quot; in the east, the tiger &quot;Byakko&quot; in the west, the bird &quot;Suzaku&quot; in the south, and the tortoise &quot;Genbu&quot; in the north. In &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, the first film in the franchise, Gamera is depicted as awakening in the Arctic, the northernmost region on Earth. &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;, the 11th film in the franchise, contains a scene featuring a book describing the Four Symbols, including &quot;Genbu&quot;. Before the character was officially referenced to the Black Tortoise in the 1999 film, designs and background stories of Gamera and Gyaos (jp) were also inspired by ancient Chinese aspects during the production of &quot;&quot; while the original script of the film focused more on ancient India.

Masaichi Nagata set the policy to make Gamera as the hero of children. Gamera&#x27;s characteristics as a hero who protects humanity and animals, his non-fauna diet, his emerging from the north, and his liking of light and nuclear explosions were also designed to differ from Godzilla having a hatred for humanity, man-made lights, and nuclear explosions. While Godzilla may represent a terror of nuclear war, Gamera was aimed to be a contrasting character, whom children can always believe in, as an antithesis to adults trying to manipulate children with nationalism and propaganda, based on Noriaki Yuasa&#x27;s own traumatic experiences of pre and post-war situations as a child. Hidemasa Nagata&#x27;s intention to make the franchise child-friendly was also due to his desire to create positive influences for children.

As the first post-war release of monster films in Japan, Daiei Film distributed the re-released edition of &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1952 and &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; in 1954. These distributions might have influenced productions of &quot;Godzilla&quot; and Daiei Film productions including &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; (1965).

===Characteristics===

Gamera resembles an enormous prehistoric turtle, and is capable of both bipedal movement and flight. He occasionally walks on all four legs in Showa films and &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; in 2006. He has a pronounced crest on his head, his mouth contains rows of teeth, and two tusks protrude upward from each side of his lower jaw.

He can fly by means of &quot;jets&quot; which can be ignited out of his limb holes when he retracts into his shell. The jets allow Gamera to rise into the air and spin, propelling him forward. In later films, he is shown to be able to fly with only his rear legs drawn inside his shell, allowing his front limbs more freedom.

Gamera&#x27;s shell is presented as being incredibly resilient and strong (only ever being damaged by Guiron, Legion (jp), Iris, and Zedus), and can deflect projectiles such as missiles. His plastron (lower shell) is more vulnerable than his carapace (upper shell), however he has been wounded in his plastron to the point of bleeding.

Gamera never feeds on any fauna or plant organisms, and exclusively relies on thermal energy, electricity, radiation, and other energy sources. Using conventional weapons, even including nuclear weapons, against Gamera may also power him instead.

All incarnations of the character have an affinity for humans (especially children) and nature, and protect them at all costs even by sacrificing themselves. They may also save animals, wildlife, and innocent kaiju even if they are offspring of antagonists.

All incarnations of the character possess several supernatural abilities, most notably telepathy, and others such as healing humans, understanding human speech, and potential reincarnation. Other powers exclusively in literature have depicted incarnations to be deities with more abilities.

====Showa====

During the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era, Gamera was depicted as feeding on flammable substances, such as oil and fire. According to notes by frequent series director Noriaki Yuasa, Gamera&#x27;s internal anatomy includes which allow him to store oil, lava, coal, and uranium. In &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; and &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot;, cold temperatures are shown to weaken Gamera, although he is capable of being in outer space and the deep ocean. Gamera is also capable of performing additional feats including supernatural ones such as emitting electricity and electromagnetic waves, telepathy, and remote sensing. Additionally, he has a high intelligence to outsmart antagonists, to tactically utilize artificial objects, behave cautiously to mind humans, and to repair an alien spaceship. Gamera&#x27;s intention behind bizarre displays including acrobatic and musical acts in later films was presumably to calm and entertain onlooking children.

The original 1965 film, &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, depicts Gamera&#x27;s origins as being a result of United States military fighters launching an attack on enemy bombers (presumably belonging to the Soviet Union), which causes the detonation of an atomic bomb on board one of the aircraft. The nuclear blast releases Gamera from a state of suspended animation in the ice. Meanwhile, a Japanese research team stumbles upon an Inuit tribe in possession of an ancient stone etching that depicts a giant turtle, which the tribe refers to as &quot;Gamera&quot;.

His exact origin was not verified aside from his association with the ancient civilization of the Atlantis. Inuit&#x27;s fear of Gamera and his confinement in the Arctic, contrary to his heroic personality and favor of thermal energy, was presumably due to his entrapment by the Atlanteans and inherited memories of their ancestors to mistake him as a threat, along with the loss of records by Atlanteans after the demise of the ancient civilization.

His incongruous ferocity in &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; was presumably due to an uncontrollable starvation and confusion after 8,000 years of hibernation caused by the entrapment by the Atlanteans, and Gamera&#x27;s rampage against humanity was only to feed on thermal energy and electricity; he learned modern technologies of humanity through the atomic bomb explosion, and his attacks on cities was also to lure military operations so that he could feed more on thermal energy of weapons. The protagonist boy (Toshio) in the 1965 film kept claiming that Gamera is not villainous but has been misunderstood by humanity, and Gamera&#x27;s uncontrollable appetite was gradually satisfied, and he regained his natural calmness as the films progressed, and began to save humanity voluntarily.

The incarnation of the character appeared in the 1980 film &quot;&quot; was depicted to be potentially a different individual from the previous films where a normal Pond slider was magically turned into a kaiju by the Spacewomen, a group of supernatural female aliens. In the end of the film, Gamera sacrificed himself to destroy the Zanon, a gigantic spaceship of antagonists, while the 1994 manga &quot;Giant Monster Gamera&quot; depicted this Gamera&#x27;s fate; Gamera was artificially resurrected by the descendants of Atlanteans with ancient technologies of the Atlantis, gaining characteristics of the Heisei trilogy Gamera, and was sent back to the ancient period to change the history to avoid a demise, to save and monitor humanity.

====Heisei Trilogy====
In the franchise&#x27;s Heisei period, which began with the 1995 reboot film &quot;&quot;, Gamera&#x27;s in-universe origins were changed. In the Heisei films, Gamera is portrayed as an ancient, bio-engineered creature from Atlantis, created for the purpose of defending the people of Atlantis from Gyaos (ギャオス), a bat-like creature which breathes a destructive supersonic beam when on the attack. Human researchers find Gamera floating in the Pacific Ocean, encased in rock, and mistake him for an atoll. Within the rock, they discover a large monolith explaining Gamera&#x27;s origins, along with dozens of magatama made from orichalcum, which allow for a psychic link between Gamera and humans. In &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;, an undersea graveyard containing numerous Gamera-like fossils is shown, suggesting that Gamera was not the only one of his kind. One character in the film refers to these fossils as &quot;beta versions&quot; of Gamera, possibly failures in Atlantis&#x27; attempts to create the final version.

This Gamera has retractable claws protruding from his elbows, and is shown to be able to shoot plasma fireballs from his mouth. Gamera has also been portrayed as being able to absorb mana from the Earth, to fire a plasma beam from his chest, and to manipulate the energy to create a pseudo arm composed of fire to destroy a foe. Within the first and the third films of the trilogy, Gamera magically healed harmed humans including reviving temporary deceased or half-dead individuals although he was unable to revive nearby humans whose corpses were physically destroyed. In the 2003 comic, he was depicted to be (supernaturally) capable of triggering eruptions among nearby lands and volcanoes. Within the comicalized adaptaion of the 1999 film by Kazunori Ito and Moo. Nenpei, who had also published another Gamera manga &quot;Gamera vs. Morphos&quot; in 1999, Gamera performed extreme regeneration to restore his head from mimicked Plasma Fireballs by Iris, and defeated the antagnoist with either an empowered fire blast or fireball instead of the &quot;Vanishing Fist&quot;. In &quot;Gamera vs. Morphos&quot;, Gamera performed additional abilities including telepathy without a magatama, an earthquake, and a powerful fireball with himself glowing red, akin to the &quot;Toto Impact&quot; in &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;.

====Gamera the Brave====
The continuity of the franchise was rebooted a second time with the 2006 film &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;, the 12th entry in the series. This incarnation was designed after African spurred tortoise, and also possesses supernatural traits such as instant growth, telepathy, comprehending human speeches, sensing and foreseeing emergences of evil monsters from afar, and reincarnation. Gamera&#x27;s origin is unclear, and governmental officials and scientists try to use him as a weapon against villainous kaiju while protagonists try to save him. Gamera and Gyaos were designed to be much smaller yet heavier than previous incarnations, corresponding with the original scripts of &quot;&quot; which became the basis for the 2006 film.

The opening scene of the film, set in 1973, depicts the original Gamera, so called &quot;Avant Gamera&quot;, sacrificing himself by means of self-destruction to save a coastal village from four Gyaos. 33 years later, a young boy named Toru Aizawa finds a glowing, heart-shaped rock near his home, with a small egg lying on top of it. A baby turtle hatches from the egg, and begins to grow in size at an alarming rate. The turtle, dubbed &quot;Toto&quot; by Toru after his own nickname by his deceased mother, quickly forms a bond with the boy and develops the ability to breathe fire and fly. After consuming the glowing rock found with his egg, Toto fully transforms into the next incarnation of Gamera, gaining the power to defeat a lizard-like monster known as Zedus, which was once a normal reptile turned into a kaiju by feeding on Gyaos&#x27; corpse, and was presumably controlled by the vengeful spirits of the villainous flying creatures.

====Gamera Rebirth====
&quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot;, the first installation in the Reiwa era introduced monsters&#x27; characteristics to represent not only homages to previous films but also some of unused ideas of previous films and scrapped projects. All kaiju in this series are artificial life forms created by ancient civilizations for warfare and to control the overpopulation of humanity. This incarnation of Gamera was also originally created for mass-massacres, however he was re-programmed by a rebellious figure to become the protector of civilians from other kaiju. During the downfalls of ancient civilizations, Gamera presumably stood against 24 different kaiju to protect the humanity.

While previous incarnations of the character possessed affinities to elements most notably fire, electricity, plasma energy, electromagnetic pulse, and jamming, Gamera in &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; further expanded combat attributes to include gravitation, energy shield, and baryon. This incarnation also possesses several supernatural traits such as telepathy, psychic link with humans, interfering mental contacts by other kaiju on humans, bestowing a power to sense presences of other kaiju on certain children, and his name itself contains a power to somehow encourages a specific children and makes humans to feel that the name &quot;Gamera&quot; is the correct one.

Gamera appeared to protect protagonist children from other monsters trying to feed on the children and other civilians. Through battles, Gamera was severely damaged and almost died, and during the battle against S-Gyaos, an enormous Gyaos mutant who fed on Viras&#x27; corpse, Gamera was injected with specific RNA viruses to reprogram him for the original usage. However, Gamera managed to regain his consciousness by willpower and a telepathic link with a boy. To prevent himself from being enslaved for carnage, Gamera sacrificed himself to destroy the Moonbase of final antagonists, the descendants of nobles of an ancient civilization who were using kaijus. Using all of his remaining power for the planet-penetrating Charged Baryon Cannon, the &quot;Moon Buster&quot;, Gamera was literally dissolved into ashes, leaving behind an egg for the new incarnation of Gamera who strongly resembles Toto from the 2006 film.

====Others====
There have been multiple other incarnations of the character appeared in various other media from novelizations to manga and video games.

The origin of the Gamera appeared in the 1995 novelization &quot;Gamera vs. Phoenix&quot; by Niisan Takahashi, which was originally a script for a cancelled film in 1994, is unclear; Showa Gamera defeated villainous monsters like in the previous films while the &quot;new&quot; Gamera who emerged from underneath the Nazca Lines possessed characteristics of the 1995 film &quot;&quot;. This &quot;new&quot; Gamera initially attacked chemical plants all over the world, resulting in hostility from the humanity, however his intention was to prevent an oncoming catastrophe caused by environmental degradations and to warn the humanity. After sealing the Phoenix, an immortal but suicidal, fiery entity constantly suffering due to its immortality, the new Gamera sacrificed himself to save the Earth from further destruction caused by harmful sunlight triggered by air pollutions, following a similar fate with the Phoenix where both monsters cannot die for the sake of the planet which was damaged by the humanity.

The incarnation of the character, the &quot;Black Tortoise&quot;, appeared in , which is the spin-off novelization of the 2021 film &quot;The Great Yokai War: Guardians&quot;, was uniquely portrayed to be an actual goddess, being capable of various supernatural abilities such as materialization, speaking human speeches, and making yokai and humans to feel that they somehow know her since their childhoods even if it is their first encounter with her. She in spirit-like form appeared from the Mount Ooe and surrounding mountains in north of the Heian-kyō, and manifested a physical form and battled Nue, a gigantic yokai being empowered by vengeful Abe no Seimei, to save the world from antagonistic humans and yokais. Gamera overwhelmed and severely weakened Nue with her fireballs and spinning jet, and left the rest to yokai and humans so that they can fulfill their destiny, and secretly disappeared (dematerialized).

The presence of the &quot;Black Tortoise&quot; was also confirmed in the 2015 novel , which was written by Shinichiro Inoue (jp) who was trying to reboot the franchise in early 2010s and has also participated in &quot;Daimajin Kanon&quot; and &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot;, and the novel was a tribute to Masaichi Nagata and his films. In this novel, Barugon and Jiger directly appeared as the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger respectively. Each monsters are spiritual and sacred entities, being regarded as actual deities with supernatural powers such as telepathy, weaponizing weathers, destructive energy beam, levitation, and time manipulation. These monsters choose specific humans as summoners and forms supernatural links with them through magatamas, and bestow them superhuman prowess. The chosen ones can summon materialized monsters to perform tremendous feats, however, if summoners use monsters for destructive deeds, the world would be spiritually poisoned, only being cured by other chosen ones by the Four Symbols; Nichiren, the current summoner of the Black Tortoise who was also bestowed abilities including time manipulation, tries to restore the world after the battle of Barugon and Jiger during the Mongol invasions of Japan.

Gamera made several appearances in the tokusatsu program series &quot;Sailor Fight&quot; (jp) in 1995 and 1996 as a &quot;Capsule Monster&quot;, presumably based on characters of the same title from &quot;Ultra Seven&quot; which later inspired &quot;Pokémon&quot;. Noriaki Yuasa directed a related 1996 video &quot;Cosplay Warrior Cutie Knight&quot; and appeared in it as a character &quot;Dr. Yuasa&quot;, and Hurricane Ryu, who was also working for the 1994 manga &quot;Giant Monster Gamera&quot;, played Gamera for it.

In the 2015 short film for the 50th anniversary of the franchise, Gamera saved a boy from a swarm of Gyaos attacking Tokyo and incinerated them with a powerful fire blast. A decade later, another monster appeared to cause a havoc, and the boy again witnessed Gamera to return to fight against it.

Within the &quot;USO Makoto Yōkai Hyaku Monogatari&quot; series by Natsuhiko Kyogoku, in which multiple Kadokawa stakeholders appeared as actual characters, and Daiei (Kadokawa)-related characters and characters from &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; made cameo appearances as unsubstantial entities along with various other characters from multiple different franchises.

==Relationship with Godzilla==
===Overview===
Both &quot;Gamera&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchises have played significant roles in expanding modern cultures in Japan, and influenced various other productions, and the two franchises have also influenced each other on various occasions. Both along with other tokusatsu productions most notably &quot;Daimajin&quot; and &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; franchises, formed the &quot;First Kaiju Boom&quot; (jp), which became the basis for the &quot;Second Kaiju Boom&quot; (jp) and the &quot;Yōkai Boom&quot;.

Daiei Film&#x27;s objective was not to surpass the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, but to coexist with it, and the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise achieved to differentiate from the Toho productions to appeal to its audiences, and gained popularity notably among children and rivaled the Toho productions.

While Gamera has been described as being a rip-off of Godzilla by some authors, Godzilla films including later Showa films, &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; (1994), &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot; (1995), &quot;Godzilla 2000&quot; (1999), &quot;Godzilla vs. Megaguirus&quot; (2000), &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot; (GMK) (2001), &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; (2016), &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; (2023), and MonsterVerse series by Legendary Pictures have been pointed out to be influenced by Showa Gamera films and Shusuke Kaneko&#x27;s Heisei Gamera Trilogy and &quot;GMK&quot;. Gamera was represented within a concept art of &quot;&quot;, and Kaneko himself acknowledges similarities between his films and MonsterVerse films where the scrapped 2011 project &quot;Gamera 3D&quot; by Yoshimitsu Banno served as one of predecessors of the 2014 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;. According to Jared Krichevsky, &quot;Shimo&quot; appeared in &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot; was partially inspired by Barugon. Shusuke Kaneko utilized some aspects of Showa Gamera and his Heisei Gamera trilogy for &quot;GMK&quot; such as &quot;submarine within kaiju&#x27;s body&quot; from &quot;Gamera vs. Jiger&quot;, and Kaneko reused ideas which he originally wanted for the Heisei trilogy and its cancelled sequel(s).

Eiji Tsuburaya depicted Godzilla to be more heroic and to bleed in later Showa films despite disliking bleeding kaiju, and having avoided this in previous Showa films due to his belief in Christianity. Later Showa Godzilla films featured more child-friendly aspects, introducing theme songs, depicting kaiju as characters than monsters with increased scenes to zoom in on kaiju, increasing the number of scenes involving kaiju, and adding more fancifully designed kaiju. Yoshimitsu Banno, who later planned to direct &quot;Gamera 3D&quot;, made Godzilla to fly in his &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;. These later Showa Godzilla films were presumably influenced by Gamera. The creations of Minilla (a child-friendly son of Godzilla) and Kamoebas (jp), Toho&#x27;s own turtle kaiju, were also possibly influenced by the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise while Toto in the 2006 film &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; in return bears physical and conceptual similarities to Minilla, Godzilla Junior in the 1994 film &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;, and &quot;Daigoro vs. Goliath&quot; by Toho and Tsuburaya Productions. While &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; re-used the original script of &quot;&quot;, which also affected productions of &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; (Toei Animation) and &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot; (Tsuburaya Productions), the plot of the 2006 film was also influenced by the Heisei Mothra trilogy where crews such as Nippon Eizo Creative (jp) had participated in both productions.

Ishiro Honda highly praised the 1967 film &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot;, pleasing Niisan Takahashi greatly and freeing him from his feeling of inferiority towards the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and Honda suggested Takahashi to work together in the future. There was a failed attempt to produce a &quot;Daimajin&quot; film involving Honda in 1980s, and Takahashi later sent his script for the cancelled 1994 film, which later became the basis of the novelization &quot;Gamera vs. Phoenix&quot;, to several tokusatsu film makers including Honda; however, despite Honda&#x27;s encouragement, Takahashi&#x27;s attempt failed to materialize.

During the production of &quot;&quot; in 1995, Yasuyoshi Tokuma (jp), the founder of Tokuma Shoten, expressed his interest in producing &quot;Godzilla vs. Gamera&quot; and proposed a crossover to Toho, however this attempt failed to materialize, and Yasuyoshi&#x27;s death in 2000 and financial situation of Tokuma Shoten eventually resulted in the disposal of Daiei Film properties, along with the cancellation of &quot;Gamera 4&quot; due to the plot of &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; and the planned plot of the scrapped sequel.

In 2002, Kadokawa acquired the copyrights of Daiei Film properties from Tokuma Shoten, and Kazuo Kuroi (jp) announced a crossover plan between Gamera and Godzilla, along with a plan to reboot &quot;Daimajin&quot;. The company approached Toho to achieve it, however the latter turned down the offer and Kadokawa therefore produced &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; instead as Toho temporary ceased Godzilla productions after &quot;&quot;. Zedus, the main antagonist of the 2006 film was intentionally designed to resemble Toho monsters such as Varan and Gorosaurus, and it notably resembles both Godzilla and Jirahs, the Godzilla-based kaiju from &quot;Ultraman&quot;. Shogo Tomiyama was aware of the demand for the crossover, however clarified it lacking merits for filmmakers. Additionally, Shusuke Kaneko has also expressed his interest in producing a crossover.

In 2023, the Netflix series &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; was directed by Hiroyuki Seshita (jp) who previously directed the anime Godzilla trilogy. This time, Toho instead proposed an offer for a crossover due to a large number of requests from players of the mobile game &quot;Godzilla Battle Line&quot;, and an official collaboration between the Netflix series and the mobile game was made where Seshita&#x27;s incarnation of Godzilla was chosen for the key art, and Gamera and Gyaos (jp) and Guiron appeared in the game as playable characters, followed by Showa incarnations of Gamera and Gyaos.

Additionally, Masaaki Tezuka (jp) once suggested using Gamera instead of the aforementioned Kamoebas (jp) for the 2003 film &quot;&quot;, and Gamera was at one point considered to appear in the 2007 video game &quot;&quot;. The 1999 video game &quot;Gamera Dream Battle&quot; was able to connect to &quot;Mothra Dream Battle&quot; in which Mothra and King Ghidorah appeared as playable characters.

Gamera&#x27;s voice effect was used in &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot;, and Gamera was represented within a concept art of &quot;&quot;, and several Godzilla productions have presumed references to Gamera.

Gamera and Godzilla and other monsters from respective franchises co-appeared in several exoteric productions and events such as stage shows, a television show (jp), &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Daicon III and IV Opening Animations&quot;, &quot;MegaTokyo&quot;, &quot;City Shrouded in Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Slammie Brothers vs. Godzilla and Gamera&quot;, and &quot;USO Makoto Yōkai Hyaku Monogatari&quot;. Several franchises such as &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon SuperS&quot;, and &quot;Jumbo Monster GOMERA&quot; (jp) have characters with the names &quot;Gamera&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;. In 2005, Shusuke Kaneko directed the 11th episode on &quot;Ultraman Max&quot;, choosing to include a scene of children playing with toys of Gamera and Godzilla as a reference to the films he had directed in both franchises. Ayako Fujitani also made an appearance as a guest in the episode. The 1998 Shochiku film &quot;Giant Monsters Appear in Tokyo&quot; represented off-screen appearances of two battling kaiju, the &quot;jet-flying turtle appeared on Fukuoka&quot; and the &quot;80 meters tall, fire-breathing, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaur-like lizard appeared on the port of Tokyo Bay&quot;, clearly referencing Gamera in &quot;&quot; and Godzilla in &quot;The Return of Godzilla&quot; where several casts from the Heisei Gamera Trilogy such as Hirotarō Honda and Tomorowo Taguchi appeared in the film.

===Productions===

Daiei Film produced and distributed films that played major roles in forming tokusatsu and kaiju genre under Masaichi Nagata, one of creators of Gamera. 

Nagata&#x27;s intentions made the company to distribute foreign films, such as Disney productions due to Masaichi&#x27;s connections with Walt Disney, and to produce innovative productions, resulting in the productions of the first post-war science fiction tokusatsu films in Japan; &quot;Rainbow Man&quot; (jp) and &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot; in 1949. Eiji Tsuburaya, who had repeatedly associated with Masaichi Nagata since early 1930s, and Sadamasa Arikawa (jp) and Shuzaburo Araki (jp) participated in these and other Daiei productions before the signing of the Six-Company Agreement in 1953 (which was also led by Masaichi), and they intended to join Daiei Film with the 1949 films after Tsuburaya&#x27;s exile from Toho because of the 1948 purge due to his involvements in war propagandas, and Arikawa and Araki&#x27;s voluntary resignations after Toho strikes. However, Tsuburaya was rather dissatisfied with the tokusatsu production (or effects) in &quot;The Invisible Man Appears&quot; (or their attempts to join the company didn&#x27;t materialize), and eventually didn&#x27;t join Daiei Film. Tsuburaya and Arikawa and Araki later participated in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and various other Toho tokusatsu productions. The 2020 biopic &quot;Nezura 1964&quot; ambiguously portrayed Tsuburaya&#x27;s association with Daiei Film before &quot;Gamera&quot;.

Daiei Film, along with its own productions of various tokusatsu films, also distributed the re-released edition of &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1952, making it the first post-war release of monster movies in Japan, and also distributed &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; in Japan in 1954, and these presumably influenced the productions of the 1954 film &quot;Godzilla&quot; by Toho and Daiei Film&#x27;s own tokusatsu productions including the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise.

The Six-Company Agreement led by Masaichi Nagata prevented other companies from easily chasing after the success of Toho, and the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise didn&#x27;t have notable competitors until the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise; the agreement ironically made Daiei Film&#x27;s own &quot;Dagora&quot; and &quot;Nezura&quot; to fail by using live animals (octopuses and rats) to avoid the Toho-style, and Daiei Film changed the direction for &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;.

Due to the Six-Company Agreement, other companies, including Daiei Film itself, could not &quot;openly&quot; use tokusatsu techniques and staffs and actors of Toho. However, according to Keizō Murase, Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s teams were secretly appointed for &quot;&quot; by Nikkatsu and &quot;The X from Outer Space&quot; by Shochiku, and other subsequent productions, and Toho&#x27;s techniques were secretly used in these films. For &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, some crews who had previously participated in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and other Toho kaiju films joined its production despite the agreement, and Eiji Tsuburaya gave a tacit approval to their actions. However, while there had been suggestions to seek Tsuburaya&#x27;s help, even by an executive who is a friend of the father of Yonejiro Saito (jp) and Tsuburaya, filmmakers intentionally avoided receiving any technological assistances from Tsuburaya for the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise to differentiate their productions from Toho, and produced &quot;Gamera&quot; and other tokusatsu films without Toho-based techniques, choices of materials, direction, and so on.

Successes of &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; and &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; resulted in sudden increases of non-Toho kaiju productions, such as afroementioned &quot;&quot; and &quot;The X from Outer Space&quot;. Film makers were suspicious of Tsuburaya&#x27;s involvements to these non-Daiei productions despite the Six-Company Agreement because of sudden increases in non-Toho kaiju productions after Gamera films, despite the only non-Toho tokusatsu film of that time before the 1965 Gamera film to feature gigantic creature was Daiei Film&#x27;s &quot;The Whale God&quot; (&quot;Killer Whale&quot;) in 1962.

Involvements of foreign cast members and enhanced childish direction began in &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; due to requests from global buyers, because of governmental attempt to support struggling Japanese film industries of that time, partially due to the recession of Japanese economy and the prosperity of television including Tsuburaya&#x27;s &quot;Ultraman&quot; by increasing film exports to global market; ironically the success of the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise indirectly contributed in this situation and the arise of the &quot;Yokai Boom&quot; for cost-effectiveness. was established, and &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; obtained a loan from the association. The establishment of the association was largely influenced by Daiei Film&#x27;s Masaichi Nagata who had connections with political circles, and the subsequent kaiju and tokusatsu films, not only &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; and &quot;Wrath of Daimajin&quot; and other Daiei Film productions, but also others such as aforementioned &quot;&quot; and &quot;The X from Outer Space&quot; by Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s team, obtained tax-based loans from the association.

Showa Gamera films, especially since &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot;, were intended to appeal to children. This was to deal with budgetary problems and the Six-Company Agreement to differentiate from the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Due to the agreement and the direction to differentiate from Toho, Gamera&#x27;s characteristics such as to breathe traditional non-atomic fire, occasional quadrupedalism along with his foes, his personality as both a friendly creature and a hero rather than Godzilla&#x27;s theme to represent a &quot;god of destruction&quot;, Material choices for suits and miniature models were devised to avoid duplicates with the Toho productions. Plots of Showa Gamera films intentionally avoided to focus on &quot;standards&quot; of kaiju films by Toho, such as the JSDF and other military forces, weapons, scientific explanations, destructions of urban areas, and so on. Instead, subsequent films since &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; featured simple, childish, and eccentric plots for young audiences. In the films, children play significant roles with the eccentric ideas presented, and children, unlike adults, always believe in Gamera, partially due to Noriaki Yuasa&#x27;s antithesis against war and political propagandas and nationalism. This direction was initially decided because a number of children watching &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; got bored with the plot and left their seats, and also to deal with drastically decreased budgets due to the financial situation of Daiei Film; the budget of &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; was ¥24 million compared to budgets of &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; (¥80 million) and &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; (¥60 million), with limitations of further elements such as designs and abilities of monsters, amounts of special effects, destructions of urban areas, limited locations, and so on. Yuasa and others didn&#x27;t intend to make &quot;Gamera&quot; films to be &quot;good in quality&quot;, but being &quot;good in performances&quot;, by appealing to young audiences for additional revenues.

On the other hand, a number of new tokusatsu expertise were obtained through productions of Showa Gamera films to compensate for lack of resources and avoiding Toho-based techniques and materials.

As below mentioned, declined public recognition of the franchise due to repeated hiatuses in productions, along with misconceptions among new audience segments, such as Gamera being an inferior imitation of Godzilla and Gamera belonging to the Toho franchise, might have negatively affected box office results of the post-Daiei productions by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation.

Shusuke Kaneko, and Shinji Higuchi, who have previously participated in &quot;The Return of Godzilla&quot;, respectively directed &quot;GMK&quot; and &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; where Kaneko and Kazunori Ito originally wanted to take the 1992 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; (the relationship between Mothra and Shobijin (jp) might have influenced the depictions of Gamera and Asagi Kusanagi in the Heisei Gamera trilogy), however Kaneko and Ito and Higuchi&#x27;s preferences of &quot;Godzilla&quot; and other Toho productions (and their disfavor of Showa Gamera) resulted in controversial outcomes of the Heisei trilogy.

===Distributions and releases===
One of factors restricting revenues from Daiei Film productions was the company&#x27;s weak distribution system including limited theater chains; releases of Daiei Film productions relied on movie theatres by Toho, Shochiku, and Toei Company. Daiei Film later launched the to gain directly-managing movie theaters, however the attempt failed as feasible properties were already acquired by other companies, further accelerating financial difficulties of Daiei Film. The deterioration of the company including its distribution system was partially caused by rather prodigal operations by Masaichi Nagata; his extensive achievements granted him the title &quot;Father of Japanese film industry&quot;, however his career ironically formed a dictatorial company culture which even restricted executives.

Ever since &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot;, the last film by Daiei Film, was distributed by Dainichi Eihai for financial reasons, Daiei Film productions by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation have always relied on other companies to distribute, restricting revenues. The Heisei trilogy was distributed by Toho as Daiei Film lost its theater chains after its bankruptcy. However, the trilogy was distributed by Toho Western Films unlike &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, and the number of movie theatres for the trilogy was much smaller than &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, further reducing potential box office results. However, Shōgo Tomiyama noted that he did not perceive the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise as a rival, but was instead happy to see its revival along with the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise which was the sole support the kaiju genre received for years. Filming of &quot;Gamera: Guardian of the Universe&quot; was also affected by the 1994 film &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; as both films were filmed in Fukuoka.

Global distributions of videos of the franchise was also affected by the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Daiei Film avoided the market in the United States and instead focused more on European countries to decrease competition with Toho productions. Foreign cast members became increasingly well-represented due to requests from European buyers; however, these buyers also requested to avoid hiring black cast members. Daiei Film obliged, though some criticized Daiei Film for this decision. On the other hand, its increasingly childish direction along with involving foreign cast members were also prompted by the Japanese Film Export Promotion Association under the Japanese government where Daiei Film&#x27;s Masaichi Nagata contributed in its establishment.

After the bankruptcy of Daiei Film, the franchise increased its efforts avoid direct competition against the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, including the Heisei trilogy, and &quot;&quot; by Tokuma Shoten and &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; by Kadokawa were released in 1980 and 2006 respectively because Toho temporary ceased producing Godzilla films due to declined box office results. After the commercial failure of the 2006 film, which was originally launched as a proposal for a crossover with Godzilla in 2002, Kadokawa cancelled various projects, including reboot attempt(s) in 2010s, and instead released a short film for the 50th anniversary of the franchise in 2015; MonsterVerse by Legendary Pictures (which was at one point a Gamera project &quot;Gamera 3D&quot;) began in 2014, and subsequent Godzilla productions were continuously developed among theatrical releases and streaming media. &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; and anime Godzilla trilogy were directed by filmmakers who have either previously or subsequently participated in Gamera productions. &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; was released on Netflix in 2023 after &quot;Godzilla Singular Point&quot; in 2021.

===Participants===
While Eiji Tsuburaya and Sadamasa Arikawa (jp) and Shuzaburo Araki (jp) eventually didn&#x27;t join Daiei Film, a number of Tsuburaya&#x27;s coworkers and students, who had previously participated in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and various other Toho productions, participated in &quot;Gamera&quot; and &quot;Daimajin&quot; and other Daiei productions, and a number of staffs involved in &quot;Gamera&quot; productions later participated in various &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; productions, including &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; and &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot; (and &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot;) reusing the same early script for &quot;&quot;.

A number of crews and filmmakers, actors, voice actors, extras, and suit actors have participated in both and related franchises (including other Tsuburaya works). Keizō Murase and Masao Yagi (jp) and Toru Suzuki (jp) and Michio Mikami (jp), who have previously participated in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and other Toho kaiju films and worked with Eiji Tsuburaya, and Akira Takahashi (jp) and Nori Maezawa (jp) founded the tokusatsu modelling company the Ex Productions (jp) after &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;. Murase also founded another tokusatsu related company called 20Twenty (jp) afterward. These companies contributed in various tokusatsu productions including &quot;Gamera&quot; and &quot;Daimajin&quot;, and non-Daiei franchises by Tsuburaya such as &quot;Godzilla&quot; and its related &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, and so on.

===P Productions===
As aforementioned, there have been contradicting theories regards the original conceptor of Gamera where even Noriaki Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and Yonejiro Saito (jp) weren&#x27;t truly aware of. Tomio Sagisu (jp), a student of Eiji Tsuburaya and the founder of P Productions, had repeatedly participated in Daiei Film productions most notably &quot;The Whale God&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot; (jp). Sagisu claimed that his 1962 demo reel for the project &quot;STOP Series&quot;, could be the original idea of Daiei&#x27;s Gamera. Sagisu initially showed the demo reel to Eiji Tsuburaya, and Toho paid attention to it, and the company later brought the project to Fuji Television, however &quot;STOP Series&quot; was eventually cancelled. Later, Sagisu instead brought the reel to Daiei Film to launch a project, and believed that this eventually became the prototype of Gamera. Sagisu once inquired Yonesaburo Tsukiji, another student of Tsuburaya and participated in both &quot;Nezura&quot; and &quot;Gamera&quot;, however Tsukiji didn&#x27;t agree with Sagisu&#x27;s claim and instead noted Hidemasa Nagata as the inventor.

There is also a testimony about the development of Gamera by the designer Akira Inoue (jp), which might not entirely correspond with Sagisu&#x27;s claim; Inoue designed over 50 different designs of Gamera for the 1965 film, including drastically different ones from the final version, such as a limb-less monster to crawl on the ground like a centipede.

Despite this, P Productions and Daiei Film retained a tie and shared various crews where Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s co-woker and student from Daiei Film, Ryosaku Takayama (jp) and Yoshio Watanabe (jp), were two of founders of P Productions. Additionally, Shinsuke Kojima (jp) and Tamotsu Taga and others abandoned Daiei Film and joined P Production after the failure and aftermaths of &quot;Nezura&quot;. Crews of &quot;Gamera&quot; and other Daiei productions including Noriaki Yuasa later participated in projects by P Productions since before the 1968 incidents on P Productions, and increased their involvements afterward where P Productions was no longer able to produce tokusatsu productions by itself and was forced to make its staffs as contract employees, and crews from P Productions projects later joined &quot;Gamera&quot; films.

Aforementioned crews, who once abandoned Daiei Film for P Productions due to multiple troubles and confusions of &quot;Nezura&quot;, such as a labor dispute and near-fatal dust mite allergy on Michio Mikami (jp) and others which were caused by using live rats, later participated in &quot;Gamera&quot; and other Daiei productions. For instance, Tamotsu Taga, along with Noriaki Yuasa and other &quot;Gamera&quot; crews, co-participated in projects such as ones by Daiei TV-Film (jp), and &quot;&quot; after the bankruptcy of Daiei Film.

Shirō Sagisu, the son of Tomio and the current owner of the company, has also participated in several Daiei TV-Film dramas after the bankruptcy of Daiel Film, and Shirō, Hideaki Anno, and Shinji Higuchi co-participated in Toho and Tsuburaya Production projects, which have been influecned by the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise; &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise, and the &quot;Gridman&quot; franchise. Shirō also introduced Higuchi to the pianist Junko Miyagi (jp) during the production of &quot;&quot; because Miyagi is also a fan of the Heisei Gamera trilogy.

==History==
The &quot;Gamera&quot; film series is broken into three different eras, each reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all &quot;kaiju eiga&quot; (monster movies) in Japan. The names of the three eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Shōwa era, the Heisei era, and the Reiwa era.

Since original 1965 film production and merchandising budgets of each film have been confined due to financial situations of Daiei Film, Tokuma Shoten, and Kadokawa Corporation respectively, resulting in repeated copyright transfers of Daiei properties and limited productions and distributions overall, including cancellations of various projects and failed global expansions despite frequently featuring foreign casts in Shōwa films. Because of further declining public recognition of the character due to years of inactivity of the franchise and limited advertising expenses, Gamera&#x27;s heroic concept and irrelevance from &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise were &quot;forgotten&quot; and new audience segments often viewed him as a mere, &quot;corny&quot; (as a turtle) and &quot;childish&quot; imitation of Godzilla. This, along with other factors such as the loss of Daiei theater chains, has negatively affected on box office results and made it more difficult for Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation to restore the series along with other Daiei tokusatsu franchises such as &quot;Daimajin&quot; and &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;.

There have been several major hiatus in productions: one between &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; in 1971 and &quot;&quot; in 1980, followed by &quot;&quot; in 1995, &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; in 1999 followed by &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; in 2023.

The &quot;Daimajin&quot;, another iconic tokusatsu character by Daiei Film, was originally designed to be an antagonist for the second film, and its concept was fed back into both Daimajin and Barugon, the foe in the 1966 film &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot;. Daiei&#x27;s yōkai films most notably the &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot; were also launched due to the success of the Gamera franchise, and productions of them and related later films such as &quot;Sakuya: Yôkaiden&quot; were largely influenced by Gamera and Daimajin series. Collaborations of the Daiei films with Shigeru Mizuki and Kazuo Umezu started because of Daiei&#x27;s yōkai films and formed the &quot;Yōkai Boom&quot; together, resulted in minor crossovers between Gamera and Daimajin and Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; series and Hiroshi Aramata&#x27;s Yasunori Katō from &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot;.

Daiei Film, which was already at the brink of bankruptcy, somewhat recovered due to the unexpected success of the 1965 film, which was considered to be &quot;a mere rehash of Godzilla&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot;, &quot;being forced on Noriaki Yuasa as no one wanted&quot;, and &quot;destined to flop&quot;, and launched the &quot;Daimajin&quot; and the &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;, and these tokusatsu franchises gained popularity despite limited and continuously decreasing budgets and the declines of the &quot;First Kaiju Boom&quot; and domestic film industries (partially due to the success of the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise) and the arise of the more affordable &quot;Yokai Boom&quot;. However, Daiei Film&#x27;s financial difficulties were further accelerated by producing three &quot;Daimajin&quot; films within the same year (1966), and resulted in the cancellation of subsequent Daimajin productions.

All villainous monsters since &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; (Viras, Guiron, Jiger, Zigra) received their names from public submissions, and this was to draw public attention to compensate for limited advertising expenses. Concepts for monsters&#x27; designs and abilities were also restricted due to budgets, decreased destructions of urban areas, and film crews focused more on brutal melee fights to compensate for limited amounts of special effects, although the franchise occasionally received global compliments for its brutalness, such as Guiron beheading a Space Gyaos in &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot;. &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot;, the last film of the Showa continuity, was co-distributed with Nikkatsu due to the financial problems. The plot of &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; was particularly poor in consistency and logics due to the confusion of the company prior to its bankruptcy; Noriaki Yuasa was forced to become a contract director without overtime pays, impoverishments of employees and resources, and production systems were disrupted due to increased labor negotiations.

The &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise solely supported Daiei Film until its bankruptcy, and a number of kaiju suits and models including Gamera were lost as Noriaki Yuasa destroyed them due to his frustration and distress when he heard about the bankruptcy of the company, resulting in the production of &quot;&quot; and limited amounts of exhibitions. The bankruptcy of the company also triggered confusions and losses of negative prints and other materials, resulting in changes in the running time of &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; for video and DVD releases.

&quot;&quot;, the first production by Tokuma Shoten, was not completely a new production as it relied on a number of stock footages. The direction to re-edit stock footages of former films was also influenced by budgetary problems, along with the aforementioned loss of suits and models by Yuasa, and the success of the 1979 &quot;Ultraman&quot; video by Akio Jissoji (jp), which contributed in the revival of the Tsuburaya Productions franchise. Its box office result was not excellent partially due to the timing; kaiju genre in general stagnated between late 1970s and early 1980s where Toho ceased producing Godzilla films because of the box office result of &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot; in 1975.

The Heisei Trilogy originally started as an attempt to revive either (or both of) the &quot;Daimajin&quot; and the &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot; by Tokuma Shoten where the project faced budgetary problems and higher popularity of Gamera was revealed, while Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation also aimed to revive the Daimajin along with the Gamera franchise respectively; one in the late 1990s along with the Heisei Gamera Trilogy by starring Steven Seagal, the father of Ayako Fujitani who played Asagi Kusanagi, the human protagonist of the trilogy, and another by Takashi Miike in late 2000s along with &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; which was eventually redeveloped into &quot;Daimajin Kanon&quot;, and Miike made the Daimajin to appear in the 2018 film &quot;The Great Yokai War: Guardians&quot; where Gamera also made a cameo appearance within its spin-off novelization.

Prior to the actual development of the trilogy, Niisan Takahashi wrote a script for a scrapped project in 1994 which later became the basis of the 1995 novelization &quot;Gamera vs. Phoenix&quot;.

Financial vulnerability resulted in repeated avoidances from direct competitions against the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, although there had been failed attempts to make a crossover in 1990s and 2002, leading to the production of &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; in 2006 due to Toho&#x27;s temporal pause of Godzilla film productions since &quot;&quot; while both films shared some of crews.

Revenues of Daiei Film productions were repeatedly restricted due to lack of exclusive movie theaters, and ever since &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; which was co-distributed with Nikkatsu due to the financial problems, the franchise has always relied on co-distributions as Daiei Film lost its theater chains after its bankruptcy; the Heisei trilogy was done so by Toho, so as &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; by Shochiku, and &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; by Netflix. &quot;The Great Yokai War&quot; and &quot;The Great Yokai War: Guardians&quot; were also co-distributed by Shochiku and Toho. Heisei trilogy was distributed by Toho Western Films with much fewer theatres than &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, further declining box office results.

===Influences of the Heisei Trilogy===
The Heisei Trilogy by Shusuke Kaneko, despite its limited budgets and distributions overall, was highly acclaimed among audiences (partially because a number of hardcore kaiju (tokusatsu) fans at that time were dissatisfied with the Heisei Godzilla continuity) and filmmakers that they are often considered as some of best kaiju (tokusatsu) films ever made, and it greatly influenced entire tokusatsu genre afterward, including the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise but most notably on &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; franchises. However, there are pros and cons regarding the outcomes of the trilogy.

The box office returns of &quot;&quot;, the first installation of the reboot by Tokuma Shoten in 1995, were also negatively affected by the Great Hanshin earthquake (and the Tokyo subway sarin attack) as the numbers of film theaters further declined and the scenes of destructions of buildings triggered PTSD of the earthquake victims. Continuation of the series after &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; was cancelled due to the overall box office result of the trilogy, partially due to declined public recognition of the franchise and limited advertising expenses and limited distributions, and the struggle to produce sequels after depicting the titular heroic character as an unintentional threat to humanity in the 1999 film, where the film plot such as a girl (child) to detest Gamera, and depictions of human casualties in the battles of Shibuya and Kyoto largely displeased Noriaki Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and others; Yuasa noted &quot;the Heisei trilogy is not Gamera films&quot;, and the draft by Shusuke Kaneko and Kazunori Itō for the sequel to portray Gamera to be a further threat was immediately turned down. This plot was later used for the 2003 independent film, &quot;GAMERA 4-TRUTH&quot; (jp) by Shinpei Hayashiya (jp).

Kaneko noted that he was at one point almost dismissed during the production of the 1995 film (and the production was at the brink of cancellation) due to considerable disagreements between Kaneko and Itō against executives and Showa staffs to depict Gamera to be both an artificial and mechanical &quot;living robot&quot; and a threat to humanity without caring at all for humans, not even children, partially because Kaneko and Ito originally wanted to make the 1992 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; instead of Gamera, and wanted to &quot;take revenge on with Gamera&quot; while they and Shinji Higuchi always preferred Toho productions since their childhoods, and disliked and regarded the concept of Gamera to be rather absurd and &quot;childish&quot;, especially his ability to fly and affinity to children (and as a protector of humanity), child protagonists, and being a turtle.
During the trilogy, Kaneko and Ito tried to exclude children completely from the plot, and also tried to depict human casualties by Gamera from the start, however executives and Showa staff didn&#x27;t approve such ideas, and scenes to involve children were briefly inserted although such scenes mostly depicted children to be helpless &quot;burdens&quot; unlike Showa films, and human casualties were not featured until &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;. The 1999 film instead situated a girl (child) named Ayana Hirasaka as one of central antagonists to detest Gamera, however she was again portrayed as a &quot;burden&quot; that her parents and pet cat named &quot;Iris&quot; were accidentally killed by Gamera because their evacuation from the battle between Gamera and a Gyaos was delayed due to Ayana&#x27;s hospitalization, and she brings a mass destruction with her misdirected hatred for Gamera, and Gamera loses his right arm to save her. Especially the 1999 film intentionally avoided to appeal to child audiences, and the trilogy in general didn&#x27;t contribute in increasing young audiences due to the difficulty of the plot, lack of points that children can empathize, and fearsome and gruesome scenes especially the destruction of Shibuya by Gamera caused family audiences to exit theaters because children started crying, and also triggered a misconception among new audience segments; Gamera as the character doesn&#x27;t specifically protect humans for the sake of the planet and nature. On the other hand, production of &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; was delayed and was intentionally designed as a horror because of box office results of 1995 and 1996 films, declined popularity of kaiju genre, and contrasting popularity of horror films among children at that time.

These aspects resulted in controversies, even among film crews of the Heisei trilogy, and a disapproval of it, especially &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;, by a number of executives and Showa staff where Tokuma Shoten&#x27;s revenues were also reduced due to the intercompany treaty with Nippon TV and Hakuhodo to achieve Kaneko&#x27;s demand to increase budgets. Parts of two previous films in the trilogy, such as Gamera&#x27;s origin as an artificial lifeform, the depiction of Gamera doing damage to Fukuoka in the 1995 film, and the &quot;Ultimate Plasma&quot; technique in &quot;Gamera 2: Attack of Legion&quot;, were also controversial, but were eventually approved. The plot of &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; and Gamera&#x27;s depictions within the film partially followed those original ideas by Kaneko and Itō and Shinji Higuchi, while some of the originally cancelled depictions of Gamera for the 1995 film, such as his intimidating appearance and the ability to transform his arms into flippers during flights, were partially approved in &quot;Gamera 2: Attack of Legion&quot;. As aforementioned, the 2003 independent film &quot;GAMERA 4-TRUTH&quot; (jp) re-used the plot of cancelled &quot;G4&quot; in which Gamera no longer protects humanity and causes tremendous collateral damages to exterminate remnants of Gyaos.

The 1999 documentary film &quot;GAMERA 1999&quot; (jp) by Hideaki Anno focused on ruptures among film crews, even between Kaneko and Higuchi. Kaneko described that the documentary film was a harassment by one of producers to target Kaneko by using Anno.

Ironically, the popularity of the Heisei trilogy indirectly triggered another setback for the franchise. While Tokuma Shoten was already struggling financially and the company eventually disposed the copyrights of Daiei properties after the death of Yasuyoshi Tokuma (jp) in 2000, sequels after &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot; potentially up to &quot;G5&quot; or more were cancelled also due to the plot of &quot;G3&quot; for Gamera to act hazardous, and the plot of &quot;G4&quot; in which Gamera becomes a further threat. The 2006 film &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;, which was released during a &quot;winter&quot; of kaiju genre (akin to the situation of &quot;&quot;) since &quot;&quot; in 2004, was the first reboot attempt by Kadokawa Corporation reusing the original scripts of the 1995 film. &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; aimed to restore the basis of the franchise, with a slogan to &quot;return Gamera to children&quot;. It was also aimed to avoid &quot;standards&quot; of kaiju films akin to Showa films, partially due to a slump of kaiju genre itself (including the box office result of &quot;&quot;) and the success of Heisei Mothra trilogy, and was also influenced by various other films including &quot;Daigoro vs. Goliath&quot; by Toho and Tsuburaya Productions, &quot;Helen the Baby Fox&quot;, which also collaborated in distribution of the 2006 Gamera film, and &quot;&quot;.

However the 2006 film was generally not well-accepted by fans of the Heisei trilogy, but it was more welcomed by children and female audiences, resulting in the commercial failure of the film and cancellation of its sequels and other subsequent productions such as (one or two) anime(s) by Cartoon Network and Yoshitomo Yonetani, &quot;Gamera 3D&quot; by Yoshimitsu Banno, and one or more presumed reboot attempt(s) in 2010s, and the franchise was again in a period of inactivity until the 2023 Netflix series &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot;. Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;Daimajin&quot; project was presumably cancelled due to the aftermath of &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;, while it resulted in the production of &quot;Daimajin Kanon&quot;, and Daimajin appeared in Miike&#x27;s &quot;The Great Yokai War: Guardians&quot; (2021), along with Gamera in its spin-off novelization.

Shusuke Kaneko, who dislikes the concepts of Showa Gamera, is aware of both of criticisms against him and the intention of &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; (to recover the ideology of the franchise from the Heisei trilogy), however he in return openly disfavored the 2006 film and criticized its concept, and advocated the superiority of the Heisei trilogy. On the other hand, Kazunori Ito, who also doesn&#x27;t favor Showa Gamera films due to his preference for Toho productions, instead suggested to free the franchise from the Heisei trilogy after he watched the short film in 2015.

One of priorities for &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; is to prevent human casualties by Gamera; while reducing battle scenes among urban areas is effective to reduce production costs, Gamera was also intentionally depicted to arrive at Tokyo in the first episode after most evacuations were completed, and also threw Gyaos and Jiger at open areas without people in early episodes for this reason.

===Shōwa era (1965–1980)===
==== Daiei Film ====
The film series began in 1965 with &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, directed by Noriaki Yuasa, which is the first and only entry in the entire series to be shot in black-and-white. To date, it is the only Showa &quot;Gamera&quot; film to be released theatrically in the United States; however, it was heavily edited, dubbed and retitled &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot;. In the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matinée showcases such as &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot;, and later in the 1990s, when five &quot;Gamera&quot; films were featured on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

A total of seven &quot;Gamera&quot; films were produced between 1965 and 1971, with one being released in Japan each year. These films, several of which were also directed by Yuasa, became popular with child audiences. During this time, five of the seven films were picked up for television distribution in the United States by American International Television. Just as &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; becoming &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot;, each film (except for &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot;) was dubbed into English and re-titled for American viewers—&quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; became &quot;War of the Monsters&quot;; &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; became &quot;Return of the Giant Monsters&quot;; &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; became &quot;Destroy All Planets&quot;; &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot; became &quot;Attack of the Monsters&quot;; and &quot;Gamera vs. Jiger&quot; became &quot;Gamera vs. Monster X&quot;.

Despite several sources stating that a monster called Garasharp was to appear in the eighth entry in the &quot;Gamera&quot; series slated for a 1972 release, director Noriaki Yuasa stated that Garasharp was created specifically for the short film &quot;Gamera vs. Garasharp&quot; featured on the 1991 LD set, &quot;Gamera Permanent Preservation Plan&quot;, and that a new two-headed monster was planned for the next film, which was canceled because Daiei Film went into bankruptcy in 1971 and the &quot;Gamera&quot; films ceased production as a result.

Niisan Takahashi later published a revised graphic novel of &quot;Gamera vs. Garasharp&quot; illustrated by Yutaka Kondo, known for his illustrations of kaiju and other fictional characters for the &quot;Kūsō Kagaku Dokuhon&quot; series, and it was recorded in the 1995 CD-ROM of &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;. This edition depicted Garasharp with a different appearance and the ability to emit electricity.

==== Tokuma Shoten ====
After Daiei was purchased by Tokuma Shoten in 1974, the new management wanted to produce another &quot;Gamera&quot; film, resulting in &quot;&quot; (also known as &quot;Space Monster Gamera&quot;), released in 1980. The filmmakers were forced to make the movie because of the contract for one more &quot;Gamera&quot; film that they owed to Daiei. Approximately one-third of &quot;Gamera: Super Monster&quot; is composed of stock footage from six of the previous seven films. Yuasa had Takahashi end the film by having Gamera be presumably killed by sacrificing his life to save Earth, while the later-published manga by Hurricane Ryu depicted that Gamera was artificially resurrected.

In 1985, the American distribution rights to the &quot;Gamera&quot; films were bought by producer Sandy Frank, who distributed five of the eight films with new English dubbing. In 1988 and 1989, Frank&#x27;s versions of &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; (simply re-titled &quot;Gamera&quot;), &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot;, &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; (re-titled &quot;Gamera vs. Gaos&quot;), &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot;, and &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; were each used in episodes of the television program &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, during the show&#x27;s first season, which aired on KTMA-TV.

===Heisei era (1995–2015)===
==== Tokuma Shoten ====
In the 1995 series reboot by Tokuma Shoten, &quot;&quot;, three Gyaos are discovered on a remote island. The Japanese government discovers that they are all female and decides that since they are the last of their kind, they should be captured and studied. Meanwhile, scientists search for a moving atoll in the Pacific. When the atoll is located, small gems made of an unknown metal are discovered on it, as well as a stone that protrudes from the center of the island. The scientists take pictures and collect some of the strange gems, but the stone crumbles and the atoll moves off towards Japan at high speeds. The atoll is found to be an ancient monster of Atlantean origin called Gamera. He attacks the Gyaos; two are killed, but one escapes. The remaining Gyaos grows to Gamera-like proportions and returns to resume the battle. Gamera defeats this foe and heads out to sea.

In &quot;Gamera 2: Attack of Legion&quot;, released in 1996, Gamera defends the Earth from attacks by an alien force known as Legion (jp).

In &quot;Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris&quot;, released in 1999, Gamera has to face hordes of Gyaos Hyper and a new foe known as Iris which is a subspecies of Gyaos. Shusuke Kaneko originally wanted to end the film with Gamera&#x27;s victory against the swarms of Gyaos, however his idea was cancelled partially due to budgetary problems.

Yasuyoshi Tokuma (jp)&#x27;s proposal for a crossover with Godzilla didn&#x27;t materialize, and &quot;G4&quot; was cancelled, and Tokuma Shoten eventually disposed Daiei Film properties due to Yasuyoshi&#x27;s death in 2000 and the financial condition of the company.

The 2003 independent film, &quot;GAMERA 4-TRUTH&quot; (jp), which presumably reused the scrapped plot of &quot;G4&quot;, was produced by Shinpei Hayashiya (jp) with featuring Yukijirō Hotaru. Tokuma Shoten gave a permission to it under the condition to not to take fees, and it has been repeatedly co-screened with canonical &quot;Gamera&quot; films on occasions.

==== Kadokawa Corporation ====
In &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;, the first reboot attempt by Kadokawa Corporation released in 2006, Gamera (Avant Gamera and Toto) battles a flock of Original Gyaos and Zedus, a mutant kaiju under the influence of Gyaos. It was initially intended to be a crossover with Godzilla, and the company also initiated reboot attempts of &quot;Daimajin&quot; and &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;, and the 2005 film &quot;The Great Yokai War&quot; was produced. Afterward the 2006 film, various subsequent productions including its sequels, along with a &quot;Daimajin&quot; project were cancelled.

In March 2014, Anime News Network reported that a new &quot;Gamera&quot; production was planned, with no release date specified.

At the New York Comic Con held in October 2015, Kadokawa Daiei Studio&#x27;s senior managing director Tsuyoshi Kikuchi and producer Shinichiro Inoue (jp) screened a full proof-of-concept film in honor of the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary; the short was directed by Katsuhito Ishii and its music was composed by Kenji Kawai. The proof-of-concept film featured a newly designed Gamera, a swarm of newly designed Gyaos and a new, as yet unnamed monster, all of which were created and rendered through the use of computer-generated imagery. It has been rumored since the film&#x27;s showing at New York Comic Con that it was never completed. However, the film&#x27;s official website and an interview with the director both state that it was only a short proof of concept film. However, Inoue was actually trying to reboot the franchise with a new film for five years.

=== Reiwa era (2023) ===

An anime series, titled &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot;, was released globally on Netflix in 2023. A number of references to previous films and scrapped projects were made, including the reuse of the &quot;Gamera March&quot; (ja), the iconic Showa song. For example, designs of Gamera and Gyaos and the scene for Gamera to shoot down a flock of smaller Gyaos with his fireball in the first episode are reused from the 2015 short film, and Katsuhito Ishii was credited as the designer of Gamera. It yet again suffers insufficiency in budget; it features poorly done 3D models for humans, and lacks an opening animation (jp) which is a common feature of Japanese anime. The battle scenes were also cut in half from what was originally intended to be, and Seshita noted that inserting kaiju battles in every episode was very difficult for budgetary problems. While crews are willing to produce additional seasons with more budgets and increased fighting scenes, potentially up to 5, the future of the series is uncertain. Hiroyuki Seshita (jp) also pointed a possibility of the series to be adapted into live-action productions, and expressed his wish for the series to contribute to the revival of the franchise.

In 2003, Alpha Video released the American versions of four Shōwa films on pan and scan DVDs: &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot;, &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; (as &quot;War of the Monsters&quot;), &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; (as &quot;Destroy All Planets&quot;) and &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot; (as &quot;Attack of the Monsters&quot;).

In 2010, Shout! Factory acquired the rights from Kadokawa Pictures for all eight of the Showa &quot;Gamera&quot; films in order to release the uncut Japanese versions on DVD for the first time ever in North America. These &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVDs were released in sequential order, starting with &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; on May 18, 2010, followed by &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; and two double features: &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot; with &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot;, and &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot; with &quot;Gamera vs. Jiger&quot;. On March 15, 2011, Shout! Factory released the last two films of the Showa series in a double feature of &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot; with &quot;&quot;. Shout! Factory later released &quot;MST3K vs. Gamera&quot;, a special 21st volume of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; containing the episodes featuring all five &quot;Gamera&quot; movies from the show&#x27;s third season.

On April 29, 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment released the eight Showa &quot;Gamera&quot; films (1965–1980) on Blu-ray in two volumes, &quot;Gamera: The Ultimate Collection Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Gamera: The Ultimate Collection Volume 2&quot;, featuring the original widescreen video and original Japanese audio only with English subtitles, and also the first 11 films (1965–1999) on DVD again as &quot;The Gamera Legacy Collection: 1965 - 1999&quot;, also featuring the original widescreen video and original Japanese audio only with English subtitles. The Heisei trilogy was re-released on Blu-ray earlier from Mill Creek Entertainment on September 27, 2011, once again featuring the original widescreen video and original Japanese audio only with English subtitles.

On August 17, 2020, Arrow Video released a Blu-ray box set titled &quot;Gamera: The Complete Collection&quot;. The set features the original Japanese cuts for all 12 films, with English audio options; the Blu-ray debut of &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot; and &quot;War of the Monsters&quot;; digital HD transfers and 4K restorations of the Heisei trilogy; case artwork by Matt Frank; audio commentaries by August Ragone, David Kalat, Steve Ryfle, Ed Godziszewski, Sean Rhoads, and Brooke McCorkle; a full color hardcover reprint of Dark Horse Comics&#x27; four-issue comic book miniseries &quot;Gamera the Guardian of the Universe&quot;; the English-language printing debut of the comic book story &quot;Gamera: The Last Hope&quot; by Matt Frank and Joshua Bugosh; and an 80-page book featuring a retrospective on the series by Patrick Macias with illustrations by Jolyon Yates.

===Comics===
Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue miniseries based on Gamera called &quot;Gamera the Guardian of the Universe&quot; in 1996. The miniseries features Gamera, Gyaos, Zigra, and Viras. The manga series &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, depicts Gamera as appearing in the land of Penguin Village. Gajira &quot;Gatchan&quot; Norimaki&#x27;s name is also a reference to Gamera. In the manga series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, also by Toriyama, a flying turtle which resembles a smaller version of Gamera is summoned by Master Roshi to carry him to Fire Mountain. There are references to Gamera in chapters of the manga series &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot;, written and illustrated by Osamu Akimoto, and &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;, created by Yudetamago. These chapters appear in &quot;Gamera: Super Monster&quot;, the eighth film in the franchise.

===Television===
The first, local TV season of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; includes five episodes which each feature a film from the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise&#x27;s Shōwa period: &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot;, &quot;Gamera vs. Barugon&quot;, &quot;Gamera vs. Gyaos&quot;, &quot;Gamera vs. Guiron&quot;, and &quot;Gamera vs. Zigra&quot;. The same five films were re-used in the show&#x27;s third national season. The thirteenth season of the show also contains an episode that features &quot;Gamera vs. Jiger&quot;. In a similar manner to events depicted in the manga series upon which it was based, the anime television series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; features a creature known as Baby Gamera, a flying turtle resembling a miniature version of Gamera which transports Master Roshi to Fire Mountain. Gamera was parodied in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Mecha-Streisand&quot;, and was featured in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo&quot;.

An anime series, titled &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot;, was released on Netflix in 2023.

As aforementioned, Gamera repeatedly appeared in the &quot;Sailor Fight&quot; series (jp) in 1995 and 1996 most notably the &quot;Gamera vs. Sailor Fighter&quot; and &quot;Cosplay Warrior Cutie Knight&quot;.

Gamera made several appearances in television advertisements; one by Calbee in 1989, and another by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group in which he co-appeared with Maki Horikita and others, and it was produced by Shinichi Wakasa (jp) and his Monsters (jp) and Jun Kawanishi (jp). Akira Ohashi again played Gamera for the latter.

===Video games===
Gamera appeared in several video games released in 1995, including &quot;Gamera: Daikaiju Kuchu Kessen&quot; for the Game Boy, &quot;Gamera: Gyaosu Gekimetsu Sakusen&quot; for the Super Famicom, and &quot;Gamera: The Time Adventure&quot; for the Bandai Playdia. In 1997, &quot;Gamera 2000&quot; was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation. In 2017, Gamera appeared in the video game &quot;City Shrouded in Shadow&quot;, released for the PlayStation 4, alongside such characters as Legion (jp), Godzilla, Ultraman, and Evangelion Unit-01.

Additional collaborations have been made with &quot;The Tower II&quot;, &quot;Monster Gear&quot;, &quot;Symphogear XD Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Godzilla Battle Line&quot;, and so on.

==Reception==
===Box office performance and critical response===
Many of the &quot;Gamera&quot; films were commercially successful in Japan, rivaling the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise at the box office during the 1960s. However, they were commonly regarded as being inferior to the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, with criticism being aimed at the derivative and absurd nature of the series. Despite this, the 1995 reboot &quot;Gamera: Guardian of the Universe&quot; was both a critical and financial success, remaining in the top 10 films in Japan for its first six weeks of release and grossing more than &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;, which was also playing in Japanese theaters at that time.

===Legacy===
As aforementioned, the franchise has been prominent in expanding post-war popular cultures in Japan (including the creations of &quot;Daimajin&quot; and &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;) where its direct and indirect influences extend among not only &quot;kaiju&quot; and &quot;tokusatsu&quot; genres but also other entertainment industries, where Noriaki Yuasa also became one of the best hitmakers for domestic television industries at that time through his experiences of &quot;Gamera&quot; and other Daiei Film productions.

Todd McCarthy, in his review of &quot;Gamera: Guardian of the Universe&quot; for &quot;Variety&quot;, wrote that &quot;Despite its horrific countenance and plated shell, Gamera remains one of the most likable of all movie monsters&quot;. Brian Solomon of the website Bloody Disgusting ranked Gamera eighth on his list of &quot;Most Kick-Ass Giant Monsters in Movie History&quot;. Gamera was also ranked eighth on Rick Mele of &quot;Sharp&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Greatest Giant Monsters in Movie History&quot;. Chris Coffel of Film School Rejects wrote that &quot;I would argue that the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise is better than the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise&quot;, complimenting Gamera&#x27;s turtle-like design and his affinity for children. Ken Watanabe, who played a major role in MonsterVerse films, noted that he preferred Gamera to Godzilla during his youth. Guillermo del Toro noted that &quot;Gamera, the Giant Monster&quot; is one of favorite kaiju films, and he as a child often created his own kaiju and robots based on classic characters including Gamera and Barugon.

Several authors such as Hiro Arikawa and Jeremy Robinson and Kōhei Horikoshi noted that Gamera is one of their favorite kaiju and had influences on their works such as &quot;Nemesis Saga&quot; and &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;. Atsuji Yamamoto noted that Gamera was one of inspiration sources for his images of protagonists of his works. Hideaki Anno and Hajime Isayama also drew inspirations from Gyaos for their images of angels and titans in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; respectively where Anno directed the 1999 documentary &quot;GAMERA 1999&quot; (jp), and Shinji Higuchi directed the live-action film adaptation of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. Several authors such as Kō Machida and Yoshiki Shibata (jp) have also published original stories of Gyaos. Shinichiro Inoue (jp) and Toshio Miike (jp) participated in the 2020 disaster film &quot;Fukushima 50&quot;, and Inoue clarified its style to insert a number of telops is an homage to the Heisei Gamera trilogy. Higuchi utilized expertise from the Gamera trilogy for his later works such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sinking of Japan&quot;, &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot;, and so on.

Showa Gamera staffs were involved in the production of the 1967 South Korean-Japanese film &quot;Yongary, Monster from the Deep&quot;, and the titular monster Yonggary bears several resembrances to Gamera such as to breathe traditional non-atomic fire and favors a song and dance with it.

The Heisei Gamera Trilogy is widely applauded both by film makers and audiences in Japan, and Keiichi Hasegawa remarked that it had a great impact on entire tokusatsu genre afterwards especially the &quot;Ultraman&quot; and the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; franchises, including various references, and several important tokusatsu techniques were created by the trilogy while expertise and connections from previous &quot;Ultraman&quot; works including a scrapped &quot;Ultra Q&quot; project by Kaneko and Kazunori Itō and Shinji Higuchi, &quot;Ultraman 80&quot;, and &quot;Ultraman Powered&quot; (jp) in return influenced the Heisei Gamera Trilogy where Showa staffs such as Noriaki Yuasa participated in the production of &quot;Ultraman 80&quot;. &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; by Toei Animation and &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot; by Tsuburaya Productions were re-developed from the original scripts of &quot;&quot; by Chiaki J. Konaka and Kazuya Konaka (jp) and Yoshikazu Okada (jp) which also became the basis for &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot;. As aforementioned, several Godzilla films have been pointed out to be influenced by Heisei Gamera Trilogy, and &quot;GMK&quot; and &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; were directed by Shusuke Kaneko and Shinji Higuchi. Kaneko acknowledges the similarities between Heisei Gamera Trilogy and MonsterVerse series, and the scrapped Gamera project &quot;&quot;Gamera 3D&quot; which was the successor of &quot;Godzilla 3D&quot;&quot; by Yoshimitsu Banno served as one of predecessors of MonsterVerse. Higuchi also adapted his experiences and miniature models from the Heisei Gamera Trilogy for his 2012 short film &quot;Giant God Warrior Appears in Tokyo&quot; where Daiei franchises and Studio Ghibli were owned by Tokuma Shoten at that time, and distributions of the trilogy were also affected by Studio Ghibli productions, while the production of the 2000 film &quot;Shiki-Jitsu&quot; by Ayako Fujitani and Hideaki Anno was instead influenced by the Heisei trilogy. Character designs of &quot;Gamera Rebirth&quot; was also somewhat affected by Studio Ghibli due to involvements of Naoya Tanaka (jp) and Mitsunori Kataama (jp). A popular television series &quot;How Do You Like Wednesday?&quot; is also strongly influenced by the trilogy.

Numerous media globally have references to the franchise. Such examples are; &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Gridman&quot;, &quot;Sadako DX&quot;, &quot;Giant Monsters Appear in Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, &quot;Love &amp; Peace&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, Bowser from the &quot;Mario&quot; series and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot; and its parody &quot;Kid Dracula&quot; &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game&quot;, &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot;, &quot;King of Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Battle Cats&quot;, &quot;Palworld&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Simulator&quot;, and many other video games, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; franchizes, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot;, &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot;, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; and &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon SuperS&quot;, &quot;Gintama&quot;, &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;, &quot;Yakitate!! Japan&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot;, &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, &quot;Devilman&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Jumbo Monster GOMERA&quot; (jp), &quot;Daicon III and IV Opening Animations&quot;, &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, &quot;Uzumaki&quot;, &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;, &quot;The Red Ranger Becomes an Adventurer in Another World&quot;, &quot;Voltes V&quot; and &quot;Voltes V: Legacy&quot;, &quot;Nurse Witch Komugi&quot;, &quot;Pani Poni&quot;, &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; and &quot;Pacific Rim Uprising&quot;, &quot;Mountain Dew Code Red&quot;, and many others. Other cases include companies and musicians and songs feature Gamera in their names or lyrics.

Gamera and his foes&#x27; roars were used in various other media such as &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Fireman&quot;, &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Aura Battler Dunbine&quot;, &quot;Reideen the Brave&quot;, &quot;Voltes V&quot;, &quot;Chargeman Ken!&quot;, and so on.

November 27 is publicly referred as in Japan as the first film was released on the day in 1965. Akira Ohashi, who played Gamera and Iris in the Heisei Trilogy and also participated in related works including &quot;GMK&quot; and &quot;Nezura 1964&quot;, noted the coincidence that the day is also the birthday of Bruce Lee where Ohashi was inspired by Bruce Lee for his acting of Gamera in the Heisei Trilogy.

Chōfu features Gamera and Daimajin along with characters from Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; and &quot;Akuma-kun&quot; as symbols where there have been several minor-crossovers between these franchises, and an official mascot character was designed and named after Gamera.

The extinct Cretaceous sinemyidid turtle with long spines on its carapace, &quot;Sinemys gamera&quot;, classified in 1993, was named after Gamera. The extinct Cretaceous baenid turtle &quot;Gamerabaena sonsalla&quot;, classified in 2010, was named after Gamera. A specimen of Nodosauridae was also nicknamed after the kaiju.

The University of Maryland Gamera I human-powered helicopter, along with its successor, was named after Gamera. Developed by University of Maryland engineering students in 2011 and 2012, respectively, the name was also chosen in reference to the university&#x27;s mascot, the diamondback terrapin, as well as to flights undertaken by Japanese human-powered helicopters years prior.

In July 2011, Washington State University veterinarians successfully fixed a prosthetic caster onto an African spurred tortoise named Gamera (after the giant turtle), who was a single amputee where Avant Gamera and Toto in &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; were designed after African spurred tortoise.

J/FPS-5 (jp), an early-warning radar of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is often referred as due to its shape somewhat resembling a turtle shell. A Japanese free climber Toshiyuki Kikuchi (jp) is known with a nickname &quot;Gamera&quot; being named after the kaiju. The Japanese esports player &quot;Gamera&quot; was named after the kaiju, and a technique for esports is called &quot;Gamera&quot; in Japan after the kaiju.

In 2024, Itochu acquired BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd (jp) after multiple scandals of the latter, and the code name for the acquiring project was named &quot;Gamera&quot; after the kaiju.

Naoyuki &quot;Gyaos&quot; Naitō (jp), a TV personality who was formerly a baseball player and a manager, took his stage name from Gyaos, the most recurring foe of Gamera of the series. The comedy troupe &quot;Gyaos&quot; which was later renamed to &quot;Denshamichi&quot; (jp), presumably took its name from Naitō as the comedians focused on baseball topics. Similarly, Kazuhiro &quot;Daimajin&quot; Sasaki was nicknamed after the Daimajin, the character redeveloped from the Gamera franchise, where Chikara Hashimoto, who portrayed the Daimajin and Daimon the vampiric demon in &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot; and participated in &quot;Gamera&quot; and other related productions, was also a baseball player and also co-acted with aforementioned Bruce Lee in the 1972 film &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;. Hashimoto was also appointed for other monsters and yokai films most notably &quot;Gamera vs. Viras&quot; and &quot;The Whale God&quot; (&quot;Killer Whale&quot;) where the latter presumably influenced the Dai-kaiju, the right whale-based kaiju with an alias of the &quot;Whale God&quot;, from &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; franchise.

<text>The Big U (1984) is a novel by American writer Neal Stephenson. His first published novel, it is a satire of campus life.

== Plot ==
The story chronicles the disillusionment of a number of young intellectuals as they encounter the realities of the higher education establishment parodied in the story. Over time their lives and sanity disintegrate in different ways through a series of escalating events that culminates with a full-scale civil war raging on the campus of &quot;American Megaversity&quot;.

Told in the first person from the perspective of Bud, a lecturer in Remote Sensing who is new to the university, the book attacks and makes fun of just about every conceivable group at university, though its portraits of the nerds/computer scientists/role players tend to be more detailed than those of other factions.

The events take place at a fictitious big university consisting of a single building (a central complex with eight towers containing student housing), making the university an enclosed universe of its own. Stephenson uses this fact to take what starts as a mostly realistic satire and move it further and further into the realm of improbability, with giant radioactive rats, hordes of bats and a lab-made railgun.

The book was written while Stephenson attended Boston University and the fictional campus is parallel to BU in many ways. The dormitories are similar to Warren Towers, one of the largest dorms in the US. The character of President Septimius Severus Krupp shares traits with then–BU President John Silber, although his name—like those of his predecessors as president of the Big U—is taken from the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. The neon Big Wheel sign plays a part reminiscent of the Boston Citgo sign just east of the BU campus in Kenmore Square.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Stephenson has said he is not proud of this book. When Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was published in 1992, the book that became a best-seller and vaulted him to fame, &quot;The Big U&quot; was out of print and Stephenson was content to leave it that way. When original editions began selling on eBay for hundreds of dollars, he relented and allowed &quot;The Big U&quot; to be republished, saying that the only thing worse than people reading the book was paying that much to read it.

== Connections to Stephenson&#x27;s later work==
* Julian Jaynes&#x27; theory of the bicameral mind used by Stephenson in this novel to explain the behavior of some of the cult-like student groups is an important part of the plot of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.
* The idea of institutions of learning also serving as repositories of nuclear waste reappears in &quot;Anathem&quot;.

<doc id="65008" wikidata="Q2334196" url="?curid=65008" title="Shub-Niggurath">
<text>Shub-Niggurath is a deity created by H. P. Lovecraft. She is often associated with the phrase &quot;The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young&quot;. The only other name by which Lovecraft referred to her was &quot;Lord of the Wood&quot; in his story &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;.

Shub-Niggurath is first mentioned in Lovecraft&#x27;s revision story &quot;The Last Test&quot; (1928); she is not described by Lovecraft, but is frequently mentioned or called upon in incantations. Most of her development as a literary figure was carried out by other Mythos authors, including August Derleth, Robert Bloch, and Ramsey Campbell.

Lovecraft explicitly defined Shub-Niggurath as a mother goddess in &quot;The Mound&quot;, where he calls her &quot;Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother&quot;. He describes her as a kind of Astarte in the same story. In &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot;, she is one of the deities siding with humanity against &quot;hostile gods&quot;.

August Derleth classified Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One, but the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; role-playing game classifies her as an Outer God. The &quot;CthulhuTech&quot; role-playing game, in turn, returns to Derleth&#x27;s classification of Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One.

== Development ==
Shub-Niggurath&#x27;s appearances in Lovecraft&#x27;s main body of fiction do not provide much detail about his conception of the entity. Her first mention under Lovecraft&#x27;s byline was in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1928), where a quote from the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; discussing the Old Ones breaks into an exclamation of &quot;Iä! Shub-Niggurath!&quot; The story provides no further information about this peculiar expression.

The next Lovecraft story to mention Shub-Niggurath is scarcely more informative. In &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1930), a recording of a ceremony involving human and nonhuman worshippers includes the following exchange:

Similarly unexplained exclamations occur in &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (1933).

== Revision tales ==

Lovecraft only provided specific information about Shub-Niggurath in his &quot;revision tales&quot;, stories published under the names of clients for whom he ghost-wrote. As Price points out, &quot;For these clients he constructed a parallel myth-cycle to his own, a separate group of Great Old Ones&quot;, including Yig, Ghatanothoa, Rhan-Tegoth, &quot;the evil twins Nug and Yeb&quot;—and Shub-Niggurath.

While some of these revision stories just repeat the familiar exclamations, others provide new elements of lore. In &quot;The Last Test&quot; (1927), the first mention of Shub-Niggurath seems to connect her to Nug and Yeb: &quot;I talked in Yemen with an old man who had come back from the Crimson Desert—he had seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb—Iä! Shub-Niggurath!&quot;

The revision story &quot;The Mound&quot;, which describes the discovery of an underground realm called K&#x27;n-yan by a Spanish conquistador, reports that a temple of Tsathoggua there &quot;had been turned into a shrine of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the Not-to-Be-Named-One. This deity was a kind of sophisticated Astarte, and her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious.&quot;

The reference to &quot;Astarte&quot;, the consort of Baal in Semitic mythology, ties Shub-Niggurath to the related fertility goddess Cybele, the Magna Mater mentioned in Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;, and implies that the &quot;great mother worshipped by the hereditary cult of Exham Priory&quot; in that story &quot;had to be none other than Shub-Niggurath&quot;.

The Not-to-Be-Named-One, not being named, is difficult to identify; a similar phrase, translated into Latin as the &quot;Magnum Innominandum&quot;, appears in a list in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; and was included in a scrap of incantation that Lovecraft wrote for Robert Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Shambler from the Stars&quot;. August Derleth identifies this mysterious entity with Hastur (though Hastur appears in the same &quot;Whisperer in Darkness&quot; list with the &quot;Magnum Innominandum&quot;), while Robert M. Price equates him with Yog-Sothoth—though he also suggests that Shub-Niggurath&#x27;s mate is implicitly the snake god Yig.

Finally, in &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot;, a revision tale set in part on the lost continent of Mu, Lovecraft describes the character T&#x27;yog as the &quot;High Priest of Shub-Niggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the Goat with a Thousand Young&quot;. In the story, T&#x27;yog surprisingly maintains that &quot;the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, and ... that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, were ready to take sides with man&quot; against the more malevolent Ghatanothoa. Shub-Niggurath is called &quot;the Mother Goddess&quot;, and reference is made to &quot;her sons&quot;, presumably Nug and Yeb.

=== Other references ===
Other evidence of Lovecraft&#x27;s conception of Shub-Niggurath can be found in his letters. For example, in a letter to Willis Conover, Lovecraft described her as an &quot;evil cloud-like entity&quot;. &quot;Yog-Sothoth&#x27;s wife is the hellish cloud-like entity Shub-Niggurath, in whose honor nameless cults hold the rite of the Goat with a Thousand Young. By her he has two monstrous offspring—the evil twins Nug and Yeb. He has also begotten hellish hybrids upon the females of various organic species throughout the universes of space-time.&quot;

==The Black Goat==
Although Shub-Niggurath is often associated with the epithet &quot;The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young&quot;, it is possible that this Black Goat is a separate entity. Rodolfo Ferraresi, in his essay &quot;The Question of Shub-Niggurath&quot;, says that Lovecraft himself separated the two in his writings, such as in &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; (1935) in which a distinction is made between Shub-Niggurath and the Black Goat—the goat is the figurehead through which Shub-Niggurath is worshipped. In apparent contrast to Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat is sometimes depicted as a male, most notably in the rite performed in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1931) in which the Black Goat is called the &quot;Lord of the Woods&quot;. However, Lovecraft clearly associates Shub-Niggurath with The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young in two of his stories—&quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; and &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot;.

It is possible that The Black Goat is actually Ny-Rakath, Shub-Niggurath&#x27;s brother. The Black Goat may also be the personification of Pan, since Lovecraft was influenced by Arthur Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; (1890), a story that inspired Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1929). In this incarnation, the Black Goat may represent Satan in the form of the satyr, a half-man, half-goat. In folklore, the satyr symbolized a man with excessive sexual appetites. The Black Goat may otherwise be a male, earthly form of Shub-Niggurath—an incarnation she assumes to copulate with her worshipers.

==Robert M. Price&#x27;s interpretation==
Robert M. Price points to a passage from &quot;Idle Days on the Yann&quot;, by Lord Dunsany, one of Lovecraft&#x27;s favorite writers, as the source for the name Shub-Niggurath:

Notes Price: &quot;The name already carried a whiff of sulfur: Sheol was the name for the Netherworld mentioned in the Bible and the Gilgamesh Epic.&quot;

As for Shub-Niggurath&#x27;s association with the symbol of the goat, Price writes,

<text>Damselflies are flying insects of the suborder Zygoptera in the order Odonata. They are similar to dragonflies (which constitute the other odonatan suborder, Epiprocta) but are usually smaller and have slimmer bodies. Most species fold the wings along the body when at rest, unlike dragonflies which hold the wings flat and away from the body. Damselflies have existed since the Late Jurassic, and are found on every continent except Antarctica.

All damselflies are predatory insects: both nymphs and adults actively hunt and eat other insects. The nymphs are aquatic, with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acidic bogs, ponds, lakes and rivers. The nymphs moult repeatedly, at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo metamorphosis. The skin splits down the back, they emerge and inflate their wings and abdomen to gain their adult form. Their presence on a body of water indicates that it is relatively unpolluted, but their dependence on freshwater makes them vulnerable to damage to their wetland habitats.

Some species of damselfly have elaborate courtship behaviours. Many species are sexually dimorphic, the males often being more brightly coloured than the females. Like dragonflies, they reproduce using indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. A mating pair form a shape known as a &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot;, the male clasping the female at the back of the head, the female curling her abdomen down to pick up sperm from secondary genitalia at the base of the male&#x27;s abdomen. The pair often remain together with the male still clasping the female while she lays eggs within the tissue of plants in or near water using a robust ovipositor.

Artificial fishing flies that mimic damselfly nymphs are used in wet-fly fishing. Damselflies are sometimes represented in personal jewellery such as brooches.

== Classification ==
The Zygoptera are an ancient group, with the earliest fossils dating to the Kimmeridgian age of the Late Jurassic, around 152 million years ago. Well-preserved Eocene damselfly larvae and exuviae are known from fossils preserved in amber in the Baltic region.

Molecular analysis in 2021 confirms that most of the traditional families are monophyletic, but shows that the Amphipterygidae, Megapodagrionidae and Protoneuridae are paraphyletic and will need to be reorganised. The Protoneuridae in particular is shown to be composed of six clades from five families. The result so far is 27 damselfly families, with 7 more likely to be created. The discovered clades did not agree well with traditional characteristics used to classify living and fossil Zygoptera such as wing venation, so fossil taxa will need to be revisited. The 18 extant traditional families are provisionally rearranged as follows (the 3 paraphyletic families disappearing, and many details not resolved):

==General description==

The general body plan of a damselfly is similar to that of a dragonfly. The compound eyes are large but are more widely separated and relatively smaller than those of a dragonfly. Above the eyes is the frons or forehead, below this the clypeus, and on the lower lip or labium, an extensible organ used in the capture of prey. The top of the head bears three simple eyes (ocelli), which may measure light intensity, and a tiny pair of antennae that serve no olfactory function but may measure air speed. Many species are sexually dimorphic; the males are often brightly coloured and distinctive, while the females are plainer, cryptically coloured, and harder to identify to species. For example, in &quot;Coenagrion&quot;, the Eurasian bluets, the males are bright blue with black markings, while the females are usually predominantly green or brown with black. A few dimorphic species show female-limited polymorphism, the females being in two forms, one form distinct and the other with the patterning as in males. The ones that look like males, andromorphs, are usually under a third of the female population but the proportion can rise significantly and a theory that explains this response suggests that it helps overcome harassment by males. Some Coenagrionid damselflies show male-limited polymorphism, an even less understood phenomenon.

In general, damselflies are smaller than dragonflies, the smallest being members of the genus &quot;Agriocnemis&quot; (wisps). However, members of the Pseudostigmatidae (helicopter damselflies or forest giants) are exceptionally large for the group, with wingspans as much as in &quot;Megaloprepus&quot; and body length up to in &quot;Pseudostigma aberrans&quot;.


The first thoracic segment is the prothorax, bearing the front pair of legs. The joint between head and prothorax is slender and flexible, which enables the damselfly to swivel its head and to manoeuvre more freely when flying. The remaining thoracic segments are the fused mesothorax and metathorax (together termed the synthorax), each with a pair of wings and a pair of legs. A dark stripe known as the humeral stripe runs from the base of the front wings to the second pair of legs, and just in front of this is the pale-coloured, antehumeral stripe.
The forewings and hindwings are similar in appearance and are membranous, being strengthened and supported by longitudinal veins that are linked by many cross-veins and that are filled with haemolymph. Species markers include quadrangular markings on the wings known as the pterostigma or stigma, and in almost all species, there is a nodus near the leading edge. The thorax houses the flight muscles. Many damselflies (e.g. Lestidae, Platycnemidae, Coenagrionidae) have clear wings, but some (Calopterygidae, Euphaeidae) have coloured wings, whether uniformly suffused with colour or boldly marked with a coloured patch. In species such as the banded demoiselle, &quot;Calopteryx splendens&quot; the males have both a darker green body and large dark violet-blue patches on all four wings, which flicker conspicuously in their aerial courtship dances; the females have pale translucent greenish wings.

The abdomen is long and slender and consists of ten segments. The secondary genitalia in males are on the undersides of segments two and three and are conspicuous, making it easy to tell the sex of the damselfly when viewed from the side. The female genital opening is on the underside between segments eight and nine. It may be covered by a subgenital plate, or extended into a complex ovipositor that helps them lay eggs within plant tissue. The tenth segment in both sexes bears cerci and in males, its underside bears a pair of paraprocts.

Damselflies (except spreadwings, Lestidae) rest their wings together, above their bodies, whereas dragonflies rest with their wings spread diametrically apart; the spreadwings rest with their wings slightly apart. Damselflies have slenderer bodies than dragonflies, and their eyes do not overlap. Damselfly nymphs differ from dragonflies nymphs in that the epiproct and pair of paraprocts at the tip of their abdomen has been modified into caudal gills, in addition to being able to absorb oxygen through the wall of their rectum, whereas dragonflies breathe through internal rectal gills only. Damselfly nymphs swim by fish-like undulations, the gills functioning like a tail. Dragonfly nymphs can forcibly expel water in their rectum for rapid escape.

==Distribution and diversity==
Odonates are found on all the continents except Antarctica. Although some species of dragonfly have wide distributions, damselflies tend to have smaller ranges. Most odonates breed in fresh-water; a few damselflies in the family Caenagrionidae breed in brackish water (and a single dragonfly species breeds in seawater). Dragonflies are more affected by pollution than are damselflies. The presence of odonates indicates that an ecosystem is of good quality. The most species-rich environments have a range of suitable microhabitats, providing suitable water bodies for breeding.

Although most damselflies live out their lives within a short distance of where they were hatched, some species, and some individuals within species, disperse more widely. Forktails in the family Coenagrionidae seem particularly prone to do this, large male boreal bluets (&quot;Enallagma boreale&quot;) in British Columbia often migrating, while smaller ones do not. These are known to leave their waterside habitats, flying upwards till lost from view, and presumably being dispersed to far off places by the stronger winds found at high altitudes. In this way they may appear in a locality where no damselflies were to be seen the day before. Rambur&#x27;s forktail (&quot;Ischnura ramburii&quot;) has been found, for example, on oil rigs far out in the Gulf of Mexico.

The distribution and diversity of damselfly species in the biogeographical regions is summarized here. (There are no damselflies in the Antarctic.) Note that some species are widespread and occur in multiple regions.
Overall, there are about 2942 extant species of damselflies placed in 309 genera.

== Biology ==


Adult damselflies catch and eat flies, mosquitoes, and other small insects. Often they hover among grasses and low vegetation, picking prey off stems and leaves with their spiny legs (unlike dragonflies which prefer catching flying prey). Although predominantly using vision to locate their prey, adults may also make use of olfactory cues. No species are known to hunt at night, but some are crepuscular, perhaps taking advantage of newly hatched flies and other aquatic insects at a time when larger dragonflies are roosting. In tropical South America, helicopter damselflies (Pseudostigmatidae) feed on spiders, hovering near an orb web and plucking the spider, or its entangled prey, from the web. There are few pools and lakes in these habitats, and these damselflies breed in temporary water bodies in holes in trees, the rosettes of bromeliads and even the hollow stems of bamboos.

The nymphs of damselflies have been less researched than their dragonfly counterparts, and many have not even been identified. They choose their prey according to size and seem less able to overpower larger prey than can dragonfly nymphs. The major part of the diet of most species appears to be crustaceans such as water fleas.

===Ecology===
Damselflies exist in a range of habitats in and around the wetlands needed for their larval development; these include open spaces for finding mates, suitable perches, open aspect, roosting sites, suitable plant species for ovipositing and suitable water quality. Odonates have been used for bio-indication purposes regarding the quality of the ecosystem. Different species have different requirements for their larvae with regard to water depth, water movement and pH.
The European common blue damselfly (&quot;Enallagma cyathigerum&quot;) for example can occur at high densities in acid waters where fish are absent, such as in bog pools.
The scarce blue-tailed damselfly (&quot;Ischnura pumilio&quot;) in contrast requires base-rich habitats and water with a slow flow-rate. It is found in ditches, quarries, seeps, flushes, marshes and pools. It tolerates high levels of zinc and copper in the sediment but requires suitable emergent plants for egg-laying without the water being choked by plants. Damselflies&#x27; dependence on freshwater habitats makes them very vulnerable to damage to wetlands through drainage for agriculture or urban growth.

In the tropics, the helicopter damselfly &quot;Mecistogaster modesta&quot; (Pseudostigmatidae) breeds in phytotelmata, the small bodies of water trapped by bromeliads, epiphytic plants of the rainforest of northwest Costa Rica, at the high density of some 6000 larvae per hectare in patches of secondary forest. Another tropical species, the cascade damselfly &quot;Thaumatoneura inopinata&quot; (Megapodagrionidae), inhabits waterfalls in Costa Rica and Panama.

Damselflies, both nymphs and adults, are eaten by a range of predators including birds, fish, frogs, dragonflies, other damselflies, water spiders, water beetles, backswimmers and giant water bugs.

Damselflies have a variety of internal and external parasites. Particularly prevalent are the gregarine protozoans found in the gut. In a study of the European common blue damselfly, every adult insect was infected at the height of the flying season. When present in large numbers, these parasites can cause death by blocking the gut. Water mites Hydracarina are often seen on the outside of both nymphs and adults, and can move from one to the other at metamorphosis. They suck the body fluids and may actually kill young nymphs, but adults are relatively unaffected, it being necessary for the completion of the mite&#x27;s life cycle that it returns to water, a feat accomplished when the adult damselfly breeds.

=== Behaviour ===

Many damselflies have elaborate courtship behaviours. These are designed to show off the male&#x27;s distinctive characteristics, bright colouring or flying abilities, thus demonstrating his fitness. &quot;Calopteryx&quot; males will hover in front of a female with alternating fast and slow wingbeats; if she is receptive she will remain perched, otherwise she will fly off. The male river jewelwing (&quot;Calopteryx aequabilis&quot;) performs display flights in front of the female, fluttering his forewings while keeping his hindwings still, and raising his abdomen to reveal the white spots on his wings. &quot;Platycypha&quot; males will hover in front of a female, thrusting their bright white legs forward in front of their heads. Flattened tibia and bright leg colouring are seen in &quot;Platycnemis phasmovolans&quot; and a few other Platycnemididae, including the extinct &quot;Yijenplatycnemis huangi&quot;. &quot;Rhinocypha&quot; bobs up and down, often low over fast-flowing forested and shaded streams, displaying its bright-coloured body and wings. Some species (&quot;R. biceriata&quot;, &quot;R. humeralis&quot;) have a foot waggling behaviour: they thrust a leg forward and vibrate it towards ovipositing females while in flight. Vibrating the tibia is seen in &quot;Libellago semiopaca&quot; despite it lacking bright colouration on the tibia suggesting that foot waggling is a generalized excitary signal in Chlorocyphidae damselflies. Foot waggling has been observed in &quot;Calopteryx&quot; sp., &quot;Platycypha fitzsimonsi&quot;, and &quot;Platycypha caligata&quot;. Male members of the family Protoneuridae with vividly coloured wings display these to visiting females. Swift forktail (&quot;Ischnura erratica&quot;) males display to each other with their blue-tipped abdomens raised.

Other behaviours observed in damselflies include wing-warning, wing-clapping, flights of attrition and abdominal bobbing. Wing-warning is a rapid opening and closing of the wings and is aggressive, while wing-clapping involves a slower opening of the wings followed by a rapid closure, up to eight times in quick succession, and often follows flight; it may serve a thermo-regulatory function. Flights of attrition are engaged in by the ebony jewelwing (&quot;Calopteryx maculata&quot;) and involve males bouncing around each other while flying laterally and continuing to do so, sometimes over a considerable distance, until one insect is presumably exhausted and gives up. Characteristics of displays and coloration of males are suggested to be the common cues used by females to choose mates. In at least one species, &quot;Mnais costalis&quot;, males with more sunlight in their territories had higher wing-beat frequency and were more likely to mate. Females preferred &quot;hotter&quot; males because they would be on warmer territories for egg laying.

At night, damselflies usually roost in dense vegetation, perching with the abdomen alongside a stem. If disturbed they will move around to the other side of the stem but will not fly off. Spreadwings fully fold their wings when roosting. The desert shadowdamsel (&quot;Palaemnema domina&quot;) aggregates to roost in thick places near streams in the heat of the day. While there it engages in wing-clapping, the exact function of which is unknown. Some species such as the rubyspot damselfly, &quot;Hetaerina americana&quot;, form night roosting aggregations, with a preponderance of males; this may have an anti-predator function or may be simply the outcome of choosing safe roosting sites.

===Reproduction===

Mating in damselflies, as in dragonflies, is a complex, precisely choreographed process involving both indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. The male first has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2–3, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair fly in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or plant stem. The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male&#x27;s secondary genitalia, while the male uses his &quot;tail&quot; claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot;; the pair may also be described as being &quot;in cop&quot;. Males may transfer the sperm to their secondary genitalia either before a female is held, in the early stage when the female is held by the legs or after the female is held between the terminal claspers. This can lead to variations in the tandem postures. The spermatophore may also have nutrition in addition to sperms as a &quot;nuptial gift&quot;. Some cases of sexual cannibalism exist where females (of &quot;Ischnura graellsii&quot;) eat males while in copula.

Parthenogenesis (reproduction from unfertilised eggs) is exceptional, and has only been recorded in nature in female &quot;Ischnura hastata&quot; on the Azores Islands.
Egg-laying (ovipositing) involves not only the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but the male hovering above her, mate-guarding, or in some species continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, a form of sperm competition (the sperms of the last mated male have the greatest chance of fertilizing the eggs, also known as sperm precedence) made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up much of the time that a copulating pair remain in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.


All damselflies lay their eggs inside plant tissues; those that lay eggs underwater may submerge themselves for 30 minutes at a time, climbing along the stems of aquatic plants and laying eggs at intervals. For example, the red-eyed damselfly &quot;Erythromma najas&quot; lays eggs, in tandem, into leaves or stems of floating or sometimes emergent plants; in contrast, the scarce bluetail &quot;Ischnura pumilio&quot; oviposits alone, the female choosing mostly emergent grasses and rushes, and laying her eggs in their stems either above or just below the waterline. The willow emerald &quot;Chalcolestes viridis&quot; (a spreadwing) is unusual in laying eggs only in woody plant tissue, choosing thin twigs of trees that hang over water, and scarring the bark in the process. A possible exception is an apparent instance of ovo-viviparity, in which &quot;Heliocypha perforata&quot; was filmed in western China depositing young larvae (presumably hatched from eggs inside the female&#x27;s body) onto a partly submerged branch of a tree.

Many damselflies are able to produce more than one brood per year (voltinism); this is negatively correlated with latitude, becoming more common towards the equator, except in the Lestidae.

===Life cycle===
Damselflies are hemimetabolous insects that have no pupal stage in their development. The female inserts the eggs by means of her ovipositor into slits made in water plants or other underwater substrates and the larvae, known as naiads or nymphs, are almost all completely aquatic. Exceptions include the Hawaiian &quot;Megalagrion oahuense&quot; and an unidentified Megapodagrionid from New Caledonia, which are terrestrial in their early stages. The spreadwings lay eggs above the waterline late in the year and the eggs overwinter, often covered by snow. In spring they hatch out in the meltwater pools and the nymphs complete their development before these temporary pools dry up.


The nymphs are voracious predators and feed by means of a flat labium (a toothed mouthpart on the lower jaw) that forms the so-called mask; it is rapidly extended to seize and pierce the &quot;Daphnia&quot; (water fleas), mosquito larvae, and other small aquatic organisms on which damselfly nymphs feed. They breathe by means of three large external, fin-like gills on the tip of the abdomen, and these may also serve for locomotion in the same manner as a fish&#x27;s tail. Compared to dragonfly larvae, the nymphs show little variation in form. They tend to be slender and elongate, many having morphological adaptations for holding their position in fast flowing water. They are more sensitive than dragonfly nymphs to oxygen levels and suspended fine particulate matter, and do not bury themselves in the mud.

The nymphs proceed through about a dozen moults as they grow. In the later stages, the wing pads become visible. When fully developed, the nymphs climb out of the water and take up a firm stance, the skin on the thorax splits and the adult form wriggles out. This has a soft body at first and hangs or stands on its empty larval case. It pumps haemolymph into its small limp wings, which expand to their full extent. The haemolymph is then pumped back into the abdomen, which also expands fully. The exoskeleton hardens and the colours become more vivid over the course of the next few days. Most damselflies emerge in daytime, and in cool conditions the process takes several hours. On a hot day, the cuticle hardens rapidly and the adult can be flying away within half an hour.

==Conservation==
Conservation of Odonata has usually concentrated on the more iconic suborder Anisoptera, the dragonflies. However, the two suborders largely have the same needs, and what is good for dragonflies is also good for damselflies. The main threats experienced by odonates are the clearance of forests, the pollution of waterways, the lowering of groundwater levels, the damming of rivers for hydroelectric schemes and the general degradation of wetlands and marshes. The clearance of tropical rainforests is of importance because the rate of erosion increases, streams and pools dry up and waterways become clogged with silt. The presence of alien species can also have unintended consequences. In Hawaii, the introduction of the mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia affinis&quot;) was effective in controlling mosquitoes but nearly exterminated the island&#x27;s endemic damselflies. The ancient greenling &quot;Hemiphlebia mirabilis&quot; has been an important flagship species for conservation action in preserving its habitat in Australia.

==In culture==

Fishing flies that mimic damselfly nymphs are sometimes used in wet-fly fishing, where the hook and line are allowed to sink below the surface.

Damselflies have formed subjects for personal jewellery such as brooches since at least 1880.

&quot;Damselfly&quot; is a 2005 short film directed by Ben O&#x27;Connor.

&quot;Damselfly&quot; is the title of a 2012 novel in the &quot;Faeble&quot; series by S. L. Naeole and of a 2018 novel by Chandra Prasad.

Modern poems with the damselfly as a subject include a 1994 poem by August Kleinzahler, which contains the lines &quot;And that blue there, cobalt / a moment, then iridescent, / fragile as a lady&#x27;s pin / hovering above the nasturtium?&quot; The poet John Engels published “Damselfly, Trout, Heron” in his 1983 collection &quot;Weather-Fear: New and Selected Poems&quot;.

<text>Billi 99 is a four-issue comic book limited series published by Dark Horse Comics in 1991, which was later reprinted in 2002. It was written by Sarah Byam and illustrated by Tim Sale. It is among Tim Sale&#x27;s earliest published work.

The tag line for &quot;Billi 99&quot;, as seen in comic ads in Fall 1991, reads, &quot;It&#x27;s 1999... Do You Know Where Your Civil Rights Are? Billi 99 A Prayer in Four Parts&quot;. The story was inspired by Byam&#x27;s experiences in Detroit in the 1980s, a love of the heroic stories and pessimism over the reactionary political movements of the time.

A second collected edition was recently reprinted and sold in English, Spanish, and Italian; and distributed throughout Europe, the U.S., and Canada.

<text>Swamp Thing is a superhero and antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson, the Swamp Thing has had several different incarnations throughout his publication. The character first appeared in &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century. The character found perhaps its greatest popularity during the original 1970s Wein/Wrightson run and in the mid-late 1980s during a highly acclaimed run under Alan Moore, Stephen Bissette, and John Totleben. Swamp Thing would also go on to become one of the staples of the Justice League Dark, a team featuring magical superheroes. 

The character is often depicted as a swamp monster that resembles an anthropomorphic mound of vegetable matter seeking to protect nature and humanity from threats of both scientific and supernatural origin. These duties are often an expression of his designation as the Avatar of the Green, an illustrious title depicted as synonymous with both Swamp Thing and makes the character the embodiment of the cosmic energies that gives life to all plant life in the known universe, often dubbed &quot;The Green&quot;. Several incarnations arise from the consciousness of other beings who are selected as the champion of the Parliament of Trees, the guiding and collective consciousness of all plant life, which includes past incarnations of Swamp Thing. Swamp Thing is also often in an elemental conflict with both rivals within the Green (i.e Floronic Man), rival elemental forces, such as &quot;The Red&quot; (embodies all animal life, including humanity), and most notably &quot;The Rot&quot; or &quot;The Black&quot; (embodies death), with their archnemesis being Anton Arcane. 

The original version of the character is Alexander Olsen, a scientist who was killed by his assistant vying for the affections of his wife. Returning as a swamp creature, he confronts his assistant and kills him in revenge but his wife runs off, unable to recognize him. He later becomes a local legend in Louisiana. His successor, [[Alec Holland]], is the second and most well regarded version of the character. A chemist who dies following the creation of a scientific formula capable of stimulating plant life in hostile environment to criminal or malevolent elements. Stories vary in his being, sometimes a plant creature believing himself to be Alec possessing his memories while later stories make him the genuine Alec who transforms into the Swamp Thing. This version is also a reluctant ally of John Constantine and a later member of the Justice League Dark, considered a powerhouse among their ranks.

In 2021, a new incarnation of Swamp Thing is created. This version is Levi Kamei, a young Indian scientist chosen as the new Swamp Thing at a young age. Descended from a tribunal connected to the Kaziranga wetlands, his powers awaken following a altercation between the community and employers, which also resulted in the death. Following his awakening, various factions seeking to control the new Swamp Thing for their own nefarious agenda. Kamei is guided by Alec and fellow scientist Jennifer Reece in his new role. Existing concurrently with the Alec version, this Swamp Thing is instead more prominently a member of the Titans.

The character has been adapted from the comics into several forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. The character made his live-action debut in the film &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982), with Dick Durock playing the Swamp Thing, while Ray Wise played Alec Holland. Durock played both Swamp Thing and Holland in the sequel film &quot;The Return of Swamp Thing&quot; (1989). Durock reprised the role again in the television series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1990). The Swamp Thing was played by Derek Mears with Andy Bean playing Alec Holland in the television series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (2019). Another live-action film adaptation, titled &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, is in development as an installment of the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise. IGN ranked him 28th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes list.

==Concept and creation==
Len Wein came up with the idea for the character while riding a subway in Queens. He later recalled: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a title for it, so I kept referring to it as &#x27;that swamp thing I&#x27;m working on&#x27;. And that&#x27;s how it got its name!&quot; Bernie Wrightson designed the character&#x27;s visual image, using a rough sketch by Wein as a guideline.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===
Len Wein was the writer for the first 13 issues, before David Michelinie and Gerry Conway finished up the series. Burgeoning horror artist Bernie Wrightson drew the first 10 issues of the series, while Nestor Redondo drew a further 13 issues, the last issue being drawn by Fred Carrillo. The original creative team worked closely together; Wrightson recalled that during story conferences, Wein would walk around the office acting out all of the parts. The Swamp Thing fought against evil as he sought the men who murdered his wife and caused his monstrous transformation, as well as searching for a means to transform back into his human form.

The Swamp Thing has since fought many villains. Though they only met twice during the first series, the mad scientist Anton Arcane (with his obsession with gaining immortality) became the Swamp Thing&#x27;s nemesis, even as the Swamp Thing developed a close bond with Arcane&#x27;s niece Abigail Arcane. Arcane was aided by his nightmarish army of Un-Men and the Patchwork Man, alias Arcane&#x27;s brother Gregori Arcane who, after a land mine explosion, was rebuilt as a Frankenstein Monster-type creature by his brother. Also involved in the conflict was the Swamp Thing&#x27;s close friend-turned-enemy Lt. Matthew Joseph Cable, a federal agent who
originally mistakenly believed the Swamp Thing to be responsible for the deaths of Alec and Linda Holland.

As sales figures plummeted towards the end of the series, the writers attempted to revive interest by introducing fantastical creatures, aliens, and even Alec Holland&#x27;s brother, Edward (a character that was never referred to again by later writers) into the picture.

The last two issues saw the Swamp Thing transformed back into Alec Holland and having to fight one last menace as an ordinary human. The series was cancelled with issue #24 and a blurb for a 25th issue containing an upcoming encounter with Hawkman led nowhere. Alec Holland&#x27;s transformation back into the Swamp Thing was covered in &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; #81-87, within which the Swamp Thing is enlisted by the titular team to fight the Lovecraftian cosmic threat M&#x27;nagalah, whom the Swamp Thing had encountered during Wein&#x27;s run.

===&quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; and Volume 2===

In 1982, DC Comics revived the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series, attempting to capitalize on the summer 1982 release of the Wes Craven film of the same name. A revival had been planned for 1978, but was a victim of the DC Implosion. The new series, called &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot;, featured an adaptation of the Craven film in its first annual. Now written by Martin Pasko, the book loosely picked up after the Swamp Thing&#x27;s guest appearances in &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; #81-87, &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #8, and &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #172, with the character wandering around the swamps of Louisiana seen as an urban legend and feared by locals. Pasko&#x27;s main arc depicted the Swamp Thing roaming the globe, trying to stop a young girl (and the possible Anti-Christ) named Karen Clancy from destroying the world.

When Pasko had to give up work on the title due to increasing television commitments, editor Len Wein assigned the title to British writer Alan Moore. When Karen Berger took over as editor, she gave Moore free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit. Moore reconfigured the Swamp Thing&#x27;s origin to make him a true monster, as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside most of the supporting cast that Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer and brought the Sunderland Corporation to the forefront, as they hunted the Swamp Thing down and &quot;killed&quot; him in a hail of bullets. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland transformed into a plant, but actually a wholly plant-based entity created upon the death of Alec Holland, having somehow absorbed duplicates of Holland&#x27;s consciousness and memories into himself. He is described as &quot;a plant that thought it was Alec Holland, a plant that was trying its level best to &quot;be&quot; Alec Holland&quot;. This is explained as a result of the plant matter of the swamp absorbing Holland&#x27;s bio-restorative formula, with the Swamp Thing&#x27;s appearance being the plants&#x27; attempt to duplicate Holland&#x27;s human form. This revelation resulted in the Swamp Thing suffering a temporary mental breakdown and identity crisis, but he eventually re-asserted himself in time to stop the latest scheme of the Floronic Man.

Issue #32 was a strange twist of comedy and tragedy, as the Swamp Thing encounters an alien version of Pogo, Walt Kelly&#x27;s character.

Moore would later reveal, in an attempt to connect the original one-off Swamp Thing story from &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #92 to the main &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; canon, that there had been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Swamp Things since the dawn of humanity, and that all versions of the creature were designated defenders of the Parliament of Trees, an elemental community which rules a dimension known as &quot;the Green&quot; that connects all plant life on Earth. Moore&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; broadened the scope of the series to include ecological and spiritual concerns while retaining its horror-fantasy roots. In issue #37, Moore formally introduced the character of John Constantine the Hellblazer as a magician/con artist who would lead the Swamp Thing on the &quot;American Gothic&quot; storyline. Alan Moore also introduced the concept of the DC characters Cain and Abel being the mystical reincarnations of the Biblical Cain and Abel caught in an endless cycle of murder and resurrection.

&quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; was the first mainstream comic book series to completely abandon the Comics Code Authority&#x27;s approval.

With issue #65, regular penciler Rick Veitch took over from Moore and began scripting the series, continuing the story in a roughly similar vein for 24 more issues. Veitch&#x27;s term ended in 1989 due to a widely publicized creative dispute, when DC refused to publish issue #88 because of the use of Jesus Christ as a character, despite having previously approved the script in which the Swamp Thing is a cupbearer who offers Jesus water when he calls for it from the cross. The series was handed to Doug Wheeler, who made the cup that the Shining Knight believed to be the Holy Grail to be a cup used in a religious ceremony by a Neanderthal tribe that was about to be wiped out by Cro-Magnons, in the published version of issue #88. Beginning in issue #90, Wheeler reintroduced Matango, a character that Stephen Bissette had introduced in &quot;Swamp Thing Annual&quot; #4.

After a period of high creative turnover, in 1991 DC sought to revive interest in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; by bringing horror writer Nancy A. Collins on board to write the series. Starting with &quot;Swamp Thing Annual&quot; #6, Collins moved on to write &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 2) #110–138, dramatically overhauling the series by restoring the pre-Alan Moore tone and incorporating a new set of supporting cast members into the book. Collins resurrected Anton Arcane, along with the Sunderland Corporation, as foils for the Swamp Thing. Her stories tended to be ecologically based and at one point featured giant killer flowers.

With issue #140 (March 1994), the title was handed over to Grant Morrison for a four-issue story arc, co-written by the then-unknown Mark Millar. As Collins had destroyed the status quo of the series, Morrison sought to shake the book up with a four-part storyline which had the Swamp Thing plunged into a nightmarish dreamworld scenario where he was split into two separate beings: Alec Holland and the Swamp Thing, which was now a mindless being of pure destruction. Millar then took over from Morrison with issue #144, and launched what was initially conceived as an ambitious 25-part storyline where the Swamp Thing would be forced to go upon a series of trials against rival elemental forces. Millar brought the series to a close with issue #171 in a finale where the Swamp Thing becomes the master of all elemental forces, including the planet.

===Volume 3===
Written by Brian K. Vaughan and drawn by Roger Petersen and Giuseppe Camuncoli in 2001, the third &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series focused on the daughter of the Swamp Thing, Tefé Holland. Even though she was chronologically 11–12, the series had Tefé aged into the body of an 18-year-old with a mindwipe orchestrated by the Swamp Thing. Constantine and Abby try to control her darker impulses, brought about by her exposure to the Parliament of Trees. Due to the circumstances under which she was conceived, the Swamp Thing, possessing John Constantine, was not aware that he was given a blood transfusion by a demon. She held power over both plants and flesh.

Believing herself to be a normal human girl named Mary who had miraculously recovered from cancer three years prior, she rediscovers her powers and identity when she finds her boyfriend and best friend betraying her on prom night. In a moment of anger, her powers manifest and she kills them both. Tefé then fakes her own death and embarks on a series of misadventures that take her across the country, and ultimately to Africa, in search of a mythical &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot;.

During this series, it seems that the Swamp Thing and Abigail have reunited as lovers and are living in their old home in the Louisiana swamps outside Houma. The home in which they live more closely resembles the one that the Swamp Thing constructs for Abigail during the Moore run than the home in which they dwell during the Collins run. In a confrontation with Tefé, the Swamp Thing explains that he has cut himself off from the Green and there seems to be no trace of the god-like powers he acquired from the Parliaments of Air, Waves, Stone or Flames during the Millar run. Also, Vaughan&#x27;s Swamp Thing does not seem to have been divorced from the humanity of his Alec Holland self. The disconnection between these two entities becomes a plot point in Volume 4.

===Volume 4===
A fourth series began in 2004, with writers Andy Diggle (#1–6), Will Pfeifer (#7–8) and Joshua Dysart (#9–29). In this latest series, the Swamp Thing is reverted to his plant-based Earth elemental status after the first story line, and he attempts to live an &quot;eventless&quot; life in the Louisiana swamps. Tefé, likewise, is rendered powerless and mortal. Issue #29 was intended to be the final issue of the fourth volume, which was cancelled due to low sales numbers.

===Return to the DC Universe===
====&quot;Brightest Day&quot;====

The conclusion of the crossover event &quot;Brightest Day&quot; revealed that the Swamp Thing had become corrupted by the personality of the villain Nekron in the wake of the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover event. The Swamp Thing now believed himself to be Nekron, similar to how he had once believed himself to be Alec Holland. The Swamp Thing went on a rampage in Star City, ultimately seeking to destroy all life on Earth. The Entity within the White Lantern used several heroes, including Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, the Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and Deadman to slow the rampage and to construct a new Swamp Thing based on the body of Alec Holland. Instead of merely &quot;thinking&quot; that it was Holland, this version of the Swamp Thing would actually &quot;be&quot; him. The new Swamp Thing defeated and killed the corrupted and original Swamp Thing. The Swamp Thing then restored life to natural areas around the world and declared that those who hurt the Green would face his wrath. He also restored Aquaman, Firestorm, Hawkman, and the Martian Manhunter to normal. The book ended with the Swamp Thing killing several businessmen who engaged in deliberate, illegal polluting activities.

====&quot;Brightest Day Aftermath: The Search for the Swamp Thing&quot;====
This three–issue miniseries follows immediately after the events of &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, and follows the actions of John Constantine as he tries to work out what has changed with the Swamp Thing and track him down, with the assistance of Zatanna, the Batman, and Superman.

===Volume 5===
DC Comics relaunched &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; with issue #1 in September 2011 as part of &quot;The New 52&quot;, with writer Scott Snyder (#1-18 and &quot;Annual&quot;). Snyder&#x27;s run concluded with &quot;Rotworld&quot;, a crossover event between &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.&quot; Charles Soule wrote issues #19-40.

===Volume 6===
A six–issue miniseries written by Len Wein, co-creator of the Swamp Thing, with art by Kelley Jones was released between March and August 2016. It follows Swamp Thing giving up his powers to Anton Arcane, who is disguised as Matt Cable.

This was followed by a critically acclaimed Tom King winter special in 2018, also featuring Len Wein&#x27;s last Swamp Thing issue.

===&quot;The Swamp Thing&quot;===
A 16-issue miniseries retitled with &quot;The&quot; written by Ram V with art by Mike Perkins began publication in March 2021. The book focuses on a new character named Levi Kami taking up the Swamp Thing mantle while the second Swamp Thing, Alec Holland, is off-world. Originally planned as a 10-issue miniseries, &quot;The Swamp Thing&quot; has been extended to 16 issues, with &quot;The Swamp Thing&quot; #10 followed by a short hiatus before returning in March 2022.

== Character overview ==

=== Levi Kamei ===
The latest version of Swamp Thing&#x27;s secret identity is Levi Kamei, an immigrant scientist from India specializing in biology.

== Powers and abilities ==

=== Alec Holland&#x27;s powers and abilities ===

==Other versions==

=== Past incarnations ===
*Allan Hallman: Alan Hallman was selected by the Parliament of Trees to be the planet&#x27;s Earth elemental before Alec Holland became the Swamp Thing. He had been a scientist working on a formula to repair damaged crops when the Parliament chose him, and he died in flames, as all Earth elementals must. While traversing the Green, he was captured within a creature of the Grey, which broke him down and converted him into fungus and mold. He was recreated as an emissary of the Grey by Matango, who gathered Hallman&#x27;s consciousness back together in his Chamber of Dreams. With Matango&#x27;s return from Hell, Alan Hallman was released into the Green to find and capture the Swamp Thing and his daughter Tefé and force them to surrender their individuality to the Grey.

* Albert Höllerer: Albert Hollerer is a German airplane pilot who fought in World War II and was shot down over a bog in 1942. In the wake of his death in which he was burned alive, he became the Swamp Thing of that era.

* Calbraith A. H. Rodgers: Calbraith A. H. Rodgers was born in England in 1920. Ever since he was a boy, he had heard whispers from the leaves, the flowers and the trees that something great and terrible would be waiting for him on the other side. Afraid of what would be waiting for him on the other side of death, he enlisted in the Royal Air Force to try and escape the pull of the Green. On May 3, 1942, on his fourth mission as a pilot during World War II, his plane was shot down. Landing in a swamp, the dying Rodgers felt the branches and petals reaching for him, delivering him to his new life as the protector of the Green. By fusing the man with the Green in the final moments of his life, the Swamp Thing was created.

* Lady Weeds: A predecessor of the Swamp Thing prior to avatars commonly adopting the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; codename denoting their status. A Victorian era avatar active in the 1800s, she was known to be a particularly ruthless avatar who slayed all her rivals and managed to convince the Green to cease by first killing their latest rival who originated from Ireland before causing the Great Potato Famine, a symbolic gesture of her power. Recognizing her strength, they cease pitting rivals against her in her time.

<text>William Hope Hodgson (15 November 1877 – 19 April 1918) was an English author. He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the &quot;Sargasso Sea Stories&quot;. His novels, such as &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; (1908) and &quot;The Night Land&quot; (1912), feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. Early in his writing career Hodgson dedicated effort to poetry, although few of his poems were published during his lifetime. He also attracted some notice as a photographer and achieved renown as a bodybuilder. He died in World War I at age 40.

==Life==
===Early years and life at sea===
Hodgson was born in the hamlet of Blackmore End near Braintree in Essex, the son of the Reverend Samuel Hodgson, an Anglican priest, and Lissie Sarah Brown. He was the second of 12 children, three of whom died in infancy. The death of a child is a theme in several of Hodgson&#x27;s works including the short stories &quot;The Valley of Lost Children&quot;, &quot;The Sea-Horses&quot;, and &quot;The Searcher of the End House&quot;.

Hodgson&#x27;s father was moved frequently and served 11 different parishes in 21 years, including one in Ardrahan, County Galway, Ireland. This setting was later featured in Hodgson&#x27;s novel &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot;.

Hodgson ran away from his boarding school at age 13, in an effort to become a sailor. He was caught and returned to his family, but eventually received his father&#x27;s permission to be apprenticed as a cabin boy and began a four-year apprenticeship in 1891. Hodgson&#x27;s father died shortly thereafter, of throat cancer, leaving the family impoverished; while William was away, the family subsisted largely on charity. After his apprenticeship ended in 1895, Hodgson began two years of study in Liverpool and was then able to pass the tests and receive his mate&#x27;s certificate; he then began several more years as a sailor.

At sea, Hodgson experienced bullying. This led him to begin a programme of personal training. According to Sam Moskowitz,

The primary motivation of his body development was not health, but self-defence. His relatively short height and sensitive, almost beautiful face made him an irresistible target for bullying seamen. When they moved in to pulverize him, they would learn too late that they had come to grips with easily one of the most powerful men, pound for pound, in all England.

The theme of bullying of an apprentice by older seamen, and revenge taken, appeared frequently in his sea stories.

While away at sea, in addition to his exercises with weights and with a punching bag, Hodgson also practised his photography, taking photographs of aurora borealis, cyclones, lightning, sharks, and the maggots that infested the food given to sailors. He also built up a stamp collection, practised his marksmanship while hunting, and kept journals of his experiences at sea. In November 1898, he was awarded the Royal Humane Society medal for heroism for saving another sailor who, in March of the same year, had fallen from the topmast into the sea in shark-infested waters off the coast of New Zealand.

===Physical culture, essays and poetry===
In 1899, at age 22, he opened a School of Physical Culture in Ainsworth Street, Blackburn, England, as &quot;the inventor and teacher of a system that will cure indigestion&quot;. The School offered tailored exercise regimes for personal training. Among his customers were members of the Blackburn police force. In 1902, Hodgson himself appeared on stage with handcuffs and other restraining devices supplied by the Blackburn police department and applied the restraints to Harry Houdini, who had previously escaped from the Blackburn jail. His behaviour towards Houdini generated controversy; the escape artist had some difficulty removing his restraints, complaining that Hodgson had deliberately injured him and jammed the locks of his handcuffs.

Hodgson was not shy of publicity, and in another notable stunt, rode a bicycle down a street so steep that it had stairs, an event written up in the local paper. Despite his reputation, he eventually found that he could not earn a living running his personal training business, which was seasonal in nature, and shut it down. He began instead writing articles such as &quot;Physical Culture versus Recreative Exercises&quot; (published in 1903). One of these articles, &quot;Health from Scientific Exercise&quot;, featured photographs of Hodgson himself demonstrating his exercises. The market for such articles seemed to be limited, however; so, inspired by authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Arthur Conan Doyle, Hodgson turned his attention to fiction, publishing his first short story, &quot;The Goddess of Death&quot;, in 1904, followed shortly by &quot;A Tropical Horror&quot; (1905). He also contributed to an article in &quot;The Grand Magazine&quot;, taking the &quot;No&quot; side in a debate on the topic &quot;Is the Mercantile Navy Worth Joining?&quot; In this piece, Hodgson laid out in detail his negative experiences at sea, including facts and figures about salaries. This led to a second article in &quot;The Nautical Magazine&quot;, an exposé on the subject of apprenticeships; at the time, families often were forced to pay to have boys accepted as apprentices. Hodgson began to give paid lectures, illustrated with his photography in the form of colorized slides, about his experiences at sea.

Although he wrote a number of poems, only a handful were published during his lifetime; several, such as &quot;Madre Mia&quot; (1907), appeared as dedications to his novels. Apparently cynical about the prospects of publishing his poetry, in 1906 he published an article in &quot;The Author&quot; magazine, suggesting that poets could earn money by writing inscriptions for tombstones. Many of his poems were published by his widow in two posthumous collections, but some 48 poems were not published until their appearance in the collection &quot;The Lost Poetry of William Hope Hodgson&quot; (2005).

===Career in fiction, and marriage===

Hodgson&#x27;s first short story was &quot;The Goddess of Death&quot; (1904), in which he utilised a statue of Flora which stood in Corporation Park, Blackburn, as the focus of a tale in which a Hindu statue, seized from an Indian temple, stood in a small English town. The statue comes alive to take its revenge on the people who stole it. &quot;The Royal Magazine&quot; published the story in April 1904.

In 1906, the American magazine &quot;The Monthly Story Magazine&quot; published &quot;From the Tideless Sea&quot;, the first of Hodgson&#x27;s Sargasso Sea stories. Hodgson continued to sell stories to American magazines as well as British magazines for the remainder of his career, carefully managing the rights to his work in order to maximize his remuneration.

While he still lived with his mother in relative poverty, his first published novel, &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot;, appeared in 1907, to positive reviews. Hodgson also published &quot;The Voice in the Night&quot; the same year, as well as &quot;Through the Vortex of a Cyclone&quot;, a realistic story inspired by Hodgson&#x27;s experiences at sea and illustrated with tinted slides made from his own photographs; Hodgson had previously used these slides to illustrate a &quot;lantern lecture&quot; entitled &quot;Through the Heart of a Cyclone&quot;, which he had given at the Trinity Wesleyan School in Montague Street, Blackburn, on 16 November 1906. Hodgson also explored the subject of ships and cyclones in his story &quot;The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder&quot; (1908). Also in 1908, Hodgson published his second novel, &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot;, again to positive reviews, as well as an unusual satirical science fiction story, &quot;Date 1965: Modern Warfare&quot;, a Swiftian satire in which it is suggested that war should be carried out by men fighting in pens with knives, and the corpses carefully salvaged for food, although in letters to the editor published at the time, Hodgson expressed strong patriotic sentiments.

In 1909, he published &quot;Out of the Storm&quot;, a short horror story about &quot;the death-side of the sea&quot;, in which the protagonist drowning in a storm rants about the horrors of a storm at sea. According to Moskowitz,

This story proved an emotional testament beyond all other evidence. Hodgson, whose literary success would be in a large measure based on the impressions he received at sea, actually hated and feared the waters with an intensity that was the passion of his life.

Also in 1909, Hodgson published another novel, &quot;The Ghost Pirates&quot;. In the foreword, he wrote that it

... completes what, perhaps, may be termed a trilogy; for, though very different in scope, each of the three books deals with certain conceptions that have an elemental kinship. With this book, the author believes that he closes the door, so far as he is concerned, on a particular phase of constructive thought.

&quot;The Bookman&quot; magazine in its review of the novel in 1909 concluded with the comment:

We can only hope that Mr. Hodgson may be induced to reconsider his decision, for we know of nothing like the author&#x27;s previous work in the whole of present-day literature.

Despite the critical success of his novels, Hodgson remained relatively poor. To try to bolster his income from short story sales, he began working on the first of his recurring characters, Thomas Carnacki, featured in several of his most famous stories and partly inspired by Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s occult detective John Silence. The first of these, &quot;The Gateway of the Monster&quot;, was published in &quot;The Idler&quot; (1910). In 1910, Hodgson also published &quot;The Captain of the Onion Boat&quot;, an unusual story that combines a nautical tale and a romance. He continued to publish many stories and non-fiction pieces, occasionally resorting to the use of recycled plot elements and situations, sometimes to the annoyance of his publishers.

His last novel to see publication, &quot;The Night Land&quot;, was published in 1912, although it likely had its genesis a number of years earlier. Hodgson also worked on a 10,000-word novelette version of the novel, now known as &quot;The Dream of X&quot; (1912). He continued to branch out into related genres, publishing &quot;Judge Barclay&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a Western adventure, in the United States, as well as several non-supernatural mystery stories and the science fiction story &quot;The Derelict&quot; (1912), and even war stories (several of the Captain Gault tales feature wartime themes).

In 1912, Hodgson married Betty Farnworth, known also as Bessie, a girl from Cheadle Hulme and a staff member who wrote the &quot;agony&quot; column for the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Home Notes&quot;. Both were 35. She gave up her job after they married on 26 February 1913, in the London borough of Kensington. They moved to the south of France and took up residence there, owing in part to the low cost of living. Hodgson began a work entitled &quot;Captain Dang (An account of certain peculiar and somewhat memorable adventures)&quot; and continued to publish stories in multiple genres, although financial security continued to elude him. When war broke out in Europe, the Hodgsons returned to England.

===Later life, World War I experience===

Hodgson joined the University of London&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Refusing to have anything to do with the sea despite his experience and Third Mate&#x27;s certificate, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 3 July 1915. In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge on 10 June 1916, and returned to writing.

Refusing to remain on the sidelines of WWI, Hodgson recovered sufficiently to re-enlist, receiving a new commission as second lieutenant on 18 March 1917. On 10 October 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant, though this was not gazetted until after his death. His published articles and stories from the time reflect his experience in war.

===Death===
Hodgson was killed by the direct impact of an artillery shell at the Fourth Battle of Ypres in April 1918; sources suggest either the 17th or 19th. He was eulogized in &quot;The Times&quot; on 2 May 1918. The American magazine &quot;Adventure&quot;, to which Hodgson had contributed fiction, also ran an obituary which reprinted a clipping from his widow, describing how Hodgson led a group of
NCOs to safety under heavy fire.

==Most famous works==
Hodgson is most widely known for two works. &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; (1908) is a novel of which H. P. Lovecraft, in his long essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;, wrote &quot;but for a few touches of commonplace sentimentality [it] would be a classic of the first water&quot;. &quot;The Night Land&quot; (1912) is a much longer novel, written in an archaic style and expressing a sombre vision of a sunless far-future world; Lovecraft described it as &quot;one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written&quot;. These works both contain elements of science fiction, although they also partake of horror and the occult. According to critical consensus, in these works, despite his often laboured and clumsy language, Hodgson achieves a deep power of expression which focuses on a sense not only of terror but as well of the ubiquity of &quot;potential&quot; terror, of the thinness of the invisible boundary between the world of normality and an underlying, unaccountable reality for which humans are not suited.

&quot;The Ghost Pirates&quot; (1909) has less of a reputation than &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot;, but is an effective seafaring horror story of a ship attacked and ultimately dragged down to its doom by supernatural creatures. The book purports to be the spoken testimony of the sole survivor, and the style lacks the pseudo-archaism which makes &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Night Land&quot; tedious reading for many.

Hodgson is also known for his short stories featuring recurring characters: the &quot;detective of the occult&quot; Thomas Carnacki, and the smuggler Captain Gault. The Carnacki story &quot;The Whistling Room&quot; has been reprinted in numerous anthologies, including collections introduced by Alfred Hitchcock. Hodgson&#x27;s single most famous short story is probably &quot;The Voice in the Night&quot; (1907), which has been adapted for film twice. Another story regarded highly by critics is &quot;The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder&quot;.

Hodgson&#x27;s work is said to have had an influence on H.P. Lovecraft, even though Lovecraft did not read his works until 1934. In a 2009 essay, China Miéville traces the origin of &quot;the tentacle&quot; as an object of horror to Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot;, but the motif had already been used by M. R. James in &quot;Count Magnus&quot;, which Lovecraft first read shortly before employing the motif.

==Literary influence==
After his death, Hodgson&#x27;s work was largely forgotten. In the 1930s, however, Hodgson&#x27;s supernatural fiction was anthologised in both Colin de la Mare&#x27;s &quot;They Walk Again&quot; (1931) and Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s &quot;A Century of Horror Stories&quot; (1935); this began a revival of interest in Hodgson&#x27;s work.

In 1934, Herman Charles Koenig, a book collector who was friends with H. P. Lovecraft, introduced Lovecraft and his friends to Hodgson&#x27;s weird fiction books. Lovecraft responded to the books with enthusiasm and praised Hodgson in the second edition of his essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;. Other writers in the &quot;Lovecraft circle&quot;, including Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth and Fritz Leiber, also read and expressed admiration for Hodgson&#x27;s work. In the late 1940s Derleth&#x27;s Arkham House published two omnibus editions of Hodgson&#x27;s work, &quot;The House on the Borderland and Other Novels&quot; and an expanded edition of &quot;Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder&quot;. These books helped popularise Hodgson&#x27;s work in the United States.

Hodgson&#x27;s work was inspirational to many science fiction and fantasy writers. In Britain, Adrian Ross, Olaf Stapledon and Dennis Wheatley were all influenced by Hodgson&#x27;s work. Across the Atlantic, Clark Ashton Smith and Henry S. Whitehead were also influenced by Hodgson&#x27;s writings. Modern authors who cite Hodgson as an influence include Iain Sinclair, Gene Wolfe, Greg Bear, China Miéville, Simon Clark, Elizabeth Massie, Tim Lebbon, and Brian Keene.

==Hodgson&#x27;s literary estate==
Hodgson&#x27;s widow, Bessie, worked to keep his books in print and to publish works he was not able to get published during his lifetime, including two books of poetry. After Bessie Hodgson died in 1943, Hodgson&#x27;s sister Lissie took over his literary estate.

While the first six Carnacki stories were collected during Hodgson&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;The Haunted Jarvee&quot; appeared posthumously in 1929, and two more Carnacki stories, &quot;The Find&quot; and &quot;The Hog,&quot; were published in 1947 by August Derleth.

One Captain Gault story, &quot;The Plans of the Reefing Bi-Plane&quot;, was not published until 1996, when it was included in the short story collection &quot;Terrors of the Sea&quot;.

Some of Hodgson&#x27;s poems were first published in 2005, when they appeared in &quot;The Lost Poetry of William Hope Hodgson&quot;.

A number of other Hodgson works are reprinted for the first time since their original publication in the five-volume &quot;Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson&quot; series published by Night Shade Books.

Copyright protection has now expired on most of Hodgson&#x27;s work, , including many of his poems.

*&quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; (1908)
*&quot;The Ghost Pirates&quot; (1909)
*&quot;The Night Land&quot; (1912)

*&quot;The House on the Borderland and Other Novels&quot; (1946) (a posthumous collection of Hodgson&#x27;s four major novels)
*&quot;Captain Dang&quot; (unfinished)

===Order of writing versus order of publication===
Sam Gafford, in his 1997 essay &quot;Writing Backwards: The Novels of William Hope Hodgson&quot; has suggested that Hodgson&#x27;s four major novels may have been published in roughly the reverse order of their writing. If this is true, then &quot;The Night Land&quot; was Hodgson&#x27;s first novel, in which he poured out his imagination at its most unbridled, and not his last. Gafford writes:

This concern over the order of composition of the novels may seem of little importance until we consider the implications toward Hodgson&#x27;s work overall. .. in effect, Hodgson moved away from &quot;TNL&quot; quasi-science fiction scenario (which contained an astounding number of original conceptions) and toward &quot;BoGC&quot;&#x27;s more basic adventure slant.

If we accept Gafford&#x27;s thesis, then Hodgson actually wrote &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot; last, and it benefits from the modernization of style to the point where it is Hodgson&#x27;s most accessible novel:

When he finishes the group with &quot;BoGC&quot;, Hodgson has managed to rid himself of these affectations of style and produces a book written in a flat but serviceable tone. With each book, Hodgson learns better control of language and more writing savvy and eventually begins to develop his own voice.

But despite the excessively archaic prose style, which does make them less approachable, it is actually Hodgson&#x27;s earlier works that are considered masterpieces today. And as Gafford says:

...we can only wonder what wonderfully imaginative excesses like &quot;The Night Land&quot; may have been lost because of an unappreciative public.

<doc id="65020" wikidata="Q23836" url="?curid=65020" title="Adapter pattern">
<text>In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

An example is an adapter that converts the interface of a Document Object Model of an XML document into a tree structure that can be displayed.

==Overview==
The adapter design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known Gang of Four design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

The adapter design pattern solves problems like:
* How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?
* How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?
* How can an alternative interface be provided for a class?

Often an (already existing) class can not be reused only because its interface does not conform to the interface clients require.

The adapter design pattern describes how to solve such problems:
* Define a separate codice_1 class that converts the (incompatible) interface of a class (codice_2) into another interface (codice_3) clients require.
* Work through an codice_1 to work with (reuse) classes that do not have the required interface.

The key idea in this pattern is to work through a separate codice_1 that adapts the interface of an (already existing) class without changing it.

Clients don&#x27;t know whether they work with a codice_3 class directly or through an codice_1 with a class that does not have the codice_3 interface.

See also the UML class diagram below.

== Definition ==
An adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real-world definition for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should suit the need. The adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.

== Usage ==
An adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. Alternatively, a decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time, and a facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.
==Structure==
=== UML class diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, the codice_9 class that requires a codice_3 interface cannot reuse the codice_2 class directly because its interface doesn&#x27;t conform to the codice_3 interface.
Instead, the codice_9 works through an codice_1 class that implements the codice_3 interface in terms of codice_2:

* The codice_17 way implements the codice_3 interface by delegating to an codice_2 object at run-time (codice_20). 
* The codice_21 way implements the codice_3 interface by inheriting from an codice_2 class at compile-time (codice_24).

===Object adapter pattern===
In this adapter pattern, the adapter contains an instance of the class it wraps. In this situation, the adapter makes calls to the instance of the wrapped object.


===Class adapter pattern===
This adapter pattern uses multiple polymorphic interfaces implementing or inheriting both the interface that is expected and the interface that is pre-existing. It is typical for the expected interface to be created as a pure interface class, especially in languages such as Java (before JDK 1.8) that do not support multiple inheritance of classes.


===A further form of runtime adapter pattern===
====Motivation from compile time solution====
It is desired for to supply with some data, let us suppose some data. A compile time solution is:
classB.setStringData(classA.getStringData());
However, suppose that the format of the string data must be varied. A compile time solution is to use inheritance:
public class Format1ClassA extends ClassA {
 @Override
 public String getStringData() {
 return format(toString());
}
and perhaps create the correctly &quot;formatting&quot; object at runtime by means of the factory pattern.
====Run-time adapter solution====
A solution using &quot;adapters&quot; proceeds as follows:

===Implementation of the adapter pattern===
When implementing the adapter pattern, for clarity, one can apply the class name to the provider implementation; for example, . It should have a constructor method with an adaptee class variable as a parameter. This parameter will be passed to an instance member of . When the clientMethod is called, it will have access to the adaptee instance that allows for accessing the required data of the adaptee and performing operations on that data that generates the desired output.

<doc id="65027" wikidata="Q8095398" url="?curid=65027" title="Shared library">
<text>A shared library is a library that contains executable code designed to be used by multiple computer programs or other libraries at runtime, with only one copy of that code in memory, shared by all programs using the code.

== Library types ==
A program that is configured to use a library can use either static-linking or dynamic-linking. Historically, libraries could only be static. For static-linking (.lib), the library is effectively embedded into the programs executable file, while for dynamic-linking the library can be loaded at runtime from a shared location, such as system files.

A program requires a compiler and linker step to access a library. In static-linking, those references are fully resolved at compile-time, whereas in dynamic-linking those references are not fully resolved until runtime by the operating system.

== Formats ==
Many modern operating systems now use a unified format for their shared libraries and executable files. For example:

* Microsoft Windows uses the Portable Executable (PE) format for .dll files;
* operating systems such as Solaris and other System V Release 4-based systems, Linux, and the free-software BSD operating systems use the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) for .so files;
* Apple&#x27;s Darwin-based operating systems, such as macOS and iOS, use the Mach-O format for .dylib files.

This offers two main advantages: first, it requires only one loader (building and maintaining a single loader is considered well worth any added complexity). Secondly, it allows an executable file to be used as a shared library (if it has a symbol table).

In some older environments such as 16-bit Windows or MPE for the HP 3000, significant restrictions were placed on shared library code, such as only allowing stack-based (local) data.

==Memory sharing==
Library code may be shared in memory by multiple processes, and on disk. If virtual memory is used, processes would execute the same physical page of RAM that is mapped into the different address spaces of the processes. This has advantages. For instance, on the OpenStep system, applications were often only a few hundred kilobytes in size and loaded quickly; most of their code was located in libraries that had already been loaded for other purposes by the operating system.

Programs can accomplish RAM sharing by using position-independent code, as in Unix, which leads to a complex but flexible architecture, or by using common virtual addresses, as in Windows and OS/2. These systems ensure, by various means, like pre-mapping the address space and reserving slots for each shared library, that code has a high probability of being shared. A third alternative is single-level store with a single address space, as used by the IBM System/38 and its successors. This allows position-dependent code, with programs and libraries assigned a permanent address in that address space.

In some cases, different versions of shared libraries can cause problems, especially when libraries of different versions have the same file name, and different applications installed on a system each require a specific version. Such a scenario is known as DLL hell, named after the Windows and OS/2 DLL file. Most modern operating systems after 2001 have clean-up methods to eliminate such situations or use application-specific &quot;private&quot; libraries.

==Dynamic linking==
Dynamic linking or late binding is linking performed while a program is being loaded (load time) or executed (runtime), rather than when the executable file is created. A dynamically linked library (dynamic-link library, or DLL, under Windows and OS/2; shareable image under OpenVMS; dynamic shared object, or DSO, under Unix-like systems) is a library intended for dynamic linking. Only a minimal amount of work is done by the linker when the executable file is created; it only records what library routines the program needs and the index names or numbers of the routines in the library. The majority of the work of linking is done at the time the application is loaded (load time) or during execution (runtime). Usually, the necessary linking program, called a &quot;dynamic linker&quot; or &quot;linking loader&quot;, is actually part of the underlying operating system. (However, it is possible, and not exceedingly difficult, to write a program that uses dynamic linking and includes its own dynamic linker, even for an operating system that itself provides no support for dynamic linking.)

Programmers originally developed dynamic linking in the Multics operating system, starting in 1964, and the MTS (Michigan Terminal System), built in the late 1960s.

==Optimizations==
Since shared libraries on most systems do not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed and store that information in the libraries and executables. If every shared library that is loaded has undergone this process, then each will load at its predetermined address, which speeds up the process of dynamic linking. This optimization is known as prebinding or prelinking on macOS and Linux, respectively. IBM z/VM uses a similar technique, called &quot;Discontinuous Saved Segments&quot; (DCSS). Disadvantages of this technique include the time required to precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use address space layout randomization, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of 64-bit architectures, at least for the time being).

==Locating libraries at runtime==
Loaders for shared libraries vary widely in functionality. Some depend on the executable storing explicit paths to the libraries. Any change to the library naming or layout of the file system will cause these systems to fail. More commonly, only the name of the library (and not the path) is stored in the executable, with the operating system supplying a method to find the library on disk, based on some algorithm.

If a shared library that an executable depends on is deleted, moved, or renamed, or if an incompatible version of the library is copied to a place that is earlier in the search, the executable would fail to load. This is called &quot;dependency hell&quot;, existing on many platforms. The (infamous) Windows variant is commonly known as DLL hell. This problem cannot occur if each version of each library is uniquely identified and each program references libraries only by their full unique identifiers. The &quot;DLL hell&quot; problems with earlier Windows versions arose from using only the names of libraries, which were not guaranteed to be unique, to resolve dynamic links in programs. (To avoid &quot;DLL hell&quot;, later versions of Windows rely largely on options for programs to install private DLLs—essentially a partial retreat from the use of shared libraries—along with mechanisms to prevent replacement of shared system DLLs with earlier versions of them.)

===Microsoft Windows===
Microsoft Windows checks the registry to determine the proper place to load DLLs that implement COM objects, but for other DLLs it will check the directories in a defined order. First, Windows checks the directory where it loaded the program (&quot;private DLL&quot;); any directories set by calling the codice_1 function; the System32, System, and Windows directories; then the current working directory; and finally the directories specified by the PATH environment variable. Applications written for the .NET Framework (since 2002), also check the Global Assembly Cache as the primary store of shared dll files to remove the issue of DLL hell.

===OpenStep===
OpenStep used a more flexible system, collecting a list of libraries from a number of known locations (similar to the PATH concept) when the system first starts. Moving libraries around causes no problems at all, although users incur a time cost when first starting the system.

===Unix-like systems===
Most Unix-like systems have a &quot;search path&quot; specifying file-system directories in which to look for dynamic libraries. Some systems specify the default path in a configuration file, others hard-code it into the dynamic loader. Some executable file formats can specify additional directories in which to search for libraries for a particular program. This can usually be overridden with an environment variable, although it is disabled for setuid and setgid programs, so that a user can&#x27;t force such a program to run arbitrary code with root permissions. Developers of libraries are encouraged to place their dynamic libraries in places in the default search path. On the downside, this can make installation of new libraries problematic, and these &quot;known&quot; locations quickly become home to an increasing number of library files, making management more complex.

==Dynamic loading==

Dynamic loading, a subset of dynamic linking, involves a dynamically linked library loading and unloading at runtime on request. Such a request may be made implicitly or explicitly. Implicit requests are made when a compiler or static linker adds library references that include file paths or simply file names. Explicit requests are made when applications make direct calls to an operating system&#x27;s API.

Most operating systems that support dynamically linked libraries also support dynamically loading such libraries via a run-time linker API. For instance, Microsoft Windows uses the API functions codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5 with Microsoft Dynamic Link Libraries; POSIX-based systems, including most UNIX and UNIX-like systems, use codice_6, codice_7 and codice_8. Some development systems automate this process.

<doc id="65028" wikidata="Q428170" url="?curid=65028" title="Facade pattern">
<text>The facade pattern (also spelled &quot;façade&quot;) is a software design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a façade in architecture, it is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:
* improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) application programming interface (API)
* provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
* serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code

Developers often use the facade design pattern when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has many interdependent classes or because its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.

==Overview== 
The Facade

design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known 
&quot;GoF design patterns&quot; 
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

What problems can the Facade design pattern solve?
* To make a complex subsystem easier to use, a simple interface should be provided for a set of interfaces in the subsystem.
* The dependencies on a subsystem should be minimized.

Clients that access a complex subsystem directly refer to (depend on) many different objects having different interfaces (tight coupling), which makes the clients hard to implement, change, test, and reuse.

What solution does the Facade design pattern describe?

Define a codice_1 object that 
* implements a simple interface in terms of (by delegating to) the interfaces in the subsystem and
* may perform additional functionality before/after forwarding a request.

This enables to work through a codice_1 object to minimize the dependencies on a subsystem.
&lt;br&gt;
See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

== Usage ==
A Facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired. Alternatively, an adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.
The facade pattern is typically used when
* a simple interface is required to access a complex system,
* a system is very complex or difficult to understand,
* an entry point is needed to each level of layered software, or
* the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.

==Structure==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In this UML class diagram, 
the codice_3 class doesn&#x27;t access the subsystem classes directly.
Instead, the codice_3 works through a codice_1 class that implements a simple interface in terms of (by delegating to) the subsystem classes (codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8).
The codice_3 depends only on the simple codice_1 interface
and is independent of the complex subsystem.

The sequence diagram 
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_3 object 
works through a codice_1 object that delegates the request to
the codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8
instances that perform the request.

=== UML class diagram ===

; Facade
: The facade class abstracts Packages 1, 2, and 3 from the rest of the application.
; Clients
: The objects are using the facade pattern to access resources from the packages.

== Example ==

This is an abstract example of how a client (&quot;you&quot;) interacts with a facade (the &quot;computer&quot;) to a complex system (internal computer parts, like CPU and HardDrive).

=== C++ ===

struct CPU {
 void Freeze();
 void Jump(long position);
 void Execute();

struct HardDrive {
 char* Read(long lba, int size);

struct Memory {
 void Load(long position, char* data);

class ComputerFacade {
 public:
 void Start() {
 cpu_.Freeze();
 memory_.Load(kBootAddress, hard_drive_.Read(kBootSector, kSectorSize));
 cpu_.Jump(kBootAddress);
 cpu_.Execute();

 private:
 CPU cpu_;
 Memory memory_;
 HardDrive hard_drive_;

int main() {
 ComputerFacade computer;
 computer.Start();

<text>A versatackle is a self-locking tensioning structure implemented in cordage. It consists of two loops with the rope passed back and forth between them. It is functionally similar to the trucker&#x27;s hitch; however, unlike the trucker&#x27;s hitch, the versatackle is self-locking under tension.

The pressure, friction, and heat that may be generated by the running end moving through the loops can accelerate wear at the loops.

<doc id="65032" wikidata="Q204042" url="?curid=65032" title="Spanky McFarland">
<text>George Robert Philips McFarland (October 2, 1928 – June 30, 1993) was an American actor most famous for starring as a child as Spanky in Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; series of short-subject comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. The &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts were later syndicated to television as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;.

In addition to his work in &quot;Our Gang&quot; and its feature-film spin-off &quot;General Spanky&quot; (1936), McFarland regularly appeared in co-starring or supporting juvenile roles in feature films produced by other studios throughout the 1930s. These included &quot;Kentucky Kernels&quot; (1934) with Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey, &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1936) with Sylvia Sidney and Fred MacMurray, and &quot;Peck&#x27;s Bad Boy with the Circus&quot; (1938). Leaving acting as a teenager, McFarland had several varying careers as an adult before finding success as a sales executive. He spent the final decades of his life as a public speaker reflecting on his child-acting career.

==Early life==
McFarland was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 2, 1928, to Virginia Winifred (née Phillips) and Robert Emmett McFarland. He had three siblings: Thomas (&quot;Tommy&quot;, who appeared in a few &quot;Our Gang&quot; episodes as &quot;Dynamite&quot;), Amanda, and Roderick (&quot;Rod&quot;). He attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Texas.

Before joining the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies, &quot;Sonny&quot;, as he was called by his family, modeled children&#x27;s clothing for a Dallas department store and was also seen around the Dallas area on highway billboards and in print advertisements for Wonder Bread. This established Sonny early on in the local public&#x27;s eye as an adorable child model and provided experience before cameras.

==Career==

===&quot;Our Gang&quot;===
In January 1931, in response to a trade magazine advertisement from Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, requesting photographs of &quot;cute kids&quot;, Spanky&#x27;s Aunt Dottie (Virginia&#x27;s sister) sent pictures from Sonny&#x27;s portfolio. An invitation for a screen test arrived that spring, leading to his acting career. Portions of Spanky&#x27;s screen test are included in a 1932 &quot;Our Gang&quot; entry, &quot;Spanky&quot;.

The nickname &quot;Spanky&quot; is erroneously said to have arisen from warnings by his mother not to misbehave during one of the initial discussions with Hal Roach in his office. McFarland contradicted the tale, saying that the name was given by a Los Angeles newspaper reporter. Use of the &quot;Spanky&quot; name by McFarland for subsequent business or personal activities was expressly granted to McFarland in one of his studio contracts. In later years some family members would affectionately refer to him as &quot;Spank&quot;.

Upon being discovered at age three, he instantly became a key member of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; children&#x27;s comedy movie series and one of Hollywood&#x27;s stars. His earliest films show him as an outspoken toddler, grumpily going along with the rest of the gang. His scene-stealing abilities brought him more attention, and by 1935 he was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the gang, often paired with Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer, and always the enterprising &quot;idea man&quot;. Switzer&#x27;s character became as much of a scene-stealer as the young McFarland was, and the two boys&#x27; fathers fought constantly over screen time and star billing for their children.

Spanky McFarland&#x27;s only starring feature-film role was in the 1936 Hal Roach film &quot;General Spanky&quot;, an unsuccessful attempt to move the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series into features. He also appeared as a juvenile performer in many non-Roach feature films, including the Wheeler &amp; Woolsey comedy &quot;Kentucky Kernels&quot;, the early Technicolor feature &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1936), and two Fritz Lang features of the 1940s.

Following the 1938 &quot;Our Gang&quot; short &quot;Came the Brawn&quot;, McFarland &quot;retired&quot; from &quot;Our Gang&quot;, beginning a personal appearance tour. In mid-1938, Hal Roach sold the &quot;Our Gang&quot; unit to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who began casting for a new &quot;team leader&quot; character in Spanky&#x27;s vein and ended up rehiring McFarland himself. He remained in the MGM &quot;Our Gang&quot; productions until his final appearance in the series &quot;Unexpected Riches&quot; in 1942, at age fourteen.

===Later years===
In 1952, at age 24, McFarland joined the U.S. Air Force. Upon his return to civilian life, indelibly typecast in the public&#x27;s mind as &quot;Spanky&quot; from &quot;Our Gang,&quot; he found himself unable to find work in show business. He took less glamorous jobs, including work at a soft drink plant, a hamburger stand, and a popsicle factory. In the mid-1950s, when the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies were syndicated on television as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, McFarland hosted an afternoon children&#x27;s show, &quot;The Spanky Show&quot;, on KOTV television in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The show included a studio audience and appearances by other celebrities such as James Arness. &quot;Little Rascals&quot; shorts were also shown. Station executives prevented McFarland from developing and expanding the show&#x27;s format, and by 1960 McFarland had quit the show.

After that stint, he continued at odd jobs: selling wine, operating a restaurant and night club, and selling appliances, electronics, and furniture. He was selling for Philco-Ford Corporation, where he advanced to national sales training director. During this time, McFarland continued to make personal appearances and cameo roles in films and television, including an appearance on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; with Darla Hood and William &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas. As general manager, McFarland helped launch the classic movie channel The Nostalgia Channel in 1985. During the 1990s, after his self-described &quot;semi-retirement&quot;, Spanky lent his name and celebrity to help raise money for charities, primarily by participating in golf tournaments. Spanky also had his own namesake charity golf classic for 16 years, held in Marion, Indiana. He also traveled the country doing speaking engagements and lectures about his movie roles and his days in the &quot;Our Gang&quot;. His final television appearance was in 1993, playing himself in the cold open of the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Woody Gets An Election&quot;.

In January 1994, McFarland posthumously joined fellow alumnus Jackie Cooper to become one of only two &quot;Our Gang&quot; members to receive a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

==Death==
McFarland died of &quot;a heart attack or an aneurysm&quot; at his home; his remains were cremated shortly thereafter. A cenotaph for McFarland to be placed at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas, has been approved, but according to the cemetery&#x27;s website, has yet to be installed.

==Namesake==
The 1960s folk-rock group Spanky and Our Gang named themselves after McFarland&#x27;s character because singer Elaine &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarlane&#x27;s last name was similar to his. However, this is disputed by biographer Bruce Eder, who has said her fellow musician Arnie Lanza gave her the nickname &quot;Spanky,&quot; based on what he saw as her resemblance to George McFarland who played &quot;Spanky&quot; in the Our Gang comedies.

In 1990, McFarland filed a $100,000 lawsuit against a bar owner in St. Paul, Minnesota. McFarland claimed that &quot;Spanky&#x27;s&quot; bar on East 7th Street used his name and face for thirteen years without permission. The lawsuit also called for McFarland to receive all of the internal merchandise and equipment featuring his likeness. The case was eventually settled, and the owner changed the name to Checker&#x27;s Bar.

==Filmography==

<doc id="65033" wikidata="Q23802" url="?curid=65033" title="Bridge pattern">
<text>The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to &quot;decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently&quot;, introduced by the Gang of Four. The &quot;bridge&quot; uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

When a class varies often, the features of object-oriented programming become very useful because changes to a program&#x27;s code can be made easily with minimal prior knowledge about the program. The bridge pattern is useful when both the class and what it does vary often. The class itself can be thought of as the &quot;abstraction&quot; and what the class can do as the &quot;implementation&quot;. The bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.

When there is only one fixed implementation, this pattern is known as the Pimpl idiom in the C++ world.

The bridge pattern is often confused with the adapter pattern, and is often implemented using the object adapter pattern; e.g., in the Java code below.

Variant: The implementation can be decoupled even more by deferring the presence of the implementation to the point where the abstraction is utilized.

== Overview ==
The Bridge design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known &quot;GoF design patterns&quot; that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

What problems can the Bridge design pattern solve?
* An abstraction and its implementation should be defined and extended independently from each other.
* A compile-time binding between an abstraction and its implementation should be avoided so that an implementation can be selected at run-time.

When using subclassing, different subclasses implement an abstract class in different ways. But an implementation is bound to the abstraction at compile-time and cannot be changed at run-time.

What solution does the Bridge design pattern describe?
* Separate an abstraction (codice_1) from its implementation (codice_2) by putting them in separate class hierarchies.
* Implement the codice_1 in terms of (by delegating to) an codice_2 object.

This enables to configure an codice_1 with an codice_2 object at run-time.
&lt;br&gt;
See also the Unified Modeling Language class and sequence diagram below.

==Structure==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In the above Unified Modeling Language class diagram, an abstraction (codice_1) is not implemented as usual in a single inheritance hierarchy.
Instead, there is one hierarchy for
an abstraction (codice_1) and a separate hierarchy for its implementation (codice_2), which makes the two independent from each other.
The codice_1 interface (codice_11) is implemented in terms of (by delegating to)
the codice_2 interface (codice_13).
&lt;br&gt;
The UML sequence diagram
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_14 object delegates implementation to the codice_15 object (by calling codice_16 on codice_15),
which performs the operation and returns to codice_14.

=== Class diagram ===

; Abstraction (abstract class)
: defines the abstract interface
: maintains the Implementor reference.
; RefinedAbstraction (normal class)
: extends the interface defined by Abstraction
; Implementor (interface)
: defines the interface for implementation classes
; ConcreteImplementor (normal class)
: implements the Implementor interface

== Example ==

=== C# ===
Bridge pattern compose objects in tree structure. It decouples abstraction from implementation. Here abstraction represents the client from which the objects will be called. An example implemented in C# is given below

// Helps in providing truly decoupled architecture
public interface IBridge
 void Function1();
 void Function2();

public class Bridge1 : IBridge
 public void Function1()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Bridge1.Function1&quot;);

 public void Function2()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Bridge1.Function2&quot;);
}

public class Bridge2 : IBridge
 public void Function1()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Bridge2.Function1&quot;);

 public void Function2()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Bridge2.Function2&quot;);
}

public interface IAbstractBridge
 void CallMethod1();
 void CallMethod2();

public class AbstractBridge : IAbstractBridge
 public IBridge bridge;

 public AbstractBridge(IBridge bridge)
 this.bridge = bridge;

 public void CallMethod1()
 this.bridge.Function1();

 public void CallMethod2()
 this.bridge.Function2();
}

The Bridge classes are the Implementation that uses the same interface-oriented architecture to create objects. On the other hand, the abstraction takes an instance of the implementation class and runs its method. Thus, they are completely decoupled from one another.

<doc id="65037" wikidata="Q169545" url="?curid=65037" title="Tire">
<text>A tire (British spelling: tyre) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel&#x27;s rim to transfer a vehicle&#x27;s load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface over which the wheel travels. Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are pneumatically inflated structures, providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint, called a contact patch, designed to match the vehicle&#x27;s weight and the bearing on the surface that it rolls over by exerting a pressure that will avoid deforming the surface.

The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, tires were metal bands fitted around wooden wheels to hold the wheel together under load and to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymers) tires are also used in various non-automotive applications, such as casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.

Unmaintained tires can lead to severe hazards for vehicles and people, ranging from flat tires making the vehicle inoperable to blowouts, where tires explode during operation and possibly damage vehicles and injure people. The manufacture of tires is often highly regulated for this reason. Because of the widespread use of tires for motor vehicles, tire waste is a substantial portion of global waste. There is a need for tire recycling through mechanical recycling and reuse, such as for crumb rubber and other tire-derived aggregate, and pyrolysis for chemical reuse, such as for tire-derived fuel. If not recycled properly or burned, waste tires release toxic chemicals into the environment. Moreover, the regular use of tires produces micro-plastic particles that contain these chemicals that both enter the environment and affect human health.

==Etymology and spelling==
The word &quot;tire&quot; is a short form of &quot;attire&quot;, from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.

&quot;Tyre&quot; is the oldest spelling, and both &quot;tyre&quot; and &quot;tire&quot; were used during the 15th and 16th centuries. During the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;tire&quot; became more common in print. The spelling &quot;tyre&quot; did not reappear until the 1840s when the English began shrink-fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron. Nevertheless, many publishers continued using &quot;tire&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in London was still using &quot;tire&quot; as late as 1905. The spelling &quot;tyre&quot; began to be commonly used in the 19th century for pneumatic tires in the UK. The 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that &quot;The spelling &#x27;tyre&#x27; is not now accepted by the best English authorities, and is unrecognized in the US&quot;, while Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; of 1926 describes that &quot;there is nothing to be said for &#x27;tyre&#x27;, which is etymologically wrong, as well as needlessly divergent from our own [sc. British] older &amp; the present American usage&quot;. However, over the 20th century, &quot;tyre&quot; became established as the standard British spelling.

==History==
The earliest tires were bands of leather, then iron (later steel) placed on wooden wheels used on carts and wagons. A skilled worker, known as a wheelwright, would cause the tire to expand by heating it in a forge fire, placing it over the wheel, and quenching it, causing the metal to contract back to its original size to fit tightly on the wheel.

The first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847 and was lodged by Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson. However, this idea never went into production. The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888 on May Street, Belfast, by Scots-born John Boyd Dunlop, owner of one of Ireland&#x27;s most prosperous veterinary practices. It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie while riding his tricycle on rough pavements. His doctor, John, later Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy and was a regular visitor. Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires. Cyclist Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop&#x27;s tires in 1889, winning the tire&#x27;s first-ever races in Ireland and then England. In Dunlop&#x27;s tire patent specification dated 31 October 1888, his interest is only in its use in cycles and light vehicles. In September 1890, he was made aware of an earlier development, but the company kept the information to itself. In 1892, Dunlop&#x27;s patent was declared invalid because of the prior art by forgotten fellow Scot Robert William Thomson of London (patents London 1845, France 1846, USA 1847). However, Dunlop is credited with &quot;realizing rubber could withstand the wear and tear of being a tire while retaining its resilience&quot;. John Boyd Dunlop and Harvey du Cros worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and acquired other rights and patents, which allowed them some limited protection of their Pneumatic Tyre business&#x27;s position. Pneumatic Tyre would become Dunlop Rubber and Dunlop Tyres. The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the vulcanization of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as the development of the &quot;clincher&quot; rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.

Synthetic rubbers were invented in the laboratories of Bayer in the 1920s. Rubber shortages in the United Kingdom during WWII prompted research on alternatives to rubber tires with suggestions including leather, compressed asbestos, rayon, felt, bristles, and paper.

In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction. Michelin had bought the bankrupt Citroën automobile company in 1934 to utilize this new technology. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the US, the outdated bias-ply tire construction persisted until the Ford Motor Company adopted radial tires in the early 1970s, following a 1968 article in an influential American magazine, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, highlighting the superiority of radial construction. The US tire industry lost its market share to Japanese and European manufacturers, which bought out US companies.

== Applications ==
Tires may be classified according to the type of vehicle they serve. They may be distinguished by the load they carry and by their application, e.g. to a motor vehicle, aircraft, or bicycle.

=== Automotive ===
==== Light–medium duty ====


Light-duty tires for passenger vehicles carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. Light-to-medium duty trucks and vans carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. They are differentiated by speed rating for different vehicles, including (starting from the lowest speed to the highest): winter tires, light truck tires, entry-level car tires, sedans and vans, sport sedans, and high-performance cars. Apart from road tires, there are special categories:

* Snow tires are designed for use on snow and ice. They have a tread design with larger gaps than those on summer tires, increasing traction on snow and ice. Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction performance test are entitled to display a &quot;Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake&quot; symbol on their sidewalls. Tires designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below . Some snow tires have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice. Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path. Regulations that require the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America.
* All-season tires are typically rated for mud and snow (M+S). These tires have tread gaps that are smaller than snow tires and larger than conventional tires. They are quieter than snow tires on clear roads, but less capable on snow or ice.
* All-terrain tires are designed to have adequate traction off-road, yet have benign handling and noise characteristics for highway driving. Such tires are rated better on snow and rain than street tires and &quot;good&quot; on ice, rock, and sand.
* Mud-terrain tires have a deeper, more open tread for good grip in mud, than all-terrain tires, but perform less well on pavement.
* High-performance tires are rated for speeds up to and ultra-high-performance tires are rated for speeds up to , but have harsher ride characteristics and durability.
* Electric vehicles have unique demands on tires due to the combination of weight (resulting in new load index), higher torque, and requirements for lower rolling resistance.

Other types of light-duty automotive tires include run-flat tires and race car tires:

* Run-flat tires eliminates the need for a spare tire because they can be traveled on at a reduced speed in the event of a puncture, using a stiff sidewall to prevent damage to the tire rim. Vehicles without run-flat tires rely on a spare tire, which may be a compact tire, to replace a damaged tire.
* Race car tires come in three main categories, &quot;DOT&quot; (street-legal), &quot;slick&quot;, and &quot;rain&quot;. Race car tires are designed to maximize cornering and acceleration friction at the expense of longevity. Racing slicks have no tread to maximize contact with the pavement and rain tires have channels to eject water to avoid hydroplaning.

==== Heavy duty ====
Heavy-duty tires for large trucks and buses come in a variety of profiles and carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. These are typically mounted in tandem on the drive axle.

* Truck tires come in a variety of profiles that include &quot;low profile&quot; with a section height that is 70 to 45% of the tread width, &quot;wide-base&quot; for heavy vehicles, and a &quot;super-single&quot; tire that has the same total contact pressure as a dual-mounted tire combination.
* Off-road tires are used on construction vehicles, agricultural and forestry equipment, and other applications that take place on soft terrain. The category also includes machinery that travels over hardened surfaces at industrial sites, ports, and airports. Tires designed for soft terrain have a deep, wide tread to provide traction in loose dirt, mud, sand, or gravel.

=== Other ===
Aircraft, bicycles, and a variety of industrial applications have distinct design requirements.

* Aircraft tires are designed for landing on paved surfaces and rely on their landing gear to absorb the shock of landing. To conserve the weight and space required, they are typically small in proportion to the vehicle that they support. Most are radial-ply construction. They are designed for a peak load when the aircraft is stationary, although side loads upon landing are an important factor. Although hydroplaning is a concern for aircraft tires, they typically have radial grooves and no lateral grooves or sipes. Some light aircraft employ large-diameter, low-pressure tundra tires for landing on unprepared surfaces in wilderness areas.
* Bicycle tires may be designed for riding on roads or over unimproved terrain and may be mounted on vehicles with more than two wheels. There are three main types: &quot;clincher&quot;, &quot;wired&quot; and &quot;tubular&quot;. Most bicycle tires are &quot;clincher&quot; and have a bead that presses against the wheel rim. An inner tube provides the air pressure and the contact pressure between the bead and wheel rim.
* Industrial tires support such vehicles as forklifts, tractors, excavators, road rollers, and bucket loaders. Those used on smooth surfaces have a smooth tread, whereas those used on soft surfaces typically have large tread features. Some industrial tires are solid or filled with foam.
* Motorcycle tires provide traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allow the motorcycle to turn via countersteering. The two tires&#x27; contact with the ground affects safety, braking, fuel economy, noise, and rider comfort.

==Construction types==
Tire construction spans pneumatic tires used on cars, trucks, and aircraft, but also includes non-automotive applications with slow-moving, light-duty, or railroad applications, which may have non-pneumatic tires.

===Automotive===
Following the 1968 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; announcement of the superiority of the radial design, radial tires began an inexorable climb in market share, reaching 100% of the North American market in the 1980s. Radial tire technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires, but other methods have been used.

Radial (or radial-ply) tire construction utilizes body ply cords extending straight across the tread from bead to bead—so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to one another—as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The plies are generally made of nylon, polyester, or steel, and the belts of steel, fiberglass, or Kevlar. The tire’s footprint, wider than a bias tire’s, and flexible sidewalls provide a better grip in turns, and its circumferential belts stabilize it. The advantages of this construction over that of a bias tire are many, including longer tread life, better steering control, lower rolling resistance, improved fuel economy, more uniform wear, higher heat resistance, fewer blowouts, and a steadier, more comfortable ride at speed. Disadvantages, besides a higher cost than that of bias tires, are a harder ride at low speeds and generally worse performance on rough terrain. Radial tires are also seldom seen in diameters of greater than 42 inches, as such tires are difficult to make.

 tire (bias-ply, or cross-ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees from the direction of travel. Successive plies are laid at opposing angles, forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. Such a design is resistant to sidewall deformation and punctures (and to punctures’ expansion, or “torque splitting”) and therefore durable in severe use. Since the tread and sidewalls share their casing plies, the tire body flexes as a whole, providing the main advantage of this construction, better traction and smoother motion on uneven surfaces, with a greater tendency to conform to rocky ground and throw off mud and clay, especially because the rubber is usually of a softer compound than that used on radial tires. However, this conformity increases a bias tire&#x27;s rolling resistance, and its stiffness allows less control, traction, and comfort at higher speeds, while shear between its overlapping plies causes friction that generates heat. Still, bias tires benefit from simpler structure and so cost less than like-size radials, and they remain in use on heavy equipment and off-road vehicles, although the earthmoving market has shifted to radials.

A belted bias tire starts with two or more bias plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides a smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the &quot;Polyglas&quot; trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass. The &quot;belted&quot; tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires. The belts may be fiberglass or steel.

===Other===

Tubeless tires are pneumatic tires that do not require a separate inner tube.

Semi-pneumatic tires have a hollow center, but they are not pressurized. They are lightweight, low-cost, puncture-proof, and provide cushioning. These tires often come as a complete assembly with the wheel and even integral ball bearings. They are used on lawn mowers, wheelchairs, and wheelbarrows. They can also be rugged, typically used in industrial applications, and are designed to not pull off their rim under use.

An airless tire is a non-pneumatic tire that is not supported by air pressure. They are most commonly used on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is high, such as on construction equipment. Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. Solid tires include those used for lawnmowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed utilizing a hydraulic tire press.

Wooden wheels for horse-drawn vehicles usually have a wrought iron tire. This construction was extended to wagons on horse-drawn tramways, rolling on granite setts or cast iron rails.

The wheels of some railway engines and older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel. The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel and is primarily held in place by interference fit.

Aircraft tires may operate at pressures that exceed . Some aircraft tires are inflated with nitrogen to &quot;eliminate the possibility of a chemical reaction between atmospheric oxygen and volatile gases from the tire inner liner producing a tire explosion&quot;.

== Manufacturing ==
Pneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world. Tire production starts with bulk raw materials such as rubber, carbon black, and chemicals and produces numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured. Many kinds of rubber are used, the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer.

Forecasts for the global automotive tire market indicate continued growth through 2027. Estimates put the value of worldwide sales volume around $126 billion in 2022, it is expected to reach the value of over $176 billion by 2027. Production of tires is also experiencing growth. In 2015, the US manufactured almost 170 million tires. Over 2.5 billion tires are manufactured annually, making the tire industry a major consumer of natural rubber. It was estimated that for 2019 onwards, at least 3 billion tires would be sold globally every year. However, other estimates put worldwide tire production of 2,268 million in 2021 and is predicted to reach 2,665 million tires by 2027.

As of 2011, the top three tire manufacturing companies by revenue were Bridgestone (manufacturing 190 million tires), Michelin (184 million), Goodyear (181 million); they were followed by Continental, and Pirelli. The Lego group produced over 318 million toy tires in 2011 and was recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest annual production of tires by any manufacturer.

===Components===

A tire comprises several components: the tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and ply.

====Tread====
The tread is the part of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface. The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the contact patch. The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite compound formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly.

The tread pattern is characterized by a system of circumferential grooves, lateral sipes, and slots for road tires or a system of lugs and for tires designed for soft terrain or snow. Grooves run circumferentially around the tire and are needed to channel away water. Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface. Grooves, sipes, and slots allow tires to evacuate water.

The design of treads and the interaction of specific tire types with the roadway surface affects roadway noise, a source of noise pollution emanating from moving vehicles. These sound intensities increase with higher vehicle speeds. Tires treads may incorporate a variety of distances between slots (&quot;pitch lengths&quot;) to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies. Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape sideways and mitigate hydroplaning.

Different tread designs address a variety of driving conditions. As the ratio of tire tread area to groove area increases, so does tire friction on dry pavement, as seen on Formula One tires, some of which have no grooves. High-performance tires often have smaller void areas to provide more rubber in contact with the road for higher traction, but may be compounded with softer rubber that provides better traction, but wears quickly. Mud and snow (M&amp;S) tires employ larger and deeper slots to engage mud and snow. Snow tires have still larger and deeper slots that compact snow and create shear strength within the compacted snow to improve braking and cornering performance.

Wear bars (or wear indicators) are raised features located at the bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service, typically at a remaining tread depth of .

====Other====
The tire bead is the part of the tire that contacts the rim on the wheel. This essential component is constructed with robust steel cables encased in durable, specially formulated rubber designed to resist stretching. The precision of the bead&#x27;s fit is crucial, as it seals the tire against the wheel, maintaining air pressure integrity and preventing any loss of air. The bead&#x27;s design ensures a secure, non-slip connection, preventing the tire from rotating independently from the wheel during vehicle motion. Additionally, the interplay between the bead&#x27;s dimensions and the wheel&#x27;s width significantly influences the vehicle&#x27;s steering responsiveness and stability, as it helps to maintain the tire’s intended shape and contact with the road.

The sidewall is that part of the tire, or bicycle tire, that bridges between the tread and bead. The sidewall is largely rubber but reinforced with fabric or steel cords that provide for tensile strength and flexibility. The sidewall contains air pressure and transmits the torque applied by the drive axle to the tread to create traction but supports little of the weight of the vehicle, as is clear from the total collapse of the tire when punctured.

Sidewalls are molded with manufacturer-specific detail, government-mandated warning labels, and other consumer information.

Sidewall may also have sometimes decorative ornamentation that includes whitewall or red-line inserts as well as tire lettering.

The shoulder is that part of the tire at the edge of the tread as it makes the transition to the sidewall.

Plies are layers of relatively inextensible cords embedded in the rubber to hold its shape by preventing the rubber from stretching in response to the internal pressure. The orientations of the plies play a large role in the performance of the tire and are one of the main ways that tires are categorized.

=== Blems ===
Blem (short for &quot;blemished&quot;) is a term used for a tire that failed inspection during manufacturing - but only for superficial/cosmetic/aesthetic reasons. For example, a tire with white painted lettering which is smudged or incomplete might be classified as a &quot;blem&quot;. Blem tires are fully functional and generally carry the same warranty as flawless tires - but are sold at a discount.

=== Materials ===
The materials of modern pneumatic tires can be divided into two groups, the cords that make up the ply and the elastomer which encases them.

====Cords====
The cords, which form the ply and bead and provide the tensile strength necessary to contain the inflation pressure, can be composed of steel, natural fibers such as cotton or silk, or synthetic fibers such as nylon or kevlar. Good adhesion between the cords and the rubber is important. To achieve this the steel cords are coated in a thin layer of brass, various additives will also be added to the rubber to improve binding, such as resorcinol/HMMM mixtures.

====Elastomer====
The elastomer, which forms the tread and encases the cords to protect them from abrasion and hold them in place, is a key component of pneumatic tire design. It can be composed of various composites of rubber material – the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer – with other chemical compounds such as silica and carbon black.

Optimizing rolling resistance in the elastomer material is a key challenge for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector. It is estimated that passenger vehicles consume approximately 5~15% of their fuel to overcome rolling resistance, while the estimate is understood to be higher for heavy trucks. However, there is a trade-off between rolling resistance and wet traction and grip: while low rolling resistance can be achieved by reducing the viscoelastic properties of the rubber compound (low tangent (δ)), it comes at the cost of wet traction and grip, which requires hysteresis and energy dissipation (high tangent (δ)). A low tangent (δ) value at 60 °C is used as an indicator of low rolling resistance, while a high tangent (δ) value at 0 °C is used as an indicator of high wet traction. Designing an elastomer material that can achieve both high wet traction and low rolling resistance is key in achieving safety and fuel efficiency in the transportation sector.

The most common elastomer material used today is a styrene-butadiene copolymer. It combines the properties of polybutadiene, which is a highly rubbery polymer (&quot;Tg&quot; = -100 °C) having high hysteresis and thus offering good wet grip properties, with the properties of polystyrene, which is a glassy polymer (&quot;Tg&quot; = 100 °C) having low hysteresis and thus offering low rolling resistance in addition to wear resistance. Therefore, the ratio of the two monomers in the styrene-butadiene copolymer is considered key in determining the glass transition temperature of the material, which is correlated to its grip and resistance properties.

Non-exhaust emissions of particulate matter, generated by the wearing down of brakes, clutches, tires, and road surfaces, as well as by the suspension of road dust, constitute a little-known but rising share of emissions from road traffic and significantly harm public health.

== On the wheel ==
Associated components of tires include the wheel on which it is mounted, the valve stem through which air is introduced, and, for some tires, an inner tube that provides the airtight means for maintaining tire pressure.

* &quot;Wheel&quot;: Pneumatic tires are mounted onto wheels that most often have integral rims on their outer edges to hold the tire. Automotive wheels are typically made from pressed and welded steel, or a composite of lightweight metal alloys, such as aluminum or magnesium. There are two aspects to how pneumatic tires support the rim of the wheel on which they are mounted. First, the tension in the cords pull on the bead uniformly around the wheel, except where it is reduced above the contact patch. Second, the bead transfers that net force to the rim. Tires are mounted on the wheel by forcing its beads into the channel formed by the wheel&#x27;s inner and outer rims.
* &quot;Valve stem&quot;: Pneumatic tires receive their air through a valve stem—a tube made of metal or rubber, with a check valve, typically a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. They mount directly to the rim, in the case of tubeless tires, or are an integral part of the inner tube. Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module.
* &quot;Inner tube&quot;: Most bicycle tires, many motorcycle tires, and many tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors are designed for use with inner tubes. Inner tubes are torus-shaped balloons made from an impermeable material, such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage. The inner tubes are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure. Large inner tubes can be reused for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see swim ring), tubing (recreation), sledding, and skitching. Purpose-built inflatable tori are also manufactured for these uses, offering a choice of colors, fabric covering, handles, decks, and other accessories, and eliminating the protruding valve stem.

==Performance characteristics==
The interactions of a tire with the pavement are complex. A commonly used (empirical) model of tire properties is Pacejka&#x27;s &quot;Magic Formula&quot;. Some are explained below, alphabetically, by section.

=== Dynamics ===

* &quot;Balance&quot;: Wheel-tire combinations require an even distribution of mass around their circumferences to maintain tire balance, while turning at speed. Tires are checked at the point of manufacture for excessive static imbalance and dynamic imbalance using automatic tire balance machines. Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel. Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance. An alternative method to tire balancing is the use of internal tire balancing agents. These agents take advantage of centrifugal force and inertia to counteract the tire imbalance. To facilitate proper balancing, most high-performance tire manufacturers place red and yellow marks on the sidewalls to enable the best possible match-mounting of the tire/wheel assembly. There are two methods of match-mounting high-performance tire-to-wheel assemblies using these red (uniformity) or yellow (weight) marks.
* &quot;Centrifugal growth&quot;: A tire rotating at higher speeds tends to develop a larger diameter, due to centrifugal forces that force the tread rubber away from the axis of rotation. This may cause speedometer error. As the tire diameter grows, the tire width decreases. This centrifugal growth can cause rubbing of the tire against the vehicle at high speeds. Motorcycle tires are often designed with reinforcements aimed at minimizing centrifugal growth.
* &quot;Pneumatic trail&quot;: Pneumatic trail of a tire is the trail-like effect generated by compliant tires rolling on a hard surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn. More technically, it is the distance that the resultant force of side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch.
* &quot;Slip angle&quot;: Slip angle or sideslip angle is the angle between a rolling wheel&#x27;s actual direction of travel and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., the angle of the vector sum of wheel translational velocity formula_1 and sideslip velocity 
* &quot;Relaxation length&quot;: Relaxation length is the delay between when a slip angle is introduced and when the cornering force reaches its steady-state value.
* &quot;Spring rate&quot;: Vertical stiffness, or spring rate, is the ratio of vertical force to vertical deflection of the tire, and it contributes to the overall suspension performance of the vehicle. In general, the spring rate increases with inflation pressure.
* &quot;Stopping distance&quot;: Performance-oriented tires have a tread pattern and rubber compounds designed to grip the road surface, and so usually have a slightly shorter stopping distance. However, specific braking tests are necessary for data beyond generalizations.

=== Forces ===

* &quot;Camber thrust&quot;: Camber thrust and camber force are the force generated perpendicular to the direction of travel of a rolling tire due to its camber angle and finite contact patch.
* &quot;Circle of forces&quot;: The circle of forces, traction circle, friction circle, or friction ellipse is a useful way to think about the dynamic interaction between a vehicle&#x27;s tire and the road surface.
* &quot;Contact patch&quot;: The contact patch, or footprint, of the tire, is the area of the tread that is in contact with the road surface. This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction. The length-to-width ratio of the contact patch affects steering and cornering behavior.
* &quot;Cornering force&quot;: Cornering force or side force is the lateral (i.e. parallel to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.
* &quot;Dry traction&quot;: Dry traction is the measure of the tire&#x27;s ability to deliver traction, or grip, under dry conditions. Dry traction is a function of the tackiness of the rubber compound.
* &quot;Force variation&quot;: The tire tread and sidewall elements undergo deformation and recovery as they enter and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV), and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine at the end of the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory at the end of the manufacturing process as a quality check.
* &quot;Rolling resistance&quot;: Rolling resistance is the resistance to rolling caused by deformation of the tire in contact with the road surface. As the tire rolls, the tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway. The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness. Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance tire constructions to improve fuel economy in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption. Pneumatic tires also have a much lower rolling resistance than solid tires. Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a pneumatic tire is able to &quot;absorb&quot; bumps in the road as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, as is the case with a solid (or foam-filled) tire.
* &quot;Self aligning torque&quot;: Self-aligning torque, also known as the aligning torque, SAT or Mz, is the torque that a tire creates as it rolls along that tends to steer it, i.e. rotate it around its vertical axis.
* &quot;Wet traction&quot;: Wet traction is the tire&#x27;s traction, or grip, under wet conditions. Wet traction is improved by the tread design&#x27;s ability to channel water out of the tire footprint and reduce hydroplaning. However, tires with a circular cross-section, such as those found on racing bicycles, when properly inflated have a sufficiently small footprint to not be susceptible to hydroplaning. For such tires, it is observed that fully slick tires will give superior traction on both wet and dry pavement.

=== Load ===
* &quot;Load sensitivity&quot;: Load sensitivity is the behavior of tires under load. Conventional pneumatic tires do not behave as classical friction theory would suggest. Namely, the load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases.
* &quot;Work load&quot;: The work load of a tire is monitored so that it is not put under undue stress, which may lead to its premature failure. Work load is measured in &quot;Ton Kilometer Per Hour&quot; (TKPH). The measurement&#x27;s appellation and units are the same. The recent shortage and increasing cost of tires for heavy equipment has made TKPH an important parameter in tire selection and equipment maintenance for the mining industry. For this reason, manufacturers of tires for large earth-moving and mining vehicles assign TKPH ratings to their tires based on their size, construction, tread type, and rubber compound. The rating is based on the weight and speed that the tire can handle without overheating and causing it to deteriorate prematurely. The equivalent measure used in the United States is &quot;Ton Mile Per Hour&quot; (TMPH).

=== Wear ===
Tire wear is a major source of rubber pollution. A concern hereby is that vehicle tire wear pollution is unregulated, unlike exhaust emissions.

;Tread wear: This occurs through normal contact with roads or terrain; there are several types of abnormal tread wear. Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain cause accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear to the center of the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear.

;Tread wear indicators (T.W.I.): Raised bars in the tread channels, which indicate that the tread is becoming worn and therefore unsafe. Indicators have been required on all new tires since 1968 in the US. In many countries the Highway Code forbids driving on public roads when the contact surface is flush with any of these bars - this is often defined when the groove depth is approximately 1.5 or 1.6 mm (2/32 inch). TWI can also be used to refer to small arrows or icons on the tire sidewall, indicating the location of the raised wear bars.
;Damage by aging: Tire aging or &quot;thermo-oxidative degradation&quot; can be caused by time, ambient and operating temperatures, partial pressure of O2 in a tire, flex fatigue, or construction and compounding characteristics. For example, prolonged UV exposure leads to rubber&#x27;s chemicals warping, potentially causing dry rot. Various storage methods may slow the aging process, but will not eliminate tire degradation.

==Sizes, codes, standards, and regulatory agencies==
Automotive tires have a variety of identifying markings molded onto the sidewall as a tire code. They denote size, rating, and other information pertinent to that individual tire.

=== Americas ===
The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a U.S. government body within the Department of Transportation (DOT) tasked with regulating automotive safety in the United States. NHTSA established the Uniform Tire Quality Grading System (UTQG), is a system for comparing the performance of tires according to the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 575.104; it requires labeling of tires for tread wear, traction, and temperature. The DOT Code is an alphanumeric character sequence molded into the sidewall of the tire and allows the identification of the tire and its age. The code is mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation but is used worldwide. The DOT Code is also useful in identifying tires subject to product recall or at end of life due to age. The &quot;Tire and Rim Association&quot; (T&amp;RA) is a voluntary U.S. standards organization that promotes the interchangeability of tires, rims, and allied parts. Of particular interest, they publish key tire dimensions, rim contour dimensions, tire valve dimension standards, and load/inflation standards.

The National Institute of Metrology Standardization and Industrial Quality (INMETRO) is the Brazilian federal body responsible for automotive wheel and tire certification.

===Europe===
The European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation (ETRTO) is the European standards organization &quot;to establish engineering dimensions, load/pressure characteristics and operating guidelines&quot;. All tires sold for road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark. The mark itself is either an upper case &quot;E&quot; or lower case &quot;e&quot; – followed by a number in a circle or rectangle, followed by a further number. An (upper case) &quot;E&quot; indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of ECE regulation 30. A (lowercase) &quot;e&quot; indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC. The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the type approval. The last number outside the circle or rectangle is the number of the type approval certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.

The British Rubber Manufacturers Association (BRMA) recommended practice, issued June 2001, states, &quot;BRMA members strongly recommend that unused tires should not be put into service if they are over six years old and that all tires should be replaced ten years from the date of their manufacture.&quot;

===Asia===
The Japanese Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association (JATMA) is the Japanese standards organization for tires, rims, and valves. It performs similar functions as the T&amp;RA and ETRTO.

The China Compulsory Certification (CCC) is a mandatory certification system concerning product safety in China that went into effect in August 2002. The CCC certification system is operated by the State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (AQSIQ) and the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (CNCA).

== Maintenance ==
To maintain tire health, several actions are appropriate, tire rotation, wheel alignment, and, sometimes, retreading the tire.

* &quot;Rotation&quot;: Tires may exhibit irregular wear patterns once installed on a vehicle and partially worn. Front-wheel drive vehicles tend to wear the front tires at a greater rate compared to the rear tires. Tire rotation is moving the tires to different car positions, such as front-to-rear, in order to even out the wear, with the objective of extending the life of the tire.
* &quot;Alignment&quot;: Wheel alignment helps prevent wear due to rotation in a direction other than the path of the vehicle. When mounted on the vehicle, the wheel and tire may not be perfectly aligned to the direction of travel, and therefore may exhibit irregular wear. If the discrepancy in alignment is large, then the irregular wear will become substantial if left uncorrected. Wheel alignment is the procedure for checking and correcting this condition through adjustment of camber, caster, and toe angles. The adjustment of the angles should be done as per the OEM specifications.

=== Inflation ===
Inflation is key to proper wear and rolling resistance of pneumatic tires. Many vehicles have monitoring systems to assure proper inflation. Most passenger cars are advised to maintain a tire pressure within the range of when the tires are not warmed by driving.

* &quot;Specification—&quot; Vehicle manufacturers provide tire specifications, including a recommended cold inflation pressure, to ensure safe operation within the designated load rating and vehicle loading capacity. While many tires feature a maximum pressure rating stamped on them, passenger vehicles and light trucks typically include inflation guidance on a decal located just inside the driver&#x27;s door and in the vehicle owner&#x27;s handbook.
* &quot;Ground contact&quot;: The tire contact patch is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may increase the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. Increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and the tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.
* &quot;Monitoring&quot;: Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are electronic systems that monitor the tire pressures on individual wheels on a vehicle and alert the driver when the pressure goes below a warning limit. There are several types of designs to monitor tire pressure. Some actually measure the air pressure, and some make indirect measurements, such as gauging when the relative size of the tire changes due to lower air pressure.

== Hazards ==

Tire hazards may occur from failure of the tire, itself, or from loss of traction on the surface over which it is rolling. Structural failures of a tire can result in flat tires or more dangerous blowouts. Some of these failures can be caused by manufacture error and may lead to recalls, such as the widespread Firestone tire failures on Ford vehicles that lead to the Firestone and Ford tire controversy in the 1990s.

=== Tire failure ===
Tires may fail for any of a variety of reasons, including:
* &quot;Belt separation&quot; which may be belt-to-belt, tread and belt, or separation of the edge of the belt. Belt-to-belt separation may occur having the tire deflect too much, from high pavement temperatures, road hazard impacts, or other causes that have to do with maintenance and storage.

* &quot;Non-belt separations&quot; include those at the tire tread, in the bead area, in the lower sidewall, between reinforcing plies, and of the reinforcing steel or fabric materials.
* Other types of failure include run-flat damage, chemical degradation, cracking, indentations and bulges.

===Vehicle operation failures===

* &quot;Melting rubber&quot;: As tire rubber compounds heat, owing to the friction of stopping, cornering, or accelerating, they may begin to melt, lubricate the tire-road contact area, and become deposited on the pavement. This effect is stronger with increased ambient temperature.
* &quot;Hydroplaning&quot;: Motor vehicles or aircraft tires passing over a wet pavement may lose contact with sufficient speed or water depth for a given tread design. In this case, the tire contact area is riding on a film of water and loses the friction needed for braking or cornering and begins to &quot;hydroplane&quot; (or &quot;aquaplane&quot;). Hydroplaning may occur as &quot;dynamic hydroplaning&quot; where standing water is present with a depth of at least above the texture of the pavement and speed is sustained above a threshold level. It may also occur as &quot;viscous hydroplaning&quot; whereby tire rubber melts for a brief interval and causes slippage. This may leave deposits of rubber on a runway as airplanes land. Dynamic hydroplaning causes decreased friction and contact with increased tire speed.
* &quot;Snow&quot;: The degree to which a tire can maintain traction in snow depends on its ability to compact snow, which material then develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground. At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction. The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation. The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.
* &quot;Ice&quot;: Ice is typically close to its melting point when a tire travels over it. This, combined with a smooth texture, promotes a low coefficient of friction and reduced traction during braking, cornering or acceleration.
* &quot;Soft ground&quot;: Soil can become lubricated with water, which reduces its ability to maintain shear strength when a tire tries to apply force in acceleration, braking, or cornering. Dry sand also has low shear strength, owing to poor cohesiveness among sand particles.

== Health impacts ==

Tires contain a number of trace toxic chemicals including heavy metals and chemical agents used to increase the durability of the tires. These typically include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzothiazoles, isoprene and heavy metals such as zinc and lead.

As tires are used for vehicle operations, the natural wear of the tire leaves microfine particles equivalent to PM0.1, PM2.5, and PM10 as tire residue. This residue accumulates near roadways and vehicle use areas, but also will travel into the environment through surface runoff. Both humans and animals are exposed to these chemicals at the site of accumulation (i.e. walking on the road surface) and through the accumulation in natural environments and foodchains. A 2023 literature review from Imperial College London, warned of both the toxic chemicals and microplastics produced from tire wear as having potential widespread serious environmental and health consequences.

Moreover, burning of tires releases these chemicals as air pollutants as well as leaving toxic residues, that can have significant effects on local communities and first responders.

== End of use ==

Once tires are discarded, they are considered scrap tires. Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps. Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of heavy metals or other serious pollutants, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound so they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals. Some facilities are permitted to recycle scrap tires by chipping and processing them into new products or selling the material to licensed power plants for fuel. Some tires may also be retreaded for re-use.

===Environmental issues===

Americans generate about 285 million scrap tires per year. Many states have regulations as to the number of scrap tires that can be held on-site, due to concerns with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes. In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields. This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. Mosquitoes create a nuisance and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease. It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel. Some tire fires have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires. Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even groundwater, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire. The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to downwind properties.

The use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial, due to the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces. Zinc is concentrated (up to 2% by weight) to levels high enough to be highly toxic to aquatic life and plants. Of particular concern is evidence that some of the compounds that leach from tires into the water contain hormone disruptors and cause liver lesions.

Tires are a major source of microplastic pollution, found in a 2020 study to contribute 78% of the total mass of microplastics found in the ocean. The commonly-used compound 6PPD-quinone, found entering stormwater runoff via tire-wear particles, has been identified as toxic to coho salmon, brook trout, and rainbow trout.

=== Retreading ===

Tires that are fully worn can be retreaded, re-manufactured to replace the worn tread. This is known as retreading or recapping, a process of buffing away the worn tread and applying a new tread. There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called mold-cure and pre-cure methods. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearography to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.

During the retreading process, retread technicians must ensure the casing is in the best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure. Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected. The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place, and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.

=== Recycling ===
Tires can be recycled into, among other things, the hot melt asphalt, typically as crumb rubber modifier—recycled asphalt pavement (CRM—RAP), and as an aggregate in portland cement concrete. Shredded tires can create rubber mulch on playgrounds to diminish fall injuries. There are some &quot;green&quot; buildings that are being made both private and public buildings that are made from old tires.

The tire pyrolysis method for recycling used tires is a technique that heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an oxygen-free atmosphere and a heat source. In the reactor, the rubber is softened after which the rubber polymers continuously break down into smaller molecules.

=== Other uses ===
Other downstream uses have been developed for worn-out tires, including:

* &quot;Building elements&quot;: Tires filled with earth have been used as garden containers house foundations, bullet-proof walls and to prevent soil erosion in flood plains. Tire walls are a common feature of motor racing circuits for safety.
* &quot;Recreational equipment&quot;: Used tires are employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as American football. One classic conditioning drill that hones players&#x27; speed and agility is the &quot;Tire Run&quot; where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern. Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire. The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping on the tires. Old tires are sometimes converted into a swing for play.
* &quot;Burning tires as protest&quot;: Protestors, worldwide, have burned tires to create black smoke.
* Necklacing is the use of tires to kill people, typically by lynch mobs. A tire is soaked in gasoline, placed around the victim&#x27;s neck, and set on fire.
