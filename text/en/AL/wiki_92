<text>Walter Bruce Willis (born March 19, 1955) is a retired American actor. He achieved fame with a leading role on the comedy-drama series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985–1989) and has appeared in over one hundred films, gaining recognition as an action hero for his portrayal of John McClane in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; franchise (1988–2013).

Willis&#x27;s other credits include &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; (1991), &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (both 2000), &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; (2003), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), &quot;The Expendables&quot;, &quot;Red&quot; (both 2010), &quot;Looper&quot; (2012), and &quot;Glass&quot; (2019). In the last years of his career, he starred in many low-budget direct-to-video films, which were poorly received. Willis retired in 2022 due to aphasia, and was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023.

As a singer, Willis released his debut album, &quot;The Return of Bruno&quot;, in 1987, followed by two more albums in 1989 and 2001. He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of &quot;Misery&quot; in 2015. Willis has received various accolades throughout his career, including a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People&#x27;s Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. Films featuring Willis have grossed between and US$3.05 billion at North American box offices, making him in 2010 the eighth-highest-grossing leading actor.

==Early life and education==
Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein in what was then West Germany. His mother, Marlene, was German, from Kassel, and his father, David Willis, was an American soldier. He has a younger sister, Florence, and two younger brothers, Robert (deceased) and David. After being discharged from the military in 1957, his father relocated the family to his hometown of Carneys Point, New Jersey. Willis has described his background as a &quot;long line of blue-collar people&quot;. His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic and factory worker.

Willis spoke with a stutter. He attended Penns Grove High School in Carneys Point Township, where his schoolmates nicknamed him &quot;Buck-Buck&quot;. Willis joined the drama club, and found that acting on stage reduced his stutter. He was eventually elected student council president. He graduated from Penns Grove in 1973.

After graduating from high school, Willis worked as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported crew members at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater. He turned to acting after working as a private investigator, a role he would later play in the comedy-drama series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and the action-comedy film &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;.

Willis enrolled in the drama program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in a production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. He left the school in 1977, and moved to New York City, where he supported himself in the early 1980s as a bartender at various nightspots in Manhattan including Kamikaze, Cafe Central &amp; Chelsea Central, while living in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood.

== Career ==
===1980s: &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot; and rise to fame===

Willis was cast as David Addison Jr. in the television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985–1989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position. His starring role in &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor. During the show&#x27;s five seasons, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy. During the height of the show&#x27;s success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products. The advertising campaign paid Willis US$5–7 million over two years. Willis chose not to renew his contract when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1987, Willis obtained his first lead role in the Blake Edwards film &quot;Blind Date&quot;, co-starring with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in &quot;Sunset&quot; (1988). The same year, he starred in an action role in &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) as John McClane. He performed most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with &quot;Die Hard&quot;, Willis had a leading role in the drama &quot;In Country&quot; as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1989) and the sequel &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990).

In the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues, &quot;The Return of Bruno&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Respect Yourself&quot; featuring the Pointer Sisters. The LP was promoted by a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;–like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; as a second single; it reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, but was less successful in the US. Willis returned to the recording studio several times.

=== 1990s: &quot;Die Hard&quot; sequels, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and dramatic roles ===

Having acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in &quot;Die Hard&quot;, Willis reprised his role in the sequels &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995). These first three installments in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars. At one point, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, starring Willis&#x27; then wife Demi Moore, would occupy the number one and number two spots at the box office, a feat that would not be accomplished again for a married Hollywood couple until 2024.

In the early 1990s, Willis&#x27;s career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990) and &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (1991), although he did find box office success with &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;. He gained more success with &quot;Striking Distance&quot; (1993) but flopped again with &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994): it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995. &quot;Maxim&quot; also ranked his sex scene in the film as the best in film history.

In 1994, Willis also had a leading role in one part of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Pulp Fiction;&quot; the film&#x27;s success gave a boost to his career, and he starred alongside his &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; co-star John Travolta. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon &quot;Bruno the Kid&quot; which featured a CGI representation of himself. That same year, he starred in Mike Judge&#x27;s animated film &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do America&quot; with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named &quot;Muddy Grimes&quot;, who mistakenly sends Judge&#x27;s titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like &quot;The Jackal&quot; (which despite negative reviews was a box office hit), &quot;Mercury Rising&quot;, and &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, as well as the implosion of the production of &quot;Broadway Brawler&quot;, a debacle salvaged only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed &quot;Armageddon&quot;, which Willis had agreed to star in as compensation for the failed production, and which turned out to be the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. In 1999, Willis played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, which was both a commercial and critical success.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Willis won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on &quot;Friends&quot; (in which he played the father of Ross Geller&#x27;s much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on &quot;Friends&quot;. Also in 2000, Willis played Jimmy &quot;The Tulip&quot; Tudeski in &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; alongside Matthew Perry. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001) but dropped out to work on recording an album. In the sequel, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004), he makes a cameo appearance as himself. In 2005, he appeared in the film adaptation of &quot;Sin City&quot;. In 2006, he lent his voice as RJ the Raccoon in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in the &quot;Planet Terror&quot; half of the double feature &quot;Grindhouse&quot; as the villain, a mutant soldier. This marked Willis&#x27;s second collaboration with the director Robert Rodriguez, following &quot;Sin City&quot;.

Willis appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show on February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis staged elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated birdshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (a parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.

On April 12, 2007, he appeared again, this time wearing a Sanjaya Malakar wig. On his June 25, 2007, appearance, he wore a mini-wind turbine on his head to accompany a joke about his own fictional documentary titled &quot;An Unappealing Hunch&quot; (a wordplay on &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;). Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials. Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged &quot;Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce&quot;, in honor of Willis.

Willis has appeared in five films with Samuel L. Jackson (National Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, and &quot;Glass&quot;) and both actors were slated to work together in &quot;Black Water Transit&quot;, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film &quot;Hostage&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot;, opposite Halle Berry, the crime/drama film &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;, opposite Sharon Stone, and reprised his role as John McClane in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;. Subsequently, he appeared in the films &quot;What Just Happened&quot; and &quot;Surrogates&quot;, based on the comic book of the same name.

Willis was slated to play U.S. Army general William R. Peers in director Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Pinkville&quot;, a drama about the investigation of the 1968 My Lai massacre. However, due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, the film was canceled. Willis appeared on the 2008 Blues Traveler album &quot;North Hollywood Shootout&quot;, giving a spoken word performance over an instrumental blues rock jam on the track &quot;Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob&#x27;s Machine Shop)&quot;. In early 2009, he appeared in an advertising campaign to publicize the insurance company Norwich Union&#x27;s change of name to Aviva.

=== 2010s ===

As of 2010, Willis was the eighth highest-grossing actor in a leading role and 12th-highest including supporting roles. Willis starred with Tracy Morgan in the 2010 comedy &quot;Cop Out&quot;, directed by Kevin Smith, about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card. Willis appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Stylo&quot; by Gorillaz. Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with the former Planet Hollywood co-owners and 80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film &quot;The Expendables&quot;. Willis played the role of CIA agent &quot;Mr. Church&quot;. It was the first time the three action stars had appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, it was one of the most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009. Willis next starred in &quot;Red&quot;, an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.

Willis starred alongside Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Frances McDormand in &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012). Filming took place in Rhode Island under the direction of Wes Anderson, in 2011. Willis returned, in an expanded role, in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; (2012). He appeared alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the sci-fi action film &quot;Looper&quot; (2012), as the older version of Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s character, Joe.

Willis teamed up with 50 Cent in a film directed by David Barrett called &quot;Fire with Fire&quot;, starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a fireman who must save the love of his life. Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in &quot;Lay the Favorite&quot;, directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler. The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.

Willis reprised his most famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, starring in &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot;, which was released on February 14, 2013. In an interview, Willis said, &quot;I have a warm spot in my heart for &quot;Die Hard&quot;... it&#x27;s just the sheer novelty of being able to play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It&#x27;s much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in &quot;Die Hard&quot;. I try to improve my work every time.&quot;

On October 12, 2013, Willis hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Katy Perry as a musical guest. In 2015, Willis made his Broadway debut in William Goldman&#x27;s adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Misery&quot; opposite Laurie Metcalf at the Broadhurst Theatre. His performance was generally panned by critics, who called it &quot;vacant&quot; and &quot;inert&quot;. Willis was the subject of a roast by Comedy Central in a program broadcast on July 29, 2018. Willis played himself in a cameo in the 2019 film &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;.

=== 2020s: Critical decline, health problems and retirement ===

In the final years of his career, Willis starred in many low-budget independent thrillers and science fiction films. He worked primarily with the production companies Emmett/Furla Oasis, headed by Randall Emmett, and 308 Entertainment Inc, headed by Corey Large. Emmett/Furla Oasis produced 20 films starring Willis. 

Described by Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Esquire&quot; as &quot;a profitable safe harbor&quot; for older actors, similar to &quot;The Expendables&quot;, most of the films were released direct-to-video and were widely panned. Willis would often earn US$2 million for two days&#x27; work, with an average of 15 minutes&#x27; screentime per film. He was nonetheless featured heavily in the films&#x27; promotional materials, earning them the derogatory nickname &quot;geezer teasers&quot;. The Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual award for the year&#x27;s worst films and performances, created a dedicated category, the Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 Movie, for Willis&#x27;s roles in eight films released that year.

Those working on the films later said Willis appeared confused, did not understand why he was there and had to be fed lines through an earpiece. Days before Willis was scheduled to arrive on set for &quot;Out of Death&quot; (2021), the screenwriter, Bill Lawrence, was instructed to reduce his role and abbreviate his dialogue, and the director, Mike Burns, was told to complete all of Willis&#x27;s scenes in a single day of filming.

On March 30, 2022, Willis&#x27;s family announced that he was retiring because he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder typically caused by damage to the area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension. The Golden Raspberry Awards retracted its Willis category, deeming it inappropriate to give a Razzie to someone whose performance was affected by a medical condition. At the time of his retirement, Willis had completed 11 films awaiting release.

On February 16, 2023, Willis&#x27;s family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. According to Gregg Day, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s Florida campus, the symptoms include difficulties with language and comprehension, and misinterpretation of instructions. In a statement, the family said that Willis&#x27;s condition had progressed and that &quot;challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease&quot;. They expressed hope that media attention on Willis would raise awareness about the disease.

== Business activities ==

Willis owns houses in Los Angeles and Penns Grove, New Jersey. He also rents apartments at Trump Tower and in Riverside South, Manhattan. In 2000, Willis and his business partner Arnold Rifkin started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;. He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and was one of the first promoters of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Willis and the other actors were paid for their appearances and endorsements through an employee stock ownership plan.

In 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA&#x27;s Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company. In 2018, Willis became the brand ambassador of the Hungarian brand Hell Energy Drink.

== Personal life ==

Willis&#x27;s acting role models are Gary Cooper, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen, and John Wayne. He is left-handed. He resides in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles with his family.

On November 21, 1987, Willis married Demi Moore at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. On December 20, the couple held a second reception for about 450 guests on a soundstage at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank. They have three daughters: Rumer (b. 1988), Scout (b. 1991), and Tallulah (b. 1994). Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998. They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000, and the divorce was finalized later that day. Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, &quot;I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.&quot; He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation. He has maintained a close friendship with both Moore and her subsequent husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding.

Willis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after ten months together. He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009; guests included his three daughters, as well as Moore and Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills six days later. The couple has two daughters, one born in 2012 and another born in 2014.

=== Military interests ===

Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as &quot;In Country&quot;, &quot;The Siege&quot;, &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, and &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;. Willis grew up in a military family. Willis has donated Girl Scout cookies to the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis&#x27;s then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.

In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered US$1 million to any noncombatant who turned in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press was more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:

=== Religious beliefs ===
Willis was a Lutheran, but says he no longer practices. In a July 1998 interview with &quot;George&quot; magazine, he said, &quot;Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn&#x27;t know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that&#x27;s the way. And that&#x27;s what makes America cool, you know?&quot;

When asked by a &quot;Hollywood.tv&quot; reporter how he stays grounded in Hollywood, Willis said, &quot;I just thank God every day for...everything great that&#x27;s come my way.&quot;

=== Political views ===
In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for then Democratic Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis&#x27;s presidential campaign in the 1988 presidential elections. In the 1992 presidential election, however, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. In 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton&#x27;s Republican opponent Bob Dole because Dole criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film &quot;Striptease&quot;. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year.

In 2006, Willis said that the United States should intervene more extensively in Colombia to end drug trafficking from that nation. In several interviews Willis has said that he supports increased salaries for teachers and police officers, and that he is disappointed in the United States foster care system and its treatment of Native Americans. Willis has supported gun rights, saying, &quot;Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.&quot;

In February 2006, when Willis was in Manhattan to promote his film &quot;16 Blocks&quot;, he was asked his opinion on the Bush administration. Willis responded: &quot;I&#x27;m sick of answering this fucking question. I&#x27;m a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I&#x27;m apolitical. Write that down. I&#x27;m not a Republican.&quot; Willis did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.

On August 17, 2006, Willis was named in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; advertisement that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. In the 2012 presidential election, Willis said that he had a negative opinion of Mitt Romney.

<text>Inge de Bruijn (; born 24 August 1973) is a Dutch former competitive swimmer. She is a four-time Olympic champion and a former world record-holder.

==Personal==
De Bruijn was born in Barendrecht, Netherlands. Inge is the sister of Olympic water polo player Matthijs de Bruijn.

==Swimming career==

De Bruijn tried several sports before eventually specialising in swimming. De Bruijn debuted at the World Aquatics Championships in January 1991, winning a bronze medal with the 4×100 m relay team, with which she won the gold medal at the European LC Championships in August of that year.

The following year, de Bruijn made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and finished 8th in the 100 m and 4×100 m freestyle events. She did not compete at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1999, she won the 50 m freestyle at the European Championships. The following year, after having swum several 50 m freestyle world records, she competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She won the 50 and 100 m freestyle, and the 100 m butterfly, setting world records in all three events. She also won a silver medal with the 4×100 m freestyle relay team. Her nickname became &quot;Invincible Inky&quot;.

She was named by &quot;Swimming World&quot; as the &quot;Female World Swimmer of the Year&quot; in both 2000 and 2001. She won titles in three events at the 2001 World Championships. At the 2003 World Championships, de Bruijn successfully defended her 50 m freestyle and butterfly titles. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she defended her gold medal in the 50 m free, and took silver in the 100 m free, and two bronze: one in the 100 m butterfly and another in the 4×100 m relay. This made her the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history. This record was only surpassed by Anthony Ervin at the age of 36, he won the gold medal for the men&#x27;s 50m freestyle at the Rio 2016 Olympics. De Bruijn&#x27;s 2004 title retains its place as the oldest female Olympic champion in swimming history.

With an Olympic medal total of four gold, two silver and two bronze, she is the fourth most successful Dutch Olympian of all time. Moreover, her combined nine individual titles won at the Olympics (four) and World Aquatics Championships (five) were a record for female swimmers until Katie Ledecky won her 10th at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In March 2007, de Bruijn announced her retirement from competitive swimming.

==International championships (50 m)==
: de Bruijn swam only in the heats

==Post-swimming career==
De Bruijn resides in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and previously trained in Portland, Oregon.

She was the face for Dutch lingerie brand &quot;Sapph&quot;, along with kickboxer Remy Bonjasky, the face for the men&#x27;s line of the brand.

She appeared in a special episode of the Dutch naked dating reality television programme &quot;Adam Zkt. Eva VIP&quot;.

<text>Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos or Dragaš Palaeologus (, ; 8 February 140429 May 1453) was the last Byzantine emperor, reigning from 1449 until his death in battle at the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Constantine&#x27;s death marked the definitive end of the Eastern Roman Empire, which traced its origin to Constantine the Great&#x27;s foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire&#x27;s new capital in 330.

Constantine was the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Serbian noblewoman Helena Dragaš. Little is known of his early life, but from the 1420s onward, he repeatedly demonstrated great skill as a military general. Based on his career and surviving contemporary sources, Constantine appears to have been primarily a soldier. This does not mean that Constantine was not also a skilled administrator: he was trusted and favored to such an extent by his older brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, that he was designated as regent twice during John VIII&#x27;s journeys away from Constantinople in 1423–1424 and 1437–1440. In 1427–1428, Constantine and John fended off an attack on the Morea (the Peloponnese) by Carlo I Tocco, ruler of Epirus, and in 1428 Constantine was proclaimed Despot of the Morea and ruled the province together with his older brother Theodore and his younger brother Thomas. Together, they extended Roman rule to cover almost the entire Peloponnese for the first time since the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years before and rebuilt the ancient Hexamilion wall, which defended the peninsula from outside attacks. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Constantine personally led a campaign into Central Greece and Thessaly in 1444–1446, attempting to extend Byzantine rule into Greece once more.

In October 1448, John VIII died without children, and as his favored successor, Constantine was proclaimed emperor on 6 January 1449. During his brief reign, Constantine would have to deal with three main issues. First, there was the issue of an heir, as Constantine was also childless. Despite attempts by Constantine&#x27;s friend and confidant George Sphrantzes to find him a wife, Constantine ultimately died unmarried. The second concern was religious conflict within what little remained of his empire. Emperor Constantine and his predecessor John VIII both believed in the reunion between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches proclaimed at the Council of Florence. They accordingly sought to secure military aid from Catholic Europe, but much of the Byzantine populace, led by Mark of Ephesus, opposed the transformation of the Greek Orthodox Church into the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church; one of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Finally, the most important concern was the growing Ottoman Empire, which by 1449 completely surrounded Constantinople. In April 1453, the Sultan Mehmed II of the House of Osman laid siege to Constantinople with an army perhaps numbering as many as 80,000 men. Even though the city&#x27;s defenders may have numbered less than a tenth of the sultan&#x27;s army, Constantine considered the idea of abandoning Constantinople unthinkable. The emperor stayed to defend the city, which fell on 29 May 1453. On the night before Constantinople fell, the Emperor received Communion from Byzantine Catholic Cardinal Isidore of Kiev. Constantine died in battle on the following day. Although no reliable eyewitness accounts of his death survived, most historical accounts agree that the emperor tore off his Imperial insignia, led a last charge against the Ottomans, and died fighting.

Constantine was the last Christian ruler of Constantinople, which alongside his bravery at the city&#x27;s fall cemented him as a near-legendary figure in later histories and Greek folklore. Some saw the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) under Constantine the Great and its loss under another Constantine as fulfillment of the city&#x27;s destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by a Romulus and lost under another, Romulus Augustulus. He became known in later Greek folklore as the Marble Emperor (, ), reflecting a popular legend that Constantine had not actually died, but had been rescued by an angel and turned into marble, hidden beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople awaiting a call from God to be restored to life and reconquer both the city and the old empire.

== Early life ==

=== Family and background ===

Constantine Dragases Palaiologos was born on 8 February 1404 as the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391–1425), the eighth emperor of the Palaiologos dynasty. Constantine&#x27;s mother (from whom he took his second last name) was Helena Dragaš, member of the powerful House of Dragaš and daughter of Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanović. Through his paternal grandmother, Helena (1333–1396), Constantine was related to the prominent Kantakouzenos family. Constantine is frequently described as &quot;Porphyrogénnētos&quot; (&quot;born in the purple&quot;), a distinction granted to sons born to a reigning emperor in the imperial palace.

Manuel ruled a disintegrating and dwindling Byzantine Empire. The catalyst of Byzantium&#x27;s fall had been the arrival of the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia in the 11th century. Though some emperors, such as Alexios I and Manuel I, had successfully recovered portions of Anatolia through help from western crusaders, their gains were only temporary. Anatolia was the empire&#x27;s most fertile, populated, and wealthy region, and after its loss, Byzantium more or less experienced constant decline. Although most of it was eventually reconquered, the Byzantine Empire was crippled by the 1204 Fourth Crusade and the loss of Constantinople to the Latin Empire, formed by the crusaders. The Byzantine Empire, under the founder of the Palaiologos dynasty, Michael VIII, retook Constantinople in 1261. Over the course of the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks had conquered vast swaths of territories and by 1405, they ruled much of Anatolia, Bulgaria, central Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Thessaly. The Byzantine Empire, once extending throughout the eastern Mediterranean, was reduced to the imperial capital of Constantinople, the Peloponnese, and a handful of islands in the Aegean Sea, and was also forced to pay tribute to the Ottomans.

As the empire dwindled, the emperors concluded that the only way to ensure that their remaining territory was kept intact was to grant some of their holdings to their sons, who received the title of despot, as appanages to defend and govern. Manuel&#x27;s oldest son, John, was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed his father. The second son, Theodore, was designated as the Despot of the Morea (the prosperous province constituting the Peloponnese) and the third son, Andronikos, was proclaimed as Despot of Thessaloniki in 1408. The younger sons; Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas, were kept in Constantinople as there was not sufficient land left to grant them.

Little is known of Constantine&#x27;s early life. From an early age, he was admired by George Sphrantzes (later a famed Byzantine historian), who would later enter his service, and later encomiasts often wrote that Constantine had always been courageous, adventurous, and skilled in martial arts, horsemanship, and hunting. Many accounts of Constantine&#x27;s life, both before and after he became emperor, are heavily skewed and eulogize his reign, as most of them lack contemporary sources and were composed after his death. Based on his actions and the surviving commentary from some of his advisors and contemporaries, Constantine appeared to have been more comfortable with military matters than with matters of state or diplomacy, though he was also a competent administrator—as illustrated by his tenures as regent—and tended to heed his councilors&#x27; advice on important matters of state. Aside from stylized and smudged depictions on seals and coins, no contemporary depictions of Constantine survive. Notable images of Constantine include a seal currently located in Vienna (of unknown provenance, probably from an imperial chrysobull), a few coins, and his portrait among the other Byzantine emperors in the Biblioteca Estense copy of the history of Zonaras. In the latter he is shown with a rounded beard, in noted contrast to his forked-bearded relatives, but it is unclear whether that reflects his actual appearance.

=== Early career ===

After an unsuccessful Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1422, Manuel II suffered a stroke and was left paralyzed in one side of his body. He lived for another three years, but the empire&#x27;s government was effectively in the hands of Constantine&#x27;s brother John. Thessaloniki was also under siege by the Ottomans; to prevent it from falling into their hands, John gave the city to the Republic of Venice. As Manuel II had once hoped years ago, John hoped to rally support from Western Europe, and he left Constantinople in November 1423 to travel to Venice and Hungary. By this time, Manuel had abandoned his hope of western aid and had even attempted to dissuade John from pursuing it. Manuel believed that an eventual church union, which would become John&#x27;s goal, would only antagonize the Turks and the empire&#x27;s populace, which could have started a civil war.

John was impressed by his brother&#x27;s actions during the 1422 Ottoman siege, and trusted him more than his other brothers. Constantine was given the title of despot and was left to rule Constantinople as regent. With the aid of his bedridden father Manuel, Constantine drew up a new peace treaty with the Ottoman sultan Murad II, who momentarily spared Constantinople from further Turkish attacks. John returned from his journey in November 1424 after failing to procure help. On 21 July 1425, Manuel died and John became the senior emperor, John VIII Palaiologos. Constantine was granted a strip of land to the north of Constantinople that extended from the town of Mesembria in the north to Derkos in the south. It also included the port of Selymbria as his appanage in 1425. Although this strip of land was small, it was close to Constantinople and strategically important, which demonstrated that Constantine was trusted by both Manuel II and John.

After Constantine&#x27;s successful tenure as regent, John deemed his brother loyal and capable. Because their brother Theodore expressed his discontent over his position as Despot of the Morea to John during the latter&#x27;s visit in 1423, John soon recalled Constantine from Mesembria and designated him as Theodore&#x27;s successor. Theodore eventually changed his mind, but John would eventually assign Constantine to the Morea as a despot in 1427 after a campaign there. Though Theodore was content to rule in the Morea, historian Donald Nicol believes that the support was helpful, as the peninsula was repeatedly threatened by external forces throughout the 1420s. In 1423, the Ottomans broke through the ancient Hexamilion wall—which guarded the Peloponnese—and devastated the Morea. The Morea was also constantly threatened by Carlo I Tocco, the Italian ruler of Epirus, who campaigned against Theodore shortly before the Ottoman invasion and again in 1426, occupying territory in the northwestern parts of the Morea.

In 1427, John VIII personally set out to deal with Tocco, bringing Constantine and Sphrantzes with him. On 26 December 1427, the two brothers reached Mystras, the capital of the Morea, and made their way to the town of Glarentza, which was captured by the Epirotes. In the Battle of the Echinades, a naval skirmish off the coast of Glarentza, Tocco was defeated and he agreed to relinquish his conquests in the Morea. In order to seal the peace, Tocco offered his niece, Creusa Tocco (whose name was later changed to the Greek &quot;Theodora&quot;), in marriage to Constantine, her dowry being Glarentza and the other Moreot territories. Glarentza was given to the Byzantines on 1 May 1428 and on 1 July, Constantine married Theodora.

== Despot of the Morea ==

=== Early rule in the Morea ===

The transfer of Tocco&#x27;s conquered Moreot territories to Constantine complicated the Morea&#x27;s government structure. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as a third Despot of the Morea, which meant that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities. Theodore did not share control over Mystras with Constantine or Thomas; instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of Aigio, fortresses and towns in Laconia (in the south), and Kalamata and Messenia in the west. Constantine made Glarentza, which he was entitled to by marriage, his capital. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of Kalavryta. During his tenure as despot, Constantine was brave and energetic, but generally cautious.
Shortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, joined forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategically important port of Patras in the northwest of the Morea, which was ruled by its Catholic Archbishop, (Theodore&#x27;s brother-in-law). The campaign ended in failure, possibly due to Theodore&#x27;s reluctant participation and Thomas&#x27; inexperience. Constantine confided with Sphrantzes and John at a secret meeting in Mystras that he would make a second attempt to retake Patras by himself; if he failed, he would return to his old appanage by the Black Sea. Constantine and Sphrantzes, confident that the city&#x27;s many Greek inhabitants would support their takeover, marched towards Patras on 1 March 1429, and they besieged the city on 20 March. The siege developed into a long and drawn-out engagement, with occasional skirmishes. At one point, Constantine&#x27;s horse was shot and killed under him and the despot nearly died, being saved by Sphrantzes at the cost of Sphrantzes being captured by the defenders of Patras (though he would be released, albeit in a state of near-death, on 23 April). After almost two months, the defenders opened up to the possibility of negotiation in May. Malatesta journeyed to Italy in an attempt to recruit reinforcements and the defenders agreed that if he did not return to them by the end of the month, Patras would surrender. Constantine agreed to this and withdrew his army. On 1 June, Constantine returned to the city and, since the Archbishop had not returned, met with the city&#x27;s leaders in the city&#x27;s Cathedral of St. Andrew on 4 June and they accepted him as their new lord. The Archbishop&#x27;s castle, located on a nearby hill, held out against Constantine for another 12 months before surrendering.

Constantine&#x27;s capture of Patras was seen as an affront by the Pope, the Venetians, and the Ottomans. In order to pacify any threats, Constantine sent ambassadors to all three, with Sphrantzes being sent to talk with Turahan, the Ottoman governor of Thessaly. Although Sphrantzes was successful in removing the threat of Turkish reprisal, the threat from the west was realized as the dispossessed Archbishop arrived at the head of a mercenary army of Catalans. Unfortunately for Malatesta, the Catalans had little interest in helping him recover Patras, and they attacked and seized Glarentza instead, which Constantine had to buy back from them for 6,000 Venetian ducats, and began plundering the Moreot coastline. To prevent Glarentza from being seized by pirates, Constantine eventually ordered it to be destroyed. During this perilous time, Constantine suffered another loss: Theodora died in November 1429. The grief-stricken Constantine first had her buried at Glarentza, but then moved to Mystras. Once the Archbishop&#x27;s castle surrendered to Constantine in July 1430, the city was fully restored to Byzantine rule after 225 years of foreign occupation. In November, Sphrantzes was rewarded by being proclaimed as the city&#x27;s governor.

By the early 1430s, the efforts of Constantine and his younger brother Thomas had ensured that nearly all of the Peloponnese was under Byzantine rule again since the Fourth Crusade. Thomas ended the Principality of Achaea by marrying Catherine Zaccaria, daughter and heir of the final prince, Centurione II Zaccaria. When Centurione died in 1432, Thomas took control of all his remaining territories by right of marriage. The only lands in the Peloponnese remaining under foreign rule were the few port towns and cities still held by the Republic of Venice. Sultan Murad II felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, Turahan sent his troops south on Murad&#x27;s orders to demolish the Hexamilion wall in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan&#x27;s vassals.

=== Second tenure as regent ===

In March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement (presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII) with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for Elis, which Thomas made his new capital. Relationships between the three despots eventually soured. John VIII had no sons to succeed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII&#x27;s preferred successor was known to be Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had a good relationship with his older brother, it was resented by Constantine&#x27;s older brother Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore falsely believed it was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, and he travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch Gregory Mammas was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. The brothers agreed that Constantine was to return to Constantinople, while Theodore and Thomas would remain in the Morea. John needed Constantine in Constantinople as he was departing for Italy soon. On 24 September 1437, Constantine reached Constantinople. Although he was not proclaimed as co-emperor, his appointment as regent for a second time, suggested to John by their mother Helena, indicated that he was to be regarded as John&#x27;s intended heir.

John left for Italy in November to attend the Council of Ferrara in an effort to unite the Eastern and Western churches. Although many in the Byzantine Empire opposed a union of the Churches, as it would mean religious submission under the Papacy, John viewed a union as necessary. The papacy did not view the situation of the Christians in the East as something positive, but it would not call for any aid to the disintegrating empire if it did not acknowledge obedience to the Catholic Church and renounce what Catholics perceived as errors. John brought a large delegation to Italy, including Joseph II, the Patriarch of Constantinople; representatives of the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem; large numbers of bishops, monks, and priests; and his younger brother Demetrios. Demetrios showed opposition against a church union, but John decided not to leave him in the East since Demetrios had shown rebellious tendencies and was thought to try to take the throne with Ottoman support. Constantine was not left without supporting courtiers in Constantinople: Constantine&#x27;s and John&#x27;s cousin Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos and the experienced statesman Loukas Notaras were left in the city. Helena and Sphrantzes were also there to advise Constantine. In 1438, Constantine served as the best man at Sphrantzes&#x27; wedding, and would later become the godfather to two of Sphrantzes&#x27; children.

During John&#x27;s absence from Constantinople, the Ottomans abided by the previously established peace. Trouble appeared to have brewed only once: in early 1439, Constantine wrote to his brother in Italy to remind the Pope that the Byzantines had been promised two warships by the end of spring. Constantine hoped that the ships would leave Italy within fifteen days, as he believed that Murad II was planning a strong offensive against Constantinople. Although the ships were not sent, Constantinople was not in danger as Murad&#x27;s campaign focused on taking Smederevo in Serbia.

In June 1439, the council in Florence, Italy, declared that the churches had been reunited. John returned to Constantinople on 1 February 1440. Although he was received with a grand ceremony organized by Constantine and Demetrios (who had returned sometime earlier), the news of the unification stirred a wave of resentment and bitterness among the general populace, who felt that John had betrayed their faith and their world view. Many feared the union would arouse suspicion among the Ottomans. Constantine&#x27;s agreed with his brother&#x27;s views on the union: if a sacrifice of the independence of their church resulted in the Westerners organizing a crusade and saving Constantinople, it would not have been in vain.

=== Second marriage and Ottoman threats ===
Despite having been relieved of his duties as regent upon John&#x27;s return, Constantine stayed in the capital for the rest of 1440. He may have stayed in order to find a suitable wife, wishing to remarry since it had been more than ten years since Theodora&#x27;s death. He decided on Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino I Gattilusio, the Genoese lord of the island Lesbos. Sphrantzes was sent to Lesbos in December 1440 to propose and arrange the marriage. In late 1441, Constantine sailed to Lesbos with Sphrantzes and Loukas Notaras, and in August he married Caterina. In September, he left Lesbos, leaving Caterina with her father on Lesbos, to travel to the Morea.

Upon his return to the Morea, Constantine observed that Theodore and Thomas had ruled well without him. He believed that he could serve the empire&#x27;s needs better if he was closer to the capital. His younger brother Demetrios governed Constantine&#x27;s former appanage around Mesembria in Thrace, and Constantine pondered the possibility that he and Demetrios could switch places, with Constantine regaining the Black Sea appanage and Demetrios being granted Constantine&#x27;s holdings in the Morea. Constantine sent Sphrantzes to propose the idea to both Demetrios and Murad II, who by this point had to be consulted about any appointments.

By 1442, Demetrios had no desire for new appointments and was eyeing the imperial throne. He had just made a deal with Murad himself and raised an army, portraying himself as the champion of the Turk-supported cause that opposed the union of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and declared war on John. When Sphrantzes reached Demetrios to forward Constantine&#x27;s offer, Demetrios was already preparing to march on Constantinople. The danger he posed to the city was so great that Constantine was summoned from the Morea by John to oversee the city&#x27;s defenses. In April 1442, Demetrios and the Ottomans began their attack and in July, Constantine left the Morea to relieve his brother in the capital. On the way, Constantine met his wife at Lesbos and together they sailed to Lemnos, where they were stopped by an Ottoman blockade and were trapped for months. Although Venice sent ships to assist them, Caterina fell ill and died in August; she was buried at Myrina on Lemnos. Constantine did not reach Constantinople until November and by then, the Ottoman attack had already been repelled. Demetrios&#x27; punishment was a brief imprisonment. In March 1443, Sphrantzes was made governor of Selymbria in Constantine&#x27;s name. From Selymbria, Sphrantzes and Constantine were able to keep a watchful eye on Demetrios&#x27; activities. In November, Constantine relinquished control of Selymbria to Theodore, who had abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, which made Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea and gave Constantine Mystras, the despotate&#x27;s prosperous capital.

=== Despot at Mystras ===

With Theodore and Demetrios gone, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea. By this time, the Morea was the cultural center of the Byzantine world and provided a more hopeful atmosphere than Constantinople. Patrons of art and science had settled there at Theodore&#x27;s invitation and churches, monasteries, and mansions continued to be built. The two Palaiologos brothers hoped to make the Morea into a safe and nearly self-sufficient principality. The philosopher Gemistus Pletho, employed in Constantine&#x27;s service, said that while Constantinople had once been the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the &quot;New Sparta&quot;, a centralized and strong Hellenic kingdom in its own right.

One of the projects of the brothers&#x27; plan to strengthen the despotate was the reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall, which was destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall by March 1444. The project impressed many of their subjects and contemporaries, including the Venetian lords in the Peloponnese, who had politely declined to help with its funding. The restoration had cost much in both money and manpower; many of the Moreot landowners had momentarily fled to Venetian lands to avoid financing the venture while others had rebelled before being compelled through military means. Constantine attempted to attract the loyalty of the Moreot landowners by granting them both further lands and various privileges. He also staged local athletic games, where young Moreots could run races for prizes.

In the summer of 1444, perhaps encouraged by news from the west that a crusade had set out from Hungary in 1443, Constantine invaded the Latin Duchy of Athens, his direct northern neighbor and an Ottoman vassal. Through Sphrantzes, Constantine was in contact with Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who along with Władysław III of Poland and Hungary was one of the leaders of the crusade. Cesarini was made aware of Constantine&#x27;s intentions and that he was ready to aid the crusade in striking at the Ottomans from the south. Constantine swiftly captured Athens and Thebes, which forced Duke Nerio II Acciaioli to pay the tribute to him instead of the Ottomans. The recapture of Athens was seen as a particularly glorious feat. One of Constantine&#x27;s counsellors compared the despot to the legendary ancient Athenian general Themistocles. Although the crusading army was destroyed by the Ottoman army led by Murad II at the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444, Constantine was not deterred. His initial campaign had been remarkably successful and he had also received foreign support from Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, who had sent him 300 soldiers. With the Burgundian soldiers and his own men, Constantine raided central Greece as far north as the Pindus mountains in Thessaly, where the locals happily welcomed him as their new lord. As Constantine&#x27;s campaign progressed, one of his governors, Constantine Kantakouzenos, also made his way north, attacked Thessaly, and seized the town of Lidoriki from the Ottomans. The townspeople were so excited at their liberation that they renamed the town to Kantakouzinopolis in his honor.

Tiring of Constantine&#x27;s successes, Murad II, accompanied by Duke Nerio II of Athens, marched on the Morea in 1446, with an army possibly numbering as many as 60,000 men. Despite the overwhelming number of Ottoman troops, Constantine refused to surrender his gains in Greece and instead prepared for battle. The Ottomans quickly restored control over Thessaly; Constantine and Thomas rallied at the Hexamilion wall, which the Ottomans reached on 27 November. Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as 20,000 men, to defend it. Although the wall might have held against the great Ottoman army under normal circumstances, Murad had brought cannons with him and by 10 December, the wall had been reduced to rubble and most of the defenders were either killed or captured; Constantine and Thomas barely escaped the catastrophic defeat. Turahan was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine&#x27;s lands while Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese. Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad only wanted to instill terror and did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time. The Turks left the peninsula devastated and depopulated. Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord, pay him tribute, and promise to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.

== Reign as emperor ==

=== Accession to the throne ===

Theodore, once Despot of the Morea, died in June 1448 and on 31 October that same year, John VIII Palaiologos died in Constantinople. Compared to his other living brothers, Constantine was the most popular of the Palaiologoi, both in the Morea and in the capital. It was well known that John&#x27;s favored successor was Constantine and ultimately, the will of Helena Dragaš (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed in the matter. Both Thomas, who appeared to have had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine left the Morea. Although many favored Demetrios for his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, and stalled Demetrios&#x27; attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine&#x27;s appointment and Demetrios was overruled, though he later proclaimed Constantine as his new emperor. Soon thereafter, Sphrantzes informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the appointment on 6 December 1448. With the issue of succession peacefully resolved, Helena sent two envoys, Manuel Palaiologos Iagros and Alexios Philanthropenos Laskaris, to the Morea to proclaim Constantine as emperor and bring him to the capital. Thomas also accompanied them.
In a small civil ceremony at Mystras, possibly in one of the churches or in the Despot&#x27;s Palace, on 6 January 1449, Constantine was proclaimed Emperor of the Romans. He was not given a crown; instead, Constantine may have put on another type of imperial headgear, a , on his head with his own hands. Although emperors were traditionally crowned in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, there was historical precedent for smaller and local ceremonies: centuries ago, Manuel I Komnenos had been given the title of emperor by his dying father, John II Komnenos, in Cilicia; Constantine&#x27;s great-grandfather, John VI Kantakouzenos, had been proclaimed emperor at Didymoteicho in Thrace. Both Manuel I and John VI had been careful to perform the traditional coronation ceremony in Constantinople once they reached the capital. In Constantine&#x27;s case, no such ceremony was ever performed. Both Constantine and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory III Mammas, were supporters of the Union of the Churches: a ceremony in which Gregory crowned Constantine emperor might have led the anti-unionists in the capital to rebel. Constantine&#x27;s rise to emperor was controversial: although he was accepted on account of his lineage with few alternative candidates, his lack of a full coronation and support for the Union of the Churches damaged public perception of the new emperor.

Careful not to anger the anti-unionists through being crowned by Gregory III, Constantine believed that his proclamation at Mystras had sufficed as an imperial coronation and had given him all the constitutional rights of the one true emperor. In his earliest known imperial document, a chrysobull from February 1449, he refers to himself as &quot;Constantine Palaiologos in Christ true Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot;. Constantine arrived at Constantinople on 12 March 1449, having been provided means of travel by a Catalan ship.

Constantine was well prepared for his accession to the throne after serving as regent twice and ruling numerous fiefs throughout the crumbling empire. By Constantine&#x27;s time, Constantinople was a shadow of its former glory; the city never truly recovered from the 1204 sack by the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade. Instead of the grand imperial capital it once was, 15th century Constantinople was an almost rural network of population centers, with many of the city&#x27;s churches and palaces, including the former imperial palace, abandoned and in disrepair. Instead of the former imperial palace, the Palaiologoi emperors used the Palace of Blachernae, located considerably closer to the city&#x27;s walls, as their main residence. The city&#x27;s population had declined significantly due to the Latin occupation, the 14th century civil wars, and outbreaks of the Black Death in 1347, 1409 and 1410. By the time Constantine became emperor, only about 50,000 people lived in the city.

One of Constantine&#x27;s most pressing concerns was the Ottomans. One of his first acts as emperor, just two weeks after arriving in the capital, was to attempt to secure the empire by arranging a truce with Murad II. He sent an ambassador, Andronikos Iagaris, to the sultan. Iagaris was successful, and the agreed-upon truce also included Constantine&#x27;s brothers in the Morea to secure the province from further Ottoman attacks. In order to remove his rebellious brother Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine had made Demetrios his replacement as Despot of the Morea to rule the despotate alongside Thomas. Demetrios was granted Constantine&#x27;s former capital, Mystras, and given authority over the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, while Thomas ruled the northwest and Corinthia alternating between Patras and Leontari as his place of residence.

Constantine tried to hold numerous discussions with the anti-unionists in the capital, who had organized themselves as a &quot;synaxis&quot; to oppose Patriarch Gregory III&#x27;s authority, on account of him being a unionist. Constantine was not a fanatical unionist and merely viewed the Union of the Churches as necessary for the empire&#x27;s survival. The unionists found this argument to be baseless and materialistic, believing that help would be more likely to come through trust in God than a western crusading campaign.

Another pressing concern was the continuation of the imperial family as neither Constantine nor his brothers had male children at the time. In February 1449, Constantine had sent Manuel Dishypatos as an envoy to Italy to speak with Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in order to secure military aid against the Ottomans and forge a marriage alliance. The intended match was the daughter of Alfonso&#x27;s nephew, Beatrice of Coimbra, but the alliance failed. In October 1449, Constantine sent Sphrantzes to the east to visit the Empire of Trebizond and the Kingdom of Georgia and see if there were any suitable brides there. Sphrantzes, accompanied by a large retinue of priests, nobles, musicians and soldiers, left the capital for nearly two years.

While at the court of Emperor John IV Megas Komnenos in Trebizond, Sphrantzes was made aware that Murad II had died. Though John IV saw this as positive news, Sphrantzes was more anxious: the old sultan had grown tired and had given up all hope of conquering Constantinople. His young son and successor, Mehmed II, was ambitious, young and energetic. Sphrantzes had the idea that the sultan could be dissuaded from invading Constantinople if Constantine married Murad II&#x27;s widow, Mara Branković. Constantine supported the idea when he received Sphrantzes&#x27; report in May 1451 and sent envoys to Serbia, where Mara had returned to after Murad II&#x27;s death. Many of Constantine&#x27;s courtiers opposed the idea due to a distrust of the Serbians, causing Constantine to question the viability of the match. Ultimately, the opposition of the courtiers to the marriage proved pointless: Mara had no wish to remarry, as she vowed to live a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her life once released from the Ottomans. Sphrantzes then decided that a Georgian bride would suit the emperor best and returned to Constantinople in September 1451, bringing a Georgian ambassador with him. Constantine thanked Sphrantzes for his efforts and they agreed that Sphrantzes was to return to Georgia in the spring of 1452 and forge a marriage alliance. Due to mounting tensions with the Ottomans, Sphrantzes ultimately did not return to Georgia.

On 23 March 1450, Helena Dragaš died. She was highly respected among the Byzantines and was mourned deeply. Gemistus Pletho, the Moreot philosopher previously at Constantine&#x27;s court in the Morea, and Gennadios Scholarios, future Patriarch of Constantinople, both wrote funeral orations praising her. Pletho praised Helena&#x27;s fortitude and intellect, and compared her to legendary Greek heroine Penelope on account of her prudence. Constantine&#x27;s other advisors were often at odds with the emperor and each other. Her death left Constantine unsure of which advisor to rely on the most. Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, the &quot;megas domestikos&quot; (or commander-in-chief), disagreed with the emperor on a number of matters, including the decision to marry a Georgian princess instead of an imperial princess from Trebizond. The most powerful figure at the court was Loukas Notaras, an experienced statesman and &quot;megas doux&quot; (commander-in-chief of the navy). Although Sphrantzes disliked Notaras, he was a close friend of Constantine. As the Byzantine Empire no longer had a navy, Notaras&#x27; position was more of an informal prime minister-type role than a position of military command. Notaras believed that Constantinople&#x27;s massive defenses would stall any attack on the city and allow western Christians to aid them in time. Due to his influence and friendship with the emperor, Constantine was likely influenced by his hopes and ideas. Sphrantzes was promoted to &quot;First Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe&quot;: his office gave him near unhindered access to the imperial residence and a position to influence the emperor. Sphrantzes was even more cautious towards the Ottomans than Notaras, and believed the &quot;megas doux&quot; risked antagonizing the new sultan. Although Sphrantzes also approved of appealing to the west for aid, he believed that any appeals had to be highly discreet in order to avoid Ottoman attention.

=== Search for allies ===

Shortly after Murad II&#x27;s death, Constantine was quick to send envoys to the new Sultan Mehmed II in an attempt to arrange a new truce. Mehmed supposedly received Constantine&#x27;s envoys with great respect and put their minds to rest through swearing by Allah, the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, and the angels and archangels that he would live in peace with the Byzantines and their emperor for the rest of his life. Constantine was unconvinced and suspected that Mehmed&#x27;s mood could abruptly change in the future. In order to prepare for the future possibility of Ottoman attack, Constantine needed to secure alliances and the most powerful realms that might be inclined to aid him were in the West.

The nearest and most concerned potential ally was Venice, which operated a large commercial colony in their quarter of Constantinople. However, the Venetians were not to be trusted. During the first few months of his rule as emperor, Constantine had raised the taxes on the goods the Venetians imported to Constantinople since the imperial treasury was nearly empty and funds had to be raised through some means. In August 1450, the Venetians had threatened to transfer their trade to another port, perhaps one under Ottoman control, and despite Constantine writing to the Doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari, in October 1450, the Venetians were unconvinced and signed a formal treaty with Mehmed II in 1451. To annoy the Venetians, Constantine attempted to seal a deal with the Republic of Ragusa in 1451, offering them a place to trade in Constantinople with limited tax concessions, though the Ragusans could offer little military aid to the empire.

Most of the kingdoms in Western Europe were occupied with their own wars at the time and the crushing defeat at the Battle of Varna had quelled most of the crusading spirit. The news that Murad II had died and been succeeded by his young son also lulled the western Europeans into a false sense of security. To the papacy, the Union of the Churches was a far more pressing concern than the threat of Ottoman attack. In August 1451, Constantine&#x27;s ambassador Andronikos Bryennios Leontaris arrived in Rome to deliver a letter to Pope Nicholas V, which contained a statement from the anti-unionist &quot;synaxis&quot; at Constantinople. Constantine hoped that the Pope would read the letter and understand Constantine&#x27;s difficulties with making the Union of the Churches a reality in the east. The letter contained the &quot;synaxis&quot;&#x27;s proposal that a new council be held at Constantinople, with an equal number of representatives from both churches (since the Orthodox had been heavily outnumbered at the previous council). On 27 September, Nicholas V replied to Constantine after he heard that the unionist Patriarch Gregory III had resigned following the opposition against him. Nicholas V merely wrote that Constantine had to try harder to convince his people and clergy and that the price of further military aid from the west was full acceptance of the union achieved at Florence; the name of the Pope had to be commemorated in the churches in Greece and Gregory III had to be reinstated as patriarch. The ultimatum was a setback for Constantine, who had done his best to enforce the union without inciting riots in Constantinople. The Pope appeared to have completely ignored the sentiment of the anti-unionist &quot;synaxis&quot;. Nicholas V sent a papal legate, Cardinal Isidore of Kiev, to Constantinople to attempt to help Constantine enforce the union, but Isidore did not arrive until October 1452, when the city faced more pressing concerns.

=== Dealings with Mehmed II ===

A great-grandson of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, Orhan Çelebi, lived as a hostage in Constantinople. Other than Mehmed II, Orhan was the only known living male member of the Ottoman dynasty, and thus was a potential rival claimant to the sultanate. Mehmed had previously agreed to pay annually for Orhan being kept at Constantinople, but in 1451, Constantine sent a message to the sultan complaining that the payment was not sufficient and hinted that unless more money was paid, Orhan might be released, possibly sparking an Ottoman civil war. The strategy of attempting to use hostage Ottoman princes had been used before by Constantine&#x27;s father Manuel II, but it was a risky one. Mehmed&#x27;s grand vizier, Çandarlı Halil Pasha, received the message at Bursa and was appalled at the threat, considering the Byzantine to be inept. Halil had long been relied upon by the Byzantines, through bribes and friendship, to maintain peaceful relations with the Ottomans, but his influence over Mehmed was limited and he was ultimately loyal to the Ottomans, not the Byzantines. Because of the blatant provocation to the sultan, he lost his temper with the Byzantine messengers, supposedly shouting:

Constantine and his advisors had catastrophically misjudged the determination of the new sultan. Throughout his brief reign, Constantine and his advisors had been unable to form an effective foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire. Constantine mainly continued the policy of his predecessors, doing what he could to brace Constantinople for attack, but also alternated between supplicating and confronting the Ottomans. Constantine&#x27;s advisors had little knowledge and expertise on the Ottoman court and disagreed in how to deal with the Ottoman threat and as Constantine wavered between the opinions of his different councillors, his policy towards Murad and Mehmed was not coherent and resulted in disaster.

Mehmed II considered Constantine to have broken the terms of their 1449 truce and quickly revoked the small concessions he had given to the Byzantines. The threat of releasing Orhan gave Mehmed a pretext for concentrating all of his efforts on seizing Constantinople, his true goal since he had become sultan. Mehmed believed that the conquest of Constantinople was essential to the survival of the Ottoman state: by taking the city, he would prevent any potential crusade from using it as a base and prevent it falling into the hands of a rival more dangerous than the Byzantines. Furthermore, Mehmed had an intense interest in ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine history, his childhood heroes being figures like Achilles and Alexander the Great.

Mehmed began preparations immediately. In the spring of 1452, work had begun on the Rumelihisarı castle, constructed on the western side of the Bosporus strait, opposite to the already existing Anadoluhisarı castle on the eastern side. With the two castles, Mehmed could control sea traffic in the Bosporus and could blockade Constantinople both by land and sea. Constantine, horrified by the implications of the construction project, protested that Mehmed&#x27;s grandfather Mehmed I had respectfully asked the permission of Emperor Manuel II before constructing the eastern castle and reminded the sultan of their existing truce. Based on his actions in the Morea, especially during at the time of the Crusade of Varna, Constantine was clearly anti-Turkish and he preferred himself to take aggressive action against the Ottoman Empire; his attempts to appeal to Mehmed were simply a stalling tactic. Mehmed&#x27;s response to Constantine was that the area he built the fortress on had been uninhabited and that Constantine owned nothing outside of Constantinople&#x27;s walls.

As panic ensued in Constantinople, the Rumelihisarı was completed in August 1452, intended not only to serve as a means to blockade Constantinople but also as the base from which Mehmed&#x27;s conquest of Constantinople was to be directed. To clear the site of the new castle, some local churches were demolished, which angered the local Greek populace. The Ottomans had sent some animals to graze on Byzantine farmland on the shores of the Sea of Marmara, which also angered the locals. Outraged, Constantine formally declared war on Mehmed II, closing the gates of Constantinople and arresting all Turks within the city walls. Seeing the futility in this move, Constantine renounced his actions three days later and set the prisoners free. After the capture of several Italian ships and the execution of their crews during Mehmed&#x27;s eventual siege of Constantinople, Constantine reluctantly ordered the execution of all Turks within the city walls.

Constantine began to prepare for what was at best a blockade, and at worst a siege, gathering provisions and working to repair Constantinople&#x27;s walls. Manuel Palaiologos Iagros, one of the envoys who had invested Constantine as emperor in 1449, was put in charge of the restoration of the formidable walls, a project which was completed late in 1452. He sent more urgent requests for aid to the west. Near the end of 1451, he had sent a message to Venice stating that unless they sent reinforcements to him at once, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Although the Venetians were sympathetic to the Byzantine cause, they explained in their reply in February 1452 that although they could ship armor and gunpowder to him, they had no troops to spare as they were fighting against neighboring city-states in Italy at the time. When the Ottomans sank a Venetian trading ship in the Bosporus in November 1452 and executed the ship&#x27;s survivors on account of the ship refusing to pay a new toll instituted by Mehmed, the Venetian attitude changed as they now also found themselves at war with the Ottomans. Desperate for aid, Constantine sent pleas for reinforcements to his brothers in the Morea and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, promising the latter the island of Lemnos if he brought help. The Hungarian warrior John Hunyadi was invited to help and was promised Selymbria or Mesembria if he came with aid. The Genoese on the island Chios were also sent a plea, being promised payment in return for military assistance. Constantine received little practical response to his pleas.

=== Religious disunity in Constantinople ===

Above all, Constantine sent many appeals for aid to Pope Nicholas V. Although sympathetic, Nicholas V believed that the papacy could not go to the rescue of the Byzantines unless they fully accepted the Union of the Churches and his spiritual authority. Furthermore, he knew that the papacy alone could not do much against the formidable Ottoman Turks, a similar response to one given by Venice, which promised military assistance only if others in Western Europe also came to Constantinople&#x27;s defense. On 26 October 1452, Nicholas V&#x27;s legate, Isidore of Kiev, arrived at Constantinople together with the Latin Archbishop of Mytilene, Leonard of Chios. With them, they brought a small force of 200 Neapolitan archers. Though they made little difference in coming battle, the reinforcements were probably more appreciated by Constantinople&#x27;s citizens than the actual purpose of Isidore&#x27;s and Leonard&#x27;s visit: cementing the Union of the Churches. Their arrival in the city spurred the anti-unionists into a frenzy. On 13 September 1452, a month before Isidore and Leonard arrived, the lawyer and anti-unionist Theodore Agallianos had written a short chronicle of contemporary events, concluding with the following words:

Constantine and his brother John VIII before him had badly misjudged the level of opposition against the church union. Loukas Notaras was successful in calming down the situation in Constantinople somewhat, explaining to an assembly of nobles that the Catholic visit was made with good intentions and that the soldiers who had accompanied Isidore and Leonard might just be an advance guard; more military aid might have been on its way. Many nobles were convinced that a spiritual price could be paid for material rewards and that if they were rescued from the immediate danger, there would be time later to think more clearly in a calmer atmosphere. George Sphrantzes suggested to Constantine that he name Isidore as the new Patriarch of Constantinople as Gregory III had not been seen for some time and was unlikely to return. Although such an appointment might have gratified the pope and led to further aid being sent, Constantine realized that it would only stir up the anti-unionists more. Once the people of Constantinople realized that no further immediate aid in addition to the 200 soldiers was coming from the papacy, they rioted in the streets.

Leonard of Chios confided in the emperor that he believed him to be far too lenient with the anti-unionists, urging him to arrest their leaders and try harder to push back the opposition to the Union of the Churches. Constantine opposed the idea, perhaps under the assumption that arresting the leaders would turn them into martyrs for their cause. Instead, Constantine summoned the leaders of the &quot;synaxis&quot; to the imperial palace on 15 November 1452, and once again asked them to write a document with their objections to the union achieved at Florence, which they were eager to do. On 25 November, the Ottomans sank another Venetian trading ship with cannon fire from the new Rumelihisarı castle, an event which captured the minds of the Byzantines and united them in fear and panic. As a result, the anti-unionist cause gradually died down. On 12 December, a Catholic liturgy commemorating the names of the Pope and Patriarch Gregory III was held in the Hagia Sophia by Isidore. Constantine and his court were present, as was a large number of the city&#x27;s citizens (Isidore stated that all of its inhabitants attended the ceremony).

=== Final preparations ===

Constantine&#x27;s brothers in the Morea could not bring him any help: Turahan had been called on by Mehmed to invade and devastate the Morea again in October 1452 to keep the two despots occupied. The Morea was devastated, with Constantine&#x27;s brothers only achieving one small success with the capture of Turahan&#x27;s son, Ahmed, in battle. Constantine then had to rely on the only other parties which had expressed interest in aiding him: Venice, the pope, and Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. Although Venice had been slow to act, the Venetians in Constantinople acted immediately without waiting for orders when the Ottomans sank their ships. The Venetian bailie in Constantinople, Girolamo Minotto, called an emergency meeting with the Venetians in the city, which was also attended by Constantine and Cardinal Isidore. Most of the Venetians voted to stay in Constantinople and aid the Byzantines in their defense of the city, agreeing that no Venetian ships were to leave Constantinople&#x27;s harbor. The decision of the local Venetians to stay and die for the city had a significantly greater effect on the Venetian government than Constantine&#x27;s pleas.

In February 1453, Doge Foscari ordered the preparation of warships and army recruitment, both of which were to head for Constantinople in April. He sent letters to the pope, Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, King Ladislaus V of Hungary, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III to inform them that unless Western Christianity acted, Constantinople would fall to the Ottomans. Though the increase in diplomatic activity was impressive, it came too late to save Constantinople: the equipment and financing of a joint papal-Venetian armada took longer than expected, the Venetians had misjudged the amount of time on their hands, and messages took at least a month to travel from Constantinople to Venice. Emperor Frederick III&#x27;s only response to the crisis was a letter sent to Mehmed II in which he threatened the sultan with an attack from all of western Christendom unless the sultan demolished the Rumelihisarı castle and abandoned his plans to Constantinople. Constantine continued to hope for help and sent more letters in early 1453 to Venice and Alfonso V, asking not only for soldiers but also food as his people were beginning to suffer from the Ottoman blockade of the city. Alfonso responded to his plea by quickly sending a ship with provisions.

Throughout the long winter of 1452–1453, Constantine ordered the citizens of Constantinople to restore the city&#x27;s imposing walls and gather as many weapons as they could. Ships were sent to the islands still under Byzantine rule to gather further supplies and provisions. The defenders grew anxious as the news of a huge cannon at the Ottoman camp that was assembled by the Hungarian engineer Orban reached the city. Loukas Notaras was given command of the walls along the sea walls of the Golden Horn and various sons of the Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos families were appointed to man other positions. Many of the city&#x27;s foreign inhabitants, notably the Venetians, offered their aid. Constantine asked them to man the battlements to show the Ottomans how many defenders they were to face. When the Venetians offered their service to guard four of the city&#x27;s land gates, Constantine accepted and entrusted them with the keys. Some of the city&#x27;s Genoese population also aided the Byzantines. In January 1453, notable Genoese aid arrived voluntarily in the form of Giovanni Giustiniani—a renowned soldier known for his skill in siege warfare—and 700 soldiers under his command. Giustiniani was appointed by Constantine as the general commander for the walls on Constantinople&#x27;s land side. Giustiniani was given the rank of &quot;protostrator&quot; and promised the island of Lemnos as a reward (though it had already been promised to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, should he come to the city&#x27;s aid). In addition to the limited western aid, Orhan Çelebi, the Ottoman contender held as a hostage in the city, and his considerable retinue of Ottoman troops, also assisted in the city&#x27;s defense.

On 2 April 1453, Mehmed&#x27;s advance guard arrived outside Constantinople and began pitching up a camp. On 5 April, the sultan himself arrived at the head of his army and encamped within firing range of the city&#x27;s Gate of St. Romanus. Bombardment of the city walls began almost immediately on 6 April. Most estimates of the number of soldiers defending Constantinople&#x27;s walls in 1453 range from 6,000 to 8,500, out of which 5,000–6,000 were Greeks, most of whom were untrained militia soldiers. An additional 1,000 Byzantine soldiers were kept as reserves inside the city. Mehmed&#x27;s army massively outnumbered the Christian defenders; his forces might have been as many as 80,000 men, including about 5,000 elite janissaries. Even then, Constantinople&#x27;s fall was not inevitable; the strength of the walls made the Ottoman numerical advantage irrelevant at first and under other circumstances, the Byzantines and their allies could have survived until help arrived. The Ottoman use of cannons intensified and sped up the siege considerably.

== Fall of Constantinople ==
=== Siege ===

An Ottoman fleet attempted to get into the Golden Horn while Mehmed began bombarding Constantinople&#x27;s land walls. Foreseeing this possibility, Constantine had constructed a massive chain laid across the Golden Horn which prevented the fleet&#x27;s passage. The chain was only lifted temporarily a few days after the siege began to allow the passage of three Genoese ships sent by the papacy and a large ship with food sent by Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples. The arrival of these ships on 20 April, and the failure of the Ottomans to stop them, was a significant victory for the Christians and significantly increased their morale. The ships, carrying soldiers, weapons and supplies, had passed by Mehmed&#x27;s scouts alongside the Bosphorus unnoticed. Mehmed ordered his admiral, Suleiman Baltoghlu, to capture the ships and their crews at all costs. As the naval battle between the smaller Ottoman ships and the large western ships commenced, Mehmed rode his horse into the water to shout unhelpful naval commands to Baltoghlu, who pretended not to hear them. Baltoghlu withdrew the smaller ships so that the few large Ottoman vessels could fire on the western ships, but the Ottoman cannons were too low to do damage to the crews and decks and their shots were too small to seriously damage the hulls. As the sun set, the wind suddenly returned and the ships passed through the Ottoman blockade, aided by three Venetian ships which had sailed out to meet and cover them.

The sea walls were weaker than Constantinople&#x27;s land walls, and Mehmed was determined to get his fleet into the Golden Horn; he needed some way to circumvent Constantine&#x27;s chain. On 23 April, the defenders of Constantinople observed the Ottoman fleet managed to get into the Golden Horn by being pulled across a massive series of tracks, constructed on Mehmed&#x27;s orders, across the hill behind Galata, the Genoese colony on the opposite side of the Golden Horn. Although the Venetians attempted to attack the ships and set fire to them, their attempt was unsuccessful.

As the siege progressed, it became clearer that the forces defending the city would not be enough to man both the sea walls and the land walls. Furthermore, food was running out and as food prices rose to compensate, many of the poor began to starve. On Constantine&#x27;s orders, the Byzantine garrison collected money from churches, monasteries and private residences to pay for food for the poor. Objects of precious metal held by the churches were seized and melted down, though Constantine promised the clergy that he would repay them four-fold once the battle had been won. The Ottomans bombarded the city&#x27;s outer walls continuously, and eventually opened up a small breach which exposed the inner defenses. Constantine grew more and more anxious. He sent messages begging the sultan to withdraw, promising whatever amount of tribute he wanted, but Mehmed was determined to take the city. The sultan supposedly responded:

To Constantine, the idea of abandoning Constantinople was unthinkable. He did not bother to reply to the sultan&#x27;s suggestion. Some days after offering Constantine the chance to surrender, Mehmed sent a new messenger to address the citizens of Constantinople, imploring them to surrender and save themselves from death or slavery. The sultan informed them that he would let them live as they were, in exchange for an annual tribute, or allow them to leave the city unharmed with their belongings. Some of Constantine&#x27;s companions and councilors implored him to escape the city, rather than die in its defense: if he escaped unharmed, Constantine could set up an empire-in-exile in the Morea or somewhere else and carry on the war against the Ottomans. Constantine did not accept their ideas; he refused to be remembered as the emperor who ran away. According to later chroniclers, Constantine&#x27;s response to the idea of escaping was the following:

Constantine then sent a response to the sultan, the last communication between a Byzantine emperor and an Ottoman sultan:

The only hope the citizens could cling to was the news that the Venetian fleet was on its way to relieve Constantinople. When a Venetian reconnaissance ship that had slipped through the Ottoman blockade returned to the city to report that no relief force had been seen, it was made clear that the few forces that had gathered at Constantinople would have to fight the Ottoman army alone. The news that the whole of Christendom appeared to have deserted them unnerved some of the Venetians and Genoese defenders and in-fighting broke out between them, forcing Constantine to remind them that there were more important enemies at hand. Constantine resolved to commit himself and the city to the mercy of Christ; if the city fell, it would be God&#x27;s will.

=== Final days and final assault ===

The Byzantines observed strange and ominous signs in the days leading up to the final Ottoman assault on the city. On 22 May, there was a lunar eclipse for three hours, harkening to a prophecy that Constantinople would fall when the moon was on wane. In order to encourage the defenders, Constantine commanded that the icon of Mary, the city&#x27;s protector, was to be carried in a procession through the streets. The procession was abandoned when the icon slipped from its frame and the weather turned to rain and hail. Carrying out the procession on the next day was impossible as the city became engulfed in a thick fog.

On 26 May, the Ottomans held a war council. Çandarlı Halil Pasha, who believed western military aid to the city was imminent, counseled Mehmed to compromise with the Byzantines and withdraw whereas Zagan Pasha, a military officer, urged the sultan to push on and pointed out that Alexander the Great had conquered almost the entire known world when he was young. Perhaps knowing that they would support a final assault, Mehmed ordered Zagan to tour the camp and gather the opinions of the soldiers. On the evening of 26 May, the dome of the Hagia Sophia was lit up by a strange and mysterious light phenomenon, also spotted by the Ottomans from their camp outside the city. The Ottomans saw it as a great omen for their victory and the Byzantines saw it as a sign of impending doom. 28 May was calm, as Mehmed had ordered a day of rest before his final assault. The citizens who had not been put to work on repairing the crumbling walls or manning them prayed in the streets. On Constantine&#x27;s orders, icons and relics from all the monasteries and churches in the city were carried along the walls. Both Catholics and Orthodox defenders joined in prayers and hymns and Constantine led the procession himself. Giustiniani sent word to Loukas Notaras to request that Notaras&#x27; artillery be brought to defend the land walls, which Notaras refused. Giustiniani accused Notaras of treachery and they almost fought each other before Constantine intervened.

In the evening, the crowds moved to the Hagia Sophia, with Orthodox and Catholic Christians joining and praying, the fear of impending doom having done more to unite them than the councils ever could. Cardinal Isidore was in attendance, as was Emperor Constantine. Constantine prayed and asked for forgiveness and remission of his sins from all the bishops there before he received communion at the church&#x27;s altar. The emperor then left the church, going to the imperial palace and asking his household there for forgiveness and saying farewell to them before again disappearing into the night, going to make a final inspection of the soldiers manning the city walls.

Without warning, the Ottomans began their final assault in the early hours of 29 May. The service in the Hagia Sophia was interrupted, with fighting-age men rushing to the walls to defend the city and the other men and women helping the parts of the army stationed within the city. Waves of Mehmed&#x27;s troops charged at Constantinople&#x27;s land walls, hammering at the weakest section for more than two hours. Despite the relentless attack, the defense, led by Giustiniani and supported by Constantine, held firm. Unbeknownst to anyone, after six hours of fighting, just before sunrise, Giustiniani was mortally wounded. Constantine begged Giustiniani to stay and continue fighting, allegedly saying:

Giustiniani was too weak, however, and his bodyguards carried him to the harbor and escaped the city on a Genoese ship. The Genoese troops wavered when they saw their commander leave them, and though the Byzantine defenders fought on, the Ottomans soon gained control of both the outer and inner walls. About fifty Ottoman soldiers made it through one of the gates, the &quot;Kerkoporta&quot;, and were the first of the enemy to enter Constantinople; it had been left unlocked and ajar by a Venetian party the night before. Ascending up the tower above the &quot;Kerkoporta&quot;, they managed to raise an Ottoman flag above the wall. The Ottomans stormed through the wall and many of the defenders panicked with no means of escape. Constantinople had fallen. Giustiniani died of his wounds on his way home. Loukas Notaras was initially captured alive before being executed shortly after. Cardinal Isidore disguised himself as a slave and escaped across the Golden Horn to Galata. Orhan, Mehmed&#x27;s cousin, disguised himself as a monk in an attempt to escape, but was identified and killed.

=== Death ===

Constantine died the day Constantinople fell. There were no known surviving eyewitnesses to the death of the emperor and none of his entourage survived to offer any credible account of his death. The Greek historian Michael Critobulus, who later worked in the service of Mehmed, wrote that Constantine died fighting the Ottomans. Later Greek historians accepted Critobulus&#x27;s account, never doubting that Constantine died as a hero and martyr, an idea never seriously questioned in the Greek-speaking world. Though none of the authors were eyewitnesses, a vast majority of those who wrote of Constantinople&#x27;s fall, both Christians and Muslims, agree that Constantine died in the battle, with only three accounts claiming that the emperor escaped the city. It also seems probable that his body was later found and decapitated. According to Critobulus, the last words of Constantine before he charged at the Ottomans were &quot;the city is fallen and I am still alive&quot;.
There were other conflicting contemporary accounts of Constantine&#x27;s demise. Leonard of Chios, who was taken prisoner by the Ottomans but later managed to escape, wrote that once Giustiniani had fled the battle, Constantine&#x27;s courage failed and the emperor implored his young officers to kill him so that he would not be captured alive by the Ottomans. None of the soldiers were brave enough to kill the emperor and once the Ottomans broke through, Constantine fell in the ensuing fight, only to briefly get up before falling again and being trampled. The Venetian physician Niccolò Barbaro, who was present at the siege, wrote that no one knew if the emperor had died or escaped the city alive, noting that some said that his corpse had been seen among the dead while others claimed that he had hanged himself as soon as the Ottomans had broken through at the St. Romanus gate. Cardinal Isidore wrote, like Critobulus, that Constantine had died fighting at the St. Romanus gate. Isidore also added that he had heard that the Ottomans had found his body, cut off his head and presented it to Mehmed as a gift, who was delighted and showered the head with insults before taking it with him to Adrianople as a trophy. Jacopo Tedaldi, a merchant from Florence who participated in the final fight, wrote that &quot;some say that his head was cut off; others that he perished in the crush at the gate. Both stories may well be true&quot;.

Ottoman accounts of Constantine&#x27;s demise all agree that the emperor was decapitated. Tursun Beg, who was part of Mehmed&#x27;s army at the battle, wrote a less heroic account of Constantine&#x27;s death than the Christian authors. According to Tursun, Constantine panicked and fled, making for the harbor in hopes of finding a ship to escape the city. On his way there, he came across a band of Turkish marines, and after charging and nearly killing one of them, was decapitated. A later account by Ottoman historian Ibn Kemal is similar to Tursun&#x27;s account, but states that the emperor&#x27;s head was cut off by a giant marine, who killed him without realizing who he was. Nicola Sagundino, a Venetian who had once been a prisoner of the Ottomans following their conquest of Thessaloniki decades before, gave an account of Constantine&#x27;s death to Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples in 1454 since he believed that the emperor&#x27;s fate &quot;deserved to be recorded and remembered for all time&quot;. Sagundino stated that although Giustiniani implored the emperor to escape as he was carried away after falling on the battlefield, Constantine refused and preferred to die with his empire. Constantine went to where the fighting appeared to be thickest and, as it would be unworthy of him to be captured alive, implored his officers to kill him. When none of them obeyed his command, Constantine threw off his imperial regalia, as to not let himself be distinguished from the other soldiers, and disappeared into the fray, sword in hand. According to one source, when Mehmed wanted the defeated Constantine to be brought to him, he was told it was too late as the emperor was dead. A search for the body was conducted, and when it was found, the emperor&#x27;s head was cut off and paraded through Constantinople before it was sent to the Sultan of Egypt as a gift, alongside twenty captured women and forty captured men.

=== Historiography ===

Constantine&#x27;s death marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, an institution tracing its origin to Constantine the Great&#x27;s foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire&#x27;s new capital in 330. Even as their realm gradually became more restricted to only Greek-speaking lands, the people of the Byzantine Empire continually maintained that they were &quot;Romaioi&quot; (Romans), not &quot;Hellenes&quot; (Greeks); as such, Constantine&#x27;s death also marked the end of the line of Roman Emperors started by Augustus 1,480 years earlier. Constantine&#x27;s death and the fall of Constantinople also marked the true birth of the Ottoman Empire, which dominated much of the eastern Mediterranean until its fall in 1922. The conquest of Constantinople had been a dream of Islamic armies since the 8th century and through its possession, Mehmed II and his successors claimed to be the heirs of the Roman emperors.

There is no evidence that Constantine ever rejected the hated union of the Churches achieved at Florence in 1439 after spending a lot of energy to realize it. Many of his subjects had chastised him as a traitor and heretic while he lived and he, like many of his predecessors before him, died in communion with the Church of Rome. Nevertheless, Constantine&#x27;s actions during the fall of Constantinople and his death fighting the Turks redeemed the popular view of him. The Greeks forgot or ignored that Constantine had died a &quot;heretic&quot;, and many considered him a martyr. In the eyes of the Orthodox Church, Constantine&#x27;s death sanctified him and he died a hero. In Athens, the modern capital of Greece, there are two statues of Constantine: a colossal monument depicting the emperor on horseback on the waterfront of Palaio Faliro, and a smaller statue in the city&#x27;s cathedral square, which portrays the emperor on foot with a drawn sword. There are no statues of emperors such as Basil II or Alexios I Komnenos, who were significantly more successful and died of natural causes after long and glorious reigns.

Scholarly works on Constantine and the fall of Constantinople tend to portray Constantine, his advisors, and companions as victims of the events that surrounded the city&#x27;s fall. There are three main works that deal with Constantine and his life: the earliest is Čedomilj Mijatović&#x27;s &quot;Constantine Palaeologus (1448–1453) or The Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks&quot; (1892), written at a time when tensions were rising between the relatively new Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire. War appeared imminent and Mijatović&#x27;s work was intended to serve as propaganda for the Greek cause by portraying Constantine as a tragic victim of events he had no possibility of affecting. The text is dedicated to the young Prince Constantine, of the same name as the old emperor and the heir to the Greek throne, and its preface states that &quot;Constantinople may soon again change masters&quot;, alluding to the possibility that Greece might conquer the ancient city.

The second major work on Constantine, Steven Runciman&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Constantinople 1453&quot; (1965), also characterizes Constantine through Constantinople&#x27;s fall, portraying Constantine as tragic figure who did everything to save his empire from the Ottomans. However, Runciman partly blames Constantine for antagonizing Mehmed II through his threats concerning Orhan. The third major work, Donald Nicol&#x27;s &quot;The Immortal Emperor: The Life and Legend of Constantine Palaiologos, Last Emperor of the Romans&quot; (1992), examines Constantine&#x27;s entire life and analyzes the trials and hardships he faced not only as emperor, but as Despot of the Morea as well. Nicol&#x27;s work places considerably less emphasis on the importance of individuals than the preceding works do, though Constantine is again portrayed as a mostly tragic figure.

A less positive assessment of Constantine was given by Marios Philippides in &quot;Constantine XI Dragaš Palaeologus (1404–1453): The Last Emperor of Byzantium&quot; (2019). Philippides sees no evidence that Constantine was a great statesman or a great soldier. Although the emperor had visions for his reign, Philippides deems him as diplomatically ineffective and unable to inspire the support of his people to achieve his goals. Philippides is highly critical of Nicol&#x27;s &quot;The Immortal Emperor&quot;, which he sees as unbalanced. In his book, Philippides points out that Constantine&#x27;s reconquest of the Morea from the Latins had mostly been achieved through marriages and not military victories. Though much of Philippides&#x27; work relies on primary sources, some of his negative assessment seems speculative; he suggests that Constantine&#x27;s campaigns in the Morea made the peninsula &quot;easier prey for the Turks&quot;, something that cannot be substantiated through the actual events that unfolded.

=== Legends of Constantine&#x27;s family ===
Constantine&#x27;s two marriages were brief and though he had attempted to find a third wife before the fall of Constantinople, he died unmarried and without children. His closest surviving relatives were his surviving brothers in the Morea: Thomas and Demetrios. Despite this, there was a persistent story that Constantine had left a widow and several daughters. The earliest documented evidence of this idea can be found in a letter by Aeneas Silvius (the future Pope Pius II) to Pope Nicholas V, dated July 1453. In Aeneas&#x27;s &quot;Cosmographia&quot; (1456–1457), the story is elaborated upon: Mehmed II supposedly defiled and murdered the empress and Constantine&#x27;s daughters in the celebrations after his victory. Aeneas also wrote of an imaginary son of Constantine who escaped to Galata, across the Golden Horn. The story of Constantine&#x27;s wife and daughters might have been further propagated through the spread of the late 15th-century Russian tale called the &quot;Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad&quot;, where a similar account appears. 16th-century French chronicler Mathieu d&#x27;Escouchy wrote that Mehmed raped the empress in the Hagia Sophia and then confined her to his harem.

The story of Constantine&#x27;s supposed family survived into modern Greek folklore. One story, propagated until as late as the 20th century, was that Constantine&#x27;s supposed empress had been six months pregnant at the time of Constantinople&#x27;s fall and that a son had been born to her while Mehmed was warring in the north. The empress raised the boy, and though he was well-versed in the Christian faith and the Greek language in his youth, he turned to Islam as an adult and eventually became sultan himself, which meant that all Ottoman sultans after him would have been Constantine&#x27;s descendants. Though the circumstances are completely fictional, the story might carry a shred of the truth; a grandson of Constantine&#x27;s brother Thomas, Andreas Palaiologos, lived in Constantinople in the 16th century, converted to Islam and served as an Ottoman court official.

Another late folk story said that Constantine&#x27;s empress had shut herself in the imperial palace after Mehmed&#x27;s victory. After the Ottomans failed to break her barricades and enter the palace, Mehmed had to agree to give her three concessions: that all coins minted by the sultans in the city would bear the names of Constantinople or Constantine, that there would be a street reserved for Greeks alone, and that the bodies of the Christian dead would be given funerals according to Christian custom.

=== Lamentations ===

The fall of Constantinople shocked Christians throughout Europe. In Orthodox Christianity, Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia became symbols of lost grandeur. In the Russian Nestor Iskander tale, the foundation of Constantinople (the New Rome) by Constantine the Great and its loss under an emperor by the same name was not seen as a coincidence, but as the fulfilling of the city&#x27;s destiny, just as Old Rome had been founded by Romulus and lost under Romulus Augustulus.

Andronikos Kallistos, a prominent 15th-century Greek scholar and Byzantine refugee to Italy, wrote a text entitled &quot;Monodia&quot; in which he laments the fall of Constantinople and mourns Constantine Palaiologos, whom he refers to as &quot;a ruler more perceptive than Themistocles, more fluent than Nestor, wiser than Cyrus, more just than Rhadamanthus and braver than Hercules&quot;.

The 1453 Greek long poem &quot;Capture of the City&quot;, of uncertain authorship, laments the bad luck of Constantine, which the author blames on Constantine&#x27;s ill-advised destruction of Glarentza (including its churches) in the 1420s. According to the author, all of Constantine&#x27;s other misfortunes—the destruction of the Hexamilion wall, the death of his brother John VIII, and the fall of Constantinople—were the result of what happened at Glarentza. Even then, Constantine was not to blame for Constantinople&#x27;s fall: he had done what he could and ultimately relied on help from Western Europe that never came. The poem concludes that people say Constantine died by his own sword, and ends with personally addressing the dead emperor:

=== The Marble Emperor ===

In 15th-century Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles&#x27;s &quot;The Histories&quot;, Chalkokondyles finished his account of Byzantine history with hope for a time when a Christian emperor would rule over the Greeks again. In the late 15th century, a legend originated among the Greeks that Constantine had not actually died, but was merely asleep and was waiting on a call from heaven to come and rescue his people. This legend eventually became the legend of the &quot;Marble Emperor&quot; (Greek: &quot;Marmaromenos Vasilefs&quot;, lit. the &quot;Emperor/King turned into Marble&quot;). Constantine Palaiologos, hero of the final Christian days of Constantinople, had not died, but had been rescued, turned into marble and immortalized by an angel moments before he was to be killed by the Ottomans. The angel then hid him in a secret cave beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople (where emperors in the past had marched during triumphs), where he awaits the angel&#x27;s call to awaken and retake the city. The Turks later walled up the Golden Gate, explained by the story as a precaution against Constantine&#x27;s eventual resurrection: when God wills Constantinople to be restored, the angel will descend from heaven, resurrect Constantine, give him the sword he used in the final battle and Constantine will then march into his city and restore his fallen empire, driving the Turks as far away as the &quot;Red Apple Tree&quot;, their legendary homeland. According to the legend, Constantine&#x27;s resurrection would be heralded by the bellowing of a great ox.

The story can be seen depicted in a series of seventeen miniatures in a 1590 chronicle by Cretan historian and painter Georgios Klontzas. Klontzas&#x27; miniatures show the emperor sleeping beneath Constantinople and guarded by angels, being crowned once more in the Hagia Sophia, entering the imperial palace and then fighting a string of battles against the Turks. Following his inevitable victories, Constantine prays at Caesarea (Kayseri), marches on Palestine and returns triumphant to Constantinople before entering Jerusalem. At Jerusalem, Constantine delivers his crown and the True Cross to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and finally travels to Calvary, where he dies, his mission completed. In the final miniature, Constantine is buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

In 1625, Thomas Roe, an English diplomat, sought permission from the Ottoman government to remove some of the stones from the walled-up Golden Gate to send them to his friend, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who was collecting antiquities. Roe was denied permission and observed that the Turks had some sort of superstitious dread of the gate, recording that the statues placed on it by the Turks were enchanted and that if they were destroyed or taken down, a &quot;great alteration&quot; would occur to the city.

The prophecy of the Marble Emperor endured until the Greek War of Independence in the 19th century and beyond. It was fuelled when the King of the Hellenes, George I, named his firstborn son and heir Constantine in 1868. His name echoed the emperors of old, proclaiming his succession not just to the new Greek kings, but to the Byzantine emperors before them as well. Once he acceded to the throne as Constantine I of Greece, many in Greece hailed him as &quot;Constantine XII&quot; instead. Constantine I&#x27;s conquest of Thessaloniki from the Turks in 1912 and his leadership in the Balkan Wars 1912–1913 seemed to be evidence that the prophecy was about to be realized; Constantinople and the Red Apple Tree were believed to be Constantine&#x27;s next goals. When Constantine was forced to abdicate in 1917, many believed he had been unjustly removed before completing his sacred destiny. The hope of capturing Constantinople would not be completely dashed until the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War in 1922.

=== Regnal number ===
Constantine Palaiologos is generally reckoned to have been the eleventh emperor with that name. As such, he is typically referred to as &quot;Constantine XI&quot;, with &#x27;XI&#x27; being a regnal number, used in monarchies since the Middle Ages to differentiate among rulers with the same name in the same office, reigning of the same territory. Regnal numbers were never used in the Roman Empire and despite an increase in emperors of the same name during the Middle Ages, such as the many emperors named Michael, Leo, John or Constantine, the practice was never introduced in the Byzantine Empire. Instead, the Byzantines used nicknames (for instance &quot;Michael &quot;the Drunkard&quot;&quot;, now given the number Michael III) or patronymics (for instance &quot;Constantine, &quot;son of Manuel&quot;&quot; rather than Constantine XI) to distinguish emperors of the same name. The modern numbering of the Byzantine emperors is a purely historiographical invention, created by historians beginning with Edward Gibbon in his &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776–1789).

Since the name Constantine connected an emperor with the founder of Constantinople and the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine the Great, the name was particularly popular among emperors. Whilst modern historiography generally recognizes eleven emperors by the name, older works have occasionally numbered Constantine Palaiologos differently. Gibbon numbered him as &quot;Constantine XIII&quot; after counting two junior co-emperors, Constantine Lekapenos (co-emperor 924–945) and Constantine Doukas (co-emperor 1074–1078 and 1081–1087). The modern number, &quot;XI&quot;, was established with the publication of the revised edition of Charles le Beau&#x27;s &quot;Histoire du Bas-Empire en commençant à Constantin le Grand&quot; in 1836. Early numismatic (coin-related) works typically assigned Constantine Palaiologos higher numerals since there were numerous coins minted by junior co-emperors of the name Constantine as well.

There is particular confusion in the correct number of Constantines since there are two different Roman emperors commonly numbered as Constantine III&quot;:&quot; the Western usurper Constantine III (407–411) of the early 5th century and the briefly reigning Byzantine Constantine III (641) of the 7th century. In addition to them, the emperor commonly known today as Constans II (641–668) actually reigned under the name Constantine, and has sometimes been referred to as Constantine III. A difficult case is Constantine Laskaris, who might have been the first, albeit ephemeral, emperor of the Empire of Nicaea, one of the Byzantine successor states after the Fourth Crusade. It is unclear whether Constantine Laskaris ruled as emperor or not and he is sometimes counted as &quot;Constantine XI&quot;, which would make Constantine Palaiologos &quot;Constantine XII&quot;. Constantine Laskaris is sometimes referred to as &quot;Constantine (XI)&quot;, with Constantine Palaiologos numbered &quot;Constantine XI (XII)&quot;.

Counting comprehensively those who were officially recognized as rulers under the name Constantine, including those that only ruled nominally as co-emperors but with the supreme title, the total number of emperors named Constantine would be 18. By counting and numbering all previous co-emperors with that name, including Constantine (son of Leo V), Constantine (son of Basil I), Constantine Lekapenos and Constantine Doukas, in addition to Constans II, Constantine Laskaris and the western Constantine III, Constantine Palaiologos would most appropriately be numbered as &quot;Constantine XVIII&quot;. Scholars commonly do not number co-emperors as the extent of their rule was mostly nominal and, unless they inherited the throne later, did not hold independent supreme power. By counting the western Constantine III, Constans II and Constantine Laskaris—all emperors reigning with supreme power under the name of Constantine (though it is questionable in Laskaris&#x27;s case)—the numbering of Constantine Palaiologos would be &quot;Constantine XIV&quot;.

<text>Mercè Rodoreda i Gurguí (; 10 October 1908 – 13 April 1983) was a Spanish novelist, who wrote in Catalan.

She is considered the most influential contemporary Catalan language writer, as evidenced by the references of other authors to her work and the international repercussion, with translations into more than thirty languages.

She also has been called the most important Catalan female novelist of the postwar period. Her novel &quot;La plaça del diamant&quot; (&#x27;The diamond square&#x27;, translated as &quot;The Time of the Doves&quot;, 1962) has become the most popular Catalan novel to date and has been translated into over 30 languages. Some critics consider it to be one of the best novels published in Spain after the Spanish Civil War.

After her death, one more of her artistic aspects was discovered, painting, which had remained in the background due to the importance that Rodoreda gave to writing:

==Biography==
===Childhood (1908-1921)===
Mercè Rosa Rodoreda i Gurguí was born on October 10, 1908, at 340 &quot;carrer de Balmes, Barcelona&quot; Her parents were Andreu Rodoreda, from Terrassa and Montserrat Gurguí, from Maresme. Both were lovers of literature and theater and had attended recital classes taught by Adrià Gual at the School of Dramatic Art (which would later become the Institute of Theater). Her mother also had an interest in music.

Her parents&#x27; financial problems forced her to leave school at age nine, from 1915 to 1917 at the Lurdes School in the Sarrià neighborhood and from 1917 to 1920 at the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Lourdes&quot; center, which was closest to her home, on Calle de Padua, at the height of the street of Vallirana. Later she went to an academy where she studied only French and business arithmetic.

Her maternal grandfather, Pere Gurguí, was an admirer of Jacint Verdaguer (of whom he had been a friend) and had collaborated as an editor in the magazines &quot;La Renaixensa&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Arc de Sant Martí&quot;. In 1910, Pere Gurguí had a monument in memory of Jacint Verdaguer erected in the garden of his house that bore an engraving with the title of the two most important works of the author, &quot;Canigó&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;; that place became the space for parties and family gatherings. The figure of her grandfather marked her intensely and she came to consider him her teacher. Gurguí instilled in her a deep Catalan feeling, and a love for the Catalan language and flowers that were well reflected throughout Mercè Rodoreda&#x27;s work.

On May 18, 1913, when she was only five years old, she performed for the first time in a play playing the role of the girl Kitty in &quot;The Mysterious Jimmy Samson&quot;, at the &quot;Torrent de les Flors&quot; theater. Years later, this character was, in a certain way, recovered for the story &quot;The bathroom&quot;, within the work &quot;Twenty-two stories&quot;.

During her childhood she read all the classic and modern Catalan authors, such as Jacint Verdaguer, Ramon Llull, Joan Maragall, Josep Maria de Sagarra and Josep Carner, among others, surely influenced by the bohemian atmosphere that was breathed in her family&#x27;s home.

On May 30, 1920, she participated in the drama &quot;Fifteen Days of Reign&quot; at Lourdes School. In the same act she also read the poem in Catalan called &quot;La negra&quot;.

In 1921, her uncle Juan moved in with the family and changed the lifestyle of all its members, imposing austerity and conventional order. She had idealized him as a result of the letters she had previously received and ended up marrying him on October 10, 1928, her twentieth birthday, in the church of Bonanova. He was fourteen years older than her and, due to the degree of consanguinity, they needed a papal dispensation.

===Youth (1921-1938)===
After the wedding, the couple went to Paris on a honeymoon, and then they settled in a house on Zaragoza Street. Her husband had gone to Argentina when he was very young and had returned with a small fortune.

On July 23, 1929, their only son, Jordi Gurguí i Rodoreda, was born. From that moment on, Mercè Rodoreda began to do literary tests, to get rid of the economic and social dependency that the monotonous married life gave her. That is how she began to consider writing as a profession. Every day she locked herself for a while in a blue dovecote that was in Manuel Angelon&#x27;s maternal house, which possibly later served as an inspiration to include the dovecote in &quot;The Time of the Doves&quot;. During that time, she wrote verses, a theatrical comedy (which remains defunct), and a novel. Meanwhile, the Second Republic was proclaimed.

====Second Spanish Republic====
In 1931 she began to take classes at the Dalmau Lyceum, where she improved her knowledge of language under the guidance of the pedagogue, linguist and esperantist Delfí Dalmau i Enero, who greatly influenced her and encouraged her to train, and with whom a bond of friendship developed. Rodoreda showed Dalmau what she wrote and he encouraged her to make these first texts public. According to Dalmau, Mercè Rodoreda was an exceptional student, possessing spiritual fulfillment and a promising literary soul. This admiration led Dalmau to ask her to be one of the counterparts in her work &quot;Polémica&quot;, An Apology for Catalan and Esperanto; she answered affirmatively and the piece was published in 1934. As the teacher Dalmau recognized, this work had also been influenced by Rodoreda&#x27;s observations.

In 1932, the first novel by Mercè Rodoreda entitled &quot;Am I an honored woman?&quot; and also some stories for various newspapers. The work went almost unnoticed until it was nominated for the &quot;Crexells Prize&quot; in 1933, although the winner of that year was Carles Soldevila. Also in that year of 1932, on October 20, she published an interview with the actress Maria Vila in the &quot;Mirador&quot; magazine.

On October 1, 1933, she began her journalistic career in the weekly magazine &quot;Clarisme&quot; where she published twenty-two contributions: five prose on traditional culture, thirteen interviews, two reviews, a short story, and three comments on political, musical and film themes. That same year, she joined the Barcelona Press Association, which evidenced her intention to formalize collaboration with journalistic work.

In the spring of 1934 she published her second work, &quot;What cannot be escaped&quot;, in the editions of the magazine Clarisme. In May of that same year, she won the &quot;Independent Casino Award of the Floral Games of Lleida&quot; with the story &quot;The little mermaid and the dolphin&quot;, which is currently lost.

After writing that second work, Joan Puig i Ferrater, director of Ediciones Proa, visited her and was interested in publishing her next work: A day in the life of a man, which was published in the autumn of that same year in Proa. Rodoreda began to enter the literary world thanks to the help of Puig i Ferrater himself, who opened the doors of &quot;El Club de los Novelistas&quot;, made up of authors such as Armand Obiols, Francesc Trabal or Joan Oliver, who were also former members of The Sabadell Group. At that time, she began to read the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky.

From 1935 to 1939, she published a total of sixteen stories for children in the newspaper &quot;La Publicidad&quot;, in a section called &quot;A while with children&quot;. &quot;Noteworthy is The Boy&quot; and &quot;The House&quot;, dedicated to her son, and also &quot;The Sheet&quot;, which she dedicated to Josep Carner. In addition, she combined it with the publication of stories in the leading Catalan press media such as &quot;La Revista&quot;, &quot;La Veu de Catalunya&quot; and &quot;Mirador&quot;, among others.

In 1936 she published her fourth novel, &quot;Crim&quot;. Later, Rodoreda rejected this novel, along with the previous three, considering them the product of inexperience.

====Spanish Civil War====
From 1937 until that moment, Rodoreda held the position of Catalan language corrector in the Generalitat&#x27;s Propaganda Commissariat. In this place she met writers of that time such as Aurora Bertrana, Maria Teresa Vernet, and also established a friendship with Susina Amat, Julieta Franquesa, Anna Murià and Carmen Manrubia.

She was awarded the 1937 Joan Crexells Prize for her work &quot;Aloma&quot;. That same year, she separated from her husband Joan Gurguí, after nine years of marriage and with one child. Her alleged lover, Andreu Nin, was arrested on June 16 in front of his party&#x27;s headquarters on La Rambla in Barcelona, where days later he was tortured and killed by Soviet police officers on the orders of General Alexander Orlov, in the prison of Alcalá de Henares.

In 1938, the fifth novel by Mercè Rodoreda entitled &quot;Aloma&quot; was published by the Institution of Catalan Letters. This was the first work that Rodoreda accepted as hers, although later she rewrote and published it again. The same year, on behalf of the PEN Club of Catalonia, she traveled together with the Catalan writer Francesc Trabal, and read a welcome written by Carles Riba at the international congress of the PEN club in Prague.

===Exile (1938-1972)===
On January 23, 1939, a few months before the defeat of the Republicans, she fled into exile. Thinking that the separation would be brief, she left her son with her mother. Although she had never participated in politics, she left on the advice of her mother, who feared problems due to collaborative activities with Catalan publications and some left-wing magazines in previous years. Along with other intellectuals of the time, she went from Barcelona to Gerona with a bookmobile owned by the Ministry of Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia, then she followed the path through Mas Perxés, in the municipality of Agullana, until crossing the administrative border by Le Perthus and entered Northern Catalonia on January 30. After spending the night in Le Boulou, they went to Perpignan; where they spent three days and then traveled to Toulouse by train.

====Roissy-en-Brie====
She arrived in the French capital at the end of February and in early April she moved to Roissy-en-Brie, a town near the east of the capital. She settled in the castle of Roissy-en-Brie, an 18th-century building, which was offered as a refuge for writers. She shared a home for a few months with other intellectuals such as Anna Murià, César Augusto Jordana, Armand Obiols, Francesc Trabal and Carles Riba.

In Roissy-en-Brie several love affairs arose; one of them was between Mercè Rodoreda and Armand Obiols. The problems in the castle arose because Armand Obiols was married to Francesc Trabal&#x27;s sister and they had a son, who had remained in Barcelona with his mother. Furthermore, Armand Obiols&#x27; mother-in-law had traveled with Trabal to Roissy-en-Brie along with other members of the Trabal family. Consequently, this affair divided the Catalan exiles into two opposing camps. According to Anna Murià, Francesc Trabal was opposed not only by his sister but by jealousy, since he would have had a secret relationship with Mercè Rodoreda in Barcelona that only the two of them and their confidante knew. Rodoreda wanted to write a book about it called The Roissy novel, however, she never decided to do it.

The atmosphere of stability offered by the castle was disturbed by the start of World War II. At that time, some decided to flee to Latin American countries and others preferred to stay in France; this last destination was the one chosen by Rodoreda and Obiols. Later they moved to the Villa Rosset house, on the outskirts of the city.

====Escaping from the Nazi troops====
Mercè Rodoreda, along with other writers who were still taking refuge in France, had to flee from Paris in mid-June 1940 due to the advance of the Germans army going in the direction of Orléans by way of Artenay. Josep Maria Esverd was able to get a truck to flee France; however, the next day the truck was requisitioned by French troops. After an unsuccessful attempt to catch a train, they had to flee south on foot. The objective was to cross the Loire River in order to enter the unoccupied area, but shortly before reaching Orleans it was found on fire and there was no bridge left on that stretch of the Loire River; consequently, they deviated from the fixed route.

For twelve days they were sheltered in a farm until the signing of the armistice of 22 June 1940, after they crossed the Loire River through the town of Meung-sur-Loire, which was completely destroyed. From there they traveled even further south, this time settling in Limoges.

====Limoges-Bordeaux====
In Limoges, she settled in a room at 12 Hijas-Notre-Dame street. These were difficult times for Rodoreda, because on June 5, 1941, her partner Armand Obiols was arrested, and she was left alone until October of that year. During that time Armand Obiols had to do forced labor in Saillat-sur-Vienne in a quarry. However, several efforts by Rodoreda got him to be sent to Bordeaux. When Obiols was already in better living conditions in Bordeaux, Rodoreda became involved in a study circle dedicated to reading and learning the English language.

During the following months, the relationship between Mercè Rodoreda and Armand Obiols was mostly at a distance, and only sporadically could they see each other in person. It was not until the end of August 1943 that Rodoreda moved to number 43 &quot;Chauffours&quot; street in Bordeaux where she was reunited with her lover. In Bordeaux she lived very hard times and, in her words, she sewed &quot;until dirty&quot; in a warehouse for much of the day, a job that did not leave her time to write.

====Paris====
The return to Paris took place in September 1946 when Rodoreda and Obiols moved to the house of Rafael Tasis in exile, the house was located at number 9 &quot;Coëtlogon&quot; street. A short time later, the couple moved to the sixth floor of number 21 on &quot;Cherche-Midi&quot; street, in the residential area of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which was a meeting place for many intellectuals of the time. This was her home for eight years and, in fact, she did not fully disengage until 1977.

At the beginning of 1947, she was able to leave her job as a seamstress to go back to work as a collaborator in the magazine &quot;Revista de Catalunya&quot;. Apart from publishing narrations during that year in the various editions of the magazine, she was also able to publish some in Chile and Mexico.

From 1947 to 1953, Mercè Rodoreda was unable to cultivate extensive literature because just in 1945 she had begun to suffer from health problems, along with the reappearance of somatic paralysis in her right arm. For this reason, she intensified her poetic creation and found her teacher in Josep Carner, with whom she maintained a close relationship by correspondence. In 1952, she began recovery therapy at the Châtel-Guyon spa. During the years that she was in Paris, she also began two novels that she did not finish.

In 1947, during the Floral Games of the Catalan Language held in London, she won her first Natural Flower with six sonnets: &quot;Rosa&quot;, &quot;Amor novell&quot;, &quot;Adam a Eva&quot;, &quot;Ocell&quot; and two more untitled sonnets. With the poem &quot;Món d&#x27;Ulisses&quot;, Rodoreda won for the second time the Natural Flower of the Floral Games of 1948 in Paris, a poem that was published in the magazine &quot;La Nostra Revista&quot; that same year. &quot;Albes i nits&quot; gave her the third victory in the Floral Games contest and, consequently, she was named &quot;&quot;Mestre en Gai Saber&quot; in Montevideo in 1949. That same year she visited Barcelona for the first time after exile.

In 1951, she also approached painting, interested above all in painters such as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Joan Miró, and she made some of her own creations. In a 1954 letter to Armand Oriols she explains that she already had a &quot;style and a world&quot; in painting, yet she acknowledged that her place was in writing. On the other hand, Obiols, began to work as a translator for UNESCO thanks to Quiroga Plá, and two years later, in 1953, he permanently moved to Geneva.

====Geneva====
In 1954, Rodoreda and Obiols moved into an apartment at 19 Violet street, in a bourgeois neighborhood in the city of Geneva. In this city, she always felt exiled and even recognized that Geneva &quot;is a very boring city, suitable for writing&quot;. Shortly after, Obiols had to move to Vienna for work reasons. That same year, Rodoreda made a trip to Barcelona to attend the wedding of her son, Jordi Gurguí i Rodoreda.

In 1956, she won the Joan Maragall Essay Prize with &quot;Three Sonnets and a Song&quot; that was published in the literary supplement &quot;La Gaceta de Letras de La Nova Revista (1955-1958)&quot;. Likewise, for her story &quot;Carnaval&quot; she was awarded the Joan Santamaria Prize in Barcelona that same year.

In 1958 the book of short stories written under the name of &quot;Twenty-two short stories&quot; was published which, a year earlier, had received the prestigious Victor Català Prize. Some of these stories had already been published in Mexico during her exile in France, while others were unpublished. As the author confessed, this book came from a technical crisis that led to an unequal literary level among the various stories, although they were tied by a thematic unit.

According to some unpublished annotations that spoke of Geneva, Rodoreda revealed that during those years she saw writers such as Eugeni Xammar, Julio Cortázar and his wife, and Jorge Semprún.

During her long stay in Geneva, she created a garden that she would later replicate in Romanyà de la Selva. The many flowers that surrounded her served as inspiration to portray the flowers that would end up making up &quot;Real Flowers&quot; within &quot;Viatges i Flors&quot;, along with the trips that she would write in Romanyà; however, this book was not published until 1980.

&quot;La Perla del Lago&quot; was the title of a potential novel by the author that remained incomplete, and was kept in the archives of the Institute of Catalan Studies. The title is the name of a restaurant on the shore of Lake Geneva in a corner of Geneva that she frequented. It was a location near the United Nations building where the author regularly ate, and from where she had a great view in the dining room on the upper floors. As described in the prologue of &quot;Broken Mirror&quot;, the eyes of the protagonist Teresa Goday de Valldaura were the same as the lady of Lemán.

In 1958, she submitted &quot;Una mica d&#x27;història&quot; (&quot;A bit of history&quot;) for the Joanot Martorell Prize, although she did not win but Ricard Salvat did with &quot;&quot;Animals destroying laws&quot;; however, this novel was published in 1967 this time under the title &quot;Garden by the Sea&quot;. She also wrote the short story &quot;Ron Negrita&quot; for the volume &quot;The 7 Deadly Sins Seen by 21 Storytellers&quot;, although it would later become part of the volume &quot;It looked like silk and other stories&quot;&quot;. From 1958 onwards, and without breaking up with Rodoreda, Obiols maintained a relationship with a woman in Geneva until his death.

In 1959, Rodoreda began to write the novel that was possibly the best of her career &quot;The Time of the Doves&quot; (&quot;Colometa&quot;), published in 1962 as &quot;La plaça del Diamant&quot; for &quot;El Club de los Novelistas&quot;. In 1960, she submitted the novel to the &quot;Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la&quot;, previously known as the Joanot Martorell Prize, however, she did not win but the Enric Massó y Urgellès prize was won with her novel &quot;Vivir es no facil&quot; (&quot;Living is not easy&quot;). Joan Fuster also sent her to &#x27;The Novelists Club&#x27;, which at that time was run by Joan Sales. Sales was delighted by the novel and started a correspondence with Rodoreda. From that moment, she found in the Editor Club a space where she could pour her literary work, where Salas was a co-founder. When it was published in 1962, the novel was not exactly the one that had been presented for the Sant Jordi prize, but it had received an extension both in chapters and in corrections by Salas, Obiols and the author herself.

In 1961, she sent another work to the same award, &quot;Death in Spring&quot;, which did not win either, but rather it was Josep Maria Espinàs with &quot;The Last Landing&quot; who was victorious.

In 1965, Rodoreda took the first steps in the publication of her Complete Works after a request from Joaquim Molas, however they would not be published in Ediciones 62 until 1977. The work did not include any of her first four works (&quot;I am an honest woman?&quot;, &quot;What cannot escape&quot;, &quot;A day in the life of a man&quot; and &quot;Crime&quot;) because she considered that they were the result of her inexperience and she agreed to rewrite &quot;Aloma&quot; to adapt it to the level of her current work; and that it would be reissued in 1969.

In 1966, her mother, Montserrat Gurguí, died; and three years later her uncle-husband, Joan Gurguí. As a result of the death of her husband, the relationship between mother and son was strained due to problems with the distribution of the inheritance. However, in 1966 was the year in which &quot;La calle de las Camelias&quot; was published that received the Sant Jordi Prize without her having submitted a candidacy; This fact was used for the direction to decide to award a work already published. With this same novel she also received the &quot;Serra d&#x27;Or Critical Prize for Literature and Essay&quot; in 1967, and the Ramon Llull Novel Award in 1969. In 1967, she began working on the novel &quot;Broken Mirror&quot;, which years later would become one of the most successful works of the author. &quot;Broken mirror&quot; was the result of the reworking of the play &quot;A day&quot; that had not been able to premiere. She also published two works: &quot;Garden by the Sea&quot; and a collection of stories entitled &quot;My Cristina and other stories&quot;.

From 1970 onwards, her work began to be translated into other languages, though her first translated work was &quot;La Plaza del Diamante&quot; in Spanish in 1965. In 1971, her feeling of exile was accentuated with the death of her companion of many years, Armand Obiols, at the Vienna University Hospital. This fact, together with the discovery of another Obiols lover, left her even more alone and broken in Switzerland. During those days, she wrote a shocking little card about the hard days she spent in the hospital; currently, this card is kept in the archives of the IEC. Consequently, after the reunion with some friends from the time of the Civil War, she decided to settle in 1972 in Carmen Manrubia&#x27;s chalet in Romanyà de la Selva, without ceasing to reside in Geneva, albeit more and more sporadically.

===Romanyà de la Selva (1972-1983)===
In 1972, she spent the summer in &quot;La Senyal&quot; - currently called &quot;La Senyal Vell&quot; - in Romanyà de la Selva, which was a house owned by her friend Carmen Manrubia, however it had been designed by both of them. Her friendship with Carmen Manrubia existed since when they worked together in the &quot;Propaganda Commissariat&quot; of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, although they became estranged when Manrubio and Rodoreda went into exile in different countries. Also participating in this project were Carmen Manrubia&#x27;s adopted son, Carlos, Susina Amat and Esther Floricourt. She lived in this house for six years, until in 1979 she built her own house in Romanyà. The name chosen by the two friends for the house, &quot;La senyal&quot;, refers to the stigma of Cain in the work &quot;Demian&quot; by Hermann Hesse.

At Manrubio&#x27;s house she substantially completed the writing work for Broken Mirror that had already begun in Geneva years before. This work is considered the most successful of her literary production and was published in 1974. She also wrote there Trips to various towns within Trips and flowers and the novel War, So Much War These two books were published in 1980 and with these she won the City of Barcelona Award. That same year, he also went to Barcelona to make the proclamation of the Festes de la Mercè. Also in that same year, she was awarded the Catalan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award for her literary career in the Catalan language, thus achieving her consecration as a writer. In 1978, &quot;Semblava de seda i altres contes&quot; (&quot;It looked like silk and other stories&quot;) was published, which was a compilation of stories written throughout her life.

The joint project between Mercè Rodoreda and Manrubio failed. Mercè Rodoreda bought a piece of land in 1977 in which she had a house built next to the existing one; which would be finished in 1979. According to Anna Maria Saludes and Amat, this abandonment of the Manrubio house was given by Rodoreda&#x27;s need to follow a life in solitude typical of her character; fruit of the difficult coexistence between the two.

In 1979, she wrote her theatrical comedy &quot;El Maniquí&quot;, which was premiered in the same year by the Brujas de Dol company at the Sitges International Theater Festival directed by Aracelli Bruch.

In those last years of her life, Mercè Rodoreda saw her novels several times on the small and big screen. First, her novel &quot;Aloma&quot;, directed by Lluís Pascual, made the leap to television in 1978. Later, made the leap to the big screen &quot;La plaça del Diamant&quot; (1982) with Silvia Munt in the role of Colometa and directed by Francesc Betriu.

In 1982, she wrote a compilation of biographical articles published in Serra d&#x27;Or titled &quot;Childhood Files&quot;. Mercè Rodoreda belonged to the Catalan Language Writers Association and was a member and honorary member after her return.

During the last period of her life, her works developed from her usual psychologic style to become more akin to symbolism in its more cryptic form.

In 1998, a literature prize was instituted in her name: the Mercè Rodoreda prize for short stories and narratives.

She was made a Member of Honour of the &quot;Associació d&#x27;Escriptors en Llengua Catalana&quot;, the Association of Writers in Catalan Language. The library in Platja d&#x27;Aro is named in her honor.

====Death====
At 1:30 p.m. on April 13, 1983, Mercè Rodoreda died of very advanced liver cancer at the Muñoz Clinic, in Girona. During her last days, when she was already admitted to the hospital, she reconciled with the members of her family after they were notified by Joan Sales. As explained by Rodoreda&#x27;s close friend, Isabel Parés, when Rodoreda was diagnosed with cancer, she collapsed and did not want to fight to live.

The burning chapel was installed in the Palau Solterra of the Department of Culture of the Generalitat and, following her wishes, Rodoreda was buried in the Romanyà de la Selva cemetery in a massive burial attended by many of her colleagues and colleagues. other personalities of the moment. Her intellectual legacy was inherited from the Institute for Catalan Studies, which years later created the Mercè Rodoreda Foundation.

<text>Babadag (; ,  &quot;Father Mountain&quot;), formerly known as Babatag, is a town in Tulcea County, Romania, located on a small lake formed by the river Taița, in the densely wooded highlands of Northern Dobruja. One of the several tombs of Sari Saltik is found in town.

The is divided only by a strip of marshland from Razim Lake, a broad landlocked sheet of water spilling into the Black Sea.

==History==

The name of Babadag is connected with 13th century dervish Baba Sari Saltik, who is said to have led a number of Turkomans to Dobruja and to have settled them in this area. The town was first mentioned by Ibn Battuta under the name Baba Saltuk, as the furthermost outpost of the &quot;Turks&quot; (i.e., the Golden Horde).

The town was conquered by Bayezid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in his 1393 Danubian campaign. The construction of a fortress was begun here in 1633 during the reign of Murad IV, but by 1650 only the fortress&#x27;s foundation walls and towers were standing. In the 17th century, it occasionally served as the winter headquarters for the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire during their wars with Russia. The town&#x27;s location near to the Black Sea made it a target for the Russian navy, the town was bombed by the Russians in 1854 during the Crimean War. In the mid-19th century, Babadag formed part of the region (&quot;sanjak&quot;) of Silistra within the &quot;Bulgarian Government&quot; (Danube Vilayet). Following the 1877–1878 war between the Ottoman and Russian empires, Babadag became part of independent Romania.

===Military training facility===
At Babadag, the Romanian Army operates a military training facility. With a total surface area of , the area can accommodate live-fire exercises for infantry and tanks at company level as well as artillery subunits. In 2008, United States Army forces started to train at Babadag as part of Romania&#x27;s integration into NATO. In 2022, units of the 101st Airborne Division (that has returned to Europe for the first time since the end World War II) deployed to the Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base have been training at the Babadag base, near the border with Ukraine. The facility is subordinated to the Cincu Training Center.

==Demographics==
In 1900, Babadag&#x27;s population was 3,500. The 2011 census counted 8,940 inhabitants; the population distribution was: 6,267 Romanians (77.64%), 1,248 Horahane Roma (15.46%), 420 Turks (5.2%), 37 Lipovans (0.45%), and 98 others. 
84.8% were Romanian Orthodox and 14.2% Muslim. At the 2021 census, Babadag had a population of 9,213; of those, 66.36% were Romanians, 16.23% Roma, and 2.42% Turks.

==Economy==
Before the First World War, Babadag served as the market for wool and mutton from the Dobruja.

<doc id="64682" wikidata="Q315058" url="?curid=64682" title="Peter II of Aragon">
<text>Peter II the Catholic (; ) (July 1178 – 12 September 1213) was the King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona from 1196 to 1213.

==Background==
Peter was born in Huesca, the son of Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancha of Castile. In 1205 he acknowledged the feudal supremacy of the papacy and was crowned in Rome by Pope Innocent III, swearing to defend the Catholic faith (hence his epithet, &quot;the Catholic&quot;). He was the first king of Aragon to be crowned by the pope.

In the first decade of the thirteenth century Peter commissioned the &quot;Liber feudorum Ceritaniae&quot;, an illustrated codex cartulary for the counties of Cerdagne, Conflent, and Roussillon.

==Marriage==
On 15 June 1204 Peter married (as her third husband) Marie of Montpellier, daughter and heiress of William VIII of Montpellier by Eudocia Comnena. She gave him a son, James, but Peter soon repudiated her. Marie was popularly venerated as a saint for her piety and marital suffering, but was never canonized; she died in Rome in 1213. Marie also perhaps bore Peter II a daughter, &quot;Sancha&quot;, at Collioure in October 1205 according to Christian Nique. (&quot;Sancha&quot; was born in 1206 according to other accounts; in 1208 according to Mark Gregory Pegg, but February 1208 is more likely the year the couple&#x27;s son was born). Sancha was betrothed to Raymond VII the son Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, not long after her birth, according to Nique, only days (sources differ as to how long). The marriage contract included Marie&#x27;s inheritance, Montpellier, which was to be passed to the child immediately should something happen to Peter, says Nique, citing documents discovered in 1850, something Marie would at first not agree to, but finally agreed to a few months later, stating that she had agreed under pressure. However the child&#x27;s younger brother James makes no mention of her and Sancha was apparently dead before the New Year, according to Nique&#x27;s information.

==Warfare==
Peter participated in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 which marked the turning point of Muslim domination in the Iberian peninsula.

The Crown of Aragon was widespread in the area that is now southwestern France, but which at that time was under the control of vassal local princes, such as the Counts of Toulouse. The Cathars or Albigenses rejected the authority and the teachings of the Catholic Church. Innocent called upon Philip II of France to suppress the Albigenses. Under the leadership of Simon de Montfort a campaign was launched. The Albigensian Crusade, begun in 1209, led to the slaughter of approximately 20,000 men, women and children, Cathar and Catholic alike. Over the course of twenty years military campaigns essentially destroyed the previously flourishing civilization of Occitania and by 1229 brought the region firmly under the control of the King of France, and the Capetian dynasty from the north of France.

Peter returned from Las Navas in autumn 1212 to find that Simon de Montfort had conquered Toulouse, exiling Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who was Peter&#x27;s brother-in-law and vassal. Peter crossed the Pyrenees and arrived at Muret in September 1213 to confront Montfort&#x27;s army. He was accompanied by Raymond of Toulouse, who tried to persuade Peter to avoid battle and instead starve out Montfort&#x27;s forces. This suggestion was rejected.

The Battle of Muret began on 12 September 1213. The Aragonese forces were disorganized and disintegrated under the assault of Montfort&#x27;s squadrons. Peter himself was caught in the thick of fighting, and died as a result of a courageous last stand. He was thrown to the ground and killed. The Aragonese forces broke in panic when their king was slain and Montfort&#x27;s crusaders won a crushing victory.

The nobility of Toulouse, vassals of the Crown of Aragon, were defeated. The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in 1229, in which the integration of the Occitan territory into the French crown was agreed upon.

Upon Peter&#x27;s death, the kingdom passed to his only son by Marie of Montpellier, the future James the Conqueror.

<text>Maurice (; ; 539 – 27 November 602) was Byzantine emperor from 582 to 602 and the last member of the Justinian dynasty. A successful general, Maurice was chosen as heir and son-in-law by his predecessor Tiberius II.

Maurice&#x27;s reign was troubled by almost constant warfare. After he became emperor, he brought the war with Sasanian Persia to a victorious conclusion. The empire&#x27;s eastern border in the South Caucasus was vastly expanded and, for the first time in nearly two centuries, the Romans were no longer obliged to pay the Persians thousands of pounds of gold annually for peace. 

Afterward, Maurice campaigned extensively in the Balkans against the Avars—pushing them back across the Danube by 599. He also conducted campaigns across the Danube, the first Roman emperor to do so in over two centuries. In the west, he established two large semi-autonomous provinces called exarchates, ruled by &quot;exarchs&quot;, or viceroys of the emperor. In Italy Maurice established the Exarchate of Italy in 584, the first real effort by the empire to halt the advance of the Lombards. With the creation of the Exarchate of Africa in 591 he further solidified the power of Constantinople in the western Mediterranean.

Maurice&#x27;s successes on battlefields and in foreign policy were counterbalanced by mounting financial difficulties of the empire. Maurice responded with several unpopular measures which alienated both the army and the general populace. In 602, a dissatisfied officer named Phocas usurped the throne, having Maurice and his six sons executed. This event would prove a disaster for the empire, sparking a twenty-six-year war with a resurgent Sassanid Persia which would leave both empires devastated prior to the Arab conquests. 

Maurice&#x27;s reign is a relatively well-documented era of late antiquity, in particular by the historian Theophylact Simocatta. The &quot;Strategikon&quot;, a manual of war which influenced European and Middle Eastern military traditions for well over a millennium, is traditionally attributed to Maurice.

==Life==
===Origins and early life===
Maurice was born in Arabissus in Cappadocia in 539. His father was Paul. He had one brother, Peter, and two sisters, Theoctista and Gordia, the latter of whom was later the wife of the general Philippicus. He is recorded to have been a native Greek speaker, unlike the previous emperors since Anastasius I Dicorus. East Roman sources call him a Cappadocian. Paul the Deacon, a late 8th-century Lombard writer, calls him the first emperor &quot;from the race of the Greeks&quot;. Evagrius, writing under Maurice&#x27;s reign, declared he traced his lines to Old Rome, which could be either truth or a flattery. A legend makes an unresolved claim that he was Armenian.

Maurice first came to Constantinople as a &quot;notarius&quot; to serve as secretary to Tiberius, the &quot;comes excubitorum&quot; (commander of the Excubitors, the imperial bodyguard). When Tiberius was named &quot;Caesar&quot; in 574, Maurice was appointed to succeed him as &quot;comes excubitorum&quot;.

===Persian War and accession to the throne===
In late 577, despite a complete lack of military experience, Maurice was named as &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot;, effectively commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army in the east. He succeeded General Justinian in the ongoing war against Sassanid Persia. At about the same time he was raised to the rank of &quot;patrikios&quot;, the empire&#x27;s senior honorific title, which was limited to a small number of holders. 

In 578, a truce in Mesopotamia came to an end and the main focus of the war shifted to that front. After Persian raids in Mesopotamia, Maurice mounted attacks on both sides of the Tigris, captured the fortress of Aphumon and sacked Singara. Sassanid emperor Khosrow sought peace in 579, but died before an agreement could be reached and his successor Hormizd IV (r. 579–590) broke off the negotiations. In 580, Byzantium&#x27;s Arab allies the Ghassanids scored a victory over the Lakhmids, Arab allies of the Sassanids, while Byzantine raids again penetrated east of the Tigris. Around this time the future Khosrow II was put in charge of the situation in Armenia, where he succeeded in convincing most of the rebel leaders to return to Sassanid allegiance, although Iberia remained loyal to the Byzantines.

The following year an ambitious campaign by Maurice, supported by Ghassanid forces under al-Mundhir III, targeted Ctesiphon, the Sassanid capital. The combined force moved south along the river Euphrates accompanied by a fleet of ships. The army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near Ctesiphon. There they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians. 

In response to Maurice&#x27;s advance, Sassanid general Adarmahan was ordered to operate in northern Mesopotamia, threatening the Roman army&#x27;s supply line. Adarmahan pillaged Osrhoene, and was successful in capturing its capital, Edessa. He then marched his army toward Callinicum on the Euphrates. With the possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone Maurice was forced to retreat. The retreat was arduous for the tired army, and Maurice and al-Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition&#x27;s failure. However, they cooperated in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum.

The mutual recriminations were not laid to rest by this. Despite his successes, al-Mundhir was accused by Maurice of treason during the preceding campaign. Maurice claimed that al-Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians, who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates. The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie, as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders. 

Both Maurice and al-Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius, who tried to reconcile them. Maurice visited Constantinople himself, where he was able to persuade Tiberius of al-Mundhir&#x27;s guilt. The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians; Irfan Shahîd says that it probably had more to do with Maurice&#x27;s dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler. This was compounded by the Byzantines&#x27; habitual distrust of the &quot;barbarian&quot; and supposedly innately traitorous Arabs, as well as by al-Mundhir&#x27;s staunchly Monophysite faith. Al-Mundhir was arrested the following year on suspicion of treachery, triggering war between Byzantines and Ghassanids and marking the beginning of the end of the Ghassanid kingdom.

In June of 582 Maurice scored a decisive victory against Adarmahan near Constantina. Adarmahan barely escaped the field, while his co-commander Tamkhosrau was killed. In the same month Emperor Tiberius was struck down by an illness which shortly thereafter killed him. In this state Tiberius initially named two heirs, each of whom was to marry one of his daughters. Maurice was betrothed to Constantina, and Germanus, related to emperor Justinian I, was married to Charito. Some historians believe that the plan was to divide the empire in two, with Maurice receiving the eastern provinces and Germanus the western. 

On 5 August, Tiberius was on his deathbed and civilian, military and ecclesiastical dignitaries awaited the appointment of his successor. He then chose Maurice and named him &quot;Caesar&quot;, after which he adopted the name &quot;Tiberius&quot;. John of Nikiû and Theophanes the Confessor write that Germanus was proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot; at the same time. However, on 11 August 582, only Maurice is recorded as &quot;Caesar&quot; in the subscription of a law of Tiberius. According to John of Nikiû, Germanus was Tiberius&#x27; favored candidate for the throne but declined out of humility. Maurice was crowned emperor soon after, on 13 August. Tiberius had reportedly prepared a speech on the matter but at this point was too weak to speak. The &quot;quaestor sacri palatii&quot; (the senior judicial official of the empire) read it for him. The speech proclaimed Maurice as &quot;Augustus&quot; and sole successor to the throne. On 14 August 582 Tiberius died. Maurice became sole emperor, marrying Constantina in the autumn.

Shortly after his ascension the advantage he had gained at the Battle of Constantina was lost when his successor as &quot;magister militum&quot; of the east, John Mystacon, was defeated at the River Nymphios by Kardarigan. The situation was difficult: Maurice ruled a bankrupt Empire; it was at war with Persia; he was paying extremely high tribute to the Avars, 80,000 gold solidi a year; and the Balkan provinces were being thoroughly devastated by the Slavs.
Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas&#x27; head, to Maurice in Constantinople. 

In 590, two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter&#x27;s son, Prince Khosrow II, the new king. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrow. Khosrow and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrow regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin&#x27;s forces near Ganzak at the Battle of the Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrow.

Subsequently, Khosrow was adopted by the emperor in order to seal their alliance. The adoption was made through a rite of &quot;adoptio per arma&quot;, which ordinarily assumed the Christian character of its partakers. However, the chief Byzantine bishops, &quot;despite their best attempts&quot;, failed to convert Khosrow. Khosrow rewarded Maurice by ceding to the empire western Armenia up to the lakes Van and Sevan, including the large cities of Martyropolis, Tigranokert, Manzikert, Ani, and Yerevan. Maurice&#x27;s treaty brought a new status-quo to the east territorially. Byzantium was enlarged to an extent never before achieved by the empire. During the new &quot;perpetual peace&quot; millions of solidi were saved by the remission of tribute to the Persians.

===Balkan war===


The Avars arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 568. Almost immediately they launched an attack on Sirmium, the keystone to the Byzantine defences on the Danube, but were repulsed. They then sent 10,000 Kotrigur Huns to invade the Byzantine province of Dalmatia. There followed a period of consolidation, during which the Byzantines paid them 80,000 gold solidi a year. In 579, his treasury empty, Tiberius II stopped the payments. 

The Avars retaliated with another siege of Sirmium. The city fell in 581. After the capture of Sirmium, the Avars demanded 100,000 solidi a year.
Refused, they used the strategically important city as a base of operations against several poorly defended forts along the Danube and began pillaging the northern and eastern Balkans. The Slavs began settling the land from the 580s on. 

In 584, the Slavs threatened the capital and in 586 the Avars besieged Thessalonica, while the Slavs went as far as the Peloponnese. After his victory on the eastern frontier in 591, Maurice was free to focus on the Balkans. He launched several campaigns against the Slavs and Avars. In 592 his troops retook Singidunum (modern Belgrade) from the Avars. His commander-in-chief Priscus defeated the Slavs, Avars and Gepids south of the Danube in 593. The same year he crossed the Danube into modern-day Wallachia to continue his series of victories. In 594, Maurice replaced Priscus with his rather inexperienced brother Peter, who, despite initial failures, scored another victory in Wallachia. Priscus, now in command of another army further upstream, defeated the Avars again in 595. The latter now only dared to attack peripherally, in Dalmatia two years later. In the same year the Byzantines concluded a peace treaty with the Avar leader Bayan I, which allowed the Byzantines to send expeditions into Wallachia. 

In 598, Maurice broke the treaty to permit a retaliation campaign inside the Avar homeland. In 599 and 601 the Byzantine forces wreaked havoc amongst the Avars and Gepids. In 602, the Slavs suffered a crushing defeat in Wallachia. The Byzantine troops were now able to hold the Danube line again. Meanwhile, Maurice was making plans for repopulating devastated areas in the Balkans by using Armenian settlers. Maurice also planned to lead further campaigns against the Avar Khaganate, so as to either destroy them or force them into submission.

===Domestic policy===
In the west, Maurice organised the threatened Byzantine dominions in Italy into the Exarchate of Italy. The Late Roman administrative system provided for a clear distinction between civil and military offices, primarily to lessen the possibility of rebellion by over-powerful provincial governors. In 584, Maurice created the office of exarch, which combined the supreme civil authority of a &quot;praetorian prefect&quot; and the military authority of a &quot;magister militum&quot; and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Constantinople. The Exarchate was successful in slowing the Lombard advance in Italy. In 591, he created a second Exarchate in Byzantine North Africa, along similar lines.

In 597, an ailing Maurice wrote his last will, in which he described his ideas of governing the empire. His eldest son, Theodosius, would rule the eastern provinces from Constantinople; his second son, Tiberius, would rule the western exarchates from Rome. Some historians believe he intended for his younger sons to rule from Alexandria, Carthage, and Antioch. His intent was to maintain the unity of the empire; this idea bears a strong resemblance to the Tetrarchy of Diocletian. However, Maurice&#x27;s violent death prevented these plans from coming to fruition.

In religious matters, Maurice was tolerant towards Monophysitism, although he was a supporter of the Council of Chalcedon. He clashed with Pope Gregory I over the latter&#x27;s defence of Rome against the Lombards.

Maurice&#x27;s efforts to consolidate the empire slowly but steadily succeeded, especially after the peace with Persia. His initial popularity apparently declined during his reign, mostly because of his fiscal policies. In 588 he announced a cut in military wages by a quarter, leading to a serious mutiny by troops on the Persian front. He refused to pay a small ransom in 599 or 600 to free 12,000 Byzantine soldiers taken prisoner by the Avars and the prisoners were killed.

==Family==
Maurice&#x27;s marriage produced nine known children:
* Theodosius (4 August 583/585 – after 27 November 602). According to John of Ephesus, he was the first son born to a reigning emperor since the birth of Theodosius II in 401. He was appointed Caesar in 587 and co-emperor on 26 March 590.
* Tiberius (died 27 November 602)
* Petrus (died 27 November 602)
* Paulus (died 27 November 602)
* Justin (died 27 November 602)
* Justinian (died 27 November 602)
* Anastasia (died c. 605)
* Theoctista (died c. 605)
* Cleopatra (died c. 605)

A daughter, Miriam/Maria, is recorded by the 12th-century chronicler Michael the Syrian and other eastern sources as married to Khosrow II but not in any Byzantine Greek ones; she is probably legendary.

His brother Petrus (c. 550 – 602) became the &quot;curopalates&quot; and was killed at the same time as Maurice. Petrus married Anastasia Aerobinda (born c. 570), daughter of Areobindus (born c. 550), and had female issue. Maurice&#x27;s nephew Domitian of Melitene was probably a son of Petrus.
==Overthrow and death==
In the autumn of 602, Maurice decreed that the army should stay for winter beyond the Danube in Sclaveni territory, seeking to capitalize the earlier campaign successes by maintaining pressure on the foreign enemies. The exhausted troops mutinied against the emperor, demanding permission to return to winter quarters. However, Maurice repeatedly ordered his troops to start a new offensive. Enraged, the army proclaimed Phocas their leader and marched to Constantinople. They demanded that Maurice abdicate and proclaim as successor either his son Theodosius or Germanus, Theodosius&#x27; father-in-law. In response, Maurice enlisted the circus factions and general Comentiolus to defend the Theodosian Walls. On 21 November, Germanus was accused of treason by Maurice and he sought sanctuary in Hagia Sophia. As riots against Maurice erupted in Constantinople, the emperor, taking his family with him, left the city on a warship heading to Nicomedia in the middle of the night of 22 November. Theodosius was put ashore with direction to seek support from the Persians, though sources claim that he never reached his destination. According to Theophylact, Germanus made an attempt for the throne but when it failed, he paid homage to Phocas, who had emerged as the heavy favorite. 

On 23 November 602, Phocas was crowned emperor in Hebdomon and two days later, entered Constantinople with unanimous support. His troops captured Maurice and his remaining family, and brought them to the Harbor of Eutropius at Chalcedon. Maurice was murdered at the harbor of Eutropius on 27 November 602. The deposed emperor was forced to watch his five younger sons executed before he was beheaded himself. There is debate over whether Theodosius managed to escape. The Persian king Khosrow II used this coup and the murder of his patron as an excuse for a renewed war against the empire.

Empress Constantina and her three daughters were temporarily spared and sent to a monastery. A few years later, Constantina and her daughters were all executed at the harbor of Eutropius when she and Germanus were found guilty of plotting against Phocas. The entire family of Maurice and Constantina was buried at the monastery of St. Mamas or Nea Metanoia that had been founded by Maurice&#x27;s sister Gordia.

==Legacy==

===Assessments===
In ancient sources, Maurice is seen as an able emperor and commander-in-chief, though the description of him by Theophylact may exaggerate these traits. He possessed insight, public spirit, and courage. He was successful in military efforts against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and in diplomacy with Khosrow II. His administrative reforms were the basis for the later introduction of themes as military districts.

Maurice is traditionally named as author of the military treatise &quot;Strategikon&quot;. Some historians now believe the &quot;Strategikon&quot; is the work of his brother or another general in his court, however.

Historian C. W. Previté-Orton believes his greatest weakness was his inability to judge how unpopular his decisions were. According to Anthony Kaldellis, his failure to keep the public opinion on his side cost him his life, which was a turning point in the fortunes of the empire. The war against Persia which it caused weakened both empires, enabling the Slavs to permanently settle the Balkans and paving the way for the Arab-Muslim expansion.

His court still used Latin alongside Greek, as did the army and administration. Historian A. H. M. Jones characterises the death of Maurice as the end of the era of Classical Antiquity, as the turmoil that shattered the empire over the next four decades permanently and thoroughly changed society and politics.

===Legends===

The first legendary accounts of Maurice&#x27;s life are recorded in the ninth century, in the work of the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. According to his chronicle &quot;Chronographia&quot;, the death of the imperial family is due to divine intervention: Christ asked the emperor to choose between a long reign or death and acceptance in the kingdom of heaven. Maurice preferred the second choice.

The same story has been recorded in a short Syriac hagiography on the life of the emperor. It is of East Syrian origin. This was later sanctified by the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the Syriac author, the emperor asked in prayer to receive a punishment in this world and a &quot;perfect reward&quot; in the kingdom of heaven. The choice was offered by an angel. Anthony Alcock has published an English translation.

According to another legend in the same text, Maurice prevented a nurse from substituting one of his sons so as to save at least one of the heirs of the empire.

It has been proposed that the name of the Albanian folk hero Muji derives from that of Emperor Maurice (Murik, Muji). Similarly, the name of the folk hero&#x27;s wife, Ajkuna (or Kuna), corresponds to that of the Empress Aelia Constantina, the wife of Maurice, if we take into account the laws of phonetic evolution of the Albanian language since Late Antiquity. Though this proposition remains a matter of debate.

<text>The Post correspondence problem is an undecidable decision problem that was introduced by Emil Post in 1946. Because it is simpler than the halting problem and the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; it is often used in proofs of undecidability.

== Definition of the problem ==

Let formula_1 be an alphabet with at least two symbols. The input of the problem consists of two finite lists formula_2 and formula_3 of words over formula_1. A solution to this problem is a sequence of indices formula_5 with formula_6 and formula_7 for all formula_8, such that

: formula_9

The decision problem then is to decide whether such a solution exists or not.

===Alternative definition===

:formula_10

:formula_11

This gives rise to an equivalent alternative definition often found in the literature, according to which any two homomorphisms formula_12 with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which now asks whether there exists a nonempty word formula_13 in the domain such that

:formula_14.

Another definition describes this problem easily as a type of puzzle. We begin with a collection of dominos, each containing two strings, one on each side. An individual domino looks like 
:formula_15 
and a collection of dominos looks like 
:formula_16. 
The task is to make a list of these dominos (repetition permitted) so that the string we get by reading off the symbols on the top is the same as the string of symbols on the bottom. This list is called a match. The Post correspondence problem is to determine whether a collection of dominos has a match.
For example, the following list is a match for this puzzle.
:formula_17.
For some collections of dominos, finding a match may not be possible. For example, the collection
:formula_18.
cannot contain a match because every top string is longer than the corresponding bottom string.

== Example instances of the problem ==

===Example 1===
Consider the following two lists:


A solution to this problem would be the sequence (3, 2, 3, 1), because

: formula_19

Furthermore, since (3, 2, 3, 1) is a solution, so are all of its &quot;repetitions&quot;, such as (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), etc.; that is, when a solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions of this repetitive kind.

However, if the two lists had consisted of only formula_20 and formula_21 from those sets, then there would have been no solution (the last letter of any such α string is not the same as the letter before it, whereas β only constructs pairs of the same letter).

A convenient way to view an instance of a Post correspondence problem is as a collection of blocks of the form

there being an unlimited supply of each type of block. Thus the above example is viewed as

&quot;i = 1&quot;
&quot;i = 2&quot;
&quot;i = 3&quot;

where the solver has an endless supply of each of these three block types. A solution corresponds to some way of laying blocks next to each other so that the string in the top cells corresponds to the string in the bottom cells. Then the solution to the above example corresponds to:

&quot;i1 = 3&quot;
&quot;i2 = 2&quot;
&quot;i3 = 3&quot;
&quot;i4 = 1&quot;
===Example 2===
Again using blocks to represent an instance of the problem, the following is an example that has infinitely many solutions in addition to the kind obtained by merely &quot;repeating&quot; a solution.


&quot;1&quot;
&quot;2&quot;
&quot;3&quot;
In this instance, every sequence of the form (1, 2, 2, . . ., 2, 3) is a solution (in addition to all their repetitions):


&quot;1&quot;
&quot;2&quot;
&quot;2&quot;
&quot;2&quot;
&quot;3&quot;
==Proof sketch of undecidability ==

The most common proof for the undecidability of PCP describes an instance of PCP that can simulate the computation of an arbitrary Turing machine on a particular input. A match will occur if and only if the input would be accepted by the Turing machine. Because deciding if a Turing machine will accept an input is a basic undecidable problem, PCP cannot be decidable either. The following discussion is based on Michael Sipser&#x27;s textbook &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Computation&quot;.

In more detail, the idea is that the string along the top and bottom will be a computation history of the Turing machine&#x27;s computation. This means it will list a string describing the initial state, followed by a string describing the next state, and so on until it ends with a string describing an accepting state. The state strings are separated by some separator symbol (usually written #). According to the definition of a Turing machine, the full state of the machine consists of three parts:
* The current contents of the tape.
* The current state of the finite-state machine which operates the tape head.
* The current position of the tape head on the tape.
Although the tape has infinitely many cells, only some finite prefix of these will be non-blank. We write these down as part of our state. To describe the state of the finite control, we create new symbols, labelled &quot;q&quot;1 through &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for each of the finite-state machine&#x27;s &quot;k&quot; states. We insert the correct symbol into the string describing the tape&#x27;s contents at the position of the tape head, thereby indicating both the tape head&#x27;s position and the current state of the finite control. For the alphabet {0,1}, a typical state might look something like:

101101110&quot;q&quot;700110.

A simple computation history would then look something like this:

&quot;q&quot;0101#1&quot;q&quot;401#11&quot;q&quot;21#1&quot;q&quot;810.

We start out with this block, where &quot;x&quot; is the input string and &quot;q&quot;0 is the start state:

The top starts out &quot;lagging&quot; the bottom by one state, and keeps this lag until the very end stage. Next, for each symbol &quot;a&quot; in the tape alphabet, as well as #, we have a &quot;copy&quot; block, which copies it unmodified from one state to the next:

We also have a block for each position transition the machine can make, showing how the tape head moves, how the finite state changes, and what happens to the surrounding symbols. For example, here the tape head is over a 0 in state 4, and then writes a 1 and moves right, changing to state 7:

Finally, when the top reaches an accepting state, the bottom needs a chance to finally catch up to complete the match. To allow this, we extend the computation so that once an accepting state is reached, each subsequent machine step will cause a symbol near the tape head to vanish, one at a time, until none remain. If &quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot; is an accepting state, we can represent this with the following transition blocks, where &quot;a&quot; is a tape alphabet symbol:


There are a number of details to work out, such as dealing with boundaries between states, making sure that our initial tile goes first in the match, and so on, but this shows the general idea of how a static tile puzzle can simulate a Turing machine computation.

The previous example

&quot;q&quot;0101#1&quot;q&quot;401#11&quot;q&quot;21#1&quot;q&quot;810.

is represented as the following solution to the Post correspondence problem:


















== Variants ==

Many variants of PCP have been considered. One reason is that, when one tries to prove undecidability of some new problem by reducing from PCP, it often happens that the first reduction one finds is not from PCP itself but from an apparently weaker version.

* The problem may be phrased in terms of monoid morphisms &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; from the free monoid &quot;B&quot;∗ to the free monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ where &quot;B&quot; is of size &quot;n&quot;. The problem is to determine whether there is a word &quot;w&quot; in &quot;B&quot;+ such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;w&quot;).
* The condition that the alphabet formula_1 have at least two symbols is required since the problem is decidable if formula_1 has only one symbol.
* A simple variant is to fix &quot;n&quot;, the number of tiles. This problem is decidable if &quot;n&quot; ≤ 2, but remains undecidable for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5. It is unknown whether the problem is decidable for 3 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 4.
* The &quot;circular&quot; Post correspondence problem asks whether indexes formula_24 can be found such that formula_25 and formula_26 are conjugate words, i.e., they are equal modulo rotation. This variant is undecidable.
* One of the most important variants of PCP is the &quot;bounded&quot; Post correspondence problem, which asks if we can find a match using no more than &quot;k&quot; tiles, including repeated tiles. A brute force search solves the problem in time O(2&quot;k&quot;), but this may be difficult to improve upon, since the problem is NP-complete. Unlike some NP-complete problems like the boolean satisfiability problem, a small variation of the bounded problem was also shown to be complete for RNP, which means that it remains hard even if the inputs are chosen at random (it is hard on average over uniformly distributed inputs).
* Another variant of PCP is called the &quot;marked&quot; Post Correspondence Problem, in which each formula_27 must begin with a different symbol, and each formula_28 must also begin with a different symbol. Halava, Hirvensalo, and de Wolf showed that this variation is decidable in exponential time. Moreover, they showed that if this requirement is slightly loosened so that only one of the first two characters need to differ (the so-called 2-marked Post Correspondence Problem), the problem becomes undecidable again.
* The Post Embedding Problem is another variant where one looks for indexes formula_29 such that formula_25 is a (scattered) subword of formula_26. This variant is easily decidable since, when some solutions exist, in particular a length-one solution exists. More interesting is the &quot;Regular&quot; Post Embedding Problem, a further variant where one looks for solutions that belong to a given regular language (submitted, e.g., under the form of a regular expression on the set formula_32). The Regular Post Embedding Problem is still decidable but, because of the added regular constraint, it has a very high complexity that dominates every multiply recursive function.
* The Identity Correspondence Problem (ICP) asks whether a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) can generate an identity pair by a sequence of concatenations. The problem is undecidable and equivalent to the following Group Problem: is the semigroup generated by a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) a group.

<text>Norman Beresford Tebbit, Baron Tebbit, (born 29 March 1931) is a retired British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet from 1981 to 1987 as Secretary of State for Employment (1981–1983), Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1983–1985), and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chairman of the Conservative Party (1985–1987). He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1970 to 1992, representing the constituencies of Epping (1970–1974) and Chingford (1974–1992).

In 1984, Tebbit was injured in the Provisional Irish Republican Army&#x27;s bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where he was staying during the Conservative Party Conference. His wife Margaret was left permanently disabled after the explosion. He left the cabinet following the 1987 general election to care for his wife.

Tebbit considered standing for the Conservative leadership following Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s resignation in 1990, but came to the decision not to stand as he had earlier made a commitment to his wife to retire from front-line politics. He did not stand for re-election as MP for Chingford in 1992, and was given a life peerage to sit in the House of Lords as Baron Tebbit, of Chingford. He retired from the House on 31 March 2022.

==Early life and career before politics==

Born in Ponders End, Middlesex, to working-class parents Leonard and Edith Tebbit, he went to Edmonton County Grammar School, which was then an academically selective state school in north London.

At the age of 16, Tebbit got a job with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and had to join NATSOPA. Disliking rules that caused members who criticised union officials to be fined or expelled (and thus lose their jobs), he recalled vowing to &quot;break the power of the closed shop&quot;.

In November 1950, Tebbit was commissioned into the Royal Air Force for national service in the rank of pilot officer. He was promoted to flying officer in April 1952. During his time in the RAF Tebbit flew Meteor and Vampire jets. In July 1954, at RAF Waterbeach near Cambridge, he had to escape from a burning Meteor 8 by breaking open the canopy, unknowingly fracturing two of his vertebrae in the accident.

On leaving the RAF, Tebbit joined BOAC in 1953 as a navigator and pilot, while initially continuing to fly in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force with 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron at North Weald in Essex. Of his airline navigation training, he later said: &quot;In those days it was a considerable academic syllabus. You had to be up to speed on spherical trigonometry to get through it&quot;.

During his time at BOAC, he was an official in the British Airline Pilots&#x27; Association. He flew Avro Yorks, Argonauts, Britannias, DC7Cs and the Boeing 707.

==Member of Parliament==
Tebbit was elected as MP for Epping in 1970 and then for Chingford in February 1974. He is recorded as an MP member of the Conservative Monday Club in 1970.

Tebbit&#x27;s first intervention as an MP was to ask a question of the then Minister at the Board of Trade, Frederick Corfield, on 6 July 1970. His question was on the subject of a crash of a Comet-4 aircraft in Spain on 3 July, which killed all the 112 people on board at the time.

In 1975, six men (the &#x27;Ferrybridge Six&#x27;) were dismissed from their jobs because of the introduction of a closed shop and were denied unemployment benefit. The Secretary of State for Employment, Michael Foot, commented: &quot;A person who declines to fall in with new conditions of employment which result from a collective agreement may well be considered to have brought about his own dismissal&quot;. Tebbit accused Foot of &quot;pure undiluted fascism&quot; and affirmed that this &quot;left Mr Foot exposed as a bitter opponent of freedom and liberty&quot;. The next day (2 December) &quot;The Times&quot; first leader —titled &quot;&quot;—quoted Tebbit and went on:

Mr Foot&#x27;s doctrine is intolerable because it is a violation of the liberty of the ordinary man in his job. Mr Tebbit is therefore using fascism in a legitimate descriptive sense when he accuses Mr. Foot of it. We perhaps need to revive the phrase &quot;social fascism&quot; to describe the modern British development of the corporate state and its bureaucratic attack on personal liberty. The question is not therefore: &quot;is Mr. Foot a fascist?&quot; but &quot;does Mr. Foot know he is a fascist?&quot;

During the Grunwick dispute, when workers went on strike over pay and working conditions, the owner George Ward refused to recognise their trade union, and there was a split in the Conservative Shadow Cabinet between the conciliatory approach of Jim Prior, the Shadow Employment Secretary, and Keith Joseph. Tebbit involved himself in that dispute by making a controversial speech on 12 September 1977, in which he said:

Inside Britain there is a ... threat from the Marxist collectivist totalitarians. ... Just to state that fact is to be accused of &#x27;union-bashing&#x27;. ... Such people are to be found in the Conservative, Liberal and Labour Parties. Their politics may be different but such people share the morality of Laval and Pétain ... they are willing not only to tolerate evil, but to excuse it. ... Both Jim Prior and Keith Joseph know that George Ward and Grunwick are not perfect, nor was Czechoslovakia perfect in 1938. But if Ward and Grunwick are destroyed by the red fascists, then, as in 1938, we will have to ask, whose turn is it next? Yes, it is like 1938. We can all see the evil, but the doctrine of appeasement is still to be heard.

Tebbit was accused of comparing Prior to Laval and at that year&#x27;s Conservative Party conference, he attempted to avoid personalising the issue, and openly splitting the party, without retracting what he had said. Tebbit said of these differences: &quot;I&#x27;m a hawk—but no kamikaze. And Jim&#x27;s a dove—but he&#x27;s not chicken&quot;.

During a debate in Parliament on 2 March 1978, Michael Foot labelled Tebbit a &quot;semi-house-trained &quot; in response to a question from Tebbit asking if he accepted that the legislation being proposed that made it compulsory for people to join a Trade Union was an act of Fascism. When he was made Lord Tebbit in 1992, he chose a polecat as one of the symbols on his coat of arms. Later, in the debate Tebbit asked Foot whether he would &quot;put a bridle on his foul-mouthed tongue&quot;.

===First Thatcher ministry===

After the Conservative Party regained power after the general election of 1979, Tebbit was appointed Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Trade.

In the September 1981 Cabinet reshuffle, Thatcher appointed Tebbit as Employment Secretary. This was seen as a shift to a &#x27;tougher&#x27; approach to the trade unions than had been the case under Tebbit&#x27;s predecessor, Jim Prior. Tebbit introduced the Employment Act 1982 which raised the level of compensation for those unfairly dismissed from a closed shop and prohibited closed shops unless 80% of relevant workers approved the arrangement in periodic ballots. It also removed trade unions&#x27; immunity from liability in tort – i.e. made trade unions liable for civil damages if they committed unlawful acts, and made injunctions possible against such acts. In his memoirs Tebbit said that the 1982 Act was his &quot;greatest achievement in Government&quot;.

In March 2021 Tebbit was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; to have said, during a Zoom meeting, that Special Branch had regularly spied on union leaders while he was employment secretary.

In the aftermath of the 1981 riots in Handsworth and Brixton, Tebbit responded to a suggestion by the Young Conservative National chairman, Iain Picton that rioting was the natural reaction to unemployment:

I grew up in the &#x27;30s with an unemployed father. He didn&#x27;t riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking till he found it.

As a result, Tebbit is often misquoted as having directly told the unemployed to &quot;get on your bike&quot;, and he was popularly referred to as &quot;Onyerbike&quot; for some considerable time afterwards.

The former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan once remarked of Tebbit: &quot;Heard a chap on the radio this morning talking with a cockney accent. They tell me he is one of Her Majesty&#x27;s ministers&quot;. Peter Dorey of Cardiff University wrote that &quot;it was Norman Tebbit... who was perhaps the public face or voice of Essex man, and articulated his views and prejudices&quot;.

===Second Thatcher ministry===
The Nuffield study of the 1983 general election found that Tebbit was the second most prominent Conservative on radio and television news broadcasts during the campaign with 81 appearances (after Thatcher&#x27;s 331 appearances).

In the post-election October 1983 reshuffle, Tebbit was moved from Employment to become Trade and Industry Secretary, replacing Cecil Parkinson, who had resigned. Thatcher had actually wanted Tebbit to become Home Secretary, but William Whitelaw vetoed this.

Tebbit was injured in the IRA&#x27;s bombing of the Grand Hotel, Brighton during the 1984 Conservative Party conference. His wife, Margaret, was permanently disabled.

In 1985, Tebbit was appointed Chairman of the Conservative Party and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Thatcher wanted to keep him in the Cabinet. During the Westland affair Tebbit was against the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation taking over Westland Aircraft. Tebbit opposed the 1986 United States bombing of Libya from British bases and objected to Thatcher&#x27;s refusal to consult the Cabinet fully on the matter. However, he did criticise the BBC for its supposedly biased reporting of the raid. During the same year, he disbanded the Federation of Conservative Students for publishing an article, penned by Harry Phibbs, following Nikolai Tolstoy&#x27;s accusation that former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was complicit in the forced repatriation of Cossacks in the aftermath of the Second World War.

On 13 April 1986, Tebbit and his chief of staff Michael Dobbs visited Thatcher at Chequers to present her with the results of polling by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi which found that with inflation down and the trade unions weakened, &quot;the Prime Minister&#x27;s combative virtues were being received as vices: her determination was perceived as stubbornness, her single-mindedness as inflexibility, and her strong will as an inability to listen&quot;. Tebbit and Dobbs told her this was becoming known as the &quot;TBW factor&quot;: TBW standing for &quot;That Bloody Woman&quot;. They recommended Thatcher take a lower profile in the forthcoming general election.

A few weeks later, Tebbit gave an interview to John Mortimer for &quot;The Spectator&quot; where he said of Thatcher: It&#x27;s a question of her leadership when our aims aren&#x27;t clearly defined. When people understand what she&#x27;s doing there&#x27;s a good deal of admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don&#x27;t agree with her. Now there&#x27;s a perception that we don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re going so those same qualities don&#x27;t seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit&#x27;s motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher&#x27;s leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.

For quite a while, Tebbit was seen as Thatcher&#x27;s natural successor as Party leader. During early 1986, when Thatcher&#x27;s popularity declined in the polls, commentators began to suggest that the succession of the Conservative leadership would lie between Michael Heseltine and Tebbit.

At the 1986 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth, Tebbit—along with Saatchi and Saatchi, Dobbs and the Conservatives&#x27; Director of Research, Robin Harris—came up with the next party slogan—&#x27;The Next Move Forward&#x27;. For the first time, the Conservatives employed pre-conference advertising to publicise the new-style conference. Tebbit persuaded Thatcher that ministers would state their objectives that they would achieve in the next three years; Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would use these to design posters, leaflets, and brochures to be deployed as each minister finished their speech. The aim &quot;was that in 1986 the media should reflect the image I wanted—of a Government confident, united, clear in where it was going—and determined to get there&quot;. According to Tebbit the conference &quot;was more successful than I had dared to hope ... the opinion polls which had us 7% behind in June and still 5% down in September now put us back into first place—a position we never relinquished from then right through the election campaign. The Prime Minister&#x27;s ratings were immediately restored&quot;.

A MORI opinion poll in March 1987 saw Tebbit as second-favourite amongst voters as Thatcher&#x27;s successor (Heseltine: 24% vs Tebbit: 15%); however, amongst Conservative voters, Tebbit was the front-runner with (Heseltine: 14% vs Tebbit: 21%). In October 1988, MORI asked the same question, with similar results (Heseltine: 22% vs Tebbit: 15%) and (Heseltine: 20% vs Tebbit: 26%) amongst Conservative voters. However, Thatcher apparently once told Rupert Murdoch: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get him elected as leader of the Tory party even if I wanted – nor would the country elect him if he was&quot;.

On 6 January 1987, the journalist Hugo Young published a quote attributed to Tebbit in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. Tebbit&#x27;s chief of staff, Michael Dobbs, responded by writing a letter to the newspaper citing Young&#x27;s dislike of Tebbit, adding &quot;Perhaps this explains the invention of the quotation he [Mr Young] attributed to Mr Tebbit&quot;. The quote was &quot;No-one with a conscience votes Conservative&quot;. Before this letter was published, however, the words &quot;the invention of&quot; had been removed. Despite publishing this letter &quot;The Guardian&quot; subsequently repeated the quote, and Young again attributed it to him in a letter to &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Tebbit feared that if no action was taken against &quot;The Guardian&quot; the Labour Party would use this quote against the Conservatives in the forthcoming general election. With Thatcher&#x27;s consent Tebbit threatened the newspaper with legal action if they did not retract the quotation and apologise to Tebbit. The case continued until 1988 when &quot;The Guardian&quot; apologised, published a retraction and paid £14,000 in libel damages in an out-of-court settlement.

During the 1987 general election, Tebbit and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spearheaded the Conservative campaign, focusing on the economy and defence. However, when on &#x27;Wobbly Thursday&#x27; it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the &#x27;exiles&#x27; camp of David Young, Tim Bell and the Young and Rubicam firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young&#x27;s memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: &quot;Norman, listen to me, we&#x27;re about to lose this fucking election&quot;. In his memoirs, Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: &quot;We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong—defence, taxation, and the economy&quot;. During the election campaign, however, Tebbit and Thatcher argued. Tebbit had already informed Thatcher at the beginning of the campaign that he would leave the government after the election to care for his wife.

Thatcher said to her friend Woodrow Wyatt on the Sunday after polling day in 1987: &quot;He&#x27;ll carry the scar of that Brighton bombing all his life. I didn&#x27;t want him to go. Whenever he is away from her he can&#x27;t even attend to business properly. He&#x27;s always ringing up to find out if the nurses are looking after his wife all right&quot;. In her memoirs, Thatcher said she &quot;bitterly regretted&quot; losing a like-minded person from the Cabinet.

On 31 July 1987, Tebbit was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour.

===Backbenches===
As Trade and Industry Secretary, Tebbit had privatised British Telecom in November 1984. He became a director of the company on 3 November 1987; this gave him an additional salary plus shares in the company.

In late 1987 and 1988, Tebbit formed a temporary alliance with Michael Heseltine in campaigning for the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, which they succeeded in achieving through a backbench amendment.

Tebbit was also prominent in an unsuccessful Conservative backbench rebellion against a Bill to give 50,000 households (around 250,000 people) from Hong Kong British citizenship.

In April 1988, Tebbit caused much controversy when, in front of an audience of South African dignitaries, he accused critics of South African apartheid of cowardice and stinking hypocrisy. He said that, although black critics attacked apartheid in South Africa, they did not speak out against violence among black tribes in South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was visiting London at the time and called on Thatcher to repudiate the remarks; instead, she defended Tebbit.

In April 1990, he proposed the &quot;Cricket test&quot;, also known as the &quot;Tebbit Test&quot;, when he argued that whether people from ethnic minorities in Britain supported the England cricket team (rather than the team from their country of ancestry) should be considered a barometer—but not the sole indicator—of whether they are truly British: &quot;A large proportion of Britain&#x27;s Asian population fail to pass the cricket test. Which side do they cheer for? It&#x27;s an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?&quot;

Tebbit told Woodrow Wyatt in 1991 that he did not think certain immigrant communities would assimilate &quot;because some of them insist on sticking to their own culture, like the Muslims in Bradford and so forth, and they are extremely dangerous&quot;. In August 2005, after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which were carried out by three young men of Pakistani descent and one of Jamaican descent, Tebbit claimed vindication for these views.

In a conversation with Woodrow Wyatt on 19 December 1988, Tebbit said he would not go back into politics unless Thatcher &quot;was run over by the proverbial bus and he didn&#x27;t like the look of the person he thought might get her job and destroy the work they&#x27;ve done&quot;. On another occasion (22 February 1990), Tebbit said to Wyatt that he would stand for the Conservative leadership if Thatcher suddenly resigned; but when Alec Douglas-Home suggested that Thatcher would not stand at the next election because she must be tired, Tebbit disagreed: &quot;She has got amazing stamina&quot;.

Following Geoffrey Howe&#x27;s resignation from the government in November 1990, Thatcher asked Tebbit to return to the Cabinet as Education Secretary, but he refused on the grounds that he was looking after his disabled wife. During the 1990 Conservative leadership election, Tebbit was on Thatcher&#x27;s campaign team with the job of assessing her support amongst Conservative MPs. According to Thatcher&#x27;s biographer John Campbell, Tebbit was &quot;her most visible cheerleader...who characteristically took the fight to Heseltine by holding a cheeky press conference on his Belgravia doorstep&quot;. After the first ballot but before the results became known, Tebbit wanted Thatcher to make a clear commitment to fight the second ballot if her vote fell short of the amount needed to win outright. When Tebbit saw Thatcher on 21 November he told her she was the candidate with the best chance of beating Heseltine. However, Thatcher withdrew from the contest the next day. Tebbit wanted to stand, but never did. Tebbit subsequently switched his support to John Major.

After Major came back from Maastricht with an opt-out from the Social Chapter and the single currency, Tebbit was one of the few MPs in the debate on 18 December 1991 to criticise the new powers the Community would acquire. He claimed the government had been on the defensive against &quot;federalist follies&quot; and that Maastricht had seen &quot;a series of bridgeheads into our constitution, into the powers of this House, and into the lives of individuals and businesses&quot;.

==After leaving the House of Commons==
Tebbit decided not to stand in the 1992 election, to devote more time to caring for his disabled wife. Following the election he was granted a life peerage and entered the House of Lords, having been created Baron Tebbit, of Chingford in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, on 6 July 1992. His former seat of Chingford was aggregated in 1997 with Woodford Green in boundary changes and was held for the Conservative Party by his successor and protégé Iain Duncan Smith. Tebbit famously said: &quot;If you think I&#x27;m right-wing, you should meet this guy&quot;.

===Maastricht Treaty and Europe===

On 11 August 1992, Woodrow Wyatt noted in his diary: &quot;[Thatcher] also seems to have formed a new alliance with Tebbit who stirs her up and talks a lot of nonsense [about the Treaty].&quot;

At the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed John Major&#x27;s government when he made a speech attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as &quot;young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident – the lager louts of our party&quot; in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, Norman Fowler. Tebbit held aloft a copy of the Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back &quot;No!&quot; after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers. Gyles Brandreth, a Conservative whip, wrote in his diary:

The talk of the town is Norman Tebbit&#x27;s vulgar grand-standing barn-storming performance on Europe. He savaged Maastricht, poured scorn on monetary union, patronised the PM...and brought the conference (or a good part of it) to its feet roaring for more. He stood there, arms aloft, acknowledging the ovation, Norman the conqueror.

In his memoirs, Major accused Tebbit of hypocrisy and disloyalty because Tebbit had encouraged Conservative MPs to vote for the Single European Act in 1986 but was now campaigning for Maastricht&#x27;s rejection.

In March 2007, Tebbit became patron of the cross-party Better Off Out campaign, which advocated British withdrawal from the EU. Tebbit issued a statement explaining his support:

From being a supporter of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 I have come to believe that the United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends and the rest of the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.

===Involvement with the Conservative Party after 1992===

Tebbit privately said of John Major on 17 November 1994: &quot;He has the mulishness of a weak man with stupidity&quot;. When asked what would it take for him to support Major, Tebbit responded: &quot;Have an entirely new department, the sole job of which would be to deal with the Brussels machinery in every aspect. I agree that we don&#x27;t want to leave the EU, but we&#x27;ve got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don&#x27;t like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of&quot;.

In 1995, Tebbit publicly backed John Redwood&#x27;s bid for the Conservative Party leadership, praising his &quot;brains, courage and humour&quot;.

In an interview for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague&#x27;s right-ward shift and said that he had &quot;never been a [Michael] Portillo fan&quot;. He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher&#x27;s resignation: &quot;When I look at what happened to the party, I tell myself that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose I am one of those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister&quot;. When asked if he regretted also allowing Major to become Prime Minister, Tebbit responded:

I helped him. If I&#x27;d opposed him, he wouldn&#x27;t have been on the radar screen. I&#x27;d have been opposing Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn&#x27;t want to go back on my word to my wife that I&#x27;d retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one&#x27;s mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn&#x27;t want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It&#x27;s possible. So I am left there. You can&#x27;t rewrite it. You can&#x27;t rerun it.

In August 2002, Tebbit called on the then leader of the Conservatives, Iain Duncan Smith, to &quot;clear out&quot; Conservative Central Office of &quot;squabbling children&quot; who were involved with infighting within the Party. He named Mark MacGregor, a former leader of the Federation of Conservative Students which Tebbit disbanded for &quot;loony Right libertarian politics&quot;, as one of them. Then, in October the same year, Tebbit accused a group of Conservative &quot;modernisers&quot; called &quot;The Movement&quot; of trying to get him expelled from the Party. Tebbit said that The Movement consisted of a &quot;loose&quot; grouping of thirteen members who had previously supported Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo for Party leader. Duncan Smith subsequently denied that Tebbit would ever be expelled and Thatcher publicly said she was &quot;appalled&quot; at attempts to have Tebbit expelled and telephoned him to say that she was &quot;four square behind him&quot;.

In February 2003, Tebbit gave a speech to an audience of the Chartered Institute of Journalists at London&#x27;s Reform Club in Pall Mall, urging journalists to reject political correctness in favour of &quot;open, honest and vigorous debate&quot;. He blamed &quot;timid&quot; politicians, including members of his own party, for allowing PC language and ideas to take hold in Britain by default.

Tebbit backed David Davis for Party leader during the 2005 Conservative leadership election.

On 30 January 2006, he accused the Conservative Party of abandoning the party&#x27;s true supporters on the Right, and opposed the new Leader David Cameron&#x27;s attempts &quot;to reposition the party on the &#x27;Left of the middle ground&#x27;&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in September 2007, Tebbit said the Conservatives lack somebody of the standing of Thatcher, and said that although it did not matter if Cameron&#x27;s team were educated at Eton, &quot;what a lot of people will suggest is that they don&#x27;t know how the other half lives. David and his colleagues – the very clever young men they have in Central Office these days – are very intellectually clever, but they have no experience of the world whatsoever. He has spent much of his time in the Conservative Party and as a public relations guy. Well, it&#x27;s not the experience of most people in the streets. That&#x27;s the real attack and that&#x27;s damaging to him, I think&quot;.
In February 2008, after a magazine article written by shadow education secretary Michael Gove, Tebbit publicly criticised what he characterised as &quot;the poisonous tree of Blairism&quot;, which he said had been &quot;planted&quot; in the Conservative Party front bench.

Tebbit is the vice-president of the Conservative Way Forward group. He continued his criticism of the Conservative Party&#x27;s move to a more &quot;centre-right&quot; position by stating that their abandonment of the traditional right vote has created a political vacuum, contributing to the rise of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), including two MP defections, both from the Conservatives.

Tebbit retired from the House of Lords on 31 March 2022, under provision in the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.

===Other political views===
====Overseas aid====
Speaking in the Lords on 26 November 1996, Lord Tebbit criticised aid to Africa, saying that most aid sent to Africa goes down a &quot;sink of iniquity, corruption and violence&quot; and does little to help the poor. A spokesman for the charity Oxfam said Tebbit&#x27;s view was &quot;simplistic and unhelpful&quot;. Later Lord Tebbit defended his statement that most money went &quot;into the pockets&quot; of politicians &quot;to buy guns for warlords&quot;.

====Homosexuality====
In a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in November 1998, Tebbit said homosexuals should be barred from being Home Secretary. A Conservative Party spokesman said Tebbit was &quot;out of touch&quot; and the official spokesman for William Hague, then Conservative Party leader, said Hague disagreed with Tebbit. In 2013, he wrote in his &quot;Telegraph&quot; blog that his views concerning whether a homosexual person could be Home Secretary had changed.

In 2004, he opposed the British Government&#x27;s Civil Partnership Act 2004. In an interview for &quot;The Big Issue&quot; in May 2013, Lord Tebbit said that the coalition government&#x27;s determination to pass the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had alienated grassroots Tories. He also speculated that it could mean that a lesbian queen could give birth to a future monarch by artificial insemination, and that the legislation might allow him to marry his own son to escape inheritance tax.

In 2018, Tebbit said that he would not attend services at St Edmundsbury Cathedral conducted by new dean Joe Hawes, because of Hawes&#x27; civil partnership with another clergyman. Tebbit described Hawes as a &quot;sodomite&quot;. Hawes said that he felt &quot;absolutely no ill will&quot; towards Tebbit for his comments and stated: &quot;I have always admired the way in which Lord Tebbit has cared for his wife with such devotion following the Brighton bomb.&quot;

====Northern Ireland====

In October 1999, he spoke out against the plans to abolish the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Tebbit said he was against throwing the Constabulary&#x27;s name and badge &quot;into the modernisation trash can&quot; and that the RUC had been &quot;the thin green line standing between bloody anarchy and the rule of law&quot;. Tebbit also mocked Blair&#x27;s pledge at the Labour conference to &quot;set people free&quot;: &quot;He has set them free. More than 250 terrorists, bombers and extortionists. Kneecappers, kidnappers, arsonists and killers have been set free. But their victims remain imprisoned. Some are imprisoned within broken bodies. Some imprisoned in grief for their loved ones. Some imprisoned by death in their graves&quot;.

====Other parties====
In an article for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in May 2001 Tebbit said that retired British security service agents from the Foreign Office had infiltrated James Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party in the 1990s and then later infiltrated UKIP. Tebbit called for an independent enquiry into the matter.

====Miners&#x27; strike====
In 2009, Tebbit said he had regrets about the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike:

Those mining communities had good working class values and a sense of family values. The men did real men&#x27;s heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that would be the end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man&#x27;s work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.

====Immigration====
In June 2014, in response to an alleged Islamist plot to infiltrate schools in Birmingham, Tebbit wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;No one should have been surprised at what was going on in schools in Birmingham. It is precisely what I was talking about over 20 years ago and Enoch Powell was warning against long before that. We have imported far too many immigrants who have come here not to live in our society, but to replicate here the society of their homelands.&quot;

====&quot;Foreigners&quot; speech====
In 2017, Lord Tebbit criticised a Lords amendment to the Brexit bill which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens to live and work within the UK after Brexit. He also criticised the Lords for &quot;thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners&quot; and &quot;[looking] after the foreigners and not the British&quot;, as Theresa May had hoped to leave this amendment out of the bill to secure the rights of British citizens living in EU countries post-Brexit. His comments produced &quot;loud gasps&quot; from the majority of peers (but gained audible support by a number on the Conservative benches), adding that &quot;Of course we don&#x27;t have the power to look after our citizens overseas, not in these days when we don&#x27;t have many gunboats&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tebbit currently lives in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He is an agnostic. He remarked tongue-in-cheek in a March 2011 interview, when asked whether he thinks God exists, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure. He ought to. Things would work better.&quot; He has two sons and a daughter. He has been described as a &#x27;keen amateur chef&#x27;, and has published a book on cooking game.

In December 2013, Tebbit suffered from a cardiac incident, praising the NHS for their quick and decisive action. In a May 2014 interview, he talked about discovering he had been suffering from a form of cardiac arrhythmia for more than 40 years: &quot;The suspicion I had a heart problem caused me to puzzle over earlier incidents in my life,&quot; he said, reflecting on his RAF jet fighter crash in 1954. &quot;I suspect that, that morning, stressed from the previous day and having had little sleep, I lost consciousness on that take-off run.&quot;

Tebbit&#x27;s wife, Baroness Tebbit, died at home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 19 December 2020 at the age of 86 after having suffered from depression and dementia with Lewy bodies.

==In the media==
In the late 1980s, Tebbit was frequently the target for stand-up comedian Ben Elton, who typically referred to him as &quot;Normo Tebbs&quot;.

Tebbit was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;. In 2011, writing in his &quot;Telegraph&quot; blog, he uncharacteristically praised an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Michael White. Tebbit cited White&#x27;s article (an account of Pauline Pearce&#x27;s visit to the 2011 Tory party conference) as being &quot;a perfect illustration of my theory of the common ground of politics.&quot;

Critics nicknamed Tebbit &quot;The Chingford Skinhead&quot;. He was portrayed as a sinister, leather-clad bovverboy beating up fellow cabinet members and keeping order in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s cabinet, by the satirical TV puppet show, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. The Professor of English at University College London, John Mullan, has written: &quot;In &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and probably the middle-class imagination, Norman Tebbit was given an Essex drag on his vowels which he hardly possessed. He should speak in that way because of what he represented&quot;.

On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was alleged to have attacked a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade in Bury St Edmunds. He is said to have been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have &quot;kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon&quot;. Tebbit later said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to deal with it. I&#x27;ve never been barged by a dragon before&quot;. A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: &quot;I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done&quot;.

In May 2009, Tebbit urged voters to snub the main three political parties in the upcoming EU Parliament election. Tebbit, who in March 2009 said that he would vote for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), stated: &quot;Local elections, the great British public should just treat as normal&quot;, but suggested using the European election to send a message to the implicated parties. Tebbit said that there were a series of smaller parties people could vote for in addition to UKIP, including the Green Party, but he urged against voting for the British National Party.

In July 2013, Tebbit was one of the guests on an episode of Peter Hennessy&#x27;s BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Reflections&quot; in which he talked about his life and career. Earlier that year he paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher, saying he wished there were &quot;someone like her now&quot;.

In 2016, Tebbit contributed an interview to the documentary film &quot;Bobby Sands: 66 Days&quot;.

== Work as a columnist ==
Tebbit was a columnist for &quot;The Sun&quot;, 1995–7; &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, 1997–2001; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; since 2010. Tebbit has also written for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot; in the past.

<doc id="64687" wikidata="Q1418029" url="?curid=64687" title="Combined arms">
<text>Combined arms is an approach to warfare that seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects—for example, using infantry and armour in an urban environment in which each supports the other.

According to the strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of &quot;supporting arms&quot; as follows:
Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).

Though the lower-echelon units of a combined arms team may be of similar types, a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher-echelon unit, whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; solution to a battlefield problem. For example, an armoured division, the modern paragon of combined arms doctrine, consists of a mixture of mechanized infantry, tank, artillery, reconnaissance, close air support and helicopter units, all of which are co-ordinated and directed by a unified command structure.

Also, most modern military units can, if the situation requires it, call on yet more branches of the military, such as infantry requesting space warfare, Cyberwarfare or Electromagnetic warfare support; or the bombing or shelling by military aircraft or naval forces to augment their ground offensive or protect their land forces. The mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level at which homogeneity ordinarily prevails, such as by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion.

==Ancient warfare==

Combined arms operations date back to antiquity, where armies would usually field a screen of skirmishers to protect their spearmen during the approach to contact. Especially in the case of the Greek hoplites, however, the focus of military thinking lay almost exclusively on the heavy infantry. In more elaborate situations armies of various nationalities fielded different combinations of light, medium, or heavy infantry, light or heavy cavalry, chariotry, camelry, elephantry, and artillery (mechanical weapons). Combined arms in this context was how to best use the cooperating units, variously armed with side-arms, spears, or missile weapons in order to coordinate an attack to disrupt and then destroy the enemy.

Philip II of Macedon greatly improved upon the limited combined arms tactics of the Greek city-states and combined the newly created Macedonian phalanx with heavy cavalry and other forces. The phalanx would hold the opposing line in place, until the heavy cavalry could smash and break the enemy line by achieving local superiority.

The early Republic Roman Legion was a combined arms force and consisted of five classes of troops. Lightly equipped velites acted as skirmishers armed with light javelins. The hastati and principes formed the main attacking strength of the legion with swords and pila, whilst the triarii formed the defensive backbone of the legion fighting as spearmen (initially as a denser Greek phalanx and later as a looser spear wall formation) with long spears and large shields. The fifth class of troops were the equites (the cavalry), which were used for scouting, pursuit and to guard the flanks.

The Legion then became notionally a unit of heavy infantrymen armed with just sword and pilum, and fielded with a small attached auxiliary skirmishers and missile troops, and incorporated a small cavalry unit. The legion was sometimes also incorporated into a higher-echelon combined arms unit – e.g., in one period it was customary for a general to command two legions plus two similarly sized units of auxiliaries, lighter units useful as screens or for combat in rough terrain. Later during the Roman Empire, auxiliary soldiers outnumbered the core legionary troops.

The army of the Han dynasty is also an example, fielding mêlée infantry (equipped with a variety of different weapons ranging from swords to pikes to halberd-like weapons), archers, crossbowmen, and cavalry (ranging from horse archers to heavy lancers). One recorded tactical formation during the Han dynasty included three ranks of halberds, swordsmen, and spearmen, supported by crossbows, and with cavalry on the flanks.

Civilizations such as the Carthaginians and Sassanids also were known to have fielded a combination of infantry supported by powerful cavalry.

==Middle Ages==
At the Battle of Hastings (1066) English infantry fighting from behind a shield wall were defeated by a Norman army consisting of archers, foot soldiers (infantry), and mounted knights (cavalry). One of the tactics used by the Normans was to tempt the English to leave the shield wall to attack retreating Norman infantry only to destroy them in the open with cavalry. Likewise Scottish sheltrons – which had been developed to counter the charges by English heavy cavalry, and had been used successfully against English cavalry at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297) – were destroyed at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) by English archers acting in concert with mounted knights. Both Hastings and Falkirk showed how combined arms could be used to defeat enemies relying on only one arm.

The English victories of Crécy, Poitiers and Agincourt were examples of a simple form of combined arms, with a combination of dismounted knights forming a foundation for formations of English longbowmen. The lightly protected longbowmen could down their French opponents at a distance, whilst the armoured men-at-arms could deal with any Frenchmen who made it to the English lines. This is the crux of combined arms: to allow a combination of forces to achieve what would be impossible for its constituent elements to do alone.

During the Middle Ages military forces used combined arms as a method of winning battles and furthering a war leader or king&#x27;s long-term goals. Some historians claim that during the Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat &quot;as a general military engagement&quot;. In the pursuit of a leader&#x27;s goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops.

Each type of military formation – infantry, archers, cavalry, or peasants – has certain advantages that the other does not have. Infantry allows a force to hold ground and in the event of overwhelming enemy forces withdraw into terrain that mounted troops cannot maneuver as easily, thus negating the advantage of the horse. Archers provide standoff with their bows or crossbows. Cavalry can maneuver faster and provide fast attack before the enemy has had time to prepare defenses. Peasants are more numerous and cheaper on the royal coffers. Over the long term the army can cross-train and learn the skills of the specialties to increase combat effectiveness. This is known as a combat multiplier today. The combination of the different skills help provide a commander the flexibility to minimize risk when it comes to engagements. The overall objective of any military force is to fight and win, while also preserving the largest number of combatants to carry on the larger strategic aims of the king. This can be seen in some of the engagements during the Middle Ages.

==15th to 18th centuries==
Generally the savanna cavalries of West Africa used a combined arms approach, seldom operating without supporting infantry.

The French army of the Valois kings, composed of heavily armoured &quot;gendarmes&quot; (professional versions of the medieval knight), Swiss and Landsknecht mercenary pikemen, and heavy cannons took form during the transition from the medieval way of war to the early modern period.

The late 15th century saw the development of combined pike and shot formations in Europe, starting with the &quot;colunelas&quot; of the Spanish general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, evolving into the &quot;tercios&quot; of Habsburg Spain and the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Emperor during the 16th century.

In Japan, at the battle of Nagashino (長篠の戦い) in 1575, forces of the Oda clan successfully employed combined arms against the Takeda clan, which heavily relied on cavalry. The Oda army erected palisades to protect their ashigaru musketeers that shot down the Takeda cavalry while their samurai cut down any enemies who managed to approach melee range.

The 17th century saw increasing use of combined arms at lower (regimental) level. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was the proponent of the idea. For fire support he attached teams of &quot;commanded musketeers&quot; to cavalry units and fielded light 3-pounder guns to provide infantry units with organic artillery.

In the eighteenth century, the concept of the legion was revived. Legions now consisted of musketeers, light infantry, dragoons and artillery in a brigade sized force. These legions often combined professional military personnel with militia. Perhaps the most notable example is the use of light cavalry, light infantry and light horse artillery in advance detachments by France&#x27;s La Grande Armée during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Napoleonic Wars==
After 25 years of near continuous warfare, the armies that met at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 were organized in a similar manner – into corps which contained infantry, cavalry and artillery (see Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign), and used similar combined arms tactics. Within each corps were divisions of infantry or cavalry made up of brigades and an artillery unit. An army would usually also have reserves of all three arms under the direct command of the army commander which could be sent in support of any corps or division of a corps to increase any arm which the army general considered necessary. The great French cavalry charge commanded by Marshal Ney during the battle failed to break Wellington&#x27;s squares of infantry and Ney&#x27;s failure to supplement his cavalry with sufficient horse artillery to break the squares open is usually given as a major contributing factor in the failure. It is an example of why generals needed to use combined arms to overcome the tactics used by enemy officers to frustrate an attack by a single arm of an army.

In contrast the 27th (Inniskilling) suffered 478 casualties from an initial strength of 750 because of their exposure to attack by French combined arms. They were located near the centre of Wellington&#x27;s line, but unlike most of the rest of Wellington&#x27;s infantry were in a declivity on the exposed side of the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment. Exposed as they were, they were forced to stand in square for most of the day for fear of cavalry attack and so made an easy dense target for Napoleon&#x27;s massed artillery.

==20th-century developments==
===First World War===
The development of modern combined arms tactics began in the First World War. Early in the Western Front, fighting descended into stagnant trench warfare. Generals on both sides applied conventional military thinking to the new weapons and situations that they faced. In these early stages, tactics typically consisted of heavy artillery barrages followed by massed frontal assaults against well entrenched enemies. These tactics were largely unsuccessful and resulted in large loss of life.

As the war progressed new combined arms tactics were developed, often described then as the &quot;all arms battle&quot;. These included direct close artillery fire support for attacking soldiers (the creeping barrage), air support and mutual support of tanks and infantry. One of the first instances of combined arms was the Battle of Cambrai, in which the British used tanks, artillery, infantry, small arms and air power to break through enemy lines. Previously such a battle would have lasted months with many hundreds of thousands of casualties. Co-ordination and planning were the key elements, and the use of combined arms tactics in the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918 allowed the Allied forces to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy trenches, forcing the surrender of the Central Powers.

===Second World War===
In World War II combined arms was a fundamental part of some operational doctrines like Heinz Guderian&#x27;s Blitzkrieg, or the Soviet deep battle doctrine, which was based on combining tanks, mobile units (mechanised infantry or cavalry) and infantry, while supported by artillery.

===Cold War years===
In 1963 the United States Marine Corps formalized the concept of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force, which combined Marine aviation and Marine ground units for expeditionary missions.

The Vietnam War had a profound influence on the development of the US Army&#x27;s combined arms doctrine. Due to the very difficult terrain that prevented access to the enemy-held areas of operation, troops were often deployed by air assault. For this reason, US troops in Vietnam saw six times more combat than in preceding wars, due to less time spent on logistic delays. The result: an infantry unit increased in effectiveness by a factor of four for its size, when supported with helicopter-delivered ammunition, food and fuel. In time the US Army in Vietnam also learned to combine helicopter operations and airmobile infantry with the armoured and artillery units operating from fire support bases as well as the US brown-water navy and USAF close air support units supporting them.

AirLand Battle was the overall conceptual framework that formed the basis of the US Army&#x27;s European warfighting doctrine from 1982 into the late 1990s. AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding those front line enemy forces.

In the 1991 Gulf War, General Schwarzkopf used a mix of strikes by fixed-wing aircraft including carpet bombing and precision bombing in combination with large numbers of strikes by attack helicopters. During the ground assault phase, tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The front line moved forward at upwards of 40–50 km/h at the upper limit of the Army&#x27;s tracked vehicles.

===Post Cold War (1992–present)===
In 2000, the US Army began developing a new set of doctrines intended to use information superiority to wage warfare. Six pieces of equipment were crucial for this: AWACS (for Airborne early warning and control), JSTARS (for Airborne ground surveillance), GPS, VHF SINCGARS (for ground and airborne communications), and ruggedized computers. The mix is supplemented by satellite photos and passive reception of enemy radio emissions, forward observers with digital target designation, specialized scouting aircraft, anti-artillery radars and gun-laying software for artillery.

Based on this doctrine, many US ground vehicles moved across the landscape alone. If they encountered an enemy troop or vehicle concentration, they would assume a defensive posture, lay down as much covering fire as they could, designate the targets for requested air and artillery assets. Within a few minutes, on station aircraft would direct their missions to cover the ground vehicle. Within a half-hour heavy attack forces would concentrate to relieve the isolated vehicle. In an hour and a half the relieved vehicle would be resupplied.

In 2020, the Israel Defense Forces established a dedicated combined arms battalion to test the viability of full integration of infantry, armor, and aircraft into a single battalion command structure. The unit fields Merkava Mk.4 main battle tanks, F-16D multirole fighters, Heron and Hermes 450 drones, and AH-64 Apache helicopters.

<text>Edward Morgan Forster (1 January 1879 – 7 June 1970) was an English author. He is best known for his novels, particularly &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1908), &quot;Howards End&quot; (1910) and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1924). He also wrote numerous short stories, essays, speeches and broadcasts, as well as a limited number of biographies and some pageant plays. His short story &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; (1909) is often viewed as the beginning of technological dystopian fiction. He also co-authored the opera &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1951). Many of his novels examine class differences and hypocrisy. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work.

Considered one of the most successful of the Edwardian era English novelists, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 22 separate years. He declined a knighthood in 1949, was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1953, and in 1961 he was one of the first five authors named as a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature.

After attending Tonbridge School, Forster studied history and classics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he met fellow future writers such as Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. He then travelled throughout Europe before publishing his first novel, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;, in 1905. His final novel, &quot;Maurice&quot;, a tale of homosexual love in early 20th-century England, was published in 1971, the year after his death. 

Many of his novels were posthumously adapted for cinema, including Merchant Ivory Productions of &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987) and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), critically acclaimed period dramas which featured lavish sets and esteemed British actors, including Helena Bonham Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis, Hugh Grant, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Director David Lean filmed another well-received adaptation, &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, in 1984.

==Early life==
Forster, born at 6 Melcombe Place, Dorset Square, London NW1, which no longer stands, was the only child of the Anglo-Irish Alice Clara &quot;Lily&quot; (née Whichelo) and a Welsh architect, Edward Morgan Llewellyn Forster. He was registered as Henry Morgan Forster, but accidentally baptised Edward Morgan Forster. His father died of tuberculosis on 30 October 1880 before Forster&#x27;s second birthday. 
In 1883, he and his mother moved to Rooks Nest, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where they lived until 1893. This was to serve as a model for the house Howards End in his novel of that name. It is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England for historic interest and literary associations. Forster had fond memories of his childhood at Rooks Nest. He continued to visit the house into the later 1940s, and he retained the furniture all his life.
Among Forster&#x27;s ancestors were members of the Clapham Sect, a social reform group in the Church of England. Forster inherited £8,000 () in trust from his paternal great-aunt Marianne Thornton (daughter of the abolitionist Henry Thornton), who died on 5 November 1887. This was enough to live on and enabled him to become a writer. He attended as a day boy Tonbridge School in Kent, where the school theatre has been named in his honour, although he is known to have been unhappy there.

At King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1897–1901, he became a member of a discussion society known as the Apostles (formally the Cambridge &quot;Conversazione&quot; Society). They met in secret to discuss their work on philosophical and moral questions. Many of its members went on to constitute what came to be known as the Bloomsbury Group, of which Forster was a member in the 1910s and 1920s. There is a famous recreation of Forster&#x27;s Cambridge at the beginning of &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;. The Schlegel sisters of &quot;Howards End&quot; are based to some degree on Vanessa and Virginia Stephen. Forster graduated with a BA with second-class honours in both classics and history.

In 1904, Forster travelled in Greece and Italy out of interest in their classical heritage. He then sought a post in Germany, to learn the language, and spent several months in the summer of 1905 in Nassenheide, Pomerania (now the Polish village of Rzędziny), as a tutor to the children of the writer Elizabeth von Arnim. He wrote a short memoir of this experience, which was one of the happiest times in his life.
In 1906 Forster fell in love with Syed Ross Masood, a 17-year-old Indian future Oxford student he tutored in Latin. Masood had a more romantic, poetic view of friendship, confusing Forster with avowals of love. After leaving university, Forster travelled in Europe with his mother. They then moved to Weybridge, Surrey, where he wrote all six of his novels.

In 1914, he visited Egypt, Germany and India with the classicist Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, by which time he had written all but one of his novels. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, Forster served as a Chief Searcher (for missing servicemen) for the British Red Cross in Alexandria, Egypt. Though conscious of his repressed desires, it was only then, while stationed in Egypt, that he &quot;lost his R [respectability]&quot; to a wounded soldier in 1917.

Forster spent a second spell in India in the early 1920s as private secretary to Tukojirao III, Maharajah of Dewas. &quot;The Hill of Devi&quot; is his non-fictional account of this period. After returning to London from India, he completed the last novel of his to be published in his lifetime, &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1924), for which he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. He also edited the letters of Eliza Fay (1756–1816) from India, in an edition first published in 1925. In 2012, Tim Leggatt, who had known Forster for his last 15 years, wrote a memoir based on unpublished correspondence with him over those years.

==Career==

Forster was awarded a Benson Medal in 1937. In the 1930s and 1940s, Forster became a notable broadcaster on BBC Radio, and while George Orwell was the BBC India Section talks producer from 1941 to 1943, he commissioned from Forster a weekly book review. Forster became publicly associated with the British Humanist Association. In addition to his broadcasting, he advocated individual liberty and penal reform and opposed censorship by writing articles, sitting on committees and signing letters.

Forster was open about his homosexuality to close friends, but not to the public. He never married, but had a number of male lovers during his adult life. He developed a long-term relationship with Bob Buckingham (1904–1975), a married policeman, which lasted for 40 years. Forster included Buckingham and his wife May in his circle, which included J. R. Ackerley, a writer and literary editor of &quot;The Listener,&quot; the psychologist W. J. H. Sprott, and for a time, the composer Benjamin Britten. Other writers with whom he associated included Christopher Isherwood, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and the Belfast-based novelist Forrest Reid. He was a close friend of the socialist poet and philosopher Edward Carpenter. A visit to Carpenter and his younger lover George Merrill in 1913 inspired Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Maurice&quot;, which is partly based on them.

In 1960, Forster began a relationship with the Bulgarian émigré Mattei Radev, a picture framer and art collector who moved in Bloomsbury group circles. He was Forster&#x27;s junior by 46 years. They met at Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset, a country retreat shared by Edward Sackville-West and the gallery owner and artist Eardley Knollys.
From 1925 until his mother&#x27;s death at age 90 in March 1945, Forster lived with her at the house of West Hackhurst in the village of Abinger Hammer, Surrey; he continued to live there until September 1946. His London base was 26 Brunswick Square from 1930 to 1939, after which he rented 9 Arlington Park Mansions in Chiswick until at least 1961. After a fall in April 1961, he spent his final years in Cambridge at King&#x27;s College.

Forster was elected an honorary fellow of King&#x27;s College in January 1946, and lived for the most part in the college, doing relatively little. In April 1947 he arrived in America for a three-month nationwide tour of public readings and sightseeing, returning to the East Coast in June. He declined a knighthood in 1949 and was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1953. At age 82, he wrote his last short story, &quot;Little Imber&quot;, a science fiction tale. According to his friend Richard Marquand, Forster was critical of American foreign policy in his latter years, which was one reason he refused offers to adapt his novels for the screen, as Forster felt such productions would involve American financing.

At 85 he went on a pilgrimage to the Wiltshire countryside that had inspired his favourite among his own novels &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;, escorted by William Golding. In 1961, he was one of the first five authors named as a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature. In 1969, he was made a member of the Order of Merit. Forster died of a stroke on 7 June 1970 at the age of 91, at the Buckinghams&#x27; home in Coventry, Warwickshire. His ashes, mingled with those of Buckingham, were later scattered in the rose garden of Coventry&#x27;s crematorium, near Warwick University.

==Work==
===Novels===

Forster had five novels published in his lifetime. Although &quot;Maurice&quot; was published shortly after his death, it had been written nearly sixty years earlier. His first novel, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; (1905), tells of Lilia, a young English widow who falls in love with an Italian, and of the efforts of her bourgeois relatives to get her back from Monteriano (based on San Gimignano). Philip Herriton&#x27;s mission to retrieve her from Italy has features in common with that of Lambert Strether in Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Ambassadors.&quot; Forster discussed James&#x27; novel ironically and somewhat disapprovingly in his book &quot;Aspects of the Novel&quot; (1927). &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; was adapted as a 1991 film directed by Charles Sturridge, starring Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Graves, Judy Davis and Helen Mirren.

Next, Forster published &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; (1907), an inverted &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; following the lame Rickie Elliott from Cambridge to a career as a struggling writer and then a post as a schoolmaster, married to an unappealing Agnes Pembroke. In a series of scenes on the Wiltshire hills, which introduce Rickie&#x27;s wild half-brother Stephen Wonham, Forster attempts a kind of sublime related to those of Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence.

Forster&#x27;s third novel, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1908), is his lightest and most optimistic. It was started in 1901, before any of his others, initially under the title &quot;Lucy&quot;. It explores young Lucy Honeychurch&#x27;s trip to Italy with a cousin and the choice she must make between the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. George&#x27;s father Mr Emerson quotes thinkers who influenced Forster, including Samuel Butler. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1985 by the Merchant Ivory team, starring Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day-Lewis, and as a televised adaptation of the same name in 2007 by Andrew Davies.

&quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; and &quot;A Room with a View&quot; can be seen as Forster&#x27;s Italian novels. Both include references to the famous Baedeker guidebooks and concern narrow-minded middle-class English tourists abroad. The books share themes with his short stories collected in &quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;The Eternal Moment&quot;.

&quot;Howards End&quot; (1910) is an ambitious &quot;condition-of-England&quot; novel about various groups among the Edwardian middle classes, represented by the Schlegels (bohemian intellectuals), the Wilcoxes (thoughtless plutocrats) and the Basts (struggling lower-middle-class aspirants). &quot;Howards End&quot; was adapted as a film in 1992 by the Merchant-Ivory team, starring Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter. Thompson won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Margaret Schlegel. It was also adapted as a miniseries in 2017. An opera libretto &quot;Howards End, America&quot; was created in 2016 by Claudia Stevens.

Forster&#x27;s greatest success, &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1924), takes as its subject the relations between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. Forster connects personal relations with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the Marabar Caves. Forster makes special mention of the author Ahmed Ali and his &quot;Twilight in Delhi&quot; in a preface to its Everyman&#x27;s Library Edition. &quot;A Passage to India&quot; was adapted as a play in 1960, directed by Frank Hauser, and as a film in 1984, directed by David Lean, starring Alec Guinness, Judy Davis and Peggy Ashcroft, with the latter winning the 1985 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

&quot;Maurice&quot; (1971), published posthumously, is a homosexual love story that also returns to matters familiar from Forster&#x27;s first three novels, such as the suburbs of London in the English home counties, the experience of attending Cambridge, and the wild landscape of Wiltshire. The novel was controversial, given that Forster&#x27;s homosexuality had not been publicly known or widely acknowledged. Today&#x27;s critics continue to debate over the extent to which Forster&#x27;s sexuality and personal activities influenced his writing. &quot;Maurice&quot; was adapted as a film in 1987 by the Merchant Ivory team. It starred James Wilby and Hugh Grant who played lovers (for which both gained acclaim) and Rupert Graves, with Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow and Ben Kingsley in the supporting cast.

Early in his career, Forster attempted a historical novel about the Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho and the Italian condottiero Sigismondo de Malatesta, but was dissatisfied with the result and never published it, though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.

===Critical reception===

Forster&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;, was described by reviewers as &quot;astonishing&quot; and &quot;brilliantly original&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; (forerunner of &quot;The Guardian&quot;) noted &quot;a persistent vein of cynicism which is apt to repel,&quot; though &quot;the cynicism is not deep-seated.&quot; The novel is labelled &quot;a sordid comedy culminating, unexpectedly and with a real dramatic force, in a grotesque tragedy.&quot; Lionel Trilling remarked on this first novel as &quot;a whole and mature work dominated by a fresh and commanding intelligence&quot;.

Subsequent books were similarly received on publication. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented on &quot;Howards End&quot;, describing it as &quot;a novel of high quality written with what appears to be a feminine brilliance of perception... witty and penetrating.&quot; An essay by David Cecil in &quot;Poets and Storytellers&quot; (1949) describes Forster as &quot;pulsing with intelligence and sensibility&quot;, but primarily concerned with an original moral vision: &quot;He tells a story as well as anyone who ever lived&quot;.

The beginning of technological dystopian fiction is traced to Forster&#x27;s &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, a 1909 short story where most people live underground in isolation. M Keith Booker states that &quot;The Machine Stops,&quot; &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; are &quot;the great defining texts of the genre of dystopian fiction, both in [the] vividness of their engagement with real-world social and political issues and in the scope of their critique of the societies on which they focus.&quot; Will Gompertz for the BBC writes, &quot;The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020.&quot;

American interest in Forster was spurred by Lionel Trilling&#x27;s &quot;E. M. Forster: A Study&quot;, which called him &quot;the only living novelist who can be read again and again and who, after each reading, gives me what few writers can give us after our first days of novel-reading, the sensation of having learned something.&quot; 

Criticism of his works has included comments on unlikely pairings of characters who marry or get engaged and the lack of realistic depiction of sexual attraction.

===Key themes===
Forster was President of the Cambridge Humanists from 1959 until his death and a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association from 1963 until his death. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections despite the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the 1938 essay &quot;What I Believe&quot; (reprinted with two other humanist essays – and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter). When Forster&#x27;s cousin Philip Whichelo donated a portrait of Forster to the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GLHA), Jim Herrick, the founder, quoted Forster&#x27;s words: &quot;The humanist has four leading characteristics – curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.&quot;
Two of Forster&#x27;s best-known works, &quot;A Passage to India&quot; and &quot;Howards End&quot;, explore the irreconcilability of class differences. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; also shows how questions of propriety and class can make human connection difficult. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is his most widely read and accessible work, remaining popular long after its original publication. His posthumous novel &quot;Maurice&quot; explores the possibility of class reconciliation as one facet of a homosexual relationship.

Sexuality is another key theme in Forster&#x27;s works. Some critics have argued that a general shift from heterosexual to homosexual love can be observed throughout the course of his writing career. The foreword to &quot;Maurice&quot; describes his struggle with his homosexuality, while he explored similar issues in several volumes of short stories. Forster&#x27;s explicitly homosexual writings, the novel &quot;Maurice&quot; and the short story collection &quot;The Life to Come,&quot; were published shortly after his death. Beyond his literary explorations of sexuality, Forster also expressed his views publicly; in 1953, Forster openly advocated in &quot;The New Statesman and Nation&quot; for a change in the law in regard to homosexuality (which would be legalised in England and Wales in 1967, three years prior to his death), arguing that homosexuality between adults should be treated without bias and on the same grounds as heterosexuality.

Forster is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised (as by his friend Roger Fry) for his attachment to mysticism. One example of his symbolism is the wych elm tree in &quot;Howards End.&quot; The characters of Mrs Wilcox in that novel and Mrs Moore in &quot;A Passage to India&quot; have a mystical link with the past, and a striking ability to connect with people from beyond their own circles. Forster, Henry James, and W. Somerset Maugham were the earliest writers in English to portray characters from diverse countries – France, Germany, Italy and India. Their work explores cultural conflict, but arguably the motifs of humanism and cosmopolitanism are dominant. In a way, this is anticipation of the concept of human beings shedding national identities and becoming more and more liberal and tolerant.

<text>[[Count|&quot;Comte&quot;]] Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (24 November 1864 – 9 September 1901), known as Toulouse-Lautrec (), was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist, and illustrator whose immersion in the colourful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant, and provocative images of the sometimes decadent affairs of those times.

Born into the aristocracy, Toulouse-Lautrec broke both his legs around the time of his adolescence and, possibly due to the rare condition pycnodysostosis, was very short as an adult due to his undersized legs. In addition to alcoholism, he developed an affinity for brothels and prostitutes that directed the subject matter for many of his works, which record details of the late-19th-century bohemian lifestyle in Paris. He is among the painters described as being Post-Impressionists, with Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Georges Seurat also commonly considered as belonging in this loose group.

In a 2005 auction at Christie&#x27;s auction house, &quot;La Blanchisseuse&quot;, Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4 million, setting a new record for the artist for a price at auction.

==Early life==
Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born at the Château du Bosc, Camjac, Aveyron, in the south of France, the firstborn child of Count Alphonse de Toulouse-Lautrec Montfa (1838–1913) and Adèle Zoë Tapié de Celeyran (1841–1930). He was a member of an aristocratic family (descended from both the Counts of Toulouse and Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, as well as the Viscounts of Montfa). His younger brother was born in 1867 but died the following year. Both sons enjoyed the &quot;titres de courtoisie&quot; of &quot;Comte&quot;. If Toulouse-Lautrec had outlived his father, he would have inherited the family title of &quot;Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec&quot;.

After the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s parents separated, and a nanny cared for him. At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec lived with his mother in Paris, where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. A friend of his father, René Princeteau, sometimes visited to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s early paintings are of horses, a speciality of Princeteau&#x27;s and a subject Toulouse-Lautrec later revisited in his &quot;Circus Paintings&quot;.

In 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at Amélie-les-Bains, and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son&#x27;s growth and development.

===Disability and health problems===

Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s parents were first cousins (their mothers were sisters), and his congenital health conditions have often been attributed to a family history of inbreeding.

At the age of 13, Toulouse-Lautrec fractured his right femur, and at age 14, he fractured his left femur. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder along the lines of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s legs ceased to grow when he reached . He developed an adult torso while retaining his child-sized legs.

==Paris==
During a stay in Nice, France, his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s parents to allow him to return to Paris and study under the portrait painter Léon Bonnat. He returned to Paris in 1882. Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family&#x27;s influence to gain him entry to Bonnat&#x27;s studio. He was drawn to Montmartre, the area of Paris known for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years.

After Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of Fernand Cormon in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time, he met Émile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat&#x27;s, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumoured to be Marie-Charlet.

=== Early career ===
In 1885, Toulouse-Lautrec began to exhibit his work at the cabaret of Aristide Bruant&#x27;s &quot;Mirliton&quot;.

With his studies finished, Toulouse-Lautrec participated in an exposition in 1887 in Toulouse using the pseudonym &quot;Tréclau&quot;, the verlan of the family name &quot;Lautrec&quot;. He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and Louis Anquetin.

In 1885, Toulouse-Lautrec met Suzanne Valadon. He made several portraits of her and supported her ambition as an artist. It is believed that they were lovers and that she wanted to marry him. Their relationship ended, and Valadon attempted suicide in 1888.

=== Rise to recognition ===
In 1888, the Belgian critic Octave Maus invited Lautrec to present eleven pieces at the &quot;Vingt&quot; (the &#x27;Twenties&#x27;) exhibition in Brussels in February. Theo van Gogh, the brother of Vincent van Gogh, bought &quot;Poudre de Riz&quot; (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the Goupil &amp; Cie gallery.
From 1889 to 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the Salon des Indépendants regularly. He made several landscapes of Montmartre. Tucked deep into Montmartre in Monsieur Pere Foret&#x27;s garden, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant en plein air paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in &quot;The Laundress&quot; (1888).

In 1890, during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, he challenged to a duel the artist Henry de Groux, who criticised van Gogh&#x27;s works. Paul Signac also declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh&#x27;s honour if Lautrec was killed. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group, and the duel never took place.

Toulouse-Lautrec contributed several illustrations to the magazine &quot;Le Rire&quot; during the mid-1890s.

=== Interactions with women ===
In addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also visited prostitutes. He was fascinated by their lifestyle as well as that of the &quot;urban underclass&quot;, and he incorporated those characters into his paintings. Fellow painter Édouard Vuillard later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, &quot;the real reasons for his behaviour were moral ones ... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his condition and the moral penury of the prostitute.&quot;

The prostitutes inspired Toulouse-Lautrec. He would frequently visit a brothel located in Rue d&#x27;Amboise, where he had a favourite called Mireille. He created about a hundred drawings and fifty paintings inspired by the life of these women. In 1892 and 1893, he created a series of two women in bed together called &quot;Le Lit&quot;, and in 1894 he painted from memory in his studio.

Toulouse-Lautrec declared, &quot;A model is always a stuffed doll, but these women are alive. I wouldn&#x27;t venture to pay them the hundred sous to sit for me, and God knows whether they would be worth it. They stretch out on the sofas like animals, make no demand and they are not in the least bit conceited.&quot; He was well appreciated by the women, saying, &quot;I have found girls of my own size! Nowhere else do I feel so much at home.&quot;

=== The Moulin Rouge ===
When the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened in 1889, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as La Goulue (The Glutton), who created the French can-can; and the much subtler dancer Jane Avril.

Other café-concerts also commissioned posters from Toulouse-Lautrec, such as the Café des Ambassadeurs, for which he made the now iconic poster of his friend Aristide Bruant, when he moved there in 1892.

==London==

Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s family were Anglophiles, and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough. He travelled to London, where he was commissioned by the J. &amp; E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their paper confetti (plaster confetti was banned after the 1892 Mardi Gras) and the bicycle advert &quot;La Chaîne Simpson&quot;.

While in London, Toulouse-Lautrec met and befriended Oscar Wilde. When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him, and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde&#x27;s trial.

==Alcoholism==

Toulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which some biographers have conjectured may have contributed to his abuse of alcohol.

Toulouse-Lautrec initially drank only beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into spirits, namely absinthe. The &quot;Earthquake Cocktail&quot; (&quot;Tremblement de Terre&quot;) is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half cognac in a wine goblet. Because of his underdeveloped legs, he walked with the aid of a cane, which he hollowed out and kept filled with liquor in order to ensure that he was never without alcohol.

==Cooking skills==
Like Claude Monet, Lautrec was known for his cooking. Culinary historian Alexandra Leaf highlights Monet and Lautrec as the two &quot;most serious gourmets&quot; among their peers. Lautrec&#x27;s love for cooking stemmed from his family upbringing and early childhood where he first learned the importance of culinary values. Before he became widely known as a painter, he was called &quot;Henri the cook&quot; by his cousins.

Lautrec&#x27;s penchant for art and cooking eventually led him to combine the visual and culinary arts, usually as a formal celebration of the release of new artworks, resulting in legendary parties for which he designed the menu (which were often artworks in themselves), bought and prepared the food, and created and often invented entirely new cocktails. Lautrec&#x27;s most famous party, held at the Natansons&#x27; Paris house in February 1895, is often regarded as one of the most notorious parties in art history. 300 guests were invited, with a claimed 2,000 cocktails served, all accompanied by side dishes of gourmet food, with Lautrec working diligently as the sole chef and bartender, dressed in a white linen jacket, complete with a freshly shaved bald head and no beard. Ironically, by the end of the night, Lautrec appeared to be the only one still awake and sober.

Lautrec was part of a group of gourmands, initially formed by Gustave Geffroy (1855–1926), the historian of the Impressionists, and Claude Monet, who met up every Friday night for dinner at &quot;Drouant&quot;, a restaurant in the Palais Garnier neighborhood. After Lautrec&#x27;s death, his close friend Maurice Joyant published Lautrec&#x27;s collection of recipessome original, some adaptedin the book &quot;La Cuisine de Monsieur Momo, Célibataire&quot; (1930), along with a color book frontispiece of &quot;Toulouse Lautrec Cooking&quot; by Vuillard. It was revised in 1966 as &quot;L&#x27;art de la cuisine&quot;. The cookbook features 150 recipes, many of which were Lautrec&#x27;s signature dishes, such as &quot;Catalan salad&quot;. Art historian Charles Stuckey describes it as the first cookbook ever published by an artist, albeit posthumously. An English translation, entitled &quot;The Art of Cuisine&quot; was published in 1966.

==Death==
By February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s alcoholism began to take its toll, and he collapsed from exhaustion. His family had him committed to Folie Saint-James, a sanatorium in Neuilly-sur-Seine for three months. While committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio and travelled throughout France. Both his physical and mental health began to decline due to alcoholism and syphilis.

On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, Toulouse-Lautrec died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother&#x27;s estate, Château Malromé, in Saint-André-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimetière de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometres from the estate. Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s last words reportedly were &quot;Le vieux con!&quot; (&quot;The old fool!&quot;), his goodbye to his father.

After Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s death, his mother, &quot;Comtesse&quot; Adèle de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in Albi, his birthplace, to show his works. This Musée Toulouse-Lautrec owns the most extensive collection of his works.

==Art==
In a career of less than 20 years, Toulouse-Lautrec created:
* 737 paintings on canvas
* 275 watercolours
* 363 prints and posters
* 5,084 drawings
* some ceramic and stained-glass work
* an unknown (80+) number of lost works
Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, that within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at &quot;A Bar at the Folies-Bergère&quot; by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s style was also influenced by the Ukiyo-e genre of Japanese woodblock prints, which became popular in the Parisian art world.

Toulouse-Lautrec excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the colour and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualised. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette &quot;alone&quot;, and the names of many of these characters have been recorded. His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately &quot;sympathetic&quot; and &quot;dispassionate&quot;.

Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s skilled depiction of people relied on his highly linear approach emphasising contours. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes leaving much of the board visible. Many of his works may be best described as &quot;drawings in coloured paint.&quot;

On 20 August 2018, Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television programme &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot;. Researchers attempted to discover whether he had created two newly discovered sketchbooks.

<text>The bombing of Dresden was a joint British and American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, during World War II. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 772 heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed more than of the city centre. Up to 25,000 people were killed. Three more USAAF air raids followed, two occurring on 2 March aimed at the city&#x27;s railway marshalling yard and one smaller raid on 17 April aimed at industrial areas.

Postwar discussions about whether the attacks were justified made the event a moral &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of the war. Nazi Germany&#x27;s desperate struggle to maintain resistance in the closing months of the war is widely understood today, but Allied intelligence assessments at the time painted a different picture. There was uncertainty over whether the Soviets could sustain their advance on Germany, and rumours of the establishment of a Nazi redoubt in Southern Germany were taken too seriously.

The Allies saw the Dresden operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target, which United States Air Force reports, declassified decades later, noted as a major rail transport and communication centre, housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort. Several researchers later asserted that not all communications infrastructure was targeted, and neither were the extensive industrial areas located outside the city centre. Critics of the bombing argue that Dresden was a cultural landmark with little strategic significance, and that the attacks were indiscriminate area bombing and were not proportionate to military gains. Some claim that the raid was a war crime. Nazi propaganda exaggerated the death toll of the bombing and its status as mass murder, and many in the German far-right have referred to it as &quot;Dresden&#x27;s Holocaust of bombs&quot;.

In the decades since the war, large variations in the claimed death toll have led to controversy, though the numbers themselves are no longer a major point of contention among historians. City authorities at the time estimated that there were as many as 25,000 victims, a figure that subsequent investigations supported, including a 2010 study commissioned by the city council. In March 1945, the German government ordered its press to publish a falsified casualty figure of 200,000, and death tolls as high as 500,000 have been claimed. These inflated figures were disseminated in the West for decades, notably by David Irving, a Holocaust denier, who in 1966 announced that the documentation he had worked from had been forged and that the real figures supported the 25,000 number.
==Background==

Early in 1945, the German offensive known as the Battle of the Bulge had been exhausted, as was the Luftwaffe&#x27;s failed New Year&#x27;s Day attack. The Red Army had launched its Silesian Offensives into pre-war German territory. The German army was retreating on all fronts, but still resisting. On 8 February 1945, the Red Army crossed the Oder River, with positions just from Berlin. A special British Joint Intelligence Subcommittee report, &quot;German Strategy and Capacity to Resist&quot;, prepared for Winston Churchill&#x27;s eyes only, predicted that Germany might collapse as early as mid-April if the Soviets overran its eastern defences. Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans might hold out until November if they could prevent the Soviets from taking Silesia. Despite the post-war assessment, there were serious doubts in Allied intelligence as to how well the war was going for them, with fears of a &quot;Nazi redoubt&quot; being established, or of the Russian advance faltering. Hence, any assistance to the Soviets on the Eastern Front could shorten the war.

A large scale aerial attack on Berlin and other eastern cities was examined under the code name Operation Thunderclap in mid-1944, but was shelved on 16 August. This was later reexamined, and the decision made to pursue a more limited operation. The Soviet Army continued its push towards the Reich despite severe losses, which they sought to minimize in the final phase of the war. On 5 January 1945, two North American B-25 Mitchell bombers dropped 300,000 leaflets over Dresden with the &quot;Appeal of 50 German generals to the German army and people&quot;.

On 22 January 1945, the RAF director of bomber operations, Air Commodore Sydney Bufton, sent Deputy Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Sir Norman Bottomley a minute suggesting that if Thunderclap was timed so that it appeared to be a coordinated air attack to aid the current Soviet offensive, then the effect of the bombing on German morale would be increased. On 25 January, the Joint Intelligence Committee supported the idea, as Ultra-based intelligence had indicated that dozens of German divisions deployed in the west were moving to reinforce the Eastern Front, and that interdiction of these troop movements should be a &quot;high priority&quot;. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, AOC-in-C Bomber Command, nicknamed &quot;Bomber Harris&quot;, was known as an ardent supporter of area bombing; when asked for his view, he proposed a simultaneous attack on Chemnitz, Leipzig and Dresden. That evening Churchill asked the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, what plans had been drawn up to carry out these proposals. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff, answered: &quot;We should use available effort in one big attack on Berlin and attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz, or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East, but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West.&quot; He mentioned that aircraft diverted to such raids should not be taken away from the current primary tasks of destroying oil production facilities, jet aircraft factories, and submarine yards.

Churchill was not satisfied with this answer and on 26 January pressed Sinclair for a plan of operations: &quot;I asked [last night] whether Berlin, and no doubt other large cities in east Germany, should not now be considered especially attractive targets ... Pray, report to me tomorrow what is going to be done&quot;.

In response to Churchill&#x27;s inquiry, Sinclair approached Bottomley, who asked Harris to undertake attacks on Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz as soon as moonlight and weather permitted, &quot;with the particular object of exploiting the confused conditions which are likely to exist in the above-mentioned cities during the successful Russian advance&quot;. This allowed Sinclair to inform Churchill on 27 January of the Air Staff&#x27;s agreement that, &quot;subject to the overriding claims&quot; on other targets under the Pointblank Directive, strikes against communications in these cities to disrupt civilian evacuation from the east and troop movement from the west would be made.

On 31 January, Bottomley sent Portal a message saying a heavy attack on Dresden and other cities &quot;will cause great confusion in civilian evacuation from the east and hamper movement of reinforcements from other fronts&quot;. British historian Frederick Taylor mentions a further memo sent to the Chiefs of Staff Committee by Air Marshal Sir Douglas Evill on 1 February, in which Evill states interfering with mass civilian movements was a key factor in the decision to bomb the city centre. Attacking main railway junctions, telephone systems, city administration and utilities would result in &quot;chaos&quot;. Britain had ostensibly learned this after the Coventry Blitz, when loss of this crucial infrastructure had supposedly longer-lasting effects than attacks on war plants.

During the Yalta Conference on 4 February, the Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, General Aleksei Antonov, raised the issue of hampering the reinforcement of German troops from the western front by paralyzing the junctions of Berlin and Leipzig with aerial bombardment. In response, Portal, who was in Yalta, asked Bottomley to send him a list of objectives to discuss with the Soviets. Bottomley&#x27;s list included oil plants, tank and aircraft factories and the cities of Berlin and Dresden. However, according to Richard Overy, the discussion with the Soviet Chief of Staff, Aleksei Antonov, recorded in the minutes, only mentions the bombing of Berlin and Leipzig. The bombing of Dresden was a Western plan, but the Soviets were told in advance about the operation.

===Military and industrial profile===

According to the RAF at the time, Dresden was Germany&#x27;s seventh-largest city and the largest remaining unbombed, built-up area. Taylor writes that an official 1942 guide to the city described it as &quot;one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich&quot; and in 1944 the German Army High Command&#x27;s Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that were supplying the army with materiel. Nonetheless, according to some historians, the contribution of Dresden to the German war effort may not have been as significant as the planners thought.

The US Air Force Historical Division wrote a report, which remained classified until December 1978, in response to international concern about the bombing. It said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the German war effort at the time of the raid. According to the report, there were aircraft components factories; a poison gas factory (Chemische Fabrik Goye and Company); an anti-aircraft and field gun factory (Lehman); an optical goods factory (Zeiss Ikon AG); and factories producing electrical and X-ray apparatus ( AG); gears and differentials (Saxoniswerke); and electric gauges (Gebrüder Bassler). The report also mentioned barracks, hutted camps, and a munitions storage depot.

The USAF report also states that two of Dresden&#x27;s traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east–west along the central European uplands. The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines. Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that &quot;I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians&quot;.

An RAF memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack gave some reasoning for the raid:

In the raid, major industrial areas in the suburbs, which stretched for miles, were not targeted. According to historian Donald Miller, &quot;the economic disruption would have been far greater had Bomber Command targeted the suburban areas where most of Dresden&#x27;s manufacturing might was concentrated&quot;.

In his biography of Attlee and Churchill, Leo McKinstry wrote: &quot;When Churchill arrived at Yalta on 4 February 1945, the first question that Stalin put to him was: &#x27;Why haven&#x27;t you bombed Dresden?&#x27; His enquiry reflected the importance that the Soviet Union attached to an attack on the city, following intelligence reports that Germany was moving large numbers of troops towards the Breslau Front. Churchill assured Stalin that an Allied attack was imminent.&quot;

==The attacks==
===Night of 13/14 February===
The Dresden attack was to have begun with a USAAF Eighth Air Force bombing raid on 13 February 1945. The Eighth Air Force had already bombed the railway yards near the centre of the city twice in daytime raids: once on 7 October 1944 with 70 tons of high-explosive bombs killing more than 400, then again with 133 bombers on 16 January 1945, dropping 279 tons of high-explosives and 41 tons of incendiaries.

On 13 February 1945, bad weather over Europe prevented any USAAF operations, and it was left to RAF Bomber Command to carry out the first raid. It had been decided that the raid would be a double strike, in which a second wave of bombers would attack three hours after the first, just as the rescue teams were trying to put out the fires. As was standard practice, other raids were carried out that night to confuse German air defences. Three hundred and sixty heavy bombers (Lancasters and Halifaxes) bombed a synthetic oil plant in Böhlen, from Dresden, while 71 de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers attacked Magdeburg with small numbers of Mosquitos carrying out nuisance raids on Bonn, Misburg near Hanover and Nuremberg.

When Polish crews of the designated squadrons were preparing for the mission, the terms of the Yalta agreement were made known to them. There was a huge uproar, since the Yalta agreement handed parts of Poland over to the Soviet Union. There was talk of mutiny among the Polish pilots, and their British officers removed their side arms. The Polish Government ordered the pilots to follow their orders and fly their missions over Dresden, which they did.

The first of the British aircraft took off at around 17:20 hours CET for the journey. This was a group of Lancasters from Bomber Command&#x27;s 83 Squadron, No. 5 Group, acting as the Pathfinders, or flare force, whose job it was to find Dresden and drop magnesium parachute flares, known to the Germans as &quot;Christmas trees&quot;, to mark and light up Dresden for the aircraft that would mark the target itself. The next set of aircraft to leave England were twin-engined Mosquito marker planes, which would identify target areas and drop target indicators (TIs) that marked the target for the bombers to aim at. The attack was to centre on the Ostragehege sports stadium, next to the city&#x27;s medieval &quot;Altstadt&quot; (old town), with its congested and highly combustible timbered buildings.

The main bomber force, called &quot;Plate Rack&quot;, took off shortly after the Pathfinders. This group of 254 Lancasters carried 500 tons of high explosives and 375 tons of incendiaries (&quot;fire bombs&quot;). There were 200,000 incendiaries in all, with the high-explosive bombs ranging in weight from —the two-ton &quot;cookies&quot;, also known as &quot;blockbusters&quot;, because they could destroy an entire large building or street. The high explosives were intended to rupture water mains and blow off roofs, doors, and windows to expose the interiors of the buildings and create an air flow to feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that followed.

The Lancasters crossed into France near the Somme, then into Germany just north of Cologne. At 22:00 hours, the force heading for Böhlen split away from Plate Rack, which turned south-east toward the Elbe. By this time, ten of the Lancasters were out of service, leaving 244 to continue to Dresden.

The sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). The &#x27;Master Bomber&#x27; Wing Commander Maurice Smith, flying in a Mosquito, gave the order to the Lancasters: &quot;Controller to Plate Rack Force: Come in and bomb glow of red target indicators as planned. Bomb the glow of red TIs as planned&quot;.

The first bombs were released at 22:13, the last at 22:28, the Lancasters delivering 881.1 tons of bombs, 57% high explosive, 43% incendiaries. The fan-shaped area that was bombed was long, and at its extreme about wide. The shape and total devastation of the area was created by the bombers of No. 5 Group flying over the head of the fan (Ostragehege stadium) on prearranged compass bearings and releasing their bombs at different prearranged times.

The second attack, three hours later, was by Lancaster aircraft of 1, 3, 6 and 8 Groups, 8 Group being the Pathfinders. By now, the thousands of fires from the burning city could be seen more than away on the groundthe second wave had been able to see the initial fires from a distance of over . The Pathfinders therefore decided to expand the target, dropping flares on either side of the firestorm, including the , the main train station, and the , a large park, both of which had escaped damage during the first raid. The German sirens sounded again at 01:05, but these were small hand-held sirens that were heard within only a block. Between 01:21 and 01:45, 529 Lancasters dropped more than 1,800 tons of bombs.

===14–15 February===
On the morning of 14 February 431 United States Army Air Force bombers of the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s 1st Bombardment Division were scheduled to bomb Dresden near midday, and the 457 aircraft of 3rd Bombardment Division were to follow to bomb Chemnitz, while the 375 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Division would bomb a synthetic oil plant in Magdeburg. Another 84 bombers would attack Wesel. The bomber groups were protected by 784 North American P-51 Mustangs of the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s VIII Fighter Command, 316 of which covered the Dresden attack – a total of almost 2,100 Eighth Army Air Force aircraft over Saxony during 14 February. The smoke plume over Dresden by now reached and was plainly visible to the approaching raid.

Primary sources disagree as to whether the aiming point was the marshalling yards near the centre of the city or the centre of the built-up urban area. The report by the 1st Bombardment Division&#x27;s commander to his commander states that the targeting sequence was the centre of the built-up area in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40 per cent incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city-busting mix than the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40 per cent mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10 per cent incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.
316 B-17 Flying Fortresses bombed Dresden, dropping 771 tons of bombs. The remaining 115 bombers from the stream of 431 misidentified their targets. Sixty bombed Prague, dropping 153 tons of bombs, while others bombed Brüx and Pilsen. The 379th bombardment group started to bomb Dresden at 12:17, aiming at marshalling yards in the Friedrichstadt district west of the city centre, as the area was not obscured by smoke and cloud. The 303rd group arrived over Dresden two minutes after the 379th and found their view obscured by clouds, so they bombed Dresden using H2X radar. The groups that followed the 303rd (92nd, 306th, 379th, 384th and 457th) also found Dresden obscured by clouds, and they too used H2X. H2X aiming caused the groups to bomb with a wide dispersal over the Dresden area. The last group to attack Dresden was the 306th, and they finished by 12:30.

No evidence of strafing of civilians has ever been found, although a March 1945 article in the Nazi-run weekly newspaper &quot;Das Reich&quot; claimed this had occurred. Historian Götz Bergander, an eyewitness to the raids, found no reports on strafing for 13–15 February by any pilots or the German military and police. He asserted in &quot;Dresden im Luftkrieg&quot; (1977) that only a few tales of civilians being strafed were reliable in detail, and all were related to the daylight attack on 14 February. He concluded that some memory of eyewitnesses was real, but that it had misinterpreted the firing in a dogfight as deliberately aimed at people on the ground. In 2000, historian Helmut Schnatz found an explicit order to RAF pilots not to strafe civilians on the way back from Dresden. He also reconstructed timelines with the result that strafing would have been almost impossible due to lack of time and fuel. Frederick Taylor in &quot;Dresden&quot; (2004), basing most of his analysis on the work of Bergander and Schnatz, concludes that no strafing took place, although some stray bullets from aerial dogfights may have hit the ground and been mistaken for strafing by those in the vicinity. The official historical commission collected 103 detailed eyewitness accounts and let the local bomb disposal services search according to their assertions. They found no bullets or fragments that would have been used by planes of the Dresden raids.

On 15 February, the 1st Bombardment Division&#x27;s primary target—the Böhlen synthetic oil plant near Leipzig—was obscured by clouds, so its groups diverted to their secondary target, Dresden. Dresden was also obscured by clouds, so the groups targeted the city using H2X. The first group to arrive over the target was the 401st, but it missed the city centre and bombed Dresden&#x27;s southeastern suburbs, with bombs also landing on the nearby towns of Meissen and Pirna. The other groups all bombed Dresden between 12:00 and 12:10. They failed to hit the marshalling yards in the Friedrichstadt district and, as in the previous raid, their ordnance was scattered over a wide area. Railroad operations at Dresden resumed within three days.

===German defensive action===
Dresden&#x27;s air defences had been depleted as anti-aircraft guns were requistioned for use against the Red Army in the east, and the city lost its last massive flak battery in January 1945. The Luftwaffe was largely ineffective, with planes that were unsafe to fly due to lack of parts and maintenance and a critical shortage of aviation fuel; the German radar system was also degraded, lowering the warning time to prepare for air attacks. The RAF also had an advantage over the Germans in the field of electronic radar countermeasures.

Of 796 British bombers that participated in the raid, six were lost, three of those hit by bombs dropped by aircraft flying over them. On the following day, only a single US bomber was shot down, as the large escort force was able to prevent Luftwaffe day fighters from disrupting the attack.

===On the ground===

The sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Frederick Taylor writes that the Germans could see that a large enemy bomber formation—or what they called &quot;&quot; (lit: a fat dog, a &quot;major thing&quot;)—was approaching somewhere in the east. At 21:39 the Reich Air Defence Leadership issued an enemy aircraft warning for Dresden, although at that point it was thought Leipzig might be the target. At 21:59 the Local Air Raid Leadership confirmed that the bombers were in the area of Dresden-Pirna. Taylor writes the city was largely undefended; a night fighter force of ten Messerschmitt Bf 110Gs at Klotzsche airfield was scrambled, but it took them half an hour to get into an attack position. At 22:03 the Local Air Raid Leadership issued the first definitive warning: &quot;Warning! Warning! Warning! The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area&quot;. Some 10,000 fled to the great open space of the Grosse Garten, the magnificent royal park of Dresden, nearly in all. Here they were caught by the second raid, which started without an air-raid warning, at 1:22 a.m. At 11:30 a.m., the third wave of bombers, the two hundred and eleven American Flying Fortresses, began their attack.


There were few public air raid shelters. The largest, beneath the main railway station, housed 6,000 refugees. As a result, most people took shelter in cellars, but one of the air raid precautions the city had taken was to remove thick cellar walls between rows of buildings and replace them with thin partitions that could be knocked through in an emergency. The idea was that, as one building collapsed or filled with smoke, those sheltering in the basements could knock walls down and move into adjoining buildings. With the city on fire everywhere, those fleeing from one burning cellar simply ran into another, with the result that thousands of bodies were found piled up in houses at the ends of city blocks.
A Dresden police report written shortly after the attacks reported that the old town and the inner eastern suburbs had been engulfed in a single fire that had destroyed almost 12,000 dwellings. The same report said that the raids had destroyed the Wehrmacht&#x27;s main command post in the Taschenbergpalais, 63 administration buildings, the railways, 19 military hospitals, 19 ships and barges, and a number of less significant military facilities. The destruction also encompassed 640 shops, 64 warehouses, 39 schools, 31 stores, 31 large hotels, 26 public houses/bars, 26 insurance buildings, 24 banks, 19 postal facilities, 19 hospitals and private clinics including auxiliary, overflow hospitals, 18 cinemas, 11 churches and 6 chapels, 5 consulates, 4 tram facilities, 3 theatres, 2 market halls, the zoo, the waterworks, and 5 other cultural buildings. Almost 200 factories were damaged, 136 seriously (including several of the Zeiss Ikon precision optical engineering works), 28 with medium to serious damage, and 35 with light damage.

An RAF assessment showed that 23 per cent of the industrial buildings and 56 per cent of the non-industrial buildings, not counting residential buildings, had been seriously damaged. Around 78,000 dwellings had been completely destroyed; 27,700 were uninhabitable, and 64,500 damaged but readily repairable.

During his post-war interrogation, Albert Speer, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production, said that Dresden&#x27;s industrial recovery from the bombings was rapid.

===Fatalities===

According to the official German report (Order of the Day) no. 47 (&quot;TB47&quot;) issued on 22 March, the number of dead recovered by that date was 20,204, including 6,865 who were cremated on the &quot;Altmarkt&quot; square, and they expected the total number of deaths to be about 25,000. Another report on 3 April put the number of corpses recovered at 22,096. Three municipal and 17 rural cemeteries outside Dresden recorded up to 30 April 1945 a total of at least 21,895 buried bodies from the Dresden raids, including those cremated on the &quot;Altmarkt&quot;.

Between 100,000 and 200,000 refugees fleeing westward from advancing Soviet forces were in the city at the time of the bombing. Exact figures are unknown, but reliable estimates were calculated based on train arrivals, foot traffic, and the extent to which emergency accommodation had to be organised. The city authorities did not distinguish between residents and refugees when establishing casualty numbers and &quot;took great pains to count all the dead, identified and unidentified&quot;. This was largely achievable because most of the dead succumbed to suffocation; in only four places were recovered remains so badly burned that it was impossible to ascertain the number of victims. The uncertainty this introduced is thought to amount to no more than 100 people. 35,000 people were registered with the authorities as missing after the raids, around 10,000 were later found alive.

A further 1,858 bodies were discovered during the reconstruction of Dresden between the end of the war and 1966. Since 1989, despite extensive excavation for new buildings, no new war-related bodies have been found. Seeking to establish a definitive casualty figure, in part to address propagandisation of the bombing by far-right groups, the Dresden city council in 2005 authorised an independent Historians&#x27; Commission (&quot;Historikerkommission&quot;) to conduct a new, thorough investigation, collecting and evaluating available sources. The results were published in 2010 and stated that between 22,700 and 25,000 people had been killed.

==Wartime political responses==
===German===
Development of a German political response to the raid took several turns. Initially, some of the leadership, especially Robert Ley and Joseph Goebbels, wanted to use the raid as a pretext for abandonment of the Geneva Conventions on the Western Front. In the end, the only political action the German government took was to exploit the bombing for propaganda purposes. Goebbels is reported to have wept with rage for twenty minutes after he heard the news of the catastrophe, before launching into a bitter attack on Hermann Göring, the commander of the Luftwaffe: &quot;If I had the power I would drag this cowardly good-for-nothing, this Reich marshal, before a court. ... How much guilt does this parasite not bear for all this, which we owe to his indolence and love of his own comforts...&quot;. On 16 February, the Propaganda Ministry issued a press release that claimed that Dresden had no war industries; it was a city of culture. On 25 February, a new leaflet with photographs of two burned children was released under the title &quot;Dresden—Massacre of Refugees&quot;, stating that 200,000 had died. Since no official estimate had been developed, the numbers were speculative, but newspapers such as the Stockholm &quot;Svenska Morgonbladet&quot; used phrases such as &quot;privately from Berlin&quot;, to explain where they had obtained the figures. Frederick Taylor states that &quot;there is good reason to believe that later in March copies of—or extracts from—[an official police report] were leaked to the neutral press by Goebbels&#x27;s Propaganda Ministry ... doctored with an extra zero to increase [the total dead from the raid] to 202,040&quot;. On 4 March, &quot;Das Reich&quot;, a weekly newspaper founded by Goebbels, published a lengthy article emphasising the suffering and destruction of a cultural icon, without mentioning damage to the German war effort.

Taylor writes that this propaganda was effective, as it not only influenced attitudes in neutral countries at the time, but also reached the House of Commons, when Richard Stokes, a Labour Member of Parliament, and a long term opponent of area-bombing, quoted information from the German Press Agency (controlled by the Propaganda Ministry). It was Stokes&#x27;s questions in the House of Commons that were in large part responsible for the shift in British opinion against this type of raid. Taylor suggests that, although the destruction of Dresden would have affected people&#x27;s support for the Allies regardless of German propaganda, at least some of the outrage did depend on Goebbels&#x27; falsification of the casualty figures.

===British===

The destruction of the city provoked unease in intellectual circles in Britain. According to Max Hastings, by February 1945, attacks upon German cities had become largely irrelevant to the outcome of the war and the name of Dresden resonated with cultured people all over Europe—&quot;the home of so much charm and beauty, a refuge for Trollope&#x27;s heroines, a landmark of the Grand Tour.&quot; He writes that the bombing was the first time the public in Allied countries seriously questioned the military actions used to defeat the Germans.

The unease was made worse by an Associated Press story that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. At a press briefing held by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force two days after the raids, British Air Commodore Colin McKay Grierson told journalists:
One of the journalists asked whether the principal aim of bombing Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies. Grierson answered that the primary aim was to attack communications to prevent the Germans from moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroy &quot;what is left of German morale&quot;. Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, subsequently filed a story claiming that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a longtime opponent of strategic bombing, Richard Stokes MP, asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March.

Churchill subsequently re-evaluated the goals of the bombing campaigns, to focus less on strategic targets, and more toward targets of tactical significance. On 28 March, in a memo sent by telegram to General Ismay for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, he wrote:


Having been given a paraphrased version of Churchill&#x27;s memo by Bottomley, on 29 March, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris wrote to the Air Ministry:

The phrase &quot;worth the bones of one British grenadier&quot; echoed Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s: &quot;The whole of the Balkans is not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier&quot;. Under pressure from the Chiefs of Staff and in response to the views expressed by Portal and Harris among others, Churchill withdrew his memo and issued a new one. This was completed on 1 April 1945:

===American===
John Kenneth Galbraith was among those in the Roosevelt administration who had qualms about the bombing. As one of the directors of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, formed late in the war by the American Office of Strategic Services to assess the results of the aerial bombardments of Nazi Germany, he wrote: &quot;The incredible cruelty of the attack on Dresden when the war had already been won—and the death of children, women, and civilians—that was extremely weighty and of no avail&quot;. The Survey&#x27;s majority view on the Allies&#x27; bombing of German cities, however, concluded:
==Timeline==
==Reconstruction and reconciliation==


After the war, and again after German reunification, great efforts were made to rebuild some of Dresden&#x27;s former landmarks, such as the Frauenkirche, the Semperoper (the Saxony state opera house) and the Zwinger Palace (the latter two were rebuilt before reunification).

In 1956, Dresden entered a twin-town relationship with Coventry. As a centre of military and munitions production, Coventry suffered some of the worst attacks on any British city at the hands of the Luftwaffe during the Coventry Blitzes of 1940 and 1941, which killed over 1,200 civilians and destroyed its cathedral.

In 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a group of prominent Dresdeners formed an international appeal known as the &quot;Call from Dresden&quot; to request help in rebuilding the Lutheran Frauenkirche, the destruction of which had over the years become a symbol of the bombing. The baroque Church of Our Lady (completed in 1743) had initially appeared to survive the raids, but collapsed a few days later, and the ruins were left in place by later Communist governments as an anti-war memorial.

A British charity, the Dresden Trust, was formed in 1993 to raise funds in response to the call for help, raising £600,000 from 2,000 people and 100 companies and trusts in Britain. One of the gifts they made to the project was an eight-metre high orb and cross made in London by goldsmiths Gant MacDonald, using medieval nails recovered from the ruins of the roof of Coventry Cathedral, and crafted in part by Alan Smith, the son of a pilot who took part in the raid.

The new Frauenkirche was reconstructed over seven years by architects using 3D computer technology to analyse old photographs and every piece of rubble that had been kept and was formally consecrated on 30 October 2005, in a service attended by some 1,800 guests, including Germany&#x27;s president, Horst Köhler, previous chancellors Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel, and the Duke of Kent.

A further development towards the reconstruction of Dresden&#x27;s historical core came in 1999 when the Dresden Historical Neumarkt Society (GHND) was founded. The society is committed to reconstructing the historic city centre as much as possible. When plans for the rebuilding of Dresden&#x27;s Frauenkirche became certain, the GHND began calls for the reconstruction of historic buildings that surrounded it.

In 2003, a petition in support of reconstructing the Neumarkt area was signed by nearly 68,000 people, amounting to 15% of the entire electorate. This demonstrated broad support for the initiative and widespread appreciation for historical Dresden. This led to the city council&#x27;s decision to rebuild a large amount of baroque buildings in accordance to historical designs, but with modern buildings in between them.

Reconstruction of the surrounding Neumarkt buildings continues to this day.

==Post-war debate==

The bombing of Dresden remains controversial and is subject to an ongoing debate by historians and scholars regarding the moral and military justifications surrounding the event. British historian Frederick Taylor wrote of the attacks: &quot;The destruction of Dresden has an epically tragic quality to it. It was a wonderfully beautiful city and a symbol of baroque humanism and all that was best in Germany. It also contained all of the worst from Germany during the Nazi period. In that sense it is an absolutely exemplary tragedy for the horrors of 20th century warfare and a symbol of destruction&quot;.

Several factors have made the bombing a unique point of contention and debate. First among these are the Nazi government&#x27;s exaggerated claims immediately afterwards. The fact that the attack was carried out in the final stages of the war, and the public perception that, unlike Hamburg, Dresden was not a major industrial centre and its contribution to the war effort was not so significant, fueled the flames of controversy.

===Legal considerations===

The Hague Conventions, addressing the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power. Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update enacted international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law does not mean that the laws of war did not cover aerial warfare, but the existing laws remained open to interpretation. Specifically, whether the attack can be considered a war crime depends on whether the city was defended and whether resistance was offered against an approaching enemy. Allied arguments centre around the existence of a local air defence system and additional ground defences the Germans were constructing in anticipation of Soviet advances.

===Falsification of evidence===
Holocaust deniers and pro-Nazi polemicists—most notably by British writer David Irving—use the bombing in an attempt to establish a moral equivalence between the war crimes committed by the Nazi government and the killing of German civilians by Allied bombing raids. As such, grossly inflated casualty figures have been promulgated over the years, many based on a figure of over 200,000 deaths quoted in a forged version of the casualty report, &quot;Tagesbefehl&quot; No. 47, that originated with Hitler&#x27;s Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Irving himself grossly exaggerated the death toll in his book &quot;The Destruction of Dresden&quot;, arguing that the allied bombing killed 135,000 inhabitants; these figures were initially widely accepted, but are now considered to be wildly inflated.

====Marshall inquiry====
An inquiry conducted at the behest of U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, stated the raid was justified by the available intelligence. The inquiry declared the elimination of the German ability to reinforce a counter-attack against Marshal Ivan Konev&#x27;s extended line or, alternatively, to retreat and regroup using Dresden as a base of operations, were important military objectives. As Dresden had been largely untouched during the war due to its location, it was one of the few remaining functional rail and communications centres. A secondary objective was to disrupt the industrial use of Dresden for munitions manufacture, which American intelligence believed was the case. The shock to military planners and to the Allied civilian populations of the German counterattack known as the Battle of the Bulge had ended speculation that the war was almost over, and may have contributed to the decision to continue with the aerial bombardment of German cities.

The inquiry concluded that by the presence of active German military units nearby, and the presence of fighters and anti-aircraft within an effective range, Dresden qualified as &quot;defended&quot;. By this stage in the war both the British and the Germans had integrated air defences at the national level; the tribunal argued that this meant no German city was undefended.

Marshall&#x27;s tribunal declared that no extraordinary decision was made to single out Dresden (for instance, to take advantage of a large number of refugees, or purposely terrorise the German populace), arguing that the area bombing was intended to disrupt communications and destroy industrial production. The American inquiry established that the Soviets, under allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested area bombing of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point following a German strategic retreat.

====U.S. Air Force Historical Division report====
A report by the U.S. Air Force Historical Division (USAFHD) analysed the circumstances of the raid and concluded that it was militarily necessary and justified, based on the following points:
# The raid had legitimate military ends, brought about by exigent military circumstances.
# Military units and anti-aircraft defences were sufficiently close that it was not valid to consider the city &quot;undefended&quot;.
# The raid did not use extraordinary means but was comparable to other raids used against comparable targets.
# The raid was carried out through the normal chain of command, pursuant to directives and agreements then in force.
# The raid achieved the military objective, without excessive loss of civilian life.

The first point regarding the legitimacy of the raid depends on two claims: first, that the railyards subjected to American precision bombing were an important logistical target, and that the city was also an important industrial centre. Even after the main firebombing, there were two further raids on the Dresden railway yards by the USAAF. The first was on 2 March 1945, by 406 B-17s, which dropped 940 tons of high-explosive bombs and 141 tons of incendiaries. The second was on 17 April, when 580 B-17s dropped 1,554 tons of high-explosive bombs and 165 tons of incendiaries.

As far as Dresden being a militarily significant industrial centre, an official 1942 guide described the German city as &quot;...one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich,&quot; and in 1944, the German Army High Command&#x27;s Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that supplied materiel to the military. Dresden was the seventh largest German city, and by far the largest un-bombed built-up area left, and thus was contributing to the defence of Germany itself.

According to the USAFHD, there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden at the time of the raid. These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.), aircraft components, anti-aircraft guns, field guns, and small arms, poison gas, gears and differentials, electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric gauges, gas masks, Junkers aircraft engines, and Messerschmitt fighter cockpit parts.

The second of the five points addresses the prohibition in the Hague Conventions, of &quot;attack or bombardment&quot; of &quot;undefended&quot; towns. The USAFHD report states that Dresden was protected by anti-aircraft defences, antiaircraft guns, and searchlights, under the Combined Dresden (Corps Area IV) and Berlin (Corps Area III) Air Service Commands.

The third and fourth points say that the size of the Dresden raid—in terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery—were commensurate with the military objective and similar to other Allied bombings. On 23 February 1945, the Allies bombed Pforzheim and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities. The most devastating raid on any city was on Tokyo on 9–10 March (the &quot;Meetinghouse&quot; raid) which caused over 100,000 casualties, many civilian. The tonnage and types of bombs listed in the service records of the Dresden raid were comparable to (or less than) throw weights of bombs dropped in other air attacks carried out in 1945. In the case of Dresden, as in many other similar attacks, the hour break in between the RAF raids was a deliberate ploy to attack the fire fighters, medical teams, and military units.

In late July 1943, the city of Hamburg was bombed during Operation Gomorrah by combined RAF and USAAF strategic bomber forces. Four major raids were carried out in the span of 10 days, of which the most notable, on the night of 27–28 July, created a devastating firestorm effect similar to Dresden&#x27;s, killing an estimated 18,474 people. The death toll for that night is included in the overall estimated total of 37,000 for the series of raids. Two-thirds of the remaining population reportedly fled the city after the raids.

The fifth point is that the firebombing achieved the intended effect of disabling the industry in Dresden. It was estimated that at least 23 per cent of the city&#x27;s industrial buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The damage to other infrastructure and communications was immense, which would have severely limited the potential use of Dresden to stop the Soviet advance. The report concludes with: 
===Arguments against justification===
====Military reasons====
The journalist Alexander McKee cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not targeted during the raid. The &quot;hutted camps&quot; mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: &quot;The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped&quot;. McKee further asserts &quot;The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built-up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure.&quot;

According to historian Sönke Neitzel, &quot;it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front. The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in German industry at this stage in the war&quot;. Wing Commander H. R. Allen said, &quot;The final phase of Bomber Command&#x27;s operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence&quot;.

====As an immoral act, but not a war crime====
Frederick Taylor told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;I personally find the attack on Dresden horrific. It was overdone, it was excessive and is to be regretted enormously,&quot; but, &quot;A war crime is a very specific thing which international lawyers argue about all the time and I would not be prepared to commit myself nor do I see why I should. I&#x27;m a historian.&quot; Similarly, British philosopher A. C. Grayling has described RAF area bombardment as an &quot;immoral act&quot; and &quot;moral crime&quot; because &quot;destroying everything... contravenes every moral and humanitarian principle debated in connection with the just conduct of war&quot;, though Grayling insisted that it &quot;is not strictly correct to describe area bombing as a &#x27;war crime&#x27;.&quot;

====As a war crime====

According to Gregory Stanton, lawyer and president of Genocide Watch:
Historian Donald Bloxham states, &quot;The bombing of Dresden on 13–14 February 1945 was a war crime&quot;. He further argues there was a strong &quot;prima facie&quot; case for trying Winston Churchill among others and a theoretical case Churchill could have been found guilty. &quot;This should be a sobering thought. If, however it is also a startling one, this is probably less the result of widespread understanding of the nuance of international law and more because in the popular mind &#x27;war criminal&#x27;, like &#x27;paedophile&#x27; or &#x27;terrorist&#x27;, has developed into a moral rather than a legal categorisation&quot;.

German author Günter Grass is one of several intellectuals and commentators who have also called the bombing a war crime.

Proponents of this position argue that the devastation from firebombing was greater than anything that could be justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a &quot;prima facie&quot; case. The Allies were aware of the effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.

British historian Antony Beevor wrote that Dresden was considered relatively safe, having been spared previous RAF night attacks, and that at the time of the raids there were up to 300,000 refugees in the area seeking sanctuary from the advancing Red Army from the Eastern Front.

====As of concealed purpose====
A revisionist story, persisting into the 21st century, was that the bombing was done, at least in part, to give the Soviets a signal demonstration–a warning–of the destructive power of the Allied bomber forces (the Soviets were expected to occupy Dresden presently).

====Political response in Germany====

Far-right politicians in Germany have sparked a great deal of controversy by promoting the term &quot;&quot; (&quot;holocaust by bomb&quot;) to describe the raids. writes that, for decades, the Communist government of East Germany promoted the bombing as an example of &quot;Anglo-American terror&quot;, and now the same rhetoric is being used by the far right. An example can be found in the extremist nationalist party &quot;Die Heimat&quot;. A party&#x27;s representative, Jürgen Gansel, described the Dresden raids as &quot;mass murder&quot;, and &quot;Dresden&#x27;s holocaust of bombs&quot;. This provoked an outrage in the German parliament and triggered responses from the media. Prosecutors said that it was legal to call the bombing a holocaust. In 2010 groups opposing the far-right blocked a demonstration of far-right organisations.

Phrases like &quot;Bomber-Harris, do it again!&quot;, &quot;Bomber-Harris Superstar – Thanks from the red Antifa&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (&quot;German perpetrators are no victims!&quot;) are popular slogans among the so-called &quot;Anti-Germans&quot;—a small radical left-wing political movement in Germany and Austria. In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing, Anti-Germans praised the bombing on the grounds that so many of the city&#x27;s civilians had supported Nazism. Similar rallies take place every year.

==In literature and the arts==

===Kurt Vonnegut===
Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children&#x27;s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death&quot; (1969) used some elements from his experiences as a prisoner of war at Dresden during the bombing. The death toll of 135,000 given by Vonnegut was taken from &quot;The Destruction of Dresden&quot;, a 1963 book by Holocaust denier David Irving. In a 1965 letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Irving later adjusted his estimates even higher, &quot;almost certainly between 100,000 and 250,000&quot;, but these figures were inflated; Irving finally published a correction in &quot;The Times&quot; in a 1966 letter to the editor lowering it to 25,000, in line with subsequent scholarship. Despite Irving&#x27;s eventual much lower numbers, and later accusations of generally poor scholarship, the figure popularised by Vonnegut remains in general circulation.

In a 2006 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, Vonnegut is quoted recalling &quot;utter destruction&quot; and &quot;carnage unfathomable&quot;. The Germans put him and other POWs to work gathering bodies for mass burial. &quot;But there were too many corpses to bury. So instead the Nazis sent in troops with flamethrowers. All these civilians&#x27; remains were burned to ashes.&quot;

In the special introduction to the 1976 Franklin Library edition of the novel, he wrote:
The firebombing of Dresden was depicted in George Roy Hill&#x27;s 1972 movie adaptation of Vonnegut&#x27;s novel.

Vonnegut&#x27;s experiences in Dresden were also used in several of his other books and are included in his posthumously published writings in &quot;Armageddon in Retrospect&quot;. In one of those essays, Vonnegut paraphrased leaflets dropped by the Allies in the days after the bombings as saying: To the people of Dresden: We were forced to bomb your city because of the heavy military traffic your railroad facilities have been carrying. We realize that we haven&#x27;t always hit our objectives. Destruction of anything other than military objectives was unintentional, unavoidable fortunes of war. Vonnegut notes that many of those railroad facilities were not actually bombed, and those that were hit were restored to operation within several days.

Freeman Dyson, a British-American physicist who had worked as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 to the end of the war, wrote in later years (1979):

In 1995, Vonnegut recalled having discussed the bombing with Dyson, and quotes Dyson as attributing the decision to bomb Dresden to &quot;bureaucratic momentum&quot;.

<text>Professor John I.Q. Nerdelbaum Frink Jr. is a recurring character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is voiced by Hank Azaria, and first appeared in the 1991 episode &quot;Old Money&quot;. Frink is Springfield&#x27;s nerdy scientist and professor and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat mad and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his trademark.

Frink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in &quot;Old Money&quot;, since he was trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria ad-libbed a voice for the character, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis&#x27;s Julius Kelp character from &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personalityhe became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink&#x27;s father in the 2003 episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIV&quot;.

The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers&#x27; listings of their favorite supporting characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood. The character&#x27;s popularity has led to him giving the name to the computer programming language Frink.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
John Frink is generally depicted as Springfield&#x27;s stereotypical nerdy, mad, and socially inept scientist, inventor, and mathematician. He wears thick glasses, a white lab coat (which was green in earlier seasons), a blue bow-tie atop a white buttoned-up shirt, and pink pants, and has buckteeth and center-parted hair. Frink is a college professor at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology and runs his own astronomical observatory. He has an IQ of 197it was 199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield&#x27;s brief intellectual juntaand is a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa. Frink is generally very polite and friendly. He has a trademark mannerism of using Jerry Lewis-style gibberish when excited, such as &quot;HOYVIN-GLAVIN!&quot; and &quot;FLAVIN&quot; and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to &quot;carry the one&quot; in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and use or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. &quot;Father and I got along like positrons and antineutrinos!&quot; or &quot;microcalifragilistics&quot;.

Frink often tries to use his mad and bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually do not work or only make things worse. Most of his inventions never function properly or are of no real use. He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a drilling machine that can cut through anything. Some of Frink&#x27;s unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), the &quot;Gamble-Tron 2000&quot;, a machine designed to predict pro football scores (after it predicts one team will win by 200 points, Frink physically attacks it on live television), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash to the ground and catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured &quot;Frink&#x27;s Disease&quot; and discovered the element &quot;Frinkonium&quot;. He has also mastered astrology to the point where he can use it to accurately predict the future, and has been shown to be capable of time travel.

The professor has a son who is seen in &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; during a convention for infant and toddler products as a pilot of a remote-controlled plane (he flies out the window of the building while in the plane and crashes), and in &quot;I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot&quot; at a robot battle (operating the robot). On the show, Frink has made mention of a wife, but there have also been jokes about him having had little contact with women in his life.

Frink often appears in the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; Halloween episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which are not accepted as canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Frink&#x27;s bizarre inventions and understanding of advanced physics usually fit well into these supernatural plotlines. In &quot;Treehouse of Horror VIII&quot;, Bart enters Frink&#x27;s matter teleporter and – echoing the film &quot;The Fly&quot; – it results in an accidental mix between Bart&#x27;s genes and the genes of a housefly that was also present in the transporter at the same time. In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIV&quot;, it is revealed that Frink had a father who was killed by a shark, whom he brings back to life in the episode by piecing together his body parts. Unfortunately, the man decides to steal body parts to improve himself after he is revived. In the latter episode, Frink is awarded a Nobel Prize.

==Character==

Frink first appeared in the season two episode &quot;Old Money&quot; that aired on . In that episode, Grampa Simpson inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that &quot;it is just a prototype. With proper funding I&#x27;m confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!&quot; Grampa responds with &quot;But I want to help people, not kill &#x27;em!&quot;, to which Frink replies &quot;Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she&#x27;s hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one.&quot;

In the original script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis&#x27;s character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that &quot;He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time.&quot; Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him look even more like Lewis&#x27;s character. Writer Jay Kogen named the character after his friend and fellow television writer John Frink, who was later hired on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Frink&#x27;s nonsensical utterances are written in the scripts as &quot;Frink noise&quot;.

Azaria has voiced Frink ever since the first appearance of the professor. Of the many characters that Azaria voices, Frink is his favorite because he was a fan of Lewis in his younger years and he enjoys imitating the voice of the Nutty Professor. He has said that &quot;once you start talking like [Julius Kelp] it&#x27;s very hard to stop. On each take, I&#x27;ll make it sillier, I always have. I&#x27;ll add more and more stupid noises and sounds to it. If they let me keep going, it gets ridiculous.&quot;

As a homage to Lewis, Azaria conceived the idea of the Treehouse of Horror XIV segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that it is hard to tell Frink and his father&#x27;s voices apart: &quot;Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking.&quot; In addition, &quot;The Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot;″s Terry Morrow commented that &quot;to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans live for.&quot;

==Reception==
Frink is a popular character on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; named him his favorite secondary character from the show. &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;″s Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, writing that &quot;Springfield&#x27;s mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny.&quot; On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters, IGN&#x27;s Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the &quot;Simpsons&quot; universe &quot;as the town&#x27;s brilliant mad scientist.&quot; They highlighted a scene from the episode &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot;, in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children&#x27;s toys to himself because the children &quot;wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it on as many levels&quot; as he did. Nick Griffiths of &quot;Radio Times&quot; named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has &quot;always loved Professor Frink&quot;, particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word &quot;the&quot;, and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of &quot;TV&#x27;s great tech figures&quot;, writing that apart from being smart, the professor is best known for his &quot;rather idiosyncratic speech patternshmmguyvin-whey-hey.&quot; Joe Rhodes of &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed the following as the professor&#x27;s most memorable line: &quot;Sorry I&#x27;m late. There was trouble at the lab with the running and the exploding and the crying when the monkeys stole the glasses off my head.&quot;

Several critics have commented on Frink&#x27;s inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN&#x27;s &quot;Tech &amp; Gadgets&quot; wrote that &quot;When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king&quot;, and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Although he added that it &quot;was not one of [Frink&#x27;s] most successful&quot;, since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink&#x27;s automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: &quot;Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink&#x27;s inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson&#x27;s head with that of a housefly?&quot; Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of &quot;Locus&quot; listed the scene in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; that features Frink&#x27;s drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.

==Merchandising and legacy==
Frink has appeared in various merchandise related to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, including issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, the simulator ride &quot;The Simpsons Ride&quot; at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, and video games such as &quot;The Simpsons Wrestling&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;. He has also been turned into a Halloween-inspired action figure that was packaged with Kids Meals at Burger King in October and . In addition, Frink was featured on the cover of the issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

The professor has also affected real-life science. Frink, a computer programming language, was named after him. It is, according to creator of the language, &quot;designed to make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out right, and to make a tool that&#x27;s really useful in the real world. It tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps you easily verify that your answers make sense.&quot;

<text>A boyar or bolyar was a member of the highest rank of the feudal nobility in many Eastern European states, including Bulgaria, Kievan Rus&#x27; (and later Russia), Moldavia and Wallachia (and later Romania), Lithuania and among Baltic Germans. Comparable to Dukes/Grand Dukes, Boyars were second only to the ruling princes, grand princes or tsars from the 10th to the 17th centuries.

==Etymology==
Also known as &quot;bolyar&quot;; variants in other languages include or ; , , ; , ; and .

The title Boila is predecessor or old form of the title Bolyar (the Bulgarian word for Boyar). Boila was a title worn by some of the Bulgar aristocrats (mostly of regional governors and noble warriors) in the First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018). The plural form of boila (&quot;noble&quot;), &quot;bolyare&quot; is attested in Bulgar inscriptions and rendered as &quot;boilades&quot; or &quot;boliades&quot; in the Greek of Byzantine documents.

Multiple different derivation theories of the word have been suggested by scholars and linguists, such as it having possible roots from old Turkic: &quot;bai&quot; (&quot;noble, rich&quot;; &quot;cf.&quot; &quot;&quot;) plus Turkic &quot;är&quot; (&quot;man, men&quot;), proto-Slavic &quot;boj&quot; (fight, battle) or from Romanian &quot;boi&quot; (oxen, cattle) to &quot;Boier&quot; (owner of cattle).

==Bolyars in Bulgaria==
The oldest Slavic form of &quot;boyar&quot;—&quot;bolyarin&quot;, pl. &quot;bolyari&quot; (, )—dates from the 10th century, and it is found in Bulgaria, also popular as old Bulgar title &quot;boila&quot;, which denoted a high aristocratic status among the Bulgars. It was probably built from Turkic &quot;bol&quot;- meaning &quot;many&quot; and &quot;yarin, yarki&quot;- meaning &quot;bright, enlightened&quot;. In support of this hypothesis is the 10th-century diplomatic protocol of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, where the Bulgarian nobles are called &quot;boliades&quot;, while the 9th-century Bulgar sources call them &quot;boila&quot;.

A member of the nobility during the First Bulgarian Empire was called a &quot;boila&quot;, while in the Second Bulgarian Empire, the corresponding title became &quot;bolyar&quot; or &quot;bolyarin&quot;. &quot;Bolyar&quot;, as well as its predecessor, &quot;boila&quot;, was a hereditary title. The Bulgarian bolyars were divided into &quot;veliki&quot; (&quot;great&quot;) and &quot;malki&quot; (&quot;minor&quot;).

Presently in Bulgaria, the word &quot;bolyari&quot; is used as a nickname for the inhabitants of Veliko Tarnovo—once the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

==Boyars in Serbia==
In medieval Serbia, the rank of the boyars () was equivalent to the rank of the baron; meaning &quot;free warrior&quot; (or &quot;free man&quot; in general), it was the first rank after the non-free peasants or serfs. The etymology of the term comes from the word &quot;battle&quot; (). The boyars of Serbia were literally &quot;men for the battle&quot; or the warrior class, in contrast to the peasants. They could own land but were obliged to defend it and fight for the king. With the rule of the Ottoman Empire after 1450, the Ottoman as well as the Austro-Hungarian terms exchanged the Serbian one. Today, it is an archaic term representing the aristocracy ().

==Boyars in Rus&#x27;==

From the 9th to 13th century, boyars wielded considerable power through their military support of the Rus&#x27;s princes. Power and prestige of many of them, however, soon came to depend almost completely on service to the state, family history of service and, to a lesser extent, land ownership. Boyars of Kievan Rus were visually very similar to knights, but after the Mongol invasion, their cultural links were mostly lost.

The boyars occupied the highest state offices and, through a council (duma), advised the grand duke. They received extensive grants of land and, as members of the Boyars&#x27; Duma, were the major legislators of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

After the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the boyars from western and southern parts of Kievan Rus&#x27; (modern Belarus and Ukraine) were incorporated into Lithuanian and Polish nobility (szlachta). In the 16th and 17th centuries, many of those Rus boyars who failed to get the status of a nobleman actively participated in the formation of the Cossack army.

Boyars in Novgorod and Pskov formed a sort of republic, where the power of princes (knyaz) was strongly limited until the conquest by Moscow. Boyars kept their influence in the Russian principalities of Vladimir, Tver and Moscow. Only after the centralization of power by Moscow was the power of the boyars diminished.

===Tsardom of Russia===

During the 14th and 15th centuries, the boyars of Moscow had considerable influence that continued from the Muscovy period. However, starting with the reign of Ivan III, the boyars were starting to lose that influence to the authoritative tsars in Muscovy. Because of Ivan III&#x27;s expansionist policies, administrative changes were needed in order to ease the burden of governing Muscovy. Small principalities knew their loyal subjects by name, but after the consolidation of territories under Ivan, familial loyalty and friendship with the boyar&#x27;s subjects turned those same subjects into administrative lists. The face of provincial rule disappeared.

Boyar membership, until the 16th century, did not necessarily require one to be Russian, or even Orthodox, as historians note that many boyars came from places like Lithuania or the Nogais, and some remained Muslims for a generation after the Mongols were ousted. What is interesting about the boyars is their implied duties. Because boyars were not constitutionally instituted, much of their powers and duties came from agreements signed between princes. Agreements, such as one between Ivan III and Mikhail Borisovich in 1484 showed how allegiances needed to be earned and secured, rather than implied and enforced.

Instead of the grand prince personally overseeing his lands, he had to rely on his captains and close advisors to oversee day-to-day operations. Instead of the great voice the boyars had previously in their advisory roles, they now had less bargaining power and mobility. They answered questions posed by the grand prince, and Ivan III even made sure to get their approval on special events, such as his marriage to Zoe Paleologa, or the attack on Novgorod. This was to ensure the boyars and their military power remained loyal to the tsar.

The grand duke also made sure that peasants could not leave the princes&#x27; lands, or from one place to another, in the mid-1400s, effectively establishing serfdom. The boyars gained rewards and gifts as well. Some boyars were sent to regions as governors, and could “feed off” the locals in this way. Still, by the end of the 15th century, boyar membership had declined, and merit rather than family background decided who became a boyar. When Ivan IV became the tsar, more radical changes were implemented to limit boyar influence.

Ivan IV became the grand prince of all Muscovy in 1533 at the age of three, but various boyar factions tried to compete for control of the regency. When Ivan IV came to power in 1547, much more of the boyars&#x27; independent political power became obsolete. The independence and autonomy experienced by the princes of the regions in Muscovy was abolished under Ivan IV by the end of the sixteenth century, making them &quot;the prince&#x27;s sons&quot;, or just simple boyars serving the Grand Prince. Ivan IV divided Muscovy into two parts in 1565, and in the private part, the terror began.

The boyars attempted to band together and resist, but instead of constitutionally establishing their role in government, Ivan IV ruthlessly crushed the boyar opposition with the use of the oprichnina terror purges. Land grants were also given to subjects that provided military service, and soon this type of land grant became the more common compared to inherited land among the boyars. Ivan IV consolidated his power, centralized royal power, and made every effort possible to curb the influence of the princes.

After Ivan IV, a time of troubles began when his son Fedor died without an heir, ending the Rurik dynasty. The boyar Boris Godunov tried to proclaim himself tsar, but several boyar factions refused to recognize him. The chaos continued after the first False Dmitriy gained the throne, and civil war erupted. When the Romanovs took over, the seventeenth century became one filled with administrative reform. A comprehensive legal code was introduced, and a merging of the boyars into the elite bureaucracy was beginning to form.

By the end of the Time of Troubles, the boyars had lost nearly all independent power. Instead of going to Moscow to gain more power, the boyars felt defeated, and felt compelled to go to Moscow to maintain a united and strong Russia. Second, the boyars lost their independent principalities, where they maintained all their power, and instead governed districts and regions under the grand prince of the time. Boyars also lost their advisory influence over the grand prince with tools such as the duma, and instead the grand prince no longer felt compelled to listen to the demands of the boyars. The tsar no longer feared losing their military support, and unification of Muscovy became paramount in importance. With Peter the Great, the final nail in the coffin happened for the boyars&#x27; power, and they would never recover from his administrative reforms.

Peter the Great, who took power in 1697, took it upon himself to westernize Russia, and catch it up with the modern world. After the revolt of the streltsy regiments in 1698, Peter the Great returned to Russia, forcing government officials and those that were financially able to have clean shaven faces and wear Western clothing. Peter also reformed the judicial system, and created a senate with members appointed by him, replacing the old council of boyars that originally advised the tsar. This move he made was one of many that dismantled the powers and status the boyars previously possessed.

Peter was driving out the conservative and religious faction of the boyars out of the courts, and instead using both foreign and Russian officials to fill the administrative system. Several boyars, as well as other nobility, spoke out against these reforms, including historian Mikhail Shcherbatov, who stated that the reforms Peter made helped destroy Russian tradition, and created people that tried to &quot;worm their way up, by flattering and humoring the monarch and the grandees in every way.&quot; Still, the reforms continued, as by this point, the tsar possessed too much power, and Russia became an absolute monarchy more and more with each ruler.

===Galicia===
The Galician nobility originally were called boyars. With the annexation of Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as the result of the Galicia-Volhynia wars, local boyars were equated since 1430 in rights along with Polish nobility (szlachta). A great number of boyars fled to the lands of Great Duchy of Lithuania in Volhynia and Podolia.

==Boyars in Moldavia and Wallachia==
In the Carpathian regions inhabited by present day Romanians, the boyar () class emerged from the chiefs (named (&quot;leader&quot;) or (&quot;judge&quot;) in the areas north of the Danube, and south of the river) of rural communities in the early Middle Ages, who made their judicial and administrative attributions hereditary and gradually expanded them upon other communities. They were &quot;approved&quot; by the Ottoman Empire, which had suzerainty over the area. After the appearance of more advanced political structures in the area, their privileged status had to be confirmed by the central power, which used this prerogative to include in the boyar class individuals that distinguished themselves in the military or civilian functions they performed, by allocating them lands from the princely domains.

Historian Djuvara explained the hypotheses concerning the origin of the Romanians, such as advancing the theory that the vast majority of the nobility in the medieval states that made up the territory of modern-day Romania was of Cuman origin and not Romanian: &quot;Romanians were called the black Cumans&quot;.

=== The boyar condition ===
The Romanian social hierarchy was composed of boyar, (&quot;turkish: mazul&quot;), (&quot;yeoman, freedman&quot;) and (&quot;serf&quot;). Being a boyar implied three things: being a land-owner, having serfs, and having a military and/or administrative function. A boyar could have a state function and/or a court function. These functions were called or . Only the prince had the power to assign a boierie. Landowners with serfs but no function were categorized as but were still considered to be of noble origin (, literally &quot;of boyar bone&quot;). Small landowners who possessed a domain without distinction () were called , while the serfs (indentured servants) were called .

=== Origin ===
Although functions could only be accorded by the prince and were not hereditary, land possession was hereditary. The prince could give land to somebody but could not take it from its possessor except for serious reasons such as treason. Therefore, there were two kinds of boyars: those whose families, as chiefs of the ancient rural communities, had held land before the formation of the feudal states, such that the prince merely confirmed their preexisting status as landowners; and those who acquired their domain from a princely donation or who had inherited it from an ancestor who acquired it through such a donation (&quot;cf.&quot; the distinction between &quot;Uradel&quot; and &quot;Briefadel&quot; in the Holy Roman Empire and in its feudal successor regimes). During the Phanariot régime, there were also boyars who had no land at all, but only a function. This way, the number of boyars could be increased, by selling functions to those who could afford them.

=== Hierarchy ===
The close alliance between the boyar condition and the military-administrative functions led to a confusion, aggravated by the Phanariots: these functions began to be considered as noble titles, like in the Occident. In fact, this was not at all the case. Traditionally, the boyars were organized in three states: boyars of the first, second, and third states. For example, there was a first or a grand postelnic, a second postelnic, and a third postelnic, each one with his different obligations and rights.

The difference of condition was visible even in the vestimentation or physical aspect. Only the boyars of the first state had the right, for example, to grow a beard, the rest being entitled only to a mustache. Within the class of the boyars of the first state, there was the subclass of the &quot;grand boyars&quot;. Those were great landowners who also had some very high functions, such as the function of great vornic. Above those grand boyars was only the prince.

=== The prince ===
Usually a prince was a boyar before his election or appointment as prince, but this was not an absolute condition. Initially, only princely descendants could be elected princes. During the Phanariot epoch, however, any man could be a prince if appointed by the sultan, and rich enough to buy this appointment from the grand vizier. During the Ottoman suzerainty, and especially during the Phanariot régime, the title of Prince became an administrative function within the imperial Ottoman hierarchy, and thus the ultimate form of boyardness. The title of Prince of Wallachia or Moldavia was equivalent in dignity to that of a Pasha with two horse-tails.

Norwegian composer Johan Halvorsen wrote a march entitled &quot;Bojarenes inntogsmarsj&quot; (&quot;Entry March of the Boyars&quot;), known in Norway as the signal tune for the radio programme &quot;Ønskekonserten&quot;. Edvard Grieg arranged it for solo piano. August Strindberg requests that this piece be played during his play &quot;The Dance of Death, Part One&quot;.

<text>Geographically, the country of Iran is located in West Asia and the bodies of water the nation borders are the Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf (Persian Gulf), and Gulf of Oman. Topographically, it is predominantly located on the Iranian/Persian plateau, Its mountains have impacted both the political and the economic history of the country for several centuries. The mountains enclose several broad basins, on which major agricultural and urban settlements are located. Until the 20th century, when major highways and railroads were constructed through the mountains to connect the population centers, these basins tended to be relatively isolated from one another.

Typically, one major town has dominated each basin, and there were complex economic relationships between the town and the hundreds of villages that surrounded it. In the higher elevations of the mountains rimming the basins, tribally organized groups practiced transhumance, moving with their herds of sheep and goats between traditionally established summer and winter pastures. There are no major river systems in the country, and historically transportation was by means of caravans that followed routes traversing gaps and passes in the mountains. The mountains also impeded easy access to the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea.

With an area of , Iran ranks seventeenth in size among the countries of the world. Iran shares its northern borders with several post-Soviet states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. These borders extend for more than , including nearly of water along the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. Iran&#x27;s western borders are with Turkey in the north and Iraq in the south, terminating at the Arvand Rud.

The Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman littorals form the entire southern border. To the east lie Afghanistan on the north and Pakistan on the far south. Iran&#x27;s diagonal distance from Azerbaijan in the northwest to Sistan and Baluchestan province in the southeast is approximately .

==Topography==


The topography of Iran consists of rugged, mountainous rims surrounding high interior basins. The main mountain chain is the Zagros Mountains, a series of parallel ridges interspersed with plains that bisect the country from northwest to southeast. Many peaks in the Zagros exceed above sea level, and in the south-central region of the country there are at least five peaks that are over .

As the Zagros continue into southeastern Iran, the average elevation of the peaks declines dramatically to under . Rimming the Caspian Sea littoral is another chain of mountains, the narrow but high Alborz Mountains. Volcanic Mount Damavand, , located in the center of the Alborz, is not only the country&#x27;s highest peak but also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush.

The center of Iran consists of several closed basins that collectively are referred to as the Central Plateau. The average elevation of this plateau is about , but several of the mountains that tower over the plateau exceed . The eastern part of the plateau is covered by two salt deserts, the Dasht-e Kavir (Great Salt Desert) and the Dasht-e Lut. Except for some scattered oases, these deserts are uninhabited.

Parts of northwestern Iran are part of the Armenian highlands, which adjoins it topographically with other parts of neighbouring Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.

Iran has only two expanses of lowlands: the Khuzestan Plain in the southwest and the Caspian Sea coastal plain in the north. The former is a roughly triangular-shaped extension of the Mesopotamia plain and averages about in width. It extends for about inland, barely rising a few meters above sea level, then meets abruptly with the first foothills of the Zagros. Much of the Khuzestan plain is covered with marshes.

The Caspian plain is both longer and narrower. It extends for some along the Caspian shore, but its widest point is less than , while at some places less than separate the shore from the Alborz foothills. The Persian Gulf coast south of Khuzestan and the Gulf of Oman coast have no real plains because the Zagros in these areas come right down to the shore.

There are no major rivers in the country. Of the small rivers and streams, the only one that is navigable is the -long Karun, which shallow-draft boats can negotiate from Khorramshahr to Ahvaz, a distance of about . Other notable rivers include the Karkheh, spanning and joining the Tigris; and the Zayandeh River, which is long. Several other permanent rivers and streams also drain into the Persian Gulf, while a number of small rivers that originate in the northwestern Zagros or Alborz drain into the Caspian Sea.

On the Central Plateau, numerous rivers—most of which have dry beds for the greater part of the year—form from snow melting in the mountains during the spring and flow through permanent channels, draining eventually into salt lakes that also tend to dry up during the summer months. There is a permanent salt lake, Lake Urmia (the traditional name, also cited as Lake Urmiyeh, to which it has reverted after being called Lake Rezaiyeh under Mohammad Reza Shah), in the northwest, whose brine content is too high to support fish or most other forms of aquatic life. There are also several connected salt lakes along the Iran-Afghanistan border in the province of Baluchestan va Sistan.

Iran&#x27;s highlands are home to some of the world&#x27;s most unexpected glaciers. Their appearance in the dry environment is advantageous for those who depend on glacial ice as a supply of fresh water. In an expedition, Klaus Thymann together with the environmental charity Project Pressure produced a series of archive and expedition photographs that depict the urgency of the situation surrounding climate change and the individuals who rely on such natural ice forms to sustain life in remote areas.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,481 km2 of tidal flats in Iran, making it the 22nd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

==Climate==
Iran has a diverse climate. In the northwest, winters are cold with heavy snowfalls and sub-freezing temperatures. Spring and fall are relatively mild, while summers are dry and hot. In the south, winters are mild and summers are very hot, with average daily maximum temperature exceeding in the month of July. On the Khuzestan Plain, summer heat is accompanied by high humidity.

In general, Iran has a temperate climate in which most of the relatively scant annual precipitation falls from October through April. In most of the country, yearly precipitation averages or less. The major exceptions are the higher mountain valleys of the Zagros and the Caspian coastal plain, where precipitation averages at least and is in the form of snow at high altitudes. In the western part of the Caspian, rainfall exceeds annually and is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year. This contrasts with some basins of the Central Plateau that receive or less of precipitation. Iran is considered colder than neighboring countries such as Iraq and Turkmenistan, due to its higher elevation.
===Examples===












==Flora and fauna==

7% of the country is forested. The most extensive growths are found on the mountain slopes rising from the Caspian Sea, with stands of oak, ash, elm, cypress, and other valuable trees. On the plateau proper, areas of scrub oak appear on the best-watered mountain slopes, and villagers cultivate orchards and grow the plane tree, poplar, willow, walnut, beech, maple, and mulberry. Wild plants and shrubs spring from the barren land in the spring and afford pasturage, but the summer sun burns them away. According to FAO reports, the major types of forests that exist in Iran and their respective areas are:
# Caspian forests of the northern districts – 
# Limestone mountainous forests in the northeastern districts (&quot;Juniperus&quot; forests) – 
# Pistachio forests in the eastern, southern and southeastern districts – 
# Oak forests in the central and western districts – 
# Shrubs of the Kavir (desert) districts in the central and northeastern part of the country – 
# Sub-tropical forests of the southern coast, like the Hara forests – 

Wildlife of Iran is diverse and composed of several animal species including bears, gazelles, wild pigs, wolves, jackals, panthers, Eurasian lynx, and foxes. Domestic animals include, sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, eagles and falcon are also native to Iran.

As of 2001, 20 of Iran&#x27;s mammal species and 14 bird species are endangered. Among them are the Baluchistan bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus&quot;), a subspecies of Asian black bear, Persian fallow deer, Siberian crane, hawksbill turtle, green turtle, Oxus cobra, Latifi&#x27;s viper, dugong and dolphins. The Asiatic cheetah is a critically endangered species which is extinct elsewhere and now can only be found in central to northeastern parts of Iran.

Iran lost all its Asiatic lions and Caspian tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century. The Syrian wild ass has become extinct. Syrian brown bears in the mountains, wild sheep and goats, gazelles, Persian onagers, wild pigs, Persian leopards, and foxes abound. Domestic animals include sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, and falcon are native to Iran.

The Persian leopard is said to be the largest of all the subspecies of leopards in the world. The main range of this species in Iran closely overlaps with that of bezoar ibex. Hence, it is found throughout Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges, as well as smaller ranges within the Iranian plateau. The leopard population is very sparse, due to loss of habitat, loss of natural prey, and population fragmentation. Apart from bezoar ibex, wild sheep, boar, deer, (either Caspian red deer or roe deer), and domestic animals constitute leopards&#x27; diet in Iran.

===Ecosystem and biosphere===

Iran&#x27;s bio-diversity ranks 13th in the world. There are 272 conservation areas around Iran for a total of 17 million hectares under the supervision of the Department of Environment (Iran), variously named national parks, protected areas, and natural wildlife refuges, all meant to protect the genetic resources of the country. There are only 2,617 rangers and 430 environmental monitoring units engaged in protecting these vast areas, which amounts to 6,500 hectares to cover for each ranger.

==International territorial disputes==

Iran is currently engaged in international territorial disputes with several neighbouring countries.

The country protests Afghanistan&#x27;s limiting flow of dammed tributaries to the Helmand River in periods of drought. The lack of a maritime boundary in the Persian Gulf with Iraq also prompts jurisdictional disputes beyond the mouth of the Arvand Rud. Iran and the United Arab Emirates have a territorial dispute over the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa islands, which are administered by Iran. Iran currently insists on dividing the Caspian Sea resources equally among the five littoral states, after the Russian-backed former soviet breakaway republics refused to respect the 50-50 agreements between Iran and the Soviet Union (despite their international obligation). Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan continue to claim territorial waters thus regarding the Caspian Sea as open international body of water, dismissing its geographically lake nature.

<text>Iran&#x27;s population increased dramatically during the later half of the 20th century, reaching about 80 million by 2016. , Iran&#x27;s population is around 91.5 million. In recent years, however, Iran&#x27;s birth rate has dropped significantly. Studies project that Iran&#x27;s rate of population growth will continue to slow until it stabilises above 100 million by 2050. Half of Iran&#x27;s population was under 35 years old in 2012. As of January 2025, the average age of the Iranian population is 32 years.

In 2009, the number of households stood at 15.3 million (4.8 persons per household). Families earn some 11.8 million rials (about $960) per month on average (2012).

According to the OECD/World Bank statistics population growth in Iran from 1990 to 2008 was 17.6 million and 32%. The literacy rate was 80% in 2002, and 85% in 2016. The fertility rate has fallen to 1.6, below the natural replacement rate of 2.1.

==Population==
According to the 2016 population census the population of Iran was 79.9 million, a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986, an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.2% between 2011 and 2016.

=== Urban population ===
In addition to its international migration pattern, Iran also exhibits one of the steepest urban growth rates in the world according to the UN humanitarian information unit. According to 2015 population estimates, approximately 73.4 per cent of Iran&#x27;s population lives in urban areas, up from 27 per cent in 1950.

The following is a list of the eight most populous cities in the country:
==Vital statistics==
===UN estimates===
(2022 estimates).
;Notes
1 per 1000&lt;br&gt;2 TFR = number of children per woman&lt;br&gt;3 per 1000 births

===Registered births and deaths===
Note that registrations may be by year of registration and not by year of occurrence. This was especially the case in the beginning of the 1980s when there were many late registrations. This explains the high number of births during 1980-1986. Before 1980, the registrations were incomplete.



====Current vital statistics====

===Total fertility rate ===
In 1960, Iran&#x27;s fertility rate was 7.3 children per woman. In 2021, the rate had fallen to 1.7 children per woman. According to a study through the Australian National University, there are both micro and macro factors affecting the fertility rate in Iran, including education, economics, and culture. Micro-factors can include family income levels and individual choices, while macro-factors can include the country&#x27;s economy, education, and shifting cultural values. The cross-sectional cohort study examined four provinces in Iran (Gilan, Sistan &amp; Baluchistan, West Azerbaijan, and Yazd) and found that trends show that women in all four provinces are choosing to have fewer children compared to the women born in the earlier cohorts. The majority of women agreed with statements such as &quot;having many children is an obstacle for the parents&#x27; interests&quot; and &quot;having many children creates financial pressure for the family&quot; (among others). Other sources also suggest that delayed marriage and a tendency to limit fertility are factors affecting the decline of TFR. A decline in TFR can lead to population decrease, and an ageing population, which can negatively impact the country&#x27;s economy. In response, Iranian policymakers have attempted to limit these factors by restricting access to contraceptives and surgeries that reduce fertility.

== Ethnic groups ==

Iran is a mosaic of diverse ethnic groups, contrary to popular belief that all Iranians are &quot;just Persian&quot;.
According to a 1939 survey and Anthropological study of the people of Iran, these were the ethnic groups that resided in the following areas of Iran:

===Genetics===
==== Haplogroups ====

===== Y-chromosome DNA =====
Y-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, the Iranian Y-chromosome pool is as follows where haplogroups, R1 (25%), J2 (23%) G (14%), J1 (8%) E1b1b (5%), L (4%), 
Q (4%), comprise more than 85% of the total chromosomes.

===== Mitochondrial DNA =====
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents the female lineage. West Eurasian mtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).

Among them, U3b3 lineages appear to be restricted to populations of Iran and the Caucasus, while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole Near East region.

In Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted of the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaks and Mazandarani&#x27;s, whose genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicities, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani&#x27;s. Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1–2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.

Levels of genetic variation in Iranian populations are comparable to the other groups from the Caucasus, Anatolia and Europe.

==== Autosomal DNA ====
A large-scale genetic analyses on various ethnic groups of Iran, published in 2019, found that genetically speaking different Iranian ethnic groups, such as Persians, Kurds, Azeris, Lurs, Mazanderanis, Gilaks and Arabs, cluster tightly together, forming a single cluster known as the &quot;CIC&quot; (Central Iranian cluster). Compared with worldwide populations, Iranians (CIC) cluster in the center of the wider West Eurasian cluster, close to Europeans, Middle Easterners, and South-Central Asians. Iranian Arabs and Turkic-speaking Azeris genetically overlap with Iranian-speaking peoples such as Persians. The genetic substructure of Iranians was found to be low, compared with other &quot;1000G&quot; populations. Iranians display their highest genetic affinity with other Southwest and West Asian populations, followed by Europeans and Central Asian groups. Certain South Asians (specifically the Parsi minority) showed the highest affinity with Iranians, inline with their ethnic history. Overall, the study results suggest that the genetic makeup of the Iranian gene pool formed already about 5,000 years ago and shows high continuity since then, suggesting that they were largely unaffected by migration events from outside groups. On a global scale, Iranians display their highest affinity with other &quot;West Eurasian&quot; populations (such as Europeans or South Asians, but also Latin Americans), while Sub-Saharan Africans and East Asians showed large degrees of differentiation with Iranians.

==Languages and ethnic groups==

The largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Luri, Talysh, and Balochi. Speakers of Turkic languages, most notably Azerbaijanis, which is by far the second-most spoken language in the country, but also the Turkmen, and the Qashqai peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Assyrian. A small number of Mandaeans in Khuzestan speak Mandaic. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as Armenian and Russian; also, Georgian (a member of the Kartvelian language family) is spoken in a large pocket only by those Iranian Georgians that live in Fereydan, Fereydunshahr. Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran province and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language.
The Circassians in Iran, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.

Jews have had a continuous presence in Iran since the time of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. In 1948, there were approximately 140,000–150,000 Jews living in Iran. According to the Tehran Jewish Committee, the Jewish population of Iran was (more recently) estimated at 25,000 to 35,000, of which approximately 15,000 are in Tehran with the rest residing in Hamadan, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Yazd, Kerman, Rafsanjan, Borujerd, Sanandaj, Tabriz and Urmia. However, the official 2011 state census recorded only 8,756 Jews in Iran.

The CIA World Factbook (which is based on 2013 statistics) gives the following numbers for the languages spoken in Iran today: Persian, Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani 66%; Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages 18%; Kurdish 10%; Arabic 2%; Balochi 2%; others 2% (Armenian, Georgian, Circassian, Assyrian, etc.).

According to anthropologist Brian Spooner, around half of Iran&#x27;s population uses a language other than Persian at home and in informal public situations.

Other sources, such as the Library of Congress, and the Encyclopedia of Islam (Leiden) give Iran&#x27;s ethnic groups as following: Persians 65%, Azerbaijanis 16%, Kurds 7%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Baloch 2%, Turkmens 1%, Turkic tribal groups (e.g. Qashqai) 1%, and non-Persian, non-Turkic groups (e.g. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians) less than 1%. For sources prior to and after 2000, see Languages and ethnicities in Iran.
==Religious affiliations==


About 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the Shi&#x27;a branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the Sunni branch, which predominates in neighbouring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Baháʼís, Mandaeans, and Yarsan. By far the largest group of Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has between 110,000, 250,000, and 300,000, adherents. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran. The Baháʼí Faith, Iran&#x27;s largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognised (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted since its inception in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Baháʼís has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment. Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000, and 70,000. The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.


==Migration==

===Recent immigration===

Most of the large Circassian migrational waves towards mainland Iran stem from the Safavid and Qajar era; however, a certain amount also stem from the relatively recent arrivals that migrated as the Circassians were displaced from the Caucasus in the 19th century. A Black African population exists due to historical slavery.
A substantial number of Russians arrived in the early 20th century as refugees from the Russian Revolution, but their number has dwindled following the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian revolution.
In the 20th to 21st centuries, there has been limited immigration to Iran from Turkey, Iraq (especially huge numbers during the 1970s known as Moaveds), Afghanistan (mostly arriving as refugees in 1978), Lebanon (especially in Qom, though a Lebanese community has been present in the nation for centuries),
India (mostly arriving temporarily during the 1950s to 1970s, typically working as doctors, engineers, and teachers), Korea (mostly in the 1970s as labour migrants), China (mostly since the 2000s working in engineering or business projects), and Pakistan, partly due to labour migrants and partly to Balochi ties across the Iranian-Pakistani border.
About 200,000 Iraqis arrived as refugees in 2003, mostly living in refugee camps near the border; an unknown number of these has since returned to Iraq.

Over the same period, there has also been substantial emigration from Iran, especially since the Iranian revolution (see Iranian diaspora, Human capital flight from Iran, Jewish exodus from Iran), especially
to the United States, Canada, Germany, Israel, and Sweden.

====Refugee population====

Iran hosts one of the largest refugee population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan (80%) and Iraq (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation. Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1 billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150 million on those in Iran. In 1999, the Iranian government estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10 million per day, compared with the US$18 million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999. As of 2016, some 300,000 work permits have been issued for foreign nationals in Iran.

===Emigration===
The term &quot;Iranian citizens abroad&quot; or &quot; Iranian/Persian diaspora&quot; refers to the Iranian people and their children born in Iran but living outside of Iran. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than two billion dollars home in 2006.

As of 2010, there are about four to five million Iranians living abroad, mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe, Persian Gulf States, Turkey, Australia and the broader Middle East. According to the 2000 Census and other independent surveys, there are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the U.S., in particular, the Los Angeles area is estimated to be host to approximately 72,000 Iranians, earning the Westwood area of LA the nickname Tehrangeles. Other metropolises that have large Iranian populations include Dubai with 300,000 Iranians, Vancouver, London, Toronto, San Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C., Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt. Their combined net worth is estimated to be $1.3 trillion.

Note that this differs from the other Iranian peoples living in other areas of Greater Iran, who are of related ethnolinguistical family, speaking languages belonging to the Iranian languages which is a branch of Indo-European languages.

==People of Iranian ancestry==
===Tats (Caucasus)===
The &quot;Tats&quot; are an Iranian people, presently living within Azerbaijan and Russia (mainly Southern Dagestan). The Tats are part of the indigenous peoples of Iranian origin in the Caucasus.

Tats use the Tat language, a southwestern Iranian language and a variety of Persian Azerbaijani and Russian are also spoken. Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a significant Sunni Muslim minority. Likely the ancestors of modern Tats settled in South Caucasus when the Sassanid Empire from the 3rd to 7th centuries built cities and founded military garrisons to strengthen their positions in this region.

===Parsis===
The Parsis are the close-knit Zoroastrian community based primarily in India but also found in Pakistan. Parsis are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago. Indian census data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of Karachi and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000.

===Iranis===
In Pakistan and India, the term &quot;Irani&quot; has come to denote Iranian Zoroastrians who have migrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most Parsis who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them moved during the Qajar era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran. Unlike the Parsis, they speak a Dari dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in Yazd and Kerman. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day Mumbai while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day Karachi. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses. Some, such as Ardeshir Irani, have also become very famous in cinema.

===Ajam (Bahrain)===

The &quot;Ajam&quot; are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of Manama and Muharraq. The Iranians who adhere to Shiite sect of Islam are Ajam, and they are different from the Huwala. Ajams are also a large percentage of the populace in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.

In addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the Safavid rule of Bahrain (1501–1722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.

===Huwala===

Huwala are the descendants of Persians and Arab-Persians who belong to the Sunni sect of Islam. Huwala migrated from Ahvaz in Iran to the Persian Gulf in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.

<text>The politics of Iran takes place in the framework of an Islamic theocracy which was formed following the overthrow of Iran&#x27;s millennia-long monarchy by the 1979 Revolution. Iran&#x27;s system of government (&quot;nezam&quot;) was described by Juan José Linz in 2000 as combining &quot;the ideological bent of totalitarianism with the limited pluralism of authoritarianism&quot;. Although it &quot;holds regular elections in which candidates who advocate different policies and incumbents are frequently defeated&quot;, Iran scored lower than Saudi Arabia in the 2021 Democracy Index, determined by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The December 1979 constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, declares that Shia Islam is Iran&#x27;s state religion (around 90–95% of Iranians associate themselves with the Shia branch of Islam), and it combines elements of theocracy (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) with a presidential system. Like many Western democracies, Iran has a president and a parliament (Majles). Unlike other Western or Islamic governments, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is supervised by a supreme leader, and an appointed and unelected Guardian Council half of which is made up of Islamic jurists.

The Supreme Leader is the head of state, above the president. According to Karim Sadjadpour he either has direct or indirect control of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, as well as the military and the media. Iran&#x27;s president, a parliament (e.g. Majlis), an Assembly of Experts, which elects the supreme leader, and local councils are all elected. All candidates who run for these positions must be vetted by the Guardian Council (which disqualifies the overwhelming majority of the candidates) for their loyalty to the Islamic Republic&#x27;s system of government. In 1998, the Guardian Council rejected Hadi Khamenei&#x27;s candidacy for a seat in the Assembly of Experts for &quot;insufficient theological qualifications&quot;. In addition, there are representatives elected from appointed organizations, usually under the Supreme Leader&#x27;s control, to &quot;protect the state&#x27;s Islamic character&quot;.

==History and background==
===1979 Revolution===
In 1979, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by an Islamic Revolution in Iran, replacing its millennia-old monarchy with a theocratic republic. Shortly after, the leader of the Revolution, a senior Islamic jurist named Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also transliterated Khumaynî, successfully supported referendums to declare Iran an Islamic Republic in March 1979, and to approve a constitution in December 1979, whereby &quot;the Islamic government&quot; would be &quot;based upon &quot;wilayat al-faqih&quot;&quot;, (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) &quot;as proposed by Imam Khumaynî&quot;, quoting the preamble of the constitution. 

The constitution (which was drafted by an assembly made up primarily by disciples of Khomeini), calls for a &quot;Vali-ye faqih&quot; (Guardian Islamic Jurist), to serve as the Supreme Leader of Iran, and for Islamic jurists to serve in other powerful institutions such as the Guardian Council and Assembly of Experts.

===Establishment of guardianship of the jurist===
Guardianship of the Jurist is a concept in Twelver Shia Islamic law, which holds that, in the absence of the &quot;Infallible Imam&quot;, who, according to Twelver beliefs, is the religious and political leader of Islam and will reappear sometime before Judgement Day, righteous Shi&#x27;i jurists (&quot;faqīh&quot;) should administer &quot;some&quot; of the &quot;religious and social affairs&quot; of the Shi&#x27;i community. In its &quot;absolute&quot; form—the form advanced by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the basis of government in Islamic Republic of Iran—the state and society are ruled by an Islamic jurist. Khomeini served as the Guardian Jurist Supreme Leader of Iran until his death in 1989. His successor, Ali Khamenei, is still ruling as of mid 2023.

In a 1970 book on the subject circulated to his network of supporters, Khomeini argued that since Islamic sharia law contains everything needed to rule a state, whether ancient or modern, any other basis of governance will lead to injustice and sin. Thus Iran, the Muslim world and eventually the whole world, must be ruled according to sharia, and the person who should rule according to sharia, is an expert in that form of law. 

These Guardians are deemed the true holders of both religious and political authority, who must be obeyed as &quot;an expression of obedience to God&quot;, 
and whose rule has &quot;precedence over all secondary ordinances in Islam such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.&quot;

===Post-revolutionary political conditions===

The early days of the revolutionary government were characterized by political tumult. In November 1979, the US embassy was seized and its occupants taken hostage and kept captive for 444 days, because of US support for the Shah (monarch) of Iran. The eight-year Iran–Iraq War killed hundreds of thousands and cost the country billions of dollars. By the early 1980s, power struggles ended in leftists and nationalists eliminated from all governmental institutions, and the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters firmly in control.

Iran&#x27;s post-revolution challenges have included the imposition of economic sanctions and the suspension of diplomatic relations with Iran by the United States because of the hostage crisis, political support to Iraq and other acts of terrorism that the U.S. government and some others have accused Iran of sponsoring. Emigration from Iran has cost Iran millions of educated people, including entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople and their capital. Poverty rose by nearly 45% in absolute terms during the first 6 years of the Iran-Iraq War, and according to the World Bank, by the time the war ended in 1988, per capita income was a little more than half of what it had been in 1976, shortly before the revolution.

====Human rights====
=====Background=====
The alleged tyranny and brutality towards all opposition of the monarchy was one of the propaganda themes of the Islamic revolution, but the Islamic Republic has not tolerated opposition to its system of government, since, as mentioned above, it believes disobedience to it is disobedience to God. In 1984, Iran&#x27;s representative to the United Nations, Saʿid Rajaʾie-Khorassani, declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be representing a &quot;secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition&quot;, which did not &quot;accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; and whose provisions the IRI would &quot;not hesitate to violate&quot;. 

In reply to international criticism of repression, Iranian officials loyal to the Supreme Leader deny wrongdoing, maintaining its human rights record is better than western countries who criticize its record. In 2004, Judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, denied that there were any political prisoners in Iran, saying &quot;The world may consider certain cases, by their nature, political crimes, but because we do not have a law in this regard, these are considered ordinary offenses.&quot; In 2008, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad replied to a question about human rights by stating that Iran has fewer prisoners than the US and &quot;the human rights situation in Iran is relatively a good one, when compared ... with some European countries and the United States.&quot;

Whether the Islamic Republic goes well beyond what Sunni and many Shia Muslims consider Islamic exceptions to international human rights norms, is also an issue. Khomeini&#x27;s January 1988 pronouncement &quot;... that [Islamic] government is a branch of the Prophet&#x27;s absolute Wilayat and one of the primary (first order) rules of Islam that has priority over all ordinances of the law even praying, fasting and Hajj…The Islamic State could prevent implementation of everything – devotional and non- devotional – that so long as it seems against Islam&#x27;s interests&quot;, leads Ann Elizabeth Mayer to argue that this theory of &quot;velayat-e motlaqaye faqih&quot; (&quot;the absolute authority of the jurist&quot;) &quot;freed&quot; the Islamic Republic &quot;to do as it chose-even if this meant violating fundamental pillars of the religion ...&quot;, and that this doctrine, not sharia law, explained &quot;the prevalence of torture and punishment of political dissent&quot; in the Islamic Republic.

On the other hand, despite the vast popularity of Khomeini in Iran before and after the revolution, (approximately 10 million people are estimated to have participated in his funeral in a country of about 60 million), observers (Akbar Ganji, Arzoo Osanloo, Hooman Majd) have suggested there is no widespread support for violent crackdowns on dissent in contemporary Iran. &quot;Notions of democracy and human rights&quot; now have much deeper roots among Iranians than under the Shah, and in fact are &quot;almost hegemonic&quot; (Arzoo Osanloo), so that it is much harder to spread fear among them, even to the point that if Iranian intelligence services &quot;were to arrest anyone who speaks ill of the government in private, they simply couldn&#x27;t build cells fast enough to hold their prisoners&quot;, according to journalist Hooman Majd.

=====Situation=====
The Islamic Republic centralized and drastically expanded the prison system of the previous regime. In one early period (1981-1985) more than 7,900 people were executed. Somewhere between 3,000 and 30,000 political prisoners were executed between July and early September 1988 on orders of the Ayatollah Khomeini, causing a 2020 UN Special Rapporteurs to send a letter to the regime describing the killings as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;.

The Islamic Republic has been criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republic&#x27;s constitution and law, but not international human rights norms (harsh penalties for crimes, punishment of victimless crimes, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, restrictions on freedom of religion, etc.); and for &quot;extrajudicial&quot; actions that follow neither, such as firebombings of newspaper offices, and beatings, torture, rape, and killing without trial of political prisoners and dissidents/civilians.

====Protests====
While the Islamic Republic has been noted for its political stability, political protests against perceived corruption and injustice have become more severe and common in the twenty-first century. Nevertheless, at least one analyst, Seth G. Jones, believes that as of 2019, &quot;the Iranian protest movement is ... too decentralized and Iranian security forces ... too strong&quot; for the regime to be in danger of being overthrown by protesters. Some protests include: 
* Iran student protests, July 1999: Protested the closure of the reformist newspaper (&quot;Salam&quot;), and violent attack on a student dormitory by riot police. Disappearance of more than seventy students, 1,200–1,400 arrested.
* 2009 Iranian presidential election protests: Protest against alleged voting fraud and irregularities during the 2009 election. An estimated 36 killed according to Iranian government, 72 killed according to opposition.
* 2011–12 Iranian protests: Protest against alleged electoral fraud during 2009 elections, violation of human rights, lack of freedom of speech, corruption.
* 2017–18 Iranian protests: Protest against economic hardships, government corruption, Iranian involvement in regional conflicts, the autocratic government of Ali Khamenei, human rights violations; 23-25 killed, 4,972 people arrested.
* 2018–2019 Iranian general strikes and protests: Protests against economic hardships, government corruption, Iranian involvement in regional conflicts. 300+ arrested.
* 2019–20 Iranian protests: Protest against government corruption, fuel price increases, human rights abuses, in favor of regime change. an estimated 1,500 killed, 7,000+ arrested.
* 2021–2022 Iranian protests: Protested the ongoing water shortages and blackouts of electricity all over Iran. An estimated 11 people killed, over 100 arrested.

==Leading figures and institutions==

=== Current office holders ===
===Supreme Leader===

Two very powerful, unelected posts/institutions unique to the Islamic Republic are the Supreme Leader and Guardian Council.

The Supreme Leader of Iran is the head of state and highest ranking political and religious authority (above the President). The armed forces, judicial system, state television, and other key governmental organizations such as the Guardian Council and Expediency Discernment Council are under the control of the Supreme Leader. According to article 110 of the constitution, the Supreme Leader delineates the general policies of the Islamic Republic. There have been only two Supreme Leaders since the founding of the Islamic Republic, and the current leader (Ali Khamenei), has been in power since 1989. His powers extend to issuing decrees and making final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national planning of population growth, 
the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and who is to be fired and reinstated in the Presidential cabinet.

The Supreme Leader is appointed by the Assembly of Experts. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), are selected by the Guardian Council, half of whose members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. All directly elected members after the vetting process by the Guardian Council still have to be approved by the Supreme Leader.

===Guardian Council===

The Guardian Council is an appointed and constitutionally mandated 12-member council with considerable power. It approves or vetoes legislative bills from the Islamic Consultative Assembly (the Iranian Parliament), supervises elections, and approves or forbids candidates seeking office to the Assembly of Experts, the Presidency and the parliament. Six of its twelve members are Islamic faqihs (expert in Islamic Law) selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. The other six are jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial system (who is also appointed by the Supreme Leader), and approved by the Iranian Parliament.

==Political parties, factions and elections==
===Political parties, organizations, pressure groups===

After the revolution, the Islamic Republic Party was Iran&#x27;s ruling and only legal political party until its dissolution in 1987. Its abolition has been attributed to Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s well founded belief that leftist, monarchists and nationalists had been suppressed, and his network&#x27;s place in power was secure. Supporters of the Islamic Republic Party reorganised themselves as &quot;principalists&quot;, and along with the &quot;reformists&quot;, became two of the major political factions in the country.

The Executives of Construction Party was formed in 1994 to run for the fifth parliamentary elections, made up mainly of executives in the government close to the then-president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. There are several other legal political parties or associations operating in Iran. Legal political groups, must support the Ayatollah Khomeini, his Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist political system (&quot;nezam&quot;) created by the revolution, the exclusion of “nonrevolutionary” and secular parties from political participation, and agree Iran&#x27;s fundamental security interest is the survival and strengthening of the &quot;nezam&quot;.

Active student groups include the pro-reform &quot;Office for Strengthening Unity&quot; and &quot;the Union of Islamic Student Societies&quot;.
Groups that generally support the Islamic Republic include Ansar-e Hizballah, The Iranian Islamic Students Association, Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam, Islam&#x27;s Students, and the Islamic Coalition Association. The conservative power base has been said to be made up of a &quot;web of Basiji militia members, families of war martyrs, some members of the Revolutionary Guard, some government employees, some members of the urban and rural poor, and conservative-linked foundations.&quot;
:&quot;see: List of political parties in Iran.&quot;
;Anti-government groups
There are many nationalist, leftist and monarchist dissident parties and militias including National Front, the Constitutionalist Party, the Tudeh Party, People&#x27;s Mujahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas (IPFG), and the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan.

===Political factions===

Iran&#x27;s political parties/organizations are said to represent political factions in Iran,
and according to at least one source, &quot;factionalism has generally been more important than constitutional process in decision making&quot;, especially under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, i.e. after 1990, when &quot;factional competition&quot; grew &quot;markedly in both intensity and
influence&quot;.

Scholars such as Maziar Behrooz, Behzad Nabavi, Bahman Baktiari, Maaike Warnaar, Payam Mohseni, have given different formulations of them, varying in number, usually between three and five, the basic three being Principlists aka hard liners, Pragmatists and Reformists, and orientation (ideological purity vs. pragmatism; support for political and religious freedom vs. authoritarianism; support for regulation and intervention in the marketplace vs. laissez faire policies).

===Elections===

These are the most recent elections that have taken place:

====President====
====Local councils====
====Islamic Consultative Assembly====
====Assembly of Experts====
==Military==
==Public finance and fiscal policy==

===Budget===

Iran&#x27;s fiscal year (FY) goes from 21 to 20 March of the following year.

Iran has two types of budget:
#Public or &quot;General&quot; Government Budget
#Overall or &quot;Total&quot; Government Budget; which includes state-owned companies

Iran&#x27;s budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and then &quot;proposed&quot; by the government to the parliament/Majlis. Once approved by Majlis, the bill still needs to be ratified by the Guardian Council. The bill will be sent back to the parliament for amendments if it is voted down by the Guardian Council. The Expediency Council acts as final arbiter in any dispute.

Following annual approval of the government&#x27;s budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan. The 5-year plan is part of &quot;Vision 2025&quot;, a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.

A unique feature of Iran&#x27;s economy is the large size of the religious foundations, called &quot;Bonyads&quot;, whose combined budgets make up more than 30% of that of the central government.

Setad, another organization worth more than $95 billion, has been described as &quot;secretive&quot; and &quot;little known&quot;. It is not overseen by the Iranian Parliament. In 2008, Parliament voted to &quot;prohibit itself from monitoring organizations that the supreme leader controls, except with his permission&quot;. It is an important factor in the Supreme Leader&#x27;s power, giving him financial independence from parliament and the national budget.

The National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) does not depend on Iran&#x27;s budget. But according to the Santiago Principles, NDFI must coordinate its investment decisions and actions with the macro-economic and monetary policies of the government of Iran.

====Revenues====
In 2004, about 45 percent of the government&#x27;s budget came from exports of oil and natural gas revenues. This varies with the fluctuations in world petroleum markets. 31 percent of the budget came from taxes and fees. Overall, an estimated 50 percent of Iran&#x27;s GDP was exempt from taxes in FY 2004.

In 2010, oil income accounted for 80% of Iran&#x27;s foreign currency revenues and 60% of Iran&#x27;s overall budget. Any surplus revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas are to be paid into the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF). In 2010, the approved &quot;total budget&quot;, including state owned commercial companies, was $295 billion.

The Government seeks to increase the share of tax revenue in the budget through the implementation of the economic reform plan, through more effective tax collection from businesses.

As of 2016, the formula set by law is that, for sales of oil at or below the budget&#x27;s price assumption, 14.5% remains with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), 20% goes to the National Development Fund (NDF), 2% goes to deprived and oil-producing provinces, and 63.5% goes to the government treasury.

Iran has not yet implemented the treasury single account system.

====Expenditures====

Because of changes in the classification of budgetary figures, comparison of categories among different years is not possible. However, since the Iranian Revolution, the government&#x27;s general budget payments have averaged:
* 59 percent for social affairs,
* 17 percent for economic affairs,
* 15 percent for national defense, and
* 13 percent for general affairs.

Iran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs, of which more than 50% covered pension costs.

For a breakdown of expenditures for social and economic purposes, see the attached chart.

In FY 2004, central government expenditures were divided as follows:

* current expenditures, 59 percent, and
* capital expenditures, 32 percent.
* Other items (earmarked expenditures, foreign-exchange losses, coverage of liabilities of letters of credit, and net lending) accounted for the remainder.

Among current expenditures, wages and salaries accounted for 36 percent; subsidies and transfers to households accounted for 22 percent (not including &quot;indirect&quot; subsidies). Earmarked expenditures totaled 13 percent of the central government total. Between FY 2000 and FY 2004, total expenditures and net lending accounted for about 26 percent of GDP. According to the Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs, Iran&#x27;s subsidy reforms would save 20 percent of the country&#x27;s budget.

According to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed in this structure, the government could save at least 30 to 35 percent on its expenses.

Contrary to the main objective and because of a lack in the implementation of the subsidy reform plan, the volume of Iranian subsidies given to its citizens on fossil fuel, which increased 42.2% in 2019, equals 15.3% of Iran&#x27;s GDP and 16% of total global energy subsidies. As a direct consequence, 
Iranian taxpayers incur a loss of $3.3 billion annually because of fuel smuggling (&amp; not including other smuggled oil derivatives), equivalent to the &quot;development budget&quot; of Iran.

====Public debt====


In 2014, Iran&#x27;s banks and financial institutions total claims on the public sector (government and governmental institutions) amounted to 929 trillion IRR ($34.8 billion), which must be reduced according to the IMF. IMF estimates that public debt could be as high as 40% of GDP (or more) once government arrears to the private sector are recognized. These arrears are owed to banks (45%), private contractors (37%), and social security (18%) (FY 2016).

=====External debts=====
In 2013, Iran&#x27;s external debts stood at $7.2 billion compared with $17.3 billion in 2012. Iran&#x27;s external debt was $7.12 billion in April 2022. This is one of the lowest numbers internationally (~$90 per capita).

====Financial situation of the government====

===Annual budgets===
====2009–10====
In Iran&#x27;s state budget for the Iranian calendar year 1388 (2009–2010), of the $102 billion earmarked for government spending,
*53% will be funded through revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas,
*28% will come from taxes and the remaining
*19% from other sources such as the privatization program.

Oil revenues are calculated based on the average price of $37.50 per barrel at the US Dollar conversion rate of 9,500 Rials. Iran balances its external accounts around $75 per barrel.

====2010–11====
The budget for Iranian year 1389 (2010–2011), which starts on 21 March, amounts to $368.4bn, representing an increase of 31 per cent on the previous year and is based on a projected oil price of $60 a barrel compared with just $37.50 last year.

====2011–12====
The public budget was $165 billion (1,770 trillion rials) in Iranian year 2011–2012. The Iranian Parliament also approved a total budget of $508 billion (5,170 trillion rials) that factors in $54 billion from price hikes and subsidy cuts and aside from the government (or public budget) also includes spending for state-owned companies. The budget is based on an oil price of $81.5 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 10,500 for the same period. The 2011-12 total budget is &quot;40&quot; per cent bigger than previous year&#x27;s (which stood at $368 billion) because of dropping subsidies on energy and food item.

====2012–13====
The proposed budget for 2011–2012 amounts to 5.1 quadrillion rials (approximately $416 billion). The funding for running the government has been decreased by 5.6 percent and the government&#x27;s tax revenues have been envisaged to rise by 20 percent. The defense budget shows an increase of 127 percent. The government also is seeking higher sums for development, research, and health projects. Approved budget of 5,660 trillion Rials $477 billion is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel and the average value of the U.S. dollar for the fiscal year has been projected to be 12,260 rials, allowing the government to gain $53.8 billion from subsidy cut. 

The approved total state budget figure shows an 11% increase in Rial terms, in comparison to the previous year&#x27;s budget. Of this amount, $134 billion relates to the government&#x27;s general budget and the remaining $343 billion relates to state-owned companies and organizations. Of the $134 billion for the government&#x27;s general budget, $117 billion relates to operating expenditure and $17 billion is for infrastructure developments. The government&#x27;s general budget for 2012–13 shows a 3.5% decline in comparison to the previous year, while the budget for state-owned companies and organisations has risen by 18.5%. Revenues from crude oil make up 37% of the state&#x27;s total revenues in the budget. Revenues from taxes have been projected at 458 trillion Rials ($37 billion), which shows a 10% increase year-on-year. In the first half of 2012, Iran announced in Majlis that it has taken in only 25% of its budgeted annual revenue. According to Apicorp, Iran needs oil to average $127 a barrel in 2012 for its fiscal budget to break even.

====2013–14====
In May 2013, the Iranian parliament approved a 7.27-quadrillion-rial (about $593 billion) national budget bill for 2013–14. The new national budget has forecast a 40% drop in oil revenues compared to the previous year&#x27;s projected figure. The bill has set the price of oil at $95 per barrel, based on the official exchange rate of 12,260 rials for a U.S. dollar, which has been fixed by the Central Bank of Iran. The budget law also includes income of 500 trillion Rials from the subsidies reform plan. Out of this amount, 410 trillion Rials is allocated for direct cash handouts to those eligible who have registered and for social funds.

====2014–15====
Iran&#x27;s earmarked government spending for the year starting in March 2014 at $75 billion, calculated on an open-market exchange rate, with an overall/&quot;total&quot; budget ceiling estimated at $265 billion. The draft budget estimates oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd). The 2014 budget assumes an average oil price of $100 per barrel, inflation at 21%, GDP growth at 3% and the official USD/IRR exchange rate at 26,000 Iranian rials. The budget bill permits the government to use more than $35 billion in foreign finance. Capital expenditure is set to rise by 9.7%. 

The administration has set the goal of 519 trillion rials, (about $20.9 billion) government&#x27;s income from implementation of the subsidy reform plan in budget bill and will be likely forced to double fuel prices. In February 2014, Parliament approved a &quot;total&quot; budget bill worth 7,930 trillion rials ($319 billion at the official exchange rate). The International Monetary Fund has estimated Iran needs an oil price above $130 a barrel to balance its 2015-state budget; Brent crude was below $80 a barrel in November 2014. The IMF estimated in October 2014 that Iran would run a general government deficit of $8.6 billion in 2015, at the official exchange rate, to be compensated by drawing on the National Development Fund.

====2015–16====
Iran&#x27;s 2015 proposed budget is nearly $300 billion. The overall/&quot;total&quot; budget shows a 4% growth compared with the 2014 budget. The budget assumes
that the country exports 1 million barrels per day of crude oil and 0.3 million barrels per day of gas condensates at an average price of $72 per barrel of crude. The official exchange rate is projected to be on average US$28,500/IRR. Dependency on oil exports in this overall budget bill has dropped to 25% (down from over 30% of government revenues in 2014.) The plan is to increase taxation on large organizations by reducing tax evasion/exemption. The Iranian state is the biggest player in the economy, and the annual budget strongly influences the outlook of local industries and the stock market. The 2015 budget is not expected to bring much growth for many of the domestic industries. 

An average oil price of $50 for the coming year would result in a deficit of $7.5 billion. The government can lower this deficit by increasing the official exchange rate but this will trigger higher inflation. The proposed expenses are $58 billion including $39 billion is salary and pension payments to government employees. Proposed development expenditure amounts to $17 billion. R&amp;D&#x27;s share in the GNP is at 0.06% (where it should be 2.5% of GDP) and industry-driven R&amp;D is almost non‑existent.

====2016–17====
Proposed government budget is 9.52-quadrillion Iranian rials (about 262 billion US dollars). Assumptions made in the budget are $50 billion in foreign investment and foreign loans, 5-6% GDP growth and 11% inflation. Sixty-five percent of the budget is to be financed through taxation and the remaining 35% from oil sales, based on 2.25 million barrels of oil sales per day, an average oil price of 40 dollars a barrel and US dollar-Iranian rial exchange rate at 29,970.

According to the sixth five-year development plan (2016-2021), the subsidy reform plan is to continue until 2021.

An amendment to the budget was passed in August 2016. This amendment allows the government to issue debt based instruments and the use of forex reserves in an attempt to clear its debt to the private sector, including contractors, banks and insurers.

====2021-22====
====2022-23====
==Complexity of the system==
According to the constitution, the Guardian Council oversees and approves electoral candidates for elections in Iran. The Guardian Council has 12 members: 6 clerics, appointed by the Supreme Leader and 6 jurists, elected by the Majlis from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial System, who is appointed by the Supreme Leader. According to the current law, the Guardian Council approves the Assembly of Experts candidates, who in turn elect the Supreme Leader.

The reformists say this system creates a closed circle of power. Iranian reformists, such as Mohammad-Ali Abtahi have considered this to be the core legal obstacle for the reform movement in Iran.

<doc id="64704" wikidata="Q1018442" url="?curid=64704" title="Economy of Iran">
<text>Iran has a mixed, centrally planned economy with a large public sector. It consists of hydrocarbon, agricultural and service sectors, in addition to manufacturing and financial services, with over 40 industries traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange. With 10% of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves, Iran is considered an &quot;energy superpower&quot;. Nevertheless, since 2024 Iran is suffering from an energy crisis. 

A unique feature of Iran&#x27;s economy is the reliance on large religious foundations called bonyads, whose combined budgets represent more than 30 percent of central government spending.

In 2007, the Iranian subsidy reform plan introduced price controls and subsidies particularly on food and energy. Contraband, administrative controls, widespread corruption, and other restrictive factors undermine private sector-led growth. The government&#x27;s 20-year vision involved market-based reforms reflected in a five year development plan, 2016 to 2021, focusing on &quot;a resilient economy&quot; and &quot;progress in science and technology&quot;. Most of Iran&#x27;s exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of government revenue in 2010. In March 2022, the Iranian parliament under the then new president Ebrahim Raisi decided to eliminate a major subsidy for importing food, medicines and animal feed, valued at $15 billion in 2021. Also in March 2022, 20 billion tons of basic goods exports from Russia including vegetable oil, wheat, barley and corn were agreed.

Iran&#x27;s educated population, high human development, constrained economy and insufficient foreign and domestic investment prompted an increasing number of Iranians to seek overseas employment, resulting in a significant &quot;brain drain&quot;. However, in 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program which removed most international sanctions. Consequently, for a short period, the tourism industry was significantly improved and the inflation of the country was decreased though US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 hindered the growth of the economy again and increased inflation.

GDP contracted in 2018 and 2019, but a modest rebound was expected in 2020. Challenges include a COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018, increased unemployment due to the sanctions, inflation, food inflation, a &quot;chronically weak and undercapitalized&quot; banking system, and an &quot;anemic&quot; private sector, and corruption. Iran&#x27;s currency, the Iranian rial, has fallen, and Iran has a relatively low rating in &quot;Economic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;ease of doing business&quot;. 

== History ==


In 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was defeated and captured by the Persians, who then adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. There are accounts in the biblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far out as India and the Kingdom of Kush during the reign of Xerxes the Great (485–465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the Persian Empire ran some 2,857 km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250 km east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern İzmir in Turkey) on the Aegean Sea.

Modern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1850s when Amir Kabir undertook a number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with other countries. Polyakov&#x27;s &quot;Bank Esteqrazi&quot; was bought in 1898 by the Tsarist government of Russia, and later passed into the hands of the Iranian government by a contract in 1920. The bank continued its activities under the name of &quot;Bank Iran&quot; until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded Keshavarzi Bank.

The Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1885, with offices in all major cities of Persia. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–41) improved the country&#x27;s overall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against foreign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern industries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change, economic development, and relative political stability.

Reza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941–79). No fundamental change occurred in the economy of Iran during World War II and the years immediately following. Between 1954 and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to greater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government sector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency, the rial, depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.

Prior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the 1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and modernization. The pace slowed by 1978 as capital flight reached $30 to $40 billion 1980-US dollars just before the revolution.

Following the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War, over 80% of the economy came under government control. The eight-year war with Iraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000. The cost of the war to Iran&#x27;s economy was some $500 billion.

After hostilities ceased in 1988, the government tried to develop the country&#x27;s communication, transportation, manufacturing, health care, education and energy sectors, including its prospective nuclear power facilities, and began integrating its communication and transportation systems with those of neighboring states.

The government&#x27;s long-term objectives since the revolution were stated as economic independence, full employment, and a comfortable standard of living but Iran&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and its median age declined. Although many Iranians are farmers, agricultural production has consistently fallen since the 1960s. By the late 1990s, Iran imported much of its food. At that time, economic hardship in the countryside resulted in many people moving to cities.

== Macroeconomic trends ==

Iran&#x27;s national science budget in 2005 was about $900 million, roughly equivalent to the 1990 figure. By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of its GDP to research and development, ranking the country behind the world average of 1.4%. In 2009 the ratio of research to GDP was 0.87% against the government&#x27;s medium-term target of 2.5%. Iran ranked first in scientific growth in the world in 2011 and 17th in science production in 2012.

Iran has a broad and diversified industrial base. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Iran ranked 39th in a list of industrialized nations, producing $23 billion of industrial products in 2008. Between 2008 and 2009 Iran moved to 28th from 69th place in annual industrial production growth because of its relative isolation from the 2008 international financial crisis.

In the early 21st century, the service sector was Iran&#x27;s largest, followed by industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture. In 2008, Iran&#x27;s GDP was estimated at $382.3 billion ($842 billion PPP), or $5,470 per capita ($12,800 PPP).

In 2010, the nominal GDP was projected to double in the next five years. Real GDP growth was expected to average 2.2% a year in 2012–16, insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. Furthermore, international sanctions have damaged the economy by reducing oil exports by half, before recovering in 2016. The Iranian rial lost more than half of its value in 2012, directing Iran to import substitution industrialization and a resistive economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran is a &quot;transition economy&quot;, i.e., changing from a planned to a market economy.

In 2008, the United Nations classified Iran&#x27;s economy as semi-developed. In 2014, Iran ranked 83rd in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s analysis of the global competitiveness of 144 countries. Political, policy and currency stability are regarded as the most problematic factors in doing business in Iran. Difficulty in accessing financing is also a major concern, especially for small and medium enterprises. Most of Iran&#x27;s financial resources are directed at trading, smuggling and speculation instead of production and manufacturing. 

In 2008, according to Goldman Sachs, Iran has the potential to become one of the world&#x27;s largest economies in the 21st century. In 2014, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that Iran has the potential to become one of the ten largest economies within the next 30 years.

One major problem often cited by Iranian industrialists is that the government is not supporting them by authorizing imports of similar parts or products into the country, undermining their activity and domestic market. This is partly due to corrupt interests inside the government and mismanagement.




=== Reform plan ===

Expansion of public healthcare and international relations are the other main objectives of the fifth plan, an ambitious series of measures that include subsidy reform, banking recapitalization, currency, taxation, customs, construction, employment, nationwide goods and services distribution, social justice and productivity. The intent is to make the country self-sufficient by 2015 and replace the payment of $100 billion in subsidies annually with targeted social assistance. These reforms target Iran&#x27;s major sources of inefficiency and price distortion and are likely to lead to major restructuring of almost all economic sectors. 

By removing energy subsidies, Iran intends to make its industries more efficient and competitive. By 2016, one third of Iran&#x27;s economic growth is expected to originate from productivity improvement. Energy subsidies left the economy as one of the world&#x27;s least energy-efficient, with energy intensity three times the global average and 2.5 times higher than the Middle Eastern average. Notwithstanding its own issues, the banking sector is seen as a potential hedge against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected to directly impact banks.

== National planning ==
Iran&#x27;s budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and proposed by the government to the parliament before the year&#x27;s end. Following approval of the budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan. The plan is part of &quot;Vision 2025&quot;, a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.


;Sixth development plan (2016–2021)
The sixth five-year development plan for the 2016–2021 period places emphasis on &quot;guidelines&quot; rather than &quot;hard targets&quot;. It defines only three priorities: 
* the development of a resilient economy;
* progress in science and technology;
* and the promotion of cultural excellence.

== Fiscal and monetary policy ==
Since the 1979 revolution, government spending has averaged 59% on social policies, 17% on economic matters, 15% on national defense, and 13% on general affairs. Payments averaged 39% on education, health and social security, 20% on other social programs, 3% on agriculture, 16% on water, power and gas, 5% on manufacturing and mining, 12% on roads and transportation and 5% on other economic affairs. Iran&#x27;s investment reached 27.7% of GDP in 2009. Between 2002 and 2006, inflation fluctuated around 14%. 

In 2008, around 55% of government revenue came from oil and natural gas revenue, with 31% from taxes and fees. There are virtually millions of people who do not pay taxes in Iran and hence operate outside the formal economy. The budget for year 2012 was $462 billion, 9% less than 2011. The budget is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 12,260 for the same period. 

According to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed the government could save at least 30 to 35% on its expenses. The central bank&#x27;s interest rate is 21%, and the inflation rate has climbed to 22% in 2012, 10% higher than in 2011. There is little alignment between fiscal and monetary policy. According to the Central Bank of Iran, the gap between the rich and the poor narrowed because of monthly subsidies but the trend could reverse if high inflation persists.

Iran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011 and balances its external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel. As of 2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of current sanctions. Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran&#x27;s government non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of the latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a consequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December 2011 and April 2012. 

Iran&#x27;s external and fiscal accounts reflect falling oil prices in FY 2012, but remain in surplus. The current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran&#x27;s National Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. In 2013 the external debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012. Overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7% in 2015.

Money in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017 pre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian rial and rise in inflation.

=== Defense related burden ===
According to official data, as of 2023 Iran spends 10.3 billion USD or 2.1% of its GDP on national defense. This percentage is similar to that in other countries such as UK, France and Finland.

In 2025, the Iranian budget bill granted 51% of the total oil and gas export revenues, estimated at about 12 billion euros, to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Command (LEF).

Iran also finances Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi militia, and Hamas. The average annual budget reserved for the funding of Iran&#x27;s proxies is estimated at approximately US$1.6 billion. According to Syrian opposition sources, starting from the beginning of 2011, Iran allocated a total of US$50 billion to maintain the Assad regime in Syria. However, this investment proved to be a failure following the eventual collapse of the regime.

The most costly of Iran&#x27;s defense expenditures is its nuclear program. The estimated total cost of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program until 2025 approaches 500 billion USD. As a result of its nuclear program Iran is subject to international sanctions, causing a long term economic stagnation which cost Iran an additional US$1.2 trillion over 12 years. Furthermore, the sanctions led to a significant decline in foreign direct investments (FDI), with Iran experiencing a reduction of approximately 80% in FDI between 2011 and 2021.

==Work time==
In 2024, Iran passed a law to make a two day weekend. Saturday was added to Friday weekends and Thursdays were removed. The work week was reduced from 44 hours to 40/42 hours.

==Challenges==
The GDP of Iran contracted in FY 2018 and FY 2019 and modest rebound is expected in 2020/2021 according to an April 2020 World Economic Outlook by the IMF. 
Challenges to the economy include the COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, which on top of US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018 and other factors, led a fall in oil production and are projected to lead to a slow recovery in oil exports. Labor-force participation has risen but unemployment is above 10% as of 2020 and projected to rise in 2021 and 2022. 

Inflation reached 41.1% in 2019, and is expected to continue &quot;in the coming years&quot; according to the World Bank, but decline into the 34-33% range. In July 2022, the average inflation rate rose 40.5% while the inflation rate for food and beverages alone rose 87%. Iran&#x27;s banking system is &quot;chronically weak and undercapitalised&quot; according to Nordea Bank Abp, holding billions of dollars of non-performing loans, and the private sector remains &quot;anemic&quot;. 

The unofficial Iranian rial to US dollar exchange rate, which had plateaued at 40,000 to one in 2017, has fallen 120,000 to one as of November 2019. Iran&#x27;s economy has a relatively low rating in the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; (164 out of 180); and ease of doing business ranking (127 among 190) according to the World Bank. Critics have complained that privatization has led not to state owned businesses being taken over by &quot;skilled businesspeople&quot; but by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps &quot;and its associates&quot;. 

In 2020, an Iranian businessperson complained to a foreign journalist (Dexter Filkins) that the uncertainty of &quot;chronic shortages of material and unruly inspectors pushing for bribes&quot; made operating his business very difficult -- &quot;Plan for the next quarter? I can&#x27;t plan for tomorrow morning.&quot;

In 2021, according to the NIOC, daily consumption of gasoline in Iran has surpassed 85 million liters, i.e., 10 times more than Turkey with almost the same population.

== Ownership ==

Following the hostilities with Iraq, the Government declared its intention to privatize most industries and to liberalize and decentralize the economy. Sale of state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a nationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006, most industries, some 70% of the economy, remained state-owned. The majority of heavy industries including steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the public sector, with most light industry privately owned.

Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country&#x27;s economy should consist of state, cooperative, and private based sectors. The state sector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals, banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services, aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned and administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned with production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of the cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law. As of 2012, 5,923 consumer cooperatives, employed 128,396. Consumer cooperatives have over six million members. Private sector operate in construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement the economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors.

Since Article 44 has never been strictly enforced, the private sector has played a much larger role than that outlined in the constitution. In recent years, the role of this sector has increased. A 2004 constitutional amendment allows 80% of state assets to be privatized. Forty percent of such sales are to be conducted through the &quot;Justice Shares&quot; scheme and the rest through the Tehran Stock Exchange. The government would retain the remaining 20%. 

In 2005, government assets were estimated at around $120 billion. Some $63 billion of such assets were privatized from 2005 to 2010, reducing the government&#x27;s direct share of GDP from 80% to 40%. Many companies in Iran remain uncompetitive because of mismanagement over the years, thus making privatization less attractive for potential investors. According to then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 60% of Iran&#x27;s wealth is controlled by just 300 people.

=== Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ===
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are thought to control about one third of Iran&#x27;s economy through subsidiaries and trusts. 2007 estimates by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; suggest the IRGC has ties to over one hundred companies and annual revenue in excess of $12 billion, particularly in construction. The Ministry of Petroleum awarded the IRGC billions of dollars in no-bid contracts as well as major infrastructure projects. 

Tasked with border control, the IRGC maintains a monopoly on smuggling, costing Iranian companies billions of dollars each year. Smuggling is encouraged in part by the generous subsidization of domestic goods, including fuel. The IRGC also runs the telecommunication company, laser eye-surgery clinics, makes cars, builds bridges and roads and develops oil and gas fields.

=== Religious foundations ===
Welfare programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 public agencies alongside semi-state organizations known as &quot;bonyads&quot;, together with several private non-governmental organizations. &quot;Bonyads&quot; are a consortium of over 120 tax-exempt organizations that receive subsidies and religious donations. They answer directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran and control over 20% of GDP. Operating everything from vast soybean and cotton farms to hotels, soft drink, automobile manufacturing, and shipping lines, they are seen as overstaffed, corrupt and generally unprofitable. 

&quot;Bonyad&quot; companies compete with Iran&#x27;s unprotected private sector, whose firms complain of the difficulty of competing with the subsidized &quot;bonyads&quot;. &quot;Bonyads&quot; are not subject to audit or Iran&#x27;s accounting laws. &quot;Setad&quot; is a multi-sector business organization, with holdings of 37 companies, and an estimated value of $95 billion. It is under the control of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and created from thousands of properties confiscated from Iranians.

== Labor force ==

After the revolution, the government established a national education system that improved adult literacy rates. In 2008, 85% of the adult population was literate, well ahead of the regional average of 62%. The Human Development Index was 0.749 in 2013, placing Iran in the &quot;high human development&quot; bracket.

In 2008, annual economic growth of above 5% was necessary to absorb the 750,000 new labor force entrants each year. In 2020, agriculture was 10% of GDP and employed 16% of the labor force. In 2017, the industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, and construction, was 35% of GDP and employed 35% of the labor force. In 2009, mineral products, notably petroleum, accounted for 80% of Iran&#x27;s export revenues, even though mining employs less than 1% of the labor force. 

In 2004, the service sector ranked as the largest contributor to GDP, at 48% of the economy, and employed 44% of workers. Women made up 33% of the labor force in 2005. Youth unemployment, aged 15–24, was 29.1% in 2012, resulting in significant brain drain. In 2016, according to the government, some 40% of the workforce in the public sector are either in excess or incompetent.

=== Labor force and the public sector ===
The Islamic Republic of Iran employs around 8 million individuals, of whom roughly 3 million hold formal positions within the three branches of government, the armed forces, and leadership institutions. These roles encompass bureaucratic staff, civil servants, and uniformed military personnel.

Beyond the formal government structure, approximately 2.3 million individuals are employed in quasi-governmental organizations, including state-owned enterprises, national banks, municipalities, and the Islamic Azad University. Additionally, about 2.5 million pensioners receive state stipends, often distributed through the Relief Committee, a government-controlled charitable organization. As a result, nearly one in ten Iranian citizens maintain a regular financial connection to the state.

=== Personal income and poverty ===


Iran is classed as a middle income country and has made significant progress in provision of health and education services in the period covered by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2010, Iran&#x27;s average monthly income was about $500. The GNI per capita in 2012 was $13,000, by PPP. A minimum national wage applies to each sector of activity as defined by the Supreme Labor Council. In 2009 this was about $263 per month ($3,156 per year). 

In 2001, approximately 20% of household consumption was spent on food, 32% on fuel, 12% on health care and 8% on education. In 2015, Iranians had little personal debt. In 2007, seventy percent of Iranians owned their homes.

In 2018–2019, the median household income of Iran was 434,905,000 rials (a bit above $3,300), an 18.6% rise from 2017–2018, when median household income was about 366,700,000 rials. Adjusted for purchasing power parity, Iran&#x27;s 2017–2018 median income was equivalent to about $28,647 (2017 conversion factor, private consumption, LCU). 

As the average Iranian household size is 3.5, this puts median personal income at around $8,185. While Iran rates relatively well on income, median wealth is very low for its income level, on par with Vietnam or Djibouti, indicating a high level of spending. According to SCI, median household spending in 2018 was 393,227,000 rials, or 90.5% of the median household income of 434,905,000 rials.

After the Revolution, the composition of the middle class in Iran did not change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15% of the population in 1979 to more than 32% in 2000. In 2008, the official poverty line in Tehran for 2008 was $9,612. The national average poverty line was $4,932. In 2010, Iran&#x27;s Department of Statistics announced that 10 million Iranians live under the absolute poverty line and 30 million live under the relative poverty line.

=== State of income inequality ===
According the inequality dataset of the world bank, in 2002 the Gini index in Iran was 34.8, a level that is considered to be quite modest. However, closer data analysis reveals significant wealth concentration, with the top 10% of earners holding 52.7% of the national income - a larger share than in the United States or European countries. 

Economic disparity is also evident within the public sector. Many Iranian state employees face significant financial hardship, with salaries as low as $200 per month, however, some Majlis representatives receive monthly salaries ranging from 200 to 250 million tomans (or more than $59,172 according to the exchange rate of January 2024). Additionally, they receive extra bonuses during religious holidays and on “Parliament Day” and “Employee Day,” along with perquisites like Nowruz and Yalda Night snacks.

Inequality is also evident in access to essential services such as water supply. In Tehran impoverished districts struggle with inadequate water provision and hazardous water quality, while affluent areas, housing many of the nation&#x27;s economic elite, including high-ranking government and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officials, are largely unaffected by these shortages.

=== Social security ===
Although Iran does not offer universal social protection, in 1996, the Iranian Center for Statistics estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by social security. Membership of the social security system for all employees is compulsory.

Social security ensures employee protection against unemployment, disease, old age and occupational accidents. In 2003, the government began to consolidate its welfare organizations to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency. In 2003 the minimum standard pension was 50% of the worker&#x27;s earnings but no less than the minimum wage. Iran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs of which more than 50% covered pension costs. Out of the 15,000 homeless in Iran in 2015, 5,000 were women.

Employees between the age of 18 and 65 years are covered by the social security system with financing shared between the employee (7% of salary), the employer (20–23%) and the state, which in turn supplements the employer contribution up to 3%. Social security applies to self-employed workers, who voluntarily contribute between 12% and 18% of income depending on the protection sought. Civil servants, the regular military, law enforcement agencies, and IRGC have their own pension systems.

=== Trade unions ===
Although Iranian workers have a theoretical right to form labor unions, there is no union system in the country. Ostensible worker representation is provided by the Workers&#x27; House, a state-sponsored institution that attempts to challenge some state policies. Guild unions operate locally in most areas, but are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right to strike is generally not respected by the state. Since 1979 strikes have often been met by police action.

A comprehensive law covers labor relations, including hiring of foreign workers. This provides a broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, recognizing written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts. Considered employee-friendly, the labor law makes it difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts (to avoid paying benefits) is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offense. Labor disputes are settled by a special labor council, which usually rules in favor of the employee.

== Sectors ==
=== Agriculture and foodstuffs ===


Agriculture contributes 9.5% to the gross domestic product and employs 17% of the labor force. About 9% of Iran&#x27;s land is arable, with the main food-producing areas located in the Caspian region and in northwestern valleys. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while others require irrigation.
Primitive farming methods, overworked and under-fertilized soil, poor seed and water scarcity are the principal obstacles to increased production. About one third of total cultivated land is irrigated. Construction of multipurpose dams and reservoirs along rivers in the Zagros and Alborz mountains have increased the amount of water available for irrigation. Agricultural production is increasing as a result of modernization, mechanization, improvements to crops and livestock as well as land redistribution programs.

Wheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest. Rice is the major crop in the Caspian region. Other crops include barley, corn, cotton, sugar beets, tea, hemp, tobacco, fruits, potatoes, legumes (beans and lentils), vegetables, fodder plants (alfalfa and clover), almonds, walnuts and spices including cumin and sumac. Iran is the world&#x27;s largest producer of saffron, pistachios, honey, berberis and berries and the second largest date producer. Meat and dairy products include lamb, goat meat, beef, poultry, milk, eggs, butter, and cheese.

Non-food products include wool, leather, and silk. Forestry products from the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are economically important. Tree-cutting is strictly controlled by the government, which also runs a reforestation program. Rivers drain into the Caspian Sea and are fished for salmon, carp, trout, pike, and sturgeon that produce caviar, of which Iran is the largest producer.

Since the 1979 revolution, commercial farming has replaced subsistence farming as the dominant mode of agricultural production. By 1997, the gross value reached $25 billion. Iran is 90% self-sufficient in essential agricultural products, although limited rice production leads to substantial imports. In 2007 Iran reached self-sufficiency in wheat production and for the first time became a net wheat exporter. By 2003, a quarter of Iran&#x27;s non-oil exports were of agricultural products, including fresh and dried fruits, nuts, animal hides, processed foods, and spices. Iran exported $736 million worth of foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000 tonnes) in 2010. A total of 12,198 entities are engaged in the Iranian food industry, or 12% of all entities in the industry sector. The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or 16.1% of the
entire industry sector&#x27;s workforce.

=== Manufacturing ===
Large-scale factory manufacturing began in the 1920s. During the Iran–Iraq War, Iraq bombed many of Iran&#x27;s petrochemical plants, damaging the large oil refinery at Abadan bringing production to a halt. Reconstruction began in 1988 and production resumed in 1993. In spite of the war, many small factories sprang up to produce import-substitution goods and materials needed by the military.

Iran&#x27;s major manufactured products are petrochemicals, steel and copper products. Other important manufactures include automobiles, home and electric appliances, telecommunications equipment, cement and industrial machinery. Iran operates the largest operational population of industrial robots in West Asia. Other products include paper, rubber products, processed foods, leather products and pharmaceuticals. In 2000, textile mills, using domestic cotton and wool such as &quot;Tehran Patou&quot; and &quot;Iran Termeh&quot; employed around 400,000 people around Tehran, Isfahan and along the Caspian coast.

A 2003 report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identified the following impediments to industrial development:
* Lack of monitoring institutions;
* Inefficient banking system;
* Insufficient research &amp; development;
* Shortage of managerial skills;
* Corruption;
* Inefficient taxation;
* Socio-cultural apprehensions;
* Absence of social learning loops;
* Shortcomings in international market awareness necessary for global competition;
* Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures;
* Shortage of skilled labor;
* Lack of intellectual property protection;
* Inadequate social capital, social responsibility and socio-cultural values.

Despite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and technological fields, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace, defense, and heavy industry. Even in the face of economic sanctions, Iran is emerging as an industrialized country.

==== Handicrafts ====
Iran has a long tradition of producing artisanal goods including Persian carpets, ceramics, copperware, brassware, glass, leather goods, textiles and wooden artifacts. The country&#x27;s carpet-weaving tradition dates from pre-Islamic times and remains an important industry contributing substantial amounts to rural incomes. An estimated 1.2 million weavers in Iran produce carpets for domestic and international export markets. More than $500 million worth of hand-woven carpets are exported each year, accounting for 30% of the 2008 world market. Around 5.2 million people work in some 250 handicraft fields and contribute 3% of GDP.

==== Automobile manufacturing ====

As of 2001, 13 public and privately owned automakers within Iran, led by Iran Khodro and Saipa that accounted for 94% of domestic production. Iran Khodro&#x27;s Paykan, replaced by the Samand in 2005, is the predominant brand. With 61% of the 2001 market, Khodro was the largest player, whilst Saipa contributed 33% that year. Other car manufacturers, such as the Bahman Group, Kerman Motors, Kish Khodro, Raniran, Traktorsazi, Shahab Khodro and others accounted for the remaining 6%. 

These automakers produce a wide range of vehicles including motorbikes, passenger cars such as Saipa&#x27;s Tiba, vans, mini trucks, medium-sized trucks, heavy trucks, minibuses, large buses and other heavy automobiles used for commercial and private activities in the country. In 2009 Iran ranked fifth in car production growth after China, Taiwan, Romania and India. Iran was the world&#x27;s 12th biggest automaker in 2010 and operates a fleet of 11.5 million cars. Iran produced 1,395,421 cars in 2010, including 35,901 commercial vehicles.

==== Defense industry ====

In 2007 the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated Iran&#x27;s defense budget at $7.31 billion, equivalent to 2.6% of GDP or $102 per capita, ranking it 25th internationally. The country&#x27;s defense industry manufactures many types of arms and equipment. Since 1992, Iran&#x27;s Defense Industries Organization (DIO) has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, radar systems, guided missile destroyers, military vessels, submarines and fighter planes. In 2006 Iran exported weapons to 57 countries, including NATO members, and exports reached $100 million. It has also developed a sophisticated mobile air defense system dubbed as Bavar 373.

==== Construction and real estate ====
Until the early 1950s construction remained in the hands of small domestic companies. Increased income from oil and gas and easy credit triggered a building boom that attracted international construction firms to the country. This growth continued until the mid-1970s when a sharp rise in inflation and a credit squeeze collapsed the boom. The construction industry had revived somewhat by the mid-1980s, although housing shortages and speculation remained serious problems, especially in large urban centers. As of January 2011, the banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan, had loaned up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing scheme. Construction is one of the most important sectors accounting for 20–50% of total private investment in urban areas and was one of the prime investment targets of well-off Iranians.

Annual turnover amounted to $38.4 billion in 2005 and $32.8 billion in 2011. Because of poor construction quality, many buildings need seismic reinforcement or renovation. Iran has a large dam building industry.

==== Mines and metals ====

Mineral production contributed 0.6% of the country&#x27;s GDP in 2011, a figure that increases to 4% when mining-related industries are included. Gating factors include poor infrastructure, legal barriers, exploration difficulties, and government control over all resources. Iran is ranked among the world&#x27;s 15 major mineral-rich countries.

Although the petroleum industry provides the majority of revenue, about 75% of all mining sector employees work in mines producing minerals other than oil and natural gas. These include coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, barite, salt, gypsum, molybdenum, strontium, silica, uranium, and gold, the latter of which is mainly a by-product of the Sar Cheshmeh copper complex operation. The mine at Sar Cheshmeh in Kerman Province is home to the world&#x27;s second largest store of copper.
Large iron ore deposits exist in central Iran, near Bafq, Yazd and Kerman. The government owns 90% of all mines and related industries and is seeking foreign investment. The sector accounts for 3% of exports.

In 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gypsum; the 8th largest world producer of molybdenum; the world&#x27;s 8th largest producer of antimony; the 11th largest world producer of iron ore; the 18th largest world producer of sulfur, in addition to being the 21st largest worldwide producer of salt. It was the 13th largest producer in the world of uranium in 2018.

Iran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9 billion short tonnes. By mid-2008, the country produced about 1.3 million short tonnes of coal annually and consumed about 1.5 million short tonnes, making it a net importer. The country plans to increase hard-coal production to 5 million tons in 2012 from 2 million tons in November 2008.

The main steel mills are located in Isfahan and Khuzestan. Iran became self-sufficient in steel in 2009. Aluminum and copper production are projected to hit 245,000 and 383,000 tons respectively by March 2009. Cement production reached 65 million tons in 2009, exporting to 40 countries.

==== Petrochemicals ====

Iran manufactures 60–70% of its equipment domestically, including refineries, oil tankers, drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and exploration instruments.

Based on a fertilizer plant in Shiraz, the world&#x27;s largest ethylene unit, in Asalouyeh, and the completion of other special economic zone projects, Iran&#x27;s exports in petrochemicals reached $5.5 billion in 2007, $9 billion in 2008 and $7.6 billion during the first ten months of the Iranian calendar year 2010. National Petrochemical Company&#x27;s output capacity will increase to over 100 million tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million tpa in 2010 thus becoming the world&#x27; second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran housing some of the world&#x27;s largest chemical complexes.

Major refineries located at Abadan (site of its first refinery), Kermanshah and Tehran failed to meet domestic demand for gasoline in 2009. Iran&#x27;s refining industry requires $15 billion in investment over the period 2007–2012 to become self-sufficient and end gasoline imports. Iran has the fifth cheapest gasoline prices in the world leading to fuel smuggling with neighboring countries.

In November 2019, Iran raised the gasoline prices by 50% and imposed a strict rationing system again, as in 2007. The prices per liter gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, where only 60 liters were permitted to private cars for a month. Besides, oil purchase beyond the limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter. Those prices are still well below target prices set in the subsidy reform plan, however. The policy changes came in effect to the US sanctions, and caused protests across the country. The result of the rationing, a year later, was reduced pollution and wasteful domestic consumption and increase in exports.

=== Services ===
Despite 1990s efforts towards economic liberalization, government spending, including expenditure by quasi-governmental foundations, remains high. Estimates of service sector spending in Iran are regularly more than two-fifths of GDP, much government-related, including military expenditures, government salaries, and social security disbursements. Urbanization contributed to service sector growth. Important service industries include public services (including education), commerce, personal services, professional services and tourism.

The total value of transport and communications is expected to rise to $46 billion in nominal terms by 2013, representing 6.8% of Iran&#x27;s GDP. Projections based on 1996 employment figures compiled for the International Labour Organization suggest that Iran&#x27;s transport and communications sector employed 3.4 million people, or 20.5% of the labor force in 2008.

Iran possesses 10% of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves. Domestic oil and gas along with hydroelectric power facilities provide power. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars per year, much higher than the international norm. Iran recycles 28% of its used oil and gas, whereas some other countries reprocess up to 60%. In 2008 Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity. It is the world&#x27;s third largest consumer of natural gas after United States and Russia. In 2010 Iran completed its first nuclear power plant at Bushehr with Russian assistance.

Iran has been a major oil exporter since 1913. The country&#x27;s major oil fields lie in the central and southwestern parts of the western Zagros mountains. Oil is also found in northern Iran and in the Persian Gulf. In 1978, Iran was the fourth largest oil producer, OPEC&#x27;s second largest oil producer and second largest exporter. Following the 1979 revolution the new government reduced production. A further decline in production occurred as result of damage to oil facilities during the Iraq-Iran war.

Oil production rose in the late 1980s as pipelines were repaired and new Gulf fields exploited. By 2004, annual oil production reached 1.4 billion barrels producing a net profit of $50 billion. Iranian Central Bank data show a declining trend in the share of Iranian exports from oil-products (FY 2006: 84.9%, 2007/2008: 86.5%, 2008/2009: 85.5%, 2009/2010: 79.8%, FY 2010 (first three quarters): 78.9%). Iranian officials estimate that Iran&#x27;s annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once current projects come on stream.

Pipelines move oil from the fields to the refineries and to such exporting ports as Abadan, Bandar-e Mashur and Kharg Island. Since 1997, Iran&#x27;s state-owned oil and gas industry has entered into major exploration and production agreements with foreign consortia. In 2008 the Iranian Oil Bourse (IOB) was inaugurated in Kish Island. The IOB trades petroleum, petrochemicals and gas in various currencies. Trading is primarily in the euro and rial along with other major currencies, not including the US dollar. According to the Petroleum Ministry, Iran plans to invest $500 billion in its oil sector by 2025.

==== Retail and distribution ====
Iran&#x27;s retail industry consists largely of cooperatives (many of them government-sponsored), and independent retailers operating in bazaars. The bulk of food sales occur at street markets with prices set by the Chief Statistics Bureau. Iran has 438,478 small grocery retailers. These are especially popular in cities other than Tehran where the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets is still very limited. More mini-markets and supermarkets are emerging, mostly independent operations. The biggest chainstores are state-owned Etka, Refah, Shahrvand and Hyperstar Market. Electronic commerce in Iran passed the $1 billion mark in 2009.

In 2012, Iranians spent $77 billion on food, $22 billion on clothes and $18.5 billion on outward tourism. In 2015, overall consumer spending and disposable income are projected at $176.4 billion and $287 billion respectively.

==== Healthcare and pharma ====

The constitution entitles Iranians to basic health care. By 2008, 73% of Iranians were covered by the voluntary national health insurance system. Although over 85% of the population use an insurance system to cover their drug expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical production/importation. The total market value of Iran&#x27;s health and medical sector was $24 billion in 2002 and was forecast to rise to $50 billion by 2013. In 2006, 55 pharmaceutical companies in Iran produced 96% (quantitatively) of the medicines for a market worth $1.2 billion. This figure is projected to increase to $3.65 billion by 2013.

==== Tourism and travel ====
Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2009 mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America.

The most popular tourist destinations are Mazandaran, Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz. In the early 2000s the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training. Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003 Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide. According to UNESCO and the deputy head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is rated among the &quot;10 most touristic countries in the world&quot;. Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world.

==== Banking, finance and insurance ====

Government loans and credits are available to industrial and agricultural projects, primarily through banks. Iran&#x27;s unit of currency is the rial which had an average official exchange rate of 9,326 rials to the U.S. dollar in 2007. Rials are exchanged on the unofficial market at a higher rate. In 1979, the government nationalized private banks. The restructured banking system replaced interest on loans with handling fees, in accordance with Islamic law. This system took effect in the mid-1980s.

The banking system consists of a central bank, the Bank Markazi, which issues currency and oversees all state and private banks. Several commercial banks have branches throughout the country. Two development banks exist and a housing bank specializes in home mortgages. The government began to privatize the banking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned banks.

State-owned commercial banks predominantly make loans to the state, &quot;bonyad&quot; enterprises, large-scale private firms and four thousand wealthy/connected individuals. While most Iranians have difficulty obtaining small home loans, 90 individuals secured facilities totaling $8 billion. In 2009, Iran&#x27;s General Inspection Office announced that Iranian banks held some $38 billion of delinquent loans, with capital of only $20 billion.

Foreign transactions with Iran amounted to $150 billion of major contracts between 2000 and 2007, including private and government lines of credit. In 2007, Iran had $62 billion in assets abroad. In 2010, Iran attracted almost $11.9 billion from abroad, of which $3.6 billion was FDI, $7.4 billion was from international commercial bank loans, and around $900 million consisted of loans and projects from international development banks.

As of 2010, the Tehran Stock Exchange traded the shares of more than 330 registered companies. Listed companies were valued at $100 billion in 2011.

Insurance premiums accounted for just under 1% of GDP in 2008, a figure partly attributable to low average income per head. Five state-owned insurance firms dominate the market, four of which are active in commercial insurance. The leading player is the Iran Insurance Company, followed by Asia, Alborz and Dana insurances. In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46% of premiums, followed by health insurance (13%), fire insurance (10%) and life insurance (9.9%).

==== Communications, electronics and IT ====
Broadcast media, including five national radio stations and five national television networks as well as dozens of local radio and television stations are run by the government. In 2008, there were 345 telephone lines and 106 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Personal computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, since when demand for Internet access has increased rapidly. As of 2010, Iran also had the world&#x27;s third largest number of bloggers (2010). 

In 1998, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph &amp; Telephone, later renamed the Ministry of Information &amp; Communication Technology, began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, revenues from the Iranian telecom industry were estimated at $1.2 billion. In 2006, Iran had 1,223 Internet Service Providers (ISPs), all private sector operated. As of 2014, Iran has the largest mobile market in the Middle East, with 83.2 million mobile subscriptions and 8 million smart-phones in 2012.

According to the World Bank, Iran&#x27;s information and communications technology sector had a 1.4% share of GDP in 2008. Around 150,000 people work in this sector, including 20,000 in the software industry. 1,200 IT companies were registered in 2002, 200 in software development. In 2014 software exports stood at $400 million. By the end of 2009, Iran&#x27;s telecom market was the fourth-largest in the Middle East at $9.2 billion and was expected to reach $12.9 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9%.

==== Transport ====

Iran has an extensive paved road system linking most towns and all cities. In 2011, the country had of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2007 there were approximately 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants. Trains operated on of track.

Iran&#x27;s major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran–Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar Anzali and Bandar Torkaman on the Caspian Sea and Khoramshahr and Bandar Imam Khomeini on the Persian Gulf. 

Dozens of cities have passenger and cargo airports. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights. All large cities have bus transit systems and private companies provide intercity bus services. Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Tabriz, Ahvaz and Isfahan are constructing underground railways. More than one million people work in the transportation sector, accounting for 9% of 2008 GDP.

In August 2022, President Ebrahim Raisi&#x27;s cabinet approved a law to import fully assembled foreign cars. His predecessor President Hassan Rouhani, had outlawed such imports in July 2018 due to sanctions imposed on Iran. Regular Iranian citizens were unable to buy safe cars at affordable prices.

== International trade ==
Iran is a founding member of OPEC and the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries. Petroleum constitutes 56% of Iran&#x27;s exports with a value of $60.2 billion in 2018. For the first time, the value of Iran&#x27;s non-oil exports is expected to reach the value of imports at $43 billion in 2011. Pistachios, liquefied propane, methanol (methyl alcohol), hand-woven carpets and automobiles are the major non-oil exports. Copper, cement, leather, textiles, fruits, saffron and caviar are also export items of Iran.

Technical and engineering service exports in FY 2007 were $2.7 billion of which 40% of technical services went to Central Asia and the Caucasus, 30% ($350 million) to Iraq, and close to 20% ($205 million) to Africa.
Iranian firms have developed energy, pipelines, irrigation, dams and power generation in different countries. The country has made non-oil exports a priority by expanding its broad industrial base, educated and motivated workforce and favorable location, which gives it proximity to an estimated market of some 300 million people in Caspian, Persian Gulf and some ECO countries further east.

Total import volume rose by 189% from $13.7 billion in 2000 to $39.7 billion in 2005 and $55.189 billion in 2009. Iran&#x27;s major commercial partners are China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. From 1950 until 1978, the United States was Iran&#x27;s foremost economic and military partner, playing a major role in infrastructure and industry modernization. It is reported that around 80% of machinery and equipment in Iran is of German origin. 
In March 2018, Iran had banned Dollar in trade. In July 2018, France, Germany and the UK agreed to continue trade with Iran without using Dollar as a medium of exchange.

Since the mid-1990s, Iran has increased its economic cooperation with other developing countries in &quot;South–South integration&quot; including Syria, India, China, South Africa, Cuba, and Venezuela. Iran&#x27;s trade with India passed $13 billion in 2007, an 80% increase within a year. Iran is expanding its trade ties with Turkey and Pakistan and shares with its partners the common objective to create a common market in West and Central Asia through ECO.

Since 2003, Iran has increased investment in neighboring countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. In Dubai, UAE, it is estimated that Iranian expatriates handle over 20% of its domestic economy and account for an equal proportion of its population. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than $2 billion home in 2006. Between 2005 and 2009, trade between Dubai and Iran tripled to $12 billion; money invested in the local real estate market and import-export businesses, collectively known as the &quot;Bazaar&quot;, and geared towards providing Iran and other countries with required consumer goods. It is estimated that one third of Iran&#x27;s imported goods and exports are delivered through the black market, underground economy, and illegal jetties, thus damaging the economy.

=== Foreign direct investment ===

In the 1990s and early 2000s, indirect oilfield development agreements were made with foreign firms, including buyback contracts in the oil sector whereby the contractor provided project finance in return for an allocated production share. Operation transferred to National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) after a set number of years, completing the contract.

Unfavorable or complex operating requirements and international sanctions have hindered foreign investment in the country, despite liberalization of relevant regulations in the early 2000s. Iran absorbed $24.3 billion of foreign investment between the Iranian calendar years 1993 and 2007. The EIU estimates that Iran&#x27;s net FDI will rise by 100% between 2010 and 2014.

Foreign investors concentrated their activities in the energy, vehicle manufacture, copper mining, construction, utilities, petrochemicals, clothing, food and beverages, telecom and pharmaceuticals sectors. Iran is a member of the World Bank&#x27;s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. In 2006, the combined net worth of Iranian citizens abroad was about 1.3 trillion dollars.

According to the head of the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), in 2008 Iran ranked 142 among 181 countries in working conditions. Iran stands at number 96 in terms of business start-ups, 165 in obtaining permits, 147 in employment, 147 in asset registration, 84 in obtaining credit, 164 in legal support for investments, 104 in tax payments, 142 in overseas trade, 56 in contract feasibility and 107 in bankruptcy. Firms from over 50 countries invested in Iran between 1992 and 2008, with Asia and Europe the largest participants as shown below:

The economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers, many of whom are young and prefer Western products&quot;. The consumer-goods market is expected to grow by $100 billion by 2020. 

In 2015, Iran was considered &quot;a strong emerging market play&quot; by investment and trading firms. Opening Iran&#x27;s market place to foreign investment could also be a boon to competitive multinational firms operating in a variety of manufacturing and service sectors, worth $600 billion to $800 billion in new investment opportunities over the next decade.

=== World Trade Organization ===


Iran has held observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 2005. Although the United States has consistently blocked its bid to join the organization, observer status came in a goodwill gesture to ease nuclear negotiations between Iran and the international community. With exports of 60 products with revealed comparative advantage, Iran is the 65th &quot;most complex country&quot;.

Should Iran eventually gain membership status in the WTO, among other prerequisites, copyrights will have to be enforced in the country. This will require a major overhaul. The country is hoping to attract billions of dollars&#x27; worth of foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment climate through freer trade. Free trade zones such as Qeshm, Chabahar, and Kish Island are expected to assist in this process. Iran allocated $20 billion in 2010 to loans for the launch of twenty trade centers in other countries.

=== International sanctions ===
See also Economic Recession in Iran
After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately $11 billion of its assets. In 1996, the U.S. Government passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which prohibits U.S. (and non-U.S.) companies from investing and trading with Iran in amounts of more than $20 million annually. Since 2000 exceptions to this restriction have been made for items including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.

Iran&#x27;s nuclear program has been the subject of contention with the West since 2006 over suspicions of its intentions. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against select companies linked to the nuclear program, thus furthering the country&#x27;s economic isolation. Sanctions notably bar nuclear, missile and many military exports to Iran and target investments in oil, gas and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banks, insurance, financial transactions and shipping. 

In 2012, the European Union tightened its own sanctions by joining the three decade-old US oil embargo against Iran. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program that will remove the main sanctions by early 2016. Even though Iran can trade in its own currency some problems subsist mainly due to the fact that it cannot transact in US dollars freely. 

In 2018, the United States government unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA agreement and re-imposed its sanctions on Iran&#x27;s oil sales, petrochemicals, shipping, metals trading and banking transactions.

==== Effects ====
According to U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns, Iran may be losing as much as $60 billion annually in energy investment. Sanctions are making imports 24% more costly on average. In addition, the latest round of sanctions could cost Iran annually $50 billion in lost oil revenues. Iran is increasingly using barter trade because its access to the international dollar payment system has been denied. According to Iranian officials, large-scale withdrawal by international companies represents an &quot;opportunity&quot; for domestic companies to replace them.

The IEA estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000 bpd in September 2012 from 2.2 million bpd at the end of 2011. This fall led to a drop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency, the rial, collapsed. September 2012 output was Iran&#x27;s lowest since 1988.

The economic impacts of sanctions have been severe. Based on research, the sanctions resulted in welfare losses across all income groups in Iran, with wealthier groups suffering greater losses compared to poorer groups. Additionally, income concentration and share within top income groups declined post-sanctions.

According to the U.S. Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl).

According to NIAC, sanctions cost the United States over $175 billion in lost trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities. Between 2010 and 2012, sanctions cost the E.U. states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of lost trade revenue. Germany was hit the hardest, losing between $23.1 and $73.0 billion between 2010–2012, with Italy and France following at $13.6-$42.8 billion and $10.9-$34.2 billion respectively.

GDP growth turned negative in 2013 (−5%). The unofficial unemployment rate was 20% by mid-2012. Oil exports dropped to 1.4 million bpd in 2014 from 2.5 million bpd in 2011. By 2013, Iran had $80 billion in foreign exchange reserves frozen overseas. Automobile production declined 40% between 2011 and 2013. According to the U.S. government in 2015, Iran&#x27;s economy has reached a point where it is &quot;fundamentally incapable of recovery&quot; without a nuclear accommodation with the West.

The tentative rapprochement between Iran and the US, which began in the second half of 2013, has the potential to become a world-changing development, and unleash tremendous geopolitical and economic opportunities, if it is sustained […] if Iran and the US were to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could decline sharply, and Iran could come to be perceived as a promising emerging market in its own right.

In January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the US for Iran&#x27;s declining economy. Following the US pullout from an international nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions, Iran faced the toughest economic situation in 40 years. According to Majlis, this has caused damages estimated between 150 and 200 billion dollars to the Iranian economy.

In August 2024, an Iranian group called IRLeaks attacked Iranian banks. Politico described the attack as the “worst cyberattack” in Iranian history. According to Politico, the Iranian government was forced to pay millions of dollars to IRLeaks in ransom. Politico reported that 20 out of about 29 Iranian credit institutions fell in the attack. The Iranian supreme leader blamed Israel and the United States without mentioning the cyberattack on the banking system. Politico remarked it was plausible Israel or the US were involved because of tensions with Israel as well as the Americans having accused Iran of intervening in the American 2024 elections. Politico also remarked that the group was made of freelance hackers and the attack was likely carried out for monetary gain. TechCentral said the attack was probably carried out by freelance hackers. An Iranian firm paid the hackers no less than $3 million to IRLeaks to stop the attack and retrieve data.

<doc id="64705" wikidata="Q170172" url="?curid=64705" title="Boris Godunov">
<text>Boris Feodorovich Godunov (; ; ) was the &quot;de facto&quot; regent of Russia from 1585 to 1598 and then tsar from 1598 to 1605 following the death of Feodor I, the last of the Rurik dynasty. After the end of Feodor&#x27;s reign, Russia descended into the Time of Troubles.

==Early years==
Boris was the son of Feodor Ivanovich Godunov &quot;Krivoy&quot; (, died c. 1568–1570) and his wife Stepanida Ivanovna. His older brother Vasily died young and without issue. There is a version according to which the Godunovs were descended from the Tatar &quot;murza&quot; Chet, who came to Russia in 1330 during the reign of Ivan Kalita. This version was included in later editions of the 16th-century &quot;Gosudarev Rodoslovets&quot;, but historians have raised doubts about this version of Godunov&#x27;s ancestry due to various chronological and genealogical issues.

Godunov&#x27;s career began at the court of Ivan the Terrible. He is mentioned in 1570 for taking part in the Serpeisk campaign as an archer of the guard. The following year he became an &quot;oprichnik&quot; – a member of Ivan&#x27;s personal guard and secret police. In 1570–1571, Godunov strengthened his position at court by his marriage to Maria Grigorievna Skuratova-Belskaya, the daughter of Malyuta Skuratov-Belskiy, head of the &quot;oprichniki&quot;.

In 1580, Ivan chose Boris Godunov&#x27;s sister Irina Godunova (1557–1603) to be the wife of his second son and eventual heir, Feodor Ivanovich (1557–1598). On this occasion, Godunov was promoted to the rank of boyar. On 15 November 1581, Godunov was present when Ivan murdered his own eldest son, Tsarevich Ivan. Godunov tried to intervene but received blows from the tsar&#x27;s sceptre. The elder Ivan immediately repented, and Godunov rushed to get help for the tsarevich, who died four days later.

==Regency==

Three years later, on his deathbed, Ivan IV appointed a council whose members consisted of Godunov, Feodor Nikitich Romanov, Vasili Shuiski and others to guide his son and successor of Russia Feodor I, who was feeble in both mind and body: &quot;he took refuge from the dangers of the palace in devotion to religion; and though his people called him a saint, they recognized the fact that he lacked the iron to govern men.&quot;

At the time of his death, Ivan also had a three-year-old son, Dmitry Ivanovich (1581–1591), from his seventh and last marriage. This son (and his mother&#x27;s family) had no claim to the throne because the Eastern Orthodox Church only recognized Ivan&#x27;s first three marriages as legitimate. Shortly after Ivan&#x27;s death, the council had both Dmitri and his mother, Maria Nagaya, moved to Uglich, some 120 miles north of Moscow. Dmitri died there in 1591 at the age of ten under suspicious circumstances.

When Dmitri&#x27;s death was announced by the ringing of the church bell, the population of Uglich rose up in order to protest against the suspected assassination, which it believed was commissioned by Boris Godunov. Troops swiftly quelled the rebellion. Godunov ordered the removal of the Uglich bell&#x27;s clapper (the bell&#x27;s &quot;tongue&quot;). He had the offending bell ringer flogged in public and exiled to Siberia along with the townspeople who had not been executed.

An official commission which was headed by Vasili Shuiski was sent to determine the cause of the boy&#x27;s death. The official verdict was that the boy had cut his throat during an epileptic seizure. Ivan&#x27;s widow claimed that her son had been murdered by Godunov&#x27;s agents. Godunov&#x27;s guilt was never established and shortly thereafter, Dmitri&#x27;s mother was forced to take the veil. Dmitry Ivanovich was laid to rest and promptly, though temporarily, forgotten.
At the coronation of Feodor Ivanovich as Tsar Feodor I on 31 May 1584, Boris received honors and riches as a member of the regency council, in which he held the second place during the life of the Tsar&#x27;s uncle Nikita Romanovich. When Nikita died in 1586, Boris had no serious rival for the regency.

A group of other boyars and Dionysius II, Metropolitan of Moscow, conspired to break Boris&#x27;s power by divorcing the Tsar from Godunov&#x27;s childless sister. The attempt proved unsuccessful, and the conspirators were banished or sent to monasteries. After that, Godunov remained supreme in Russia and he corresponded with foreign princes as their equal.

His policy was generally pacific and always prudent. In 1595, he recovered from Sweden some towns lost during the former reign. Five years previously he had defeated a Turkic raid upon Moscow, for which he received the title of &quot;Konyushy&quot;, an obsolete dignity even higher than that of &quot;Boyar&quot;. He supported an anti-Turkish faction in the Crimea and gave the Khan subsidies in his war against the sultan.

Godunov encouraged English merchants to trade with Russia by exempting them from duties. He built towns and fortresses along the north-eastern and south-eastern borders of Russia to keep the Tatar and Finnic tribes in order. These included Samara, Saratov, Voronezh, and Tsaritsyn, as well as other lesser towns. He colonized Siberia with scores of new settlements, including Tobolsk.

During his rule, the Russian Orthodox Church received its patriarchate, placing it on an equal footing with the ancient Eastern churches and freeing it from the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople. This pleased the Tsar, as Feodor took a great interest in church affairs.

In Godunov&#x27;s most important domestic reform, a 1597 decree forbade peasants from transferring land from one landowner to another (which they had been freely able to do each year around Saint George&#x27;s Day in November), thus binding them to the soil. This ordinance aimed to secure revenue, but it led to the institution of serfdom in its most oppressive form. (See also Serfdom in Russia.)

==Reign==

During the first years of his reign, he was both popular and prosperous, and ruled well. He recognized the need for Russia to catch up with the intellectual progress of the West and he did his best to bring about educational and social reforms. He was the first tsar to import foreign teachers on a large scale, the first tsar to send young Russians to be educated abroad, and the first tsar to allow Lutheran churches to be built in Russia. After the Russo–Swedish War (1590–1595), he attempted to gain access to the Baltic Sea and he also attempted to obtain Livonia by diplomatic means. He cultivated friendly relations with the Scandinavians and hoped to take a bride from a foreign royal house, thereby increasing the dignity of his own dynasty. However he declined the personal union proposed to him in 1600 by the diplomatic mission led by Lew Sapieha from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Boris died after a lengthy illness and a stroke on 13/23 April 1605. He left one son, Feodor II, who succeeded him but only ruled Russia for less than a month, until he and Boris&#x27;s widow were murdered by the enemies of the Godunovs in Moscow on 10/20 June 1605. Boris&#x27;s first son, Ivan, was born in 1587 and died in 1588. His daughter, Xenia, was born in 1582. She was engaged to Johann of Schleswig-Holstein, but he died shortly before their planned wedding in October 1602. Xenia was given the name &quot;Olga&quot; upon being forced to take monastic vows at the Voskresensky Monastery in Beloozero and her name is inscribed as &quot;the Nun Olga Borisovna&quot; at the crypt of the Godunovs at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius where she lived from 1606, when she sojourned there to attend the reburial of her father, until her death in 1622. Boris, his wife, and their children are buried together in a mausoleum near the entrance of the Assumption Cathedral at Trinity–St. Sergius Lavra.

==Arts and popular media==
Boris&#x27;s life was dramatised by the founder of Russian literature, Alexander Pushkin, in his play &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (1831), which was inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;. Modest Mussorgsky based his opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; on Pushkin&#x27;s play. Sergei Prokofiev later wrote incidental music for Pushkin&#x27;s drama. In 1997, the score of a 1710 baroque opera based on the reign of Boris by German composer Johann Mattheson was rediscovered in Armenia and returned to Hamburg, Germany. This opera, never performed during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, had its world premiere in 2005 at the Boston Early Music Festival &amp; Exhibition.

Boris was portrayed on BBC Radio 4 by Shaun Dooley in the radio plays &quot;Ivan the Terrible: Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Boris Godunov: Ghosts&quot; written by Mike Walker and which were the first two plays in the first series of &quot;Tsar&quot;. The plays were broadcast on 11 and 18 September 2016.

The 2018 Russian television miniseries Godunov (TV series) is a historical drama based on the lives of the Godunovs with a focus on Boris Godunov (played by Sergey Bezrukov) and lasted for two seasons.

The character Boris Badenov in the cartoon &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; takes his name from a play on Godunov&#x27;s name.

<text>Iran&#x27;s telecommunications industry is almost entirely state-owned, dominated by the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). Fixed-line penetration in 2004 was relatively well-developed by regional standards, standing at 22 lines per 100 people, higher than Egypt with 14 and Saudi Arabia with 15, although behind the UAE with 27. Iran had more than 1 mobile phone per inhabitant by 2012.

Iran has a population of 80 million with some 56% of Iranians under the age of 25. In 2008, there were more than 52,000 rural offices, providing Telecom services to the villages across the country. The number of fixed telephone lines is above 24 million, with penetration factor of 33.66%. In 2012, there were 43 million internet users in Iran, making the country first in the Middle East in terms of number. As of 2020, 70 million Iranians are using high-speed mobile internet.

Iran is among the first five countries which have had a growth rate of over 20 percent and the highest level of development in telecommunications. Iran has been awarded the UNESCO special certificate for providing telecommunication services to rural areas. By the end of 2009, Iran&#x27;s telecommunications market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.

According to the &quot;Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries&quot; (EJISDC), the information and communications technology (ICT) sector had a 1.1–1.3% share of GDP in 2002. About 150,000 people are employed in the ICT sector, including around 20,000 in the software industry. There were 1,200 registered information technology (IT) companies in 2002, 200 of which were involved in software development. Software exports stood around $50 million in 2008. Between 2009 and 2020 the Telecommunications market more than doubled.

==Overview==

The government runs the broadcast media, which includes three national radio stations and two national television networks, as well as dozens of local radio and television stations. In 2000 there were 252 radios, 158 television sets, 219 telephone lines, and 110 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, and since then demand for access to the Internet has increased rapidly. In 1998, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (renamed the Ministry of Information &amp; Communication Technology) began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, the Iranian telecom industry&#x27;s revenues were estimated at $1.2 billion. By the end of 2009, Iran&#x27;s telecommunications market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.

The Fourth Five Year Economic Development Plan has proposed the following key benchmarks for 2010: 36 million fixed lines; 50% penetration rate for mobile phones; establishment of reliable rural ICT connections and 30 million internet users. Given the recent developments of the industry, the objectives are very likely to be achieved.

According to one report, Iran has seen above average growth, specially in mobile subscriber numbers. Mobile data services are available but account for a small proportion of total data consumption in 2014. Some telecom parameters of 2012 &amp; 2014 are as below:

More than 23 million Iranians have access to the Internet and over 45 million own mobile phones (2009/10). Tech-savvy citizens use text messages to communicate with friends and browse the Internet — which the government controls in terms of access and speed — for a multiplicity of purposes. Blogging is also immensely popular.



==Press==
The press in Iran is privately &quot;and&quot; government owned and reflects a diversity of political and social views. A special court has authority to monitor the print media and may suspend publication or revoke the licenses of papers or journals that a jury finds guilty of publishing anti-religious material, slander, or information detrimental to the national interest. Since the late 1990s the court has shut down many pro-reform newspapers and other periodicals. Most Iranian newspapers are published in Persian, but newspapers in English and other languages also exist. The most widely circulated periodicals are based in Tehrān. Popular daily and weekly newspapers include &quot;Ettelaat&quot;, &quot;Kayhan&quot;, &quot;Resalat&quot;, &quot;Iran Daily&quot; and the &quot;Tehran Times&quot; (Iran Daily and Tehran Times are both English-language papers).

==Satellite==
Since the 1970s, there have been a number of proposals for a state-owned communications satellite, called &quot;Zohreh&quot; (en:Venus) from 1993 onwards. The planned satellite would have similar capabilities to a commercially produced Western satellite, while such capabilities are already provided through leases owned by the Iranian telecommunications sector. An agreement was signed between Iran and Russia in 2005 to develop the satellite with a planned launch date of 2007, but the launch has been postponed until at least 2009, set to follow actual construction of the satellite.

==Telephone==
The telephone system is inadequate but being modernized and expanded with the goal of not only improving the efficiency and increasing the volume of the urban service but also bringing telephone service to several thousand villages that are not connected now.

===Domestic===
As a result of heavy investing in the telephone system since 1994, thousands of mobile cellular subscribers are being served; moreover, the technical level of the system has been raised by the installation of thousands of digital switches.

Iran&#x27;s telecommunication network enjoys the highest growth rate in the Middle East. One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989–1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994–1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Iran&#x27;s telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from &quot;voice&quot; mobile-phone and 1/10 from &quot;data&quot; mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business. As of 2010, Iran had about 66 million mobile-phone subscribers covering about 70% of the population. In contrast, about 36% of Iranians had fixed-line phones.

====Landlines====
*24.8 million (2008), with a penetration rate of 34%.
*30.6 million (2017) 

====Mobile phone====

*Mobile: 123.7 million (Jan 2019); 80.85 million (end of 2012 est.); 68 million (Sep. 2011); 35 million (early 2008) and 4.3 million in 2004. The bulk of mobile subscriptions in Iran are made up of prepaid users. As of 2014, 75% of the cell phones in the market were smuggled into the country. Since 2018, mobile registry scheme in Iran has been deployed to combat smuggling of mobile phones. 
**Penetration rate: 91.2% as of September 2011; 130% as of February 2012.
*Smartphone owners: 12 million (2014 est.), 30 million (2015) 47 million (2016), mostly Samsung and Huawei models.
*Short Text Messages: Iranians send 80 million SMS per day (Nov. 2008).

===== Operators =====
Major mobile operators as of 2008: Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI Hamrahe Aval) with 70% market share, MTN Irancell (28%), and Emirates Telecommunications Corp (Etisalat) who won a license for 300 million euros in December 2008. Etisalat has been replaced by an Iranian consortium and operates under the name &quot;RighTel&quot;. The two national operators, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran and MTN Irancell both offer GPRS-based data services. Recently a new LTE mobile broadband service provider called ApTel has started its work in Iran.

As of 2011, major foreign supplier to Iran&#x27;s mobile-phone networks are: Huawei of China along, Telefon AB L.M. and Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia Corp. and Siemens AG. As of 2016, France&#x27;s Orange S.A. and U.K.&#x27;s Vodafone (through &quot;HiWEB.ir&quot;) are also developing mobile IT in Iran.

=====3G network=====
Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat and &quot;Tamin Telecom&quot;, the telecommunications investment arm of Iran&#x27;s social security and pensions department, will gain exclusive rights for two years to offer second- and third-generation services (3G) in Iran (2008). Assuming a minimum network investment of $4 billion, Etisalat can gain about 20 percent to 25% market share over five years of its operations (by 2013). In 2009 it was announced that Etisalat, however, failed to secure the right to be Iran&#x27;s exclusive 3G operator for two years. Later, &quot;Tamin Telecom&quot; announced that, IDRO and &quot;Imam Khomeini Decree Center&quot; have replaced Etisalat because of contractual disagreements. In 2011, Tamin Telecom revealed plans to cover 60 percent of the population with its 2G network and 40 percent with its 3G network by 2014.

=====4G network=====
As of 2020, 4G LTE population coverage in Iran has reached around 90%. The government is preparing regulations for 5G deployment and aims to launch services in the next couple of years.

===International===
As of 2010, international connection services are provided exclusively by Infrastructure Company of Iran, a fully owned subsidiary of TCI. Submarine fiber-optic cable to UAE with access to Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG); Trans Asia Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line runs from Azerbaijan through the northern portion of Iran to Turkmenistan with expansion to Georgia and Azerbaijan; HF radio and microwave radio relay to Turkey, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Syria, Kuwait, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan; satellite earth stations – 13 (9 Intelsat and 4 Inmarsat) (2007)
Apart from Iran-Kuwait submarine communications cable network, Iran is launching an optical fiber channel and a submarine communications cable in the Persian Gulf. The next program is to connect the country with global optical fiber networks from northern and northwestern borders.

==Radio and Television==

*Radio broadcast stations: AM 72, FM 5, shortwave 5 (1998)
*Number of radios: 22 million (2005)
*Television broadcast stations: 29 (plus 450 repeaters) (1997)
*Number of television sets: 15 million (2007 est.)
*Although formally illegal, the use of satellite television receivers in urban areas is widespread. Over 30 percent of Iranians watch satellite channels.

Since 2015, Iran is domestically manufacturing DVB-T 6,000W digital transmitters.

==Internet==
In 1993 Iran became the second country in the Middle East to be connected to the Internet, and since then the government has made significant efforts to improve the nation&#x27;s ICT infrastructure. Iran&#x27;s national Internet connectivity infrastructure is based on two major networks: the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the public data network. The PSTN provides a connection for end-users to Internet service providers (ISPs) over mostly digital lines and supports modem-based connections. The Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI), a subsidiary of TCI, operates the public data network. Iran&#x27;s external Internet links use the basic Internet protocol of TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol) via satellite exclusively. For data lines, copper, fiber, satellite and microwave are the available media, and popular services are high-speed Internet via digital subscriber lines (DSL), high-bandwidth lease lines and satellite. About 33 Iranian cities are connected directly by the Trans-Asia-Europe cable network, or &quot;silk road&quot;, connecting China to Europe. According to the &quot;Statistical Center of Iran&quot;, 13.5 million households (i.e. 55.5% of all Iranians) have access to the internet (2016). Of this number, 7 million households have access to fixed high-speed internet connection, and 10.7 million households have access to wireless high-speed internet. In 2016 64.8% of urban households and 36.1% of rural households had access to computers at their home. As of 2020, mobile broadband coverage had exceeded 91 percent in Iran.

Since 2005 the Iranian government has been developing its &quot;National Information Network&quot; to tighten its control over content as well as increasing speed. The project, which is separate from the World Wide Web, will be completed by 2017. This network will be separated from the rest of the internet, specifically for domestic use. Creating such a network, similar to one used by North Korea would prevent unwanted information from outside of Iran getting into the closed system, such as with an intranet network. Myanmar and Cuba also use similar systems. Iran has announced that all government ministries and state bodies will be available through the secure &quot;national information network&quot; (NIN).

The current internet services will not be replaced by the National Information Network or &quot;Clean Internet&quot; as it is called. In order to protect the privacy of Iranian internet users, a number of non-governmental organizations are currently developing domestic search engines that people can use through the NIN.

Iranian officials have accused U.S.-based technology companies such as Google, Twitter and Microsoft of working in tandem with U.S. authorities to spy on Iranian online trends, search behavior, social networking sites and e-mail. These companies have denied those allegations despite NSA leaks. As of 2013, 90% of all of Internet traffic is being routed to hosts outside the country. Iran said it set a &quot;world record&quot; of 46% in online participation using NIN during the national census in 2016.

Much has been reported on the ways in which NIN aids the government with censorship and controls on the internet. Whilst to date, the existence of the NIN has not resulted in long-term disconnection from the global Internet, in the short-term it has been used by the authorities for this purpose. This was illustrated during the widespread deliberate disruptions to both mobile and networked Internet connections in the midst of nationwide protests in late 2017 and into early 2018. Research by the Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) identified that the authorities had ordered IXPs to intentionally interrupt international traffic while maintaining national connections hosted on the NIN.

Strengthening and driving local users towards local platforms is central to the NIN strategy. This has included efforts to undermine net neutrality, by requiring domestic ISPs to zero-rate domestic platforms, in effect subsidising users’ use of local Internet platforms. These domestic platforms are subject to the close oversight, influence and enforcement powers of the authorities. Pushing users to use these services strengthens the government&#x27;s surveillance and monitoring capabilities and raises concerns for the protection of the right to privacy. These platforms are required to apply Iranian law, including content-based restrictions on content outlined in the Islamic Penal Code, the Press Laws and the Computer Crimes Law. Over-reliance on domestic platforms is therefore likely to have a detrimental effect on the diversity and pluralism of content available on these platforms.

80 percent of modem imports are smuggled to Iran.

===Infrastructure===
Iran has developed (or is in the process of developing) IT/technology parks, infrastructures for local emails, instant messaging (such as &quot;TD Messenger&quot; produced by Tehran Data), domestic search engines (such as Yooz, Parsijoo or &quot;Gorgor.ir&quot;), auction website (e.g. &quot;Esam.ir&quot;), e-commerce (e.g. Digikala), e-government, distance education (e.g. Payame Noor University), social medias (e.g. Cloob or Aparat), a domestic version of the Linux operating system called &quot;Sharif Linux&quot;, bespoke or open source software for web browsing, word processing, spreadsheet and database; accounting and various business/financial and industrial software (e.g. NOSA), security software (e.g. Padvish Antivirus or APA at Shiraz University), and video games.

Iran is also manufacturing key computer, internet and IT components, including a local data center, microprocessors (design only), PCBs, supercomputers, routers (experimental basis), computer monitors, printers, mobile phones, fiber optics and lasers.

As of 2020 there were 7 Internet exchange points built in some Iranian cities. 72 private data centers were connected to them.

===Cyber-security===

Iran is among 5 countries with cyber warfare capabilities according to the Defense Tech institute (US military and security institute).

===Internet service provider|ISPs===
The leading Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI) which belongs to TCI (now privatized) and the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST) are two bodies that act as ISPs. As of 2008, the largest privately owned ISP was Parsnet, which serves only Tehran. The leading ISP with a provincial focus is Isfahan-based Irangate.net. The Neda Rayaneh Institute was the first private ISP in Iran.

Domain names with the &quot;.ir&quot; suffix are assigned by the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics (IPM). DCI maintains the network infrastructure, providing Internet access via the IRANPAK X.25 packet-switching network, which covers most major cities. DCI is the only ISP with a permit for supplying government agencies. DCI supplies both dial-up and leased lines to its users.

By the regulations of Iran, these ISPs should rely on TCI for their bandwidth. Previously serviced by TCI&#x27;s Public Switch Telephone Network, the ISPs have been provided with modern data line capacity through a national IP-based network. With the completion of this new network, Internet services in Iran is expected to improve dramatically.

====Speed and costs====
Iranian internet has an average speed of 2 Mbit/s, about one-tenth of the global average (2014). Hong Kong, the world leader, boasts an average of 72 Mbit/s; the United States ranks 31st, at about 21 Mbit/s. A 2 Mbit/s subscription costs $5 a month, daily traffic is charged at 60¢/GB but traffic is free at night at up to 5 GB per night. Upload speeds are typically 40% of the download speed.People must pay four times price for download and upload using internet than national internet network.

According speedtest.net in 2019, the average landline Internet speed in Iran is 12.84 Mbit/s and the country is ranked 104 among 130 audited countries. The global average speed of landline Internet services is 49.26 Mbit/s. Mobile Internet services is significantly better in Iran compared to landline services, with an average speed of 27.71 Mbit/s — 4 Mbit/s higher than the global average. Iran is ranked 51.

====Broadband Internet access====

As of 2012, 11 private access providers (PAPs) and TCI compete for market share, offering ADSL2+, WiMAX, and other fixed wireless broadband services. Meanwhile, fixed broadband internet connections quadrupled between 2011 and 2015 to 8.3m lines. Iran&#x27;s IP-based &#x27;national data network&#x27; is being developed by Information Technology Company (ITC), which is also a TCI subsidiary. This network covers 210 Iranian cities and has 60,000 high-speed ports to meet the needs of its end users such as business and ISPs (2009). Some actions are being taken to build and optimize infrastructure for provision of broadband services in the next five years and the Regulatory has decided to grant the license of offering WiMAX services to some private companies based on auction and then the license for the 3rd mobile operator.

===Usage===

Full Internet service is available in all major cities and it is very rapidly increasing. Many small towns and even some villages now have full Internet access. The government aims to provide 10% of government and commercial services via the Internet by end-2008 and to equip every school with computers and Internet connections by the same date. The Internet has become an expanding means to accessing information and self-expression among the younger population. Iran is also the world&#x27;s fourth largest country of bloggers with approx. 60,000 Persian blogs although Internet censorship in Iran is amongst the most restrictive and sophisticated in the world. As of 2014, 67.4 percent of Iranian young people (between the ages of 15 and 29) use the internet. 69.3% of Iranian young people reported using anti-internet filtering software to be able to surf through blocked websites. Three-fifths of Iranians use Facebook. Iranians spend an average of nine hours on social media websites every day. according of the government of Iran, the first stage of smart filtering for the internet has been successful and the second stage has been launched in 2015. As of 2016, 40 percent of content used by Iranian Internet citizens are produced in the country.

====Electronic commerce====
Iran&#x27;s electronic commerce was 10,000 billion rials ($1 billion) in March 2009 and growing 60% annually. Online-sales reached $300,000 per day in 2014 with more than 20,000 active online stores with electronics being the most popular sale product. In 2007, Tetra-Tech IT Company announced that using Visa and Mastercard is now possible for online sales and in Iranian e-card terminals at shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies for Iranians and foreign tourists. Saman Bank was the first bank to introduce online banking services in Iran. Since, it has been at the forefront of expansion and enhancement of electronic banking. In 2010, a state-linked technology group (the Rouyesh Technical Centre) established the country&#x27;s first online supermarket.

In 2015, the dollar value of e-commerce reached $17.4 billion. With the new &quot;national information network&quot;, Internet speed has increased drastically. Iran&#x27;s penetration rate of the internet stands at 82.12% (2016), with 19 million people using the internet on their mobile phones. As of 2016, 600 cities in Iran had access to 3G networks and 200 cities had access to 4G Internet. The rate of mobile phone penetration in Iran stands at 94.46%.

Iran is presently implementing a barcode system across the country in order to facilitate e-commerce and tax collection. The executive state organizations, which are the largest buyers of goods in the country, cannot buy and use goods that do not have the &quot;Irancode&quot;.

In 2004 the Majlis adopted the Electronic Commerce Law:
*Articles 62–66 of this law specify that Iran&#x27;s existing intellectual-property laws apply to all electronic transactions.
*Articles 33–49 of the Electronic Commerce Law of 2004 seek to ensure consumer protection in electronic transactions. This legislation ensures the right of consumers to complete disclosure of information by suppliers before, during and after electronic transactions. Also specified are the terms under which contracts for electronic commerce may be broken.
*Article 37 gives consumers seven days to withdraw from any contract without penalty.
*Article 42 stipulates that the protections laid down in this law do not apply to financial services, immovable property, automatic vending machines, transactions over public payphones and auctions.

The Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (2010–15) has set the target of conducting electronically:
* 80 percent of governmental transactions,
* 20 percent of domestic trade
* 30 percent of foreign trade.

==Software development==
According to the &quot;Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries&quot; (EJISDC), the information and communications technology (ICT) sector had a 1.1–1.3% share of GDP in 2002. About 150,000 people are employed in the ICT sector, including around 20,000 in the software industry. There were 1,200 registered information technology (IT) companies in 2002, 200 of which were involved in software development. Software exports stood around $50 million in 2008 and $400 million in 2014.

Iran imports a large part of its software. According to the EJISDC, around 95% of the output of the domestic industry is bespoke development (including translation/adaptation from foreign source) —as opposed to product work—meaning export possibilities are low.
Domestic firms involved in software production include Sena Soft, Dadeh-Pardazi, Iran Argham, Kafa System Information Network, Iran System and Puya. IDRO&#x27;s subsidiaries &quot;Magfa&quot; (Information Technology Development Center) and Iran Info-Tech Development Co. are also leading players in this sector. The largest private computer software producer in Iran is Hamkaran Systems with 7000 customers.

Iran&#x27;s National Foundation for Computer Games unveiled the country&#x27;s first online video game in 2010, capable of supporting up to 5,000 users at the same time.

Although there are no established clusters in Tehran, a major facility, the Tehran Software and Information Technology Park, is planned. &quot;International Development Ireland&quot; was selected as the consultant for the project in mid-2004. There are also plans for a technology park in the free-trade zone on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, which already contains the necessary technological infrastructure.

The government&#x27;s drive to automate manual processes is expected to account for about 70% of demand for software development, but there are also some 15,000 private-sector factories that have software needs. Foreign investment in the sector is minimal, although some links are being developed with the Indian software industry. Poor intellectual property protection in Iran has also hindered the development of Iranian software companies causing a lack of foreign direct investment in this sector.

===Popular apps===
As of 2019, main categories are tools with 12,024 apps published in this group, followed by health and sports (4,368), travel and transportation (2,578), social media (2,227) and shopping (2,072). The most popular Android apps as measured by Cafe Bazaar downloads are:

==Technology start-ups==
Iran is an innovative country with a population of approximately 80 million and 120% mobile penetration. Yet the technology &quot;start-up economy&quot; represents less than 1% of Iran&#x27;s GDP. Since 2012, Iran&#x27;s startup ecosystem has flourished. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, sanctions are also helping spur entrepreneurship in Iran by protecting them from outside competition. Iran has three seed accelerators already (e.g. Avatech and DMOND), a few VCs (e.g. Sarava Pars and Shenasa) and 170 incubators (e.g. MAPS). eCommerce is growing at a rapid speed. The advent of higher Internet speed marks the beginning of a new era for entrepreneurs. Iran Entrepreneurship Association (IEA) is the flagship NGO in the &quot;entrepreneurship revolution&quot; in Iran. TechRasa is the leading online media devoted to the coverage of technology startups. As of 2015, there are almost 180 technology startups companies in Iran, many of them backed by state-run universities (this number does not include 3,000 (non-IT) knowledge based companies also active in Iran). As of 2016, fifty fintech firms are operating in Iran.

Parsijoo and Yooz are 2 domestic search engines with 600,000 and 100,000 hits per day and 120,000 and 60,000 searches per day respectively. Adro is a leading Adtech/Ad exchange start-up (In 2016, publishers had 365 billion impressions through Iranian Ad networks). Cafe Bazaar, with 20 million visits weekly and a market share of 85%, has 25,000 downloadable Iranian and international apps for gaming, social media, messaging and other uses. Iranians developed 70 thousand mobile apps in less than 2 years (2016).

Cloob, the Iranian version of Facebook, has 2.5 million users. Soroush is the messaging application replacing Telegram. Aparat (Owned by &quot;Saba Idea Technology Co&quot;), with a staff of 65, is an Iranian video-sharing platform similar to YouTube, has a following of 5 millions a day and has 22,000 minutes of video uploaded daily. Takhfifan (with 100 employees) and Netbarg are two group buying portals. eSam and Saddarsad are similar to eBay. Digikala, an e-commerce platform like Amazon.com with a daily average income of $400,000, ships more than 4,000 orders each day. With a staff of 900 and about 850,000 visitors every day, Digikala was estimated to be worth $150 million in 2014 ($500 million according to the company in 2015, over $1 billion in 2018). As of 2015, 85–90% of Iran&#x27;s e-commerce takes place on Digikala (which has its own courier system throughout Iran). Albasko is another well-known e-commerce platform. Fidibo is the Iranian equivalent of Kindle. With 40,000 orders per month, Maman-Paz is a food delivery service that connects hungry workers with housewives selling home-cooked meals. Its restaurant-based counterpart is ZoodFood. ShopFa, with 2000 active online stores in 2012, is the local version of Shopify. ZarinPal (owned by &quot;SamanSystems&quot;), with 2 million transactions processed in 2012, is the Iranian alternative to PayPal. As of 2015, Taskulu, a task management platform, had over 8000 users from 120 different countries. Hamijoo is a crowdfunding platform. AnjamMidam is an online marketplace for freelance services modeled after Fiverr. Navaak is modeled after Spotify, the online music streaming company. AloPeyk is a delivery service company. Pak Charkh is a bike-sharing app like Germany&#x27;s Nextbike.

Since 2015, many foreign companies are beginning to explore ways to start technology companies in Iran (such as Germany&#x27;s Rocket Internet) or allow their services to become available in the country (such as United States&#x27; Google). For example, &quot;Iran Internet Group&quot;, a joint venture between South African telecom company MTN and Rocket Internet has been launching Iranian versions of eBay (Mozando), Amazon (Bamilo), and Uber (Snapp/previously known as &quot;Taxi Yaab&quot;). Snapp has over 600,000 drivers across Iran and has a valuation potential of $1 billion ($1.4–1.7 billion according to the company in 2018). It carries over 1 million passengers-a-day. Many returning Iranian citizens abroad are also participating in this trend (Iranian Americans in particular).

==Consumer electronics==

The Middle East consumer electronics and technology sector amounts to a $37 billion high (2008), according to a study by the Dubai-based subsidiary of GfK-MEMRB Marketing Services.
The study also predicts that the market will continue riding the wave of growth to hit $39–$40 billion in 2009. Mobile and smartphones make up 41 percent of the entire digital consumer market with sales of $10 billion expected in 2008. It&#x27;s followed by desktop and notebook computers at $5 billion and LCD televisions at $4 billion. The study also reveals the market structure by channel where, in Iran and the UAE, independent retailers still lead with 60-percent share in volume for product categories such as digital cameras, LCD televisions and mobile phones. However, large retailers like Plug-Ins, Emax and Sharaf DG are also making their presence felt by capturing the remaining 40 percent. The digital consumer technology sector is expected to see retail sales in excess of $24 billion by the end of 2008.

Iran’s domestic consumer electronic market, defined as including computing devices, mobile handsets and video audio and gaming products, was estimated at $7.3 billion in 2008 ($8.2 billion in 2010), with 47% market share for computer hardware, 28% Audio/Video and 25% mobile phone (with growing demand for PDAs, smartphones and 3G handsets). Business Monitor International (BMI) forecasts that Iran’s demands for domestic consumer electronic devices will reach $10 billion by 2013 and $16 billion by 2016.

Held once a year, &quot;ELECOMP&quot; is the greatest commercial event in Iran’s market of electronics and computer products and services.

===Computers===

Iran is manufacturing some computer components under license from international companies, predominantly in the area of monitors. Eight Iranian companies are manufacturing monitors under licence of LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Benq, Tatung and CTX. Motherboard, keyboard, mouse, computer case, power supply, CPU, hard drive and printers are other components that are now manufactured locally. Personal computer (PC) ownership in Iran stood at 7.3m in 2005, or 10.5 PCs per 100 people.

Among the leading domestic telecoms equipment manufacturers is the Iran Telephone Manufacturing Company (ITMC), which has licensing agreements with Siemens and Alcatel-Lucent of France. ITMC is owned by TCI (45%), Industry Bank (35%) and Siemens (20%).
Other manufacturers include Iran Communications Industries Incorporated and Parstel—which produces under licence from Daewoo Corporation, a South Korean firm. IDRO&#x27;s Iran Info-Tech Development Co. is producing computers under the brand name &quot;SAHAND&quot;. Overall, ICT hardware sales were estimated to total US$700m a year in 2008.

==Ministry of Information and Communication Technology==

The main functions of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology are laying out and implementing policies pertaining to post and communications in Iran. The Ministry is also in charge of issuing import licenses for certain communication equipment and parts thereof. This ministry was originally named &quot;Ministry of Post, Telegraph &amp; Telephone&quot;.

===Privatization===

Based on Note C of the general policies of the constitution&#x27;s Article 44, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced that it will float the shares of affiliated companies such as Telecommunications Company in the stock market.

Under the general policies of Article 44, telecom companies are categorized in four groups as follows:

*Group One: Among the 30 provincial telecom networks, the fixed telecom networks pertain to those of Tehran, Isfahan, Fars, Hamedan, Ahvaz, Khorasan Razavi, Khuzestan and East Azarbaijan. The first group concerns fixed line telecom networks, including those in the public sector with 30 subsidiary telecom networks in provinces. The non-governmental sector includes companies such as Iraphone, Novin, Zahi Kish, Kouh-e Nour, Montazeran Adlgostar and Pouya Ertebat with each having hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
*Group Two: The second group concerns mobile telephone networks. In the public sector, they include TCI. In the non-governmental sector, they include telecommunications companies such as Omran Kish, Isfahan, Rafsanjan Complex and Irancell. Privatization Organization has forecast that shares of TCI will be floated in the stock market by late September 2007.
*Group Three: There is only one public network in the data network sector, namely Data and Telecommunications Company of Iran which is considered a basic telecom network in terms of mobile networks and Shomal IT Company. In the non-governmental sector, there are over 100 companies with a shared data network.
*Group Four: The subsidiary telecom network named Subsidiary Telecommunications Company is another basic telecom network. They are completely owned by the state and not targeted for privatization.

TCI&#x27;s Infrastructure Telecom Company will be detached from it and it would continue its activities as a part of the ICT Ministry. 33 companies in the telecom sector are to be privatized by September 2007. This happened simultaneously with the launch of MTN Irancell, a private second carrier with foreign ownership. The privatization and introduction of a second operator has created a significantly more competitive environment which has led to significant cost reductions for mobile owners and service benefits.

====2009 – IPO====
In 2009, 51% of the shares of TCI was sold to Mobin Trust Consortium, a consortium which some media claimed it was affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for the sum of $7.8 billion.

====Other ICP/ISP IPOs====
In late 2011, Iranian ICP/ISP Afranet (Symbol in Tehran Stock Exchange: AFRZ1) went public. As of 2012, there is no other ICP/ISP companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange.

<text>Iran has a long paved road system linking most of its towns and all of its cities. In 2011 the country had of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2008 there were nearly 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants.

Trains operate on 11,106 km (6,942 mi) of railroad track. The country&#x27;s major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed throughout the country by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran–Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to the railroad system of Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar e-Anzali and Bandar e-Torkeman on the Caspian Sea and Khorramshahr and Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni on the Persian Gulf.

Dozens of cities have airports that serve passenger and cargo planes. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights.

Transport in Iran is inexpensive because of the government&#x27;s subsidization of the price of gasoline. The downside is a huge draw on government coffers, economic inefficiency because of highly wasteful consumption patterns, contraband with neighboring countries and air pollution. In 2008, more than one million people worked in the transportation sector, accounting for 9% of GDP.

== Ministry of Road and Transportation ==

The Ministry of Roads and Transportation is in charge of studying and deciding pricing policy of the transportation; as well as issuing licenses for the establishment of transportation firms. In addition, the Ministry is in charge of implementing comprehensive and integrated transportation policies in Iran. As of 2016, plans for foreign direct investment in the transport sector include over 5,600 km of highways, 745 km of freeways, and close to 3,000 km of main roads. These projects and others are worth $25 billion (not including aircraft purchases worth another $50 billion). Iran says it needs more than $40 billion to complete 258 major unfinished transportation projects (2016).

== Railways ==


*Total: 11,106 km Plan to increase total railways length from 13,500 km in 2016 to 20,000 km by 2025.
**Standard gauge: 8,273 km of gauge (146 km electrified) (2006)
**Broad gauge: 94 km of gauge (connected to Pakistan Railways)
Electrified railway is 146 km from Tabriz to Jolfa and the tender for electrification of Tehran–Mashhad has been finished according to Railway electrification in Iran.
Note: Broad-gauge track is employed at the borders with Azerbaijan Republic and Turkmenistan which have broad gauge rail systems; 41 km of the standard gauge, electrified track is in suburban service at Tehran (2007).

The majority of transport in Iran is road-based. The government plans to transport 3.5% of the passenger volume and 8.5% of the freight volume by rail. Extensive electrification is planned. According to the Ministry of R&amp;T,The railway network expands by about 500 km per year.

=== Railway links with adjacent countries ===
In December 2014, a rail line from Iran opened to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The opening of the line marks the first direct rail link between Iran, Kazakhstan and China and upon completion direct rail transport between China and Europe (while avoiding Russia) will be possible.
* Afghanistan – completed in 2020.
* Azerbaijan – break-of-gauge / (Only to Nakhichevan, planned link to Azerbaijan proper for building Russia-Iran corridor)
* Armenia – planned – break of gauge /
* Iraq – part under construction, part planned.
** one long link from Arak via Kermanshah to Baghdad
** one short link of about 50 km links Khorramshahr to Basra and is due for completion in 2006.
* Pakistan – break-of-gauge / - missing link from Bam to Zahedan completed 2009.
* Turkey – via Lake Van – train ferry - 
* Turkmenistan – break-of-gauge /

=== Couplings, brakes and electrification ===
* Couplers – SA3 and buffers
* Brakes – air
* Electrification – 25 kV AC

== Rapid transit ==


=== Tehran Metro ===

== Roadways and automobiles ==

*Total: 172,927 km (2006)
:*Paved: 125,908 km (includes 1,429 km of expressways)
:*Unpaved: 47,019 km

Note: There were more than 11 million vehicles in Iran by 2010 mostly manufactured or assembled locally. As of 2015, 34,000 km of roads provided essential corridors of transportation, while 45,000 km of major roads and 100,000 km of roads connecting villages and rural areas have seen no maintenance and upkeep practices (worth a total of $57 billion). As of 2020, cycling hold less than 1% share of urban transport in Iran.

=== Road accidents ===

Iran ranks 23rd worldwide in traffic deaths per 100,000 population per year, with a rate of 24.3, half the rate of the worst country, Eritrea. Iran ranks first worldwide in terms of having the largest number of road accidents with 38,000 deaths and injuries per year. Other sources place the total number of fatalities at 100,000 over the past 6 years or 20,000 per year on average (2008).

Transport officials say 46.8 percent of car accidents take place in cities, 21.5 percent outside, 19.5 percent on rural routes, 4.2 percent on urban highways and 4.2 percent on suburban highways. Pedestrians account for 45% of traffic deaths in Tehran.

The high death tolls in car accidents are blamed on high speed, unsafe vehicles, widespread disregard of traffic laws and inadequate emergency services.

Motorcycles account for 50 percent of sound pollution in Tehran and 40-45 percent of accidents.

== Waterways ==

There are no major rivers in Iran. Just Karun is navigable which &quot;shallow-draft boats can negotiate from Khorramshahr to Ahvaz, a distance of about 180 km (110 mi)&quot;. The Shatt al-Arab is usually navigable by maritime traffic for about 130 km; channel has been dredged to 3 m and is in use.

*Iran is currently undergoing negotiations with neighboring Pakistan for the construction of an oil and gas pipeline to that country to help integrate their respective economies and solve the energy shortage being faced by Pakistan.

== Ports and harbours ==


The capacity of container loading and unloading in the country&#x27;s ports is currently at 4.4 million which will increase to 7 million by the end of 2015. Port capacity will increase to 200 million tons in 2015 from 150 million tons in 2010.

All Iranian ports are supervised by the &#x27;PMO&#x27;, i.e. the &#x27;Port &amp; Maritime Organization&#x27;, which is part of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development.

* &quot;All ports:&quot; Abadan (largely destroyed in fighting during 1980–1988 war), Ahvaz, Bandar Abbas, Bandar-e Anzali (Caspian Sea), Bushehr, Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni, Bandar-e Lengeh, Bandar-e Mahshahr, Bandar-e Torkaman (Caspian Sea), Chabahar (Bandar-e Beheshti), Kharg Island, Lavan Island, Sirri Island, Khorramshahr (limited operation since November 1992), Noshahr (Caspian Sea), Arvand Kenar, Chabahar Port.
** &quot;Main:&quot; Bandar-e Eman Khomeyni, Assaluyeh (Bushehr), Bandar Abbas, Chabahar Port. 
Bandar Abbas, with capacity of 2.5 million TEU in 2010 and 3.3 million TEU in 2016, is in southern-central Iran and handles 90% of the country&#x27;s container throughput. Bandar Abbas is run by the &quot;Shaheed Rajaee&quot; Port Authority.

Chabahar Port, the southernmost Iranian port, on the Gulf of Oman, a couple dozen kilometers from the Iran - Pakistan border, is being recently expanded and developed partly with Indian public funding, and in connection with the INSTC North-South overland transportation corridor linking Iran with Afghanistan, the Caucasus countries, Turkey and Russia.

** &quot;Major Export Terminals (loading capacity):&quot; Kharg Island , Lavan Island , Neka (Caspian Sea) , Assaluyeh gas liquids, Kish Island, Abadan, Bandar-e Eman Khomeyni) and Bandar Mahshahr (latter 2 close-by ports are used mostly by NPC for petrochemicals export).
*** &quot;Major Oil/Gas Ports:&quot;
**** Kharg Island: is the largest and main export terminal in Iran. Roughly 90% of Iran&#x27;s exports are sent via Kharg. Kharg&#x27;s loading system has a capacity of 5.0 million bbl/d. The terminal processes all onshore production (the Iranian Heavy and Iranian Light Blends) and offshore production from the Froozan field (the Froozan Blend). The Kharg terminal includes the main T-jetty, the Sea Island that is located on the west side of Kharg, and the Dariush terminal to the south. Kharg Island relies on storage to ensure even operations, and its current storage capacity is expected to increase to 28 million barrels of oil in 2014.
**** Lavan Island, mostly handles exports of the Lavan Blend sourced from offshore fields. Lavan is Iran&#x27;s highest-quality export grade and one of Iran&#x27;s smallest streams. Lavan&#x27;s production averaged less than 100,000 bbl/d in 2013, but the Lavan facilities have the capacity to process 200,000 bbl/d of crude oil. Lavan has a two-berth jetty, which can accommodate vessels up to 250,000 deadweight tons. Lavan&#x27;s storage capacity is 5.5 million barrels.
**** Sirri Island: serves as a loading port for the Sirri Blend that is produced in the offshore fields of the same name. The Sirri terminal includes a loading platform equipped with four loading arms that can load tankers from 80,000 to 330,000 deadweight tons. Its storage capacity is 4.5 million barrels.

Bandar Abbas, contributing 40.8% of transit operations, was considered the most dynamic in terms of transiting cargo. It was followed by Bazargan (16.6 percent), Sarakhs (14.1 percent), Bandar Anzali (9.2 percent) and Pileh-Savar (3.9 percent).

==== Economics ====

* Every ton of transit cargo earns $150 for the country and creates 40 jobs. Iran will earn a revenue of US$12 billion when the volume of goods transported through the country reaches 40 million tons annually.

=== TRACECA ===

In September 2009, Iran formally joined the Transport Corridor Europe – Caucasus – Asia (TRACECA) programme, also known as the &quot;new Silk Road.&quot; TRACECA was founded in 1998 with the aim of promoting economic relations, trade and transport communications between Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. This programme consists of the EU and 14 member states (including Iran) from Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Iran&#x27;s strategic location means that it is a key transport corridor between Europe and Central Asia.

In August 2010, Iran declared that it &quot;did not sign on to TRACECA project&quot; and said it has been fostering improved transport links through a series of bilateral agreements with neighboring states instead. According to Iran&#x27;s first Vice-President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi &quot;If all the potential of the country&#x27;s transit sector is tapped, it can bring in as much revenues as [the] oil [industry]&quot;. He also announced that Iran will join China and Europe by rail in the near future.
