<text>The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and United States Navy (USN) landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during World War II. The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the island with its two airfields: South Field and Central Field.

The Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and of tunnels. The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle. The five-week battle saw some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War.

Unique among Pacific War Marine battles, total American casualties exceeded those of the Japanese, with a ratio of three American casualties for every two Japanese. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some of whom were captured only because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled. Most of the remainder were killed in action, but it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within various cave systems on the island after most major fighting ended, until they eventually succumbed to their injuries or surrendered weeks later.

The invasion of Iwo Jima was controversial, with retired Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt stating that the island was useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base. The Japanese continued to maintain early-warning radar capabilities on Rota island, which was never invaded by American forces. Experiences with previous Pacific island battles suggested that the island would be well-defended and result in significant casualties. The lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for American forces in the Battle of Okinawa two months later, as well as for the planned invasion of the Japanese homeland.

Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag at the summit of the Mount Suribachi by six U.S. Marines became a famous image of the battle and the American war effort in the Pacific.

==Background==

After the American capture of the Marshall Islands and the air attacks against the Japanese fortress island of Truk Atoll in the Carolines in January 1944, Japanese military leaders reevaluated their strategic position. All indications pointed to an American drive toward the Mariana Islands and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, from there to Japan via the Volcano Islands, and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the Palau Islands to the Philippines.

In March 1944, the Japanese 31st Army, commanded by General Hideyoshi Obata, was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that an army-sized unit in Imperial Japanese military doctrine was about the size of an American, British Army, or Canadian Army corps. The Japanese Army had many armies, but the U.S. Army had only ten at its peak, with the 4th Army, the 6th Army, the 8th Army, and the 10th Army being in the Pacific Theater. The 10th Army only saw action at the end of the Pacific war, landing on Okinawa in the spring of 1945.)

The commander of the Japanese garrison on Chichi Jima was placed nominally in command of IJA and IJN units in the Volcano Islands. After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas began to hit mainland Japan as part of Operation Scavenger. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to the Home Islands, allowing Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.

After the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of Kwajalein and Eniwetok in February 1944, Japanese reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at Yokosuka and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the Japanese home islands, the army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men. The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were concerned that the loss of those islands would further facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands, disrupt war manufacturing, and severely damage civilian morale.

The final Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were hamstrung by several factors:

# The Combined Fleet had lost almost all of its striking power during naval engagements in the latter half of 1944, and could not interdict American landings.
# Aircraft losses in 1944 had been so severe that even if war production was not affected by American air attacks, the combined Japanese air strength was not expected to increase to 3,000 warplanes until March or April 1945.
# Those aircraft could not be used from bases in the home islands to support the defense of Iwo Jima because their range was not more than .
# Available warplanes had to be hoarded to defend Taiwan and the home islands from any attack.
# There was a serious shortage of properly trained and experienced Japanese pilots because such large numbers of pilots and crewmen had perished fighting over the Solomon Islands in 1942 and during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944.

In a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:

After the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines, the Allies were left with a two-month lull in their offensive operations before the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima was considered strategically important since it provided an air base for Japanese fighter planes to intercept long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers flying to strike targets in Japan. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage intermittent air attacks on the Mariana Islands from November 1944 to January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate those problems. The island&#x27;s airfield would also support P-51 Mustang fighters, which could escort and protect bombers en route to Japan.

American intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima, and the operation was codenamed Operation Detachment.

==Planning and preparation==
===Japanese preparations===

In June 1944, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that if the Americans decided to land on Iwo Jima, his garrison could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces so that the United States, and its Australian and British allies, might reconsider carrying out an invasion of the Japanese home islands.

Drawing inspiration from Japanese defensive tactics used in the Battle of Peleliu, Kuribayashi designed a defensive strategy that broke with traditional Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to contest the landings directly, he instead opted for defenses in depth. Kuribayashi&#x27;s troops constructed a complex system of mutually-supporting fortifications, often linked together by a vast tunnel system, equipped with heavy machine guns and artillery. Takeichi Nishi&#x27;s armored tanks were camouflaged and utilized as static artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking Mount Suribachi to the rest of the island was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around the mountain as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment prompted the creation of an extensive network of tunnels connecting otherwise disparate fighting positions, so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be reoccupied later. This network of bunkers and pillboxes strongly favored the defense, and was designed for protracted resistance. For instance, the Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water, and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet underground, and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately five hundred 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were stored inside the complex. Gasoline-powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.

By the time the Americans invaded on 19 February 1945, of a planned of tunnels had been dug. Besides the Nanpo Bunker, there were numerous other command centers and barracks that were 75 feet below ground. Tunnels allowed for troops to move undetected between various defensive positions. Hundreds of hidden artillery and mortar positions were placed all over the island, and many areas were extensively mined. Among the Japanese weapons were 320 mm spigot mortars and a variety of explosive rockets. Nonetheless, the Japanese supply situation was inadequate. Troops were supplied 60% of the ammunition normally considered sufficient for single engagement by one division, and food for no more than four months.

Numerous Japanese sniper nests and camouflaged machine gun positions were set up. Kuribayashi engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots to use against the enemy fleet; their attacks during the battle killed 318 American sailors. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi&#x27;s superiors on Honshu ordered him to erect some beach defenses.

Starting on 15 June 1944, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Air Forces began shore bombardment and air raids against Iwo Jima, which would become the longest and most intense preliminary bombardments in the Pacific Theater. They consisted of a combination of naval artillery attacks and aerial bombings, which would last for nine months. Unaware of Kuribayashi&#x27;s tunnel defense system, some American planners assumed that most of the Japanese garrison had been killed by the constant bombing raids.

On 17 February 1945 the destroyer escort deployed Underwater Demolition Team 15 (UDT-15) onto Iwo Jima&#x27;s Blue Beach for reconnaissance. They were spotted by Japanese infantry and fired upon, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, &quot;Blessman&quot; was hit with a bomb by Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of the UDT.

===Pre-landing bombardment===

Major General Harry Schmidt, commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy bombardment of the island immediately preceding his planned amphibious assault. However, Rear Admiral William H. P. Blandy, commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), believed that such a bombardment would not allow him time to replenish his ships&#x27; ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt&#x27;s request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and insisted upon a three-day bombardment. This decision was resented among the Marines in the landing force. After the war, Lieutenant General Holland M. &quot;Howlin&#x27; Mad&quot; Smith, commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt&#x27;s Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that a frequent lack of supporting naval gunfire had cost Marine lives throughout the Allied island-hopping campaign.

Each heavy warship was assigned an area on Iwo Jima to saturate with shells, ultimately covering the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D-3 (three days before the landings) led to uncertain results for that day&#x27;s bombardment. On D-2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When heavy cruiser got within range of Japanese shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit 6 times and suffered 17 dead. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land a UDT were all struck by Japanese fire and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the destroyer was also hit and suffered 7 dead. On D-1, Blandy&#x27;s gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Schmidt summed up his feelings by stating, &quot;We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight.&quot;

The limited bombardment had a questionable impact on the enemy since the Japanese were heavily dug-in and well fortified. The craters left behind by the barrage also provided additional cover for the defenders, while hampering the attackers&#x27; advance. Despite this, many bunkers and caves were destroyed during the bombardment, giving it some limited success. The Japanese had been preparing for this battle since March 1944, which gave them a significant advantage. By the time of the landing, about 450 American ships were located off Iwo Jima, and the battle ultimately involved about 60,000 U.S. Marines and several thousand U.S. Navy Seabees.

==First day – 19 February 1945==
===Amphibious landing===
During the night of 18 February 1945, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s large carrier force, Task Force 58, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, the overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship . Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher&#x27;s powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher&#x27;s fliers did, however, assist the additional surface vessel bombardment that accompanied the launch of the amphibious landing craft toward the island.
Unlike many days during the three-day preliminary bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright. At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Under Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, six Navajo code talkers worked around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six men sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, &quot;Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.&quot;

===Situation on the beaches===
Unfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor severely misjudged the situation that would face Schmidt&#x27;s Marines. The beaches had been described as &quot;excellent,&quot; and the thrust inland was expected to be &quot;easy.&quot; The apparent lack of a vigorous Japanese response to the landings led the Navy to conclude that its bombardment had effectively suppressed the Japanese defenses. The Marines initially began deployment on the beach in good order, but the landings swiftly became congested due to the loose volcanic ash that covered the island. After allowing the Americans to concentrate men and materiel on the beach for just over an hour, throughout which they maintained cohesive fire discipline, the Japanese opened fire. Shortly after 10:00 machine guns, mortars, and heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach.

Furthermore, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with slopes of soft black volcanic ash. This ash allowed for neither secure footing nor the construction of foxholes to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the fragments from Japanese artillery.

The Japanese crews manning the heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened reinforced steel doors shielding their positions in order to fire, and then closed them immediately afterward to prevent counterfire from the Marines and U.S. Navy gunners. This made it exceedingly difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece. To make matters worse for the Americans, most bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system that ran through most of the island, such that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were often reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving underground. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.

&quot;Time-Life&quot; correspondent Robert Sherrod described the landing simply as &quot;a nightmare in hell.&quot;
===Moving off the beaches===
Amtracs, unable to gain traction in the black ash, made no progress up the slopes dominating the beach; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot. Men of Naval Construction Battalions 31 and 133, braving enemy fire, were eventually able to bulldoze roads off of the beach. This allowed the Marines to finally make some progress inland and get off the beach, which had become overcrowded with both men and materiel as follow-on waves of landing craft continued to unload. Casualties on the beach were heavy, with historian Derrick Wright noting &quot;in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine.&quot;

By 11:30, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, the seizure of which had been one of the original American objectives for the first day. The Marines endured a fanatical charge by the over 100 Japanese troops, but were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.

===Crossing the island===
In the left-most sector of the landings, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by Colonel Harry B. &quot;Harry the Horse&quot; Liversedge, the 28th Marines drove across the island at its narrowest width, around , thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.

===Action on the right flank===
The rightmost landing area was dominated by Japanese fortifications located at &quot;the Quarry&quot;. The 25th Marine Regiment conducted a two-pronged attack to neutralize this position. 2nd Lieutenant Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire, described the following experience:

The 25th Marines&#x27; 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men on the island that morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall, only 150 Marines were left in fighting condition, an 83.3% casualty rate.

By the evening of 19 February, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow. Aboard the command ship &quot;USS Eldorado&quot;, Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and was briefed on the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation, Smith remarked: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard.&quot;

==Subsequent combat==

In the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese &quot;banzai&quot; charge during the night. This had been the standard Japanese defense strategy in previous island battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the Battle of Saipan in June 1944. In those attacks, for which the Marines had usually been at least somewhat prepared, the majority of Japanese attackers had been killed and the overall Japanese fighting strength significantly degraded. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these &quot;human wave&quot; attacks by the Japanese infantrymen, considering them a futile waste of resources.
The fighting near the beachhead remained intense, and the American advance was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery. Marines were frequently ambushed by Japanese troops who sprang out of previously-unseen tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses in small groups to attack American foxholes under cover of darkness, and U.S. Navy ships began firing star shells to illuminate the battlefield. Similar to previous battles on Japanese-held islands, on Iwo Jima Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and deceive Marines units; English-speaking IJA troops often yelled &quot;corpsman&quot;, pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure and kill the U.S. Navy medical personnel attached to Marine infantry companies.
The Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders, and turned to flamethrowers and grenades to flush the Japanese troops out of their tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight Sherman M4A3R3 medium tanks equipped with a flamethrower (&quot;Ronson&quot; or &quot;Zippo&quot; tanks), proved highly effective at clearing hardened Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, often requiring Japanese defenders to assault them in the open, where they were vulnerable to the superior numbers and firepower of the Marines.

Close air support was initially provided by fighters from escort carriers off the coast. This shifted over to the 15th Fighter Group, flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares), used to light up the battlefield at night, were initially provided by ships but were later provided by land-based artillery. Navajo code talkers were part of the American ground communications system, along with walkie-talkies and SCR-610 backpack radio sets.

After running out of water, food and most other supplies, Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks for most of the fighting, realized that defeat was imminent.

Marines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun fire and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks. Once the landing area was secured, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the Americans proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.

==Raising the flag on Mount Suribachi==

&quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; is a black and white photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal depicting six Marines from E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, raising a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi on 23 February 1945, which was the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time. The flag raising picture was later used by Felix de Weldon to sculpt the Marine Corps War Memorial which is located adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery since 1954.

Three of the six Marines depicted in the photograph, Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley, were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Surviving flag-raiser Private First Class Ira Hayes, together with Private First Class Rene Gagnon and Navy hospital corpsman Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Second Class John Bradley, became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle. Three subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined: in 1946 and 1947, that Harlon Block was incorrectly identified as Henry Hansen (both were killed six days after the photo was taken); in May and June 2016, that John Bradley was not in the photograph and Private First Class Harold Schultz was; and in 2019, that Rene Gagnon was not in the photograph and Private First Class Harold Keller was.

By the morning of 23 February, Mount Suribachi was effectively cut off above ground from the rest of the island. The Marines knew there was an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies from the 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain&#x27;s north face. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting any contact to the 2/28 Marines commander, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson.

Popular accounts embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo of the flag raising, had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the Marine riflemen expected an ambush, the larger patrol going up afterwards encountered a few defenders once on top and after the flag was raised. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network during shelling, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed.

Johnson called for a reinforced platoon size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, was handed the battalion&#x27;s American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi&#x27;s capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of sniper fire on the way up the mountain. Once the top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found there among the wreckage, and the American flag was attached to the pipe and then raised and planted on top of Mount Suribachi which became the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil. Photographs of the flag and some of the patrol members around it were taken by Marine photographer Louis R. Lowery, the only photographer who had accompanied Schrier&#x27;s patrol up the mountain.

As the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Johnson believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. In the early afternoon, Johnson sent Gagnon, a runner (messenger) from his battalion for E Company, to take a larger flag up the volcano to replace the smaller and less visible flag. The replacement flag was attached to a heavier section of water pipe, and six Marines proceeded to raise it into place as the smaller flag was taken down and delivered to the battalion&#x27;s headquarters down below. It was during this &quot;second&quot; flag-raising that Rosenthal took the photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;. The second flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on 14 March, when at the same time an American flag was officially raised during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post near Mount Suribachi. The official flag raising was ordered by Holland Smith and attended by Erskine and some members of the 3rd Marine Division.

==Northern Iwo Jima==
Despite the loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much more vulnerable to naval artillery fire. The fortifications on the northern section of Iwo Jima were also more impressive than those at the southern end of the island. Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry available for combat. The most arduous task left to the Marines was seizing the Motoyama Plateau, with its distinctive Hill 382 and &quot;Turkey knob&quot;, as well as the area in between, referred to as &quot;the Amphitheater&quot;. These obstacles formed the basis of what came to be known to the Marines as the &quot;meatgrinder&quot;. While these Japanese positions were being reduced on the right flank, American units on the left were clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty.

The Marines&#x27; overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every &quot;penetration seemed to become a disaster&quot; as &quot;units were raked from the flanks, chewed up, and sometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines&quot;. As a result, the fighting bogged down, and American casualties piled up rapidly. Even capturing these points did not guarantee that the captured territory was secure, since a previously cleared fortification could be reoccupied by Japanese troops utilizing the island&#x27;s tunnel system. As such, it was said that &quot;[the Marines] could take these heights at will, and then regret it&quot;.

American troops observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in caves, only to reemerge when Marine units began to advance and lay down devastating fire on them. Over time, the Japanese learned basic American combat tactics, which usually involved laying down a heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, Erskine ordered the 9th Marine Regiment to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage. This was a resounding success, with many Japanese soldiers killed while still asleep. This became a key moment in the capture of Hill 362. The hill held such strategic importance that the Japanese organized a counterattack to retake it the following night. Although Kuribayashi had forbidden the massed infantry charges often used by the Japanese in previous battles in the Pacific, the local IJA commander of the area decided on a &quot;banzai&quot; charge with the optimistic goal of recapturing Mount Suribachi.

On the evening of 8 March, Captain Samaji Inouye and his 1,000 men charged the American lines, inflicting 347 casualties (90 deaths). The Marines counted 784 dead Japanese soldiers the next day. The same day, elements of the 3rd Marine Division reached the northern coast of the island, splitting Kuribayashi&#x27;s defenses in two. There was also a &quot;kamikaze&quot; air attack (the only one of the battle) on the ships anchored at sea on 21 February, which resulted in the sinking of the escort carrier , severe damage to , and slight damage to the escort carrier , an LST, and a transport.

Although the island was declared secure at 18:00 on 16 March (25 days after the landings), the 5th Marine Division still faced Kuribayashi&#x27;s main stronghold, located in a gorge long at the northwestern end of the island. On 21 March, the Marines destroyed the command post in the gorge with four tons of explosives, and on 24 March Marines sealed the remaining caves at the northern tip of the island. However, on the night of 25 March, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack in the vicinity of Airfield No. 2. Army pilots, Seabees, and Marines of the 5th Pioneer Battalion and 28th Marines fought the Japanese force for up to 90 minutes, suffering heavy casualties (53 killed, 120 wounded). Although still a matter of speculation due to conflicting accounts from surviving Japanese veterans, it is possible that Kuribayashi personally led this final assault, which - unlike the loud &quot;banzai&quot; charge of previous battles - was conducted in silence by the Japanese infantrymen. If he did participate in this assault, Kuribayashi would have been the highest ranking Japanese officer to have personally led an attack during World War II. Additionally, this would also be a departure from the normal practice of commanding Japanese officers committing seppuku behind the lines while their subordinates perished in a last-ditch &quot;banzai&quot; charge, as occurred during the battles of Saipan and Okinawa. The island was officially declared secure at 09:00 on 26 March.

Once the island was officially declared secure, the U.S. Army&#x27;s 147th Infantry Regiment was ostensibly there to act as a garrison force, but soon found itself locked in a bitter struggle against thousands of Japanese holdouts engaging in a guerrilla campaign to harass the Americans. Utilizing caves and tunnel systems, the remnants of the Japanese garrison conducted numerous attacks on American forces. For three months, the 147th slogged across the island, using flamethrowers, grenades, and satchel charges to dig out the enemy, ultimately killing some 1,602 Japanese soldiers in small unit actions (along with many others who died in sealed caves) while suffering fifteen men killed in action and another 144 wounded. The Ohioans were also credited with capturing 867 Japanese soldiers; combined with the number of enemy soldiers killed by the regiment, this casualty figure represented over 10% of the original Japanese garrison.

==Flamethrowers==
The United States M2 flamethrower was heavily used in the Pacific. It features two tanks containing fuel and compressed gas respectively, which are combined and ignited to produce a stream of flaming liquid out of the tip.

These flamethrowers were used to kill Japanese holed into pillboxes, buildings and caves. A battalion would assign one flamethrower per platoon with one reserve flamethrower in each group. Flamethrower operators were usually in more danger than regular troops as the short range of their weapon required close combat, and the visibility of the flames on the battlefield made them a prominent target for snipers. Still, they were essential to breaking the dug-in enemy.

For better protection, flamethrowers were mounted on flame tanks, and one battalion commander called these the &quot;best single weapon of the operation.&quot; Prior to Saipan the Marine Corps had left flamethrowing tank development to the Army. They had placed an order with the Army for nine tanks per division. At Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, Colonel Unmacht&#x27;s top secret &quot;Flame Thrower Group&quot; located eight M4A3 Sherman medium tanks to convert for Operation Detachment. His Seabees, from the 117th CB, worked to combine the best features of three different flame units, the Ronson, the Navy model I and the Navy Mk-1, which soon led to the far better CB-H2. The U.S. Army Chemical Corps variously identified these tanks as POA-CWS-H1, (Pacific Ocean Area-Chemical Warfare Section-Hawaii) CWS-POA-H2, CWS-POA-H1 H2, OR CWS-&quot;75&quot;-H1 H2 mechanized flamethrowers. U.S. Marine and U.S. Army observer documents from Iwo Jima refer to them as the CB-Mk-1 or CB-H1. Marines on the lines simply called them the Mark I. The official USMC designation was &quot;M4 A3R5&quot;. The Japanese referred to them as M1 tanks, and it is speculated that they did so because of a poor translation of &quot;MH-1&quot;.

On Iwo Jima the flame tanks all landed on D-day and went into action on D+2, sparingly at first. As the battle progressed, portable flame units wielded on foot sustained casualty rates up to 92%, leaving few troops trained to use the weapon. More and more calls came for the Mark-1 flame tanks, to the point that the Marines became dependent upon them and would hold up their assault until a flame tank was available. Since each tank battalion had only four, they were pooled among units and would dispatch from their respective refueling locations as the battle progressed. Towards the end of the battle, 5th Marine tanks expended between of napalm per day.

==Aftermath==
Japanese holdouts on the island, including two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno&#x27;s men, and , lasted four years without being caught, and finally surrendered on 6 January 1949.

Though ultimately victorious, the American victory at Iwo Jima had been extremely costly. According to the Navy Department Library, &quot;the 36-day assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.&quot; By comparison, the much larger scale 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasting from early April until mid-June 1945 (involving five U.S. Army and two Marine Corps divisions) resulted in over 62,000 U.S. casualties, of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing. Iwo Jima was also the only U.S. Marine battle where the American casualties exceeded those of the Japanese, although Japanese combat deaths numbered three times as many as American KIA. Two U.S. Marines were captured during the battle, neither of whom survived their captivity.
The was sunk during the battle, the last U.S. aircraft carrier sunk in World War II. Twenty Grumman FM-2 Wildcat fighters and 11 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;. The was so severely damaged that she took no part in either combat or transportation duties for the rest of the war, and became a training ship. Thirty-one Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 9 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers were destroyed by the kamikaze attack on &quot;Saratoga&quot;. Because all civilians had been evacuated, there were no civilian casualties on Iwo Jima, unlike at Saipan and Okinawa.
==Strategic importance==

In hindsight, given the number of casualties, the necessity and long-term significance of the island&#x27;s capture to the outcome of the war became a contentious issue and remains disputed. The Marines, who conducted the landings themselves and took the vast majority of the casualties, had not been consulted in the planning of the operation. As early as April 1945, retired Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt stated in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine that the &quot;expenditure of manpower to acquire a small, God-forsaken island, useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base ... [one] wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost.&quot;

The lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945, and influenced American planning for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. For example, on Okinawa, &quot;because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day, it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island&quot;. Additionally, in the planning for a potential invasion of Japan itself, it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima, and later again at Okinawa, had been killed or wounded.

The justification behind Iwo Jima&#x27;s strategic importance to the United States&#x27; war effort revolves around the island&#x27;s role as a landing and refueling site for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts ultimately proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were flown from Iwo Jima. By the time Iwo Jima had been captured, the bombing campaign against Japan had switched from daylight precision bombing to nighttime incendiary attacks, so fighter escorts were of limited utility.

Japanese fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima occasionally attacked U.S. Army Air Force bombers, which were vulnerable en route to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel. However, the impact of Iwo Jima-based Japanese interceptors on the American bombing effort was marginal; in the three months before the invasion, only 11 B-29s had been lost to Japanese aircraft flying out of the Bonin Islands. The Superfortresses largely found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island. Capturing the island neutralized Japanese air attacks on the Marianas, but these attacks were too small to ever seriously threaten American military assets based on Saipan and Tinian.
The Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima possessed radar and was thus able to notify air defenses on the Home Islands of incoming B-29 Superfortresses flying from the Marianas. However, the capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early-warning radar system, which continued to receive information on incoming B-29s from the island of Rota (which was never invaded).

As early as 4 March 1945, while fighting was still taking place, the B-29 &quot;Dinah Might&quot; of the USAAF 9th Bomb Group reported it was low on fuel near the island and requested an emergency landing. Despite enemy fire, the airplane landed on the Allied-controlled section of the island (South Field) without incident and was serviced, refueled and departed.

In all, 2,251 B-29 landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war. Author J. Robert Moskin records that 1,191 fighter escorts and 3,081 strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan. A more recent Air Force study found the contribution of VII Fighter Command, based on Iwo Jima, to be superfluous. Another rationale for capturing the island was to provide a base for shorter-range B-24 Liberator bombers against Japan, but no significant B-24 bombing campaign ever materialized.

Some downed B-29 crewmen were saved by air-sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island, but Iwo Jima was just one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose. As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers, Marine Captain Robert Burrell, then a history instructor at the United States Naval Academy, suggested that only a small proportion of the 2,251 landings were for genuine emergencies, with the vast majority possibly being for minor technical checkups, training, or refueling. According to Burrell,

The &quot;emergency landing&quot; thesis counts every B-29 landing on Iwo Jima as an emergency and asserts that capturing the island saved the lives of the nearly 25,000 crewmen of all 2,251 planes (2,148 B-29 crewmen were killed in combat during the entire war in all theaters). However, of the nearly 2,000 B-29s which landed from May–July 1945, more than 80% were for routine refueling. Several hundred landings were made for training purposes, and most of the remainder were for relatively minor engine maintenance. During June 1945, which saw the largest number of landings, none of the more than 800 B-29s that landed on the island did so because of combat damage. Of the aircraft that would have been lost without being able to land, air-sea rescue figures indicate that 50% of crewmen who ditched at sea survived, so even if Iwo Jima had not been taken the estimate of the supposedly potential 25,000 dead crewmen from airplanes crashing into the ocean should be dwindled down to 12,500.

According to Robert S. Burrell, author of &quot;The Ghosts of Iwo Jima&quot;, the very losses formed the basis for a &quot;reverence for the Marine Corps&quot; that not only embodied the &quot;American national spirit&quot; but ensured the &quot;institutional survival&quot; of the Marine Corps.

==Naval vessels badly damaged==
The following table lists for each ship badly damaged in the Battle of Iwo Jima, the dates they received hits, the cause, the type of ship, and the casualties inflicted during 17–28 February. The carrier , which received light damage, was listed because of the importance of escort carriers in the battle.

==Medal of Honor recipients==
The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Forces who distinguishes himself by &quot;... conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States ...&quot; Because of its nature, the medal is commonly awarded posthumously.

The Medal of Honor was awarded to 22 Marines (12 posthumously), and 5 were presented to sailors, 4 of whom were hospital corpsmen (2 posthumously) attached to Marine infantry units. The medals awarded for the battle accounted for 28% of the 82 awarded to Marines in World War II.

At the time of his death on 29 June 2022, Marine Hershel W. Williams was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from World War II. He received his medal for actions in the Battle of Iwo Jima.

==Legacy==

The Marine Corps Iwo Jima Memorial was dedicated on 10 November 1954 at Arlington National Cemetery.

The United States Navy has commissioned two ships with the name (1961–1993) and (2001–present).

The first large-scale reunion on the island was held in 1970 on the 25th anniversary of the battle. The event was sponsored by the Fifth Marine Division Association and included both American and Japanese veterans of the battle. Other notable attendees included then Brigadier General William K. Jones commander of the 3rd Marine Division and NBC’s senior correspondent in Asia John Rich. The widows of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi and Colonel Takeichi Nishi also attended events with American veterans held in Tokyo.

On 19 February 1985, the 40th anniversary of the landings on Iwo Jima, an event called the &quot;Reunion of Honor&quot; was held (the event has been held annually since 2002). Veterans of both sides who fought in the battle attended the event. The place was the invasion beach where U.S. forces landed. A memorial on which inscriptions were engraved by both sides was built at the center of the meeting place. Japanese attended at the mountain side, where the Japanese inscription was carved, and Americans attended at the shore side, where the English inscription was carved. After unveiling and offering of flowers were made, the representatives of both countries approached the memorial; upon meeting, they shook hands. The combined Japan-U.S. memorial service of the 50th anniversary of the battle was held in front of the monument in February 1995. Further memorial services have been held on later anniversaries.

The importance of the battle to Marines today is demonstrated in pilgrimages made to the island, and specifically the summit of Suribachi. Marines will often leave dog tags, rank insignia, or other tokens at the monuments in homage. Iwo Jima Day is observed annually on 19 February in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a ceremony at the State House.

The Japanese government continues to search for and retrieve the remains of Japanese military personnel who were killed during the battle.

<text>General Antoine Drouot, Comte Drout (11 January 1774 – 24 March 1847) was a French officer who fought in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Drouot is one of a select group who were present at both the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the Battle of Waterloo (1815). Deouot&#x27;s name is inscribed on the western pillar under the Arc de Triomphe.

==Biography==
Born in Nancy, France, the son of a baker, Drouot trained as an artilleryman and took part in the battles of the French Revolution where he rose through the ranks and was a captain of artillery at the Battle of Hohenlinden in 1800.

Later he had an illustrious career in the many battles of the Empire, notably, Wagram (1809) and Borodino (1812). For his conduct at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen in 1813, where he commanded the artillery of the Imperial Guard, he was made a general of division and aide-de-camp to the Emperor Napoleon.

Drouot was with Napoleon during his exile to the island of Elba (1814–1815), who made him governor of the island. He accompanied Napoleon back to France in 1815 and was with him at the start of the Hundred Days. He was with the Imperial Guard for the Waterloo Campaign, and on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo he took command of the Imperial Guard when Marshal Mortier who would generally assume command fell ill with sciatica, He was with Napoleon when at the end of the battle just before the rout when Napoleon briefly took command of a square of grenadier Guards, near Decoster&#x27;s house, and left the field with Napoleon. Later in the campaign (after Napoleon had abdicated for the second time), he was commandant of the Imperial Guard in Paris.

After the surrender of Paris and the restoration of King Louis XVIII, Drouot stood trial for treason in which he defended himself skilfully. He was acquitted and granted a state pension. In his retirement he did what he could for the veterans of the Imperial Guard and died in 1847.

==Assessment==
In his biography in &quot;Nouvelle Biographie Générale&quot; Ch. Héquet wrote &quot;France was astonished in 1814 to learn, that she had possessed for a long time the best officer of artillery in Europe&quot;. Napoleon called Drouot &quot;le Sage de la Grande Armée&quot; (the sage of the Grand Army).

Drouot is one of a select group who were present at both the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the Battle of Waterloo (1815). 

Drouot&#x27;s name is inscribed on the western pillar under the Arc de Triomphe.

<text>Włocławek (; or &quot;Alt Lesle&quot;, Yiddish: וולאָצלאַוועק, romanized: &quot;Vlatzlavek&quot;) is a city in the Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship in central Poland along the Vistula River, bordered by the Gostynin-Włocławek Landscape Park. As of December 2021, the population of the city is 106,928.

Founded in the 9th century, Włocławek is located in the historical region of Kuyavia, and was its administrative center and main city in the Middle Ages. Nowadays, Włocławek is the third largest city of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (after Bydgoszcz and Toruń) and the main cultural and economic center of eastern Kuyavia. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Włocławek, one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, since the 12th century, with the landmark Gothic Włocławek Cathedral listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. Poland&#x27;s largest hydroelectric power plant is also located there.

==History==

Włocławek&#x27;s history dates back to the late Bronze Age – early Iron Age (1300 BCE – 500 BCE). Archaeological excavations conducted on the current city site uncovered the remains of a settlement belonging to the Lusatian culture, as well as evidence of a settlement of early Pomeranian culture which had been established. Traces of additional settlements dating to the Roman period and the early Middle Ages have also been excavated in the area.

===Middle Ages===
The settlement was founded in the 9th century and its early inhabitants were occupied with agriculture and crafts. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under the Piast dynasty. Already under the rule of Bolesław I the Brave it was one of Poland&#x27;s most important administrative centers, as mentioned in the &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; chronicle from the 1110s, which also happens to be the oldest known mention of the city. The name is derived from the Old Polish male name Włodzisław, possibly the founder of Włocławek. In the mid-10th century, under Casimir I the Restorer, Włocławek was the seat of a castellany and the administrative center of Kuyavia.

One of the earliest references to the town came from an assistant to the Archbishop of Gniezno who was noted as residing in the town in 1123. Later the Diocese of Włocławek () of Kuyavia in 1148, notates its existence in a bull issued by Pope Eugene III, while mentioning the first bishop of Włocławek as Warner. Warner was followed by an Italian, Onoldius; the diocese was recorded as &quot;Włocławek and Pomerania&quot; (&quot;Vladislaviensis et Pomeraniae&quot;).

In the 12th century, there was a mint and a customs chamber, where tolls were collected from ships and boats sailing on the Vistula and Zgłowiączka rivers. A hospital was founded at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, whereas the local school was first mentioned in 1215.

Włocławek received its city rights in 1255. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the city was destroyed and captured several times by the Teutonic Knights and renamed it Leslau. The Treaty of Thorn, signed in 1411, resulted in short-lived peace for the city, however, it prospered from its involvement in the ransoming of the captured Teutonic Knights which was payable in three instalments and proved to be a hardship on the Prussian faction. Włocławek was located within the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province. There is a possibility that Nicolaus Copernicus, the later renowned astronomer, may have attended the local cathedral school in the late 15th century.

===Modern era===

The city&#x27;s prosperity came from river transport of grain from Kuyavia, the collection of tolls on grain floated from the more southern part of Poland to the country&#x27;s main port of Gdańsk, transport of timber from the Narew, Bug and upper Vistula rivers for export to Western Europe and brewing. This is mentioned in the 1595 poem &quot;Flis, to jest Spuszczanie statków Wisłą i inszymi rzekami do niej przypadającymi&quot; by Sebastian Klonowic.

In 1569, Bishop Stanisław Karnkowski founded a theological seminary in Włocławek, one of the oldest seminaries in Poland. In 1625, the Reformed Franciscans were brought to Włocławek by Bishop Andrzej Lipski, and soon their Baroque monastery was built.

The city was ravaged by the Swedes during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1657 and by the Russians during the Great Northern War in 1707. In 1790, Polish national hero Tadeusz Kościuszko stayed in Włocławek.

After the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, Włocławek became part of Prussia. It was the site of Polish resistance during the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, when sank Prussian ships with ammunition headed for besieged Warsaw. After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 it became part of the Polish short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. Subsequently, after the Congress of Vienna it became part of Congress Kingdom of Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland in 1815. Polish insurgents operated in the city and in its vicinity during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. The insurgents clashed with Russian troops in Włocławek on November 8, 1863, and February 17, 1864. The oldest Polish theological journal &quot;&quot; has been published in Włocławek since 1909. The city was again destroyed during the battles of German offensive during the First World War.

When Poland declared independence in 1918, local Poles disarmed the Germans and liberated the city. In 1920, Poles successfully defended the city against the invading Soviets during the Polish–Soviet War.

===World War II===

During World War II, Włocławek was occupied by German troops, which entered the city on 14 September 1939. Under the Nazi German occupation Włocławek was again renamed Leslau, annexed by decree to the German Reich on 8 October 1939 and administered from 26 October as a part of Reichsgau Posen (renamed on 29 January 1940 Reichsgau Wartheland).

Already in September 1939, Germans committed a massacre of a group of local Jews and burned both synagogues. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe III&quot; entered the city between September 23 and October 5, 1939, and afterwards carried out mass arrests of local Poles in October and November as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Dozens of Catholic priests from Włocławek, including Auxiliary Bishop of Włocławek Michał Kozal, and lecturers and students of the seminary were arrested, and then deported in January 1940 to the Dachau concentration camp, where most of them were killed. Rector of the local seminary Henryk Kaczorowski and two students Bronisław Kostkowski and Tadeusz Dulny are now considered three of the 108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II by the Catholic Church. Local teachers were arrested in October 1939, and then deported to concentration camps and murdered. In late 1939, the &quot;SS&quot; and &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; burnt down the Grzywno district and murdered many of its inhabitants in the nearby village of Warząchewka Polska. Poles from Włocławek were also massacred in the nearby village of Pińczata. Arrested Polish teachers, landowners and priests from the Włocławek and Lipno counties were also imprisoned in Włocławek, and some were later also deported to concentration camps and murdered.

Families of deported and murdered Poles, as well as the remaining residents of Grzywno were expelled to the so-called General Government in late 1939, and in 1940 also owners of shops, workshops and bigger houses were expelled, so their properties could be handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. The Germans also robbed the precious historical collections of the Diocese of Włocławek and the Baroque Franciscan monastery and closed down the cathedral. The city&#x27;s central square, &quot;Plac Wolności&quot; (&quot;Liberty Square&quot;), was renamed &quot;Adolf-Hitler-Platz&quot; by the Germans. By the time the war ended, nearly the entire Jewish population of more than 10,000 had been murdered.

Włocławek was liberated on 20 January 1945 by Soviet troops of the 1st Belorussian Front during the Vistula–Oder Offensive. One third of the city was destroyed, but its factories and workshops were rebuilt by the Polish government in the following decades.

===Recent period===
The most important industries in Włocławek today are chemical industry, production of furniture, and food processing. The dam which was constructed in 1969 regulates the water level of the Vistula river, forming Włocławek Reservoir. From 1975 to 1999, the city was the capital of the Włocławek Voivodeship.

The Catholic priest Fr. (now Blessed), Jerzy Popiełuszko, who was associated with the workers&#x27; and trade union movement Solidarity, and who was also a member of the opposition to the Communist regime in Poland, was tortured and murdered by three Security Police officers, and was thrown into the Włocławek Reservoir, close to the city. His body was recovered from the reservoir on 30 October 1984.

From 2012 the city is part of the Special Economic Zone - Włocławek Economic Development Area – Industrial and Technological Park with tax-free areas and incentives for investors.

===The Jewish Community in Włocławek===

The Jewish population increased from 218 (6.6%) in 1820 to 6,919 in 1910 (20.5%) and 13,500 in 1939. One of the founders of the Mizracḥi movement, rabbi Leib Kowalski (1895–1925), lived and worked in Włocławek. During the interbellum period, the town had several Jewish schools (primary and high schools), two yeshivas, and three Jewish sports clubs.

With the beginning of the German occupation of Poland, Włocławek became the first town in Europe in which Jews were required to wear distinctive yellow badges. Murders of Jews began in 1939 and the Włocławek ghetto was created in November 1940. The Nazis deported 3,000 of Włocławek&#x27;s Jews to ghettos and labor camps between December 1939 and June 1941. Some 2,000 Jews were deported to Łódź and then to the Chełmno extermination camp between 26 and 30 September 1941. The ghetto was burnt in late April 1942 after the remaining Jews were sent to Chelmno where they were immediately gassed. Most of the Jews sent to the Łódź Ghetto died of starvation or illness, and many were sent to Auschwitz from Łódź.

After the war nearly 1000 Jews returned to Włocławek and re-established their community. However, Jews left after disputes within the community itself, and the desire of most Jews not to live under Communism, installed by the Soviets. By the late 1960s, the community had disappeared.

Today there is only very little, if any trace at all, of their once rich and lively community. There is a table for victims of Jewish ghetto in Włocławek&#x27;s Rakutówek neighborhood (Polish Tablica Ofiar Getta we Włocławku) and Jewish Cemetery at Municipal/Communal Cemetery (Polish Cmentarz Komunalny we Włocławku).

<text>Trinity was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. MWT (11:29:21 GMT) on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project. The test was of an implosion-design plutonium bomb, nicknamed &quot;The Gadget&quot;, of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. Concerns about whether the complex Fat Man design would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The code name &quot;Trinity&quot; was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, possibly inspired by the poetry of John Donne.

The test, both planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge, was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range (renamed the White Sands Proving Ground just before the test). The only structures originally in the immediate vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. Fears of a fizzle prompted construction of &quot;Jumbo&quot;, a steel containment vessel that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered; but ultimately Jumbo was not used in the test. On May 7, 1945, a rehearsal was conducted, during which of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes was detonated.

Some 425 people were present on the weekend of the Trinity test. In addition to Bainbridge and Oppenheimer, observers included Vannevar Bush, James Chadwick, James B. Conant, Thomas Farrell, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Leslie Groves, Frank Oppenheimer, Geoffrey Taylor, Richard Tolman, Edward Teller, and John von Neumann. The Trinity bomb released the explosive energy of ± , and a large cloud of fallout. Thousands of people lived closer to the test than would have been allowed under guidelines adopted for subsequent tests, but no one living near the test was evacuated before or afterward.

The test site was declared a National Historic Landmark district in 1965 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year.

==Background==

The creation of nuclear weapons arose from the scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries about the nature of atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.

These efforts were transferred to the authority of the U.S. Army in June 1942 and became the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. was appointed its director in September. The weapons development portion of this project was located at the Los Alamos Laboratory in northern New Mexico, under the directorship of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The University of Chicago, Columbia University and the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley conducted other development work.

Manhattan Project scientists had identified two fissile isotopes for potential use in bombs: uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Uranium-235 became the basis of the Little Boy bomb design, first used (without prior testing) in the bombing of Hiroshima; the design used in the Trinity test, and eventually used in the bombing of Nagasaki (Fat Man), was based on plutonium. The original design considered for a weapon based on plutonium-239 was Thin Man, in which (as in the Little Boy uranium bomb) two subcritical masses of fissile material would be brought rapidly together to form a single critical mass.

Plutonium is a synthetic element with complicated properties about which little was known at first, as until 1944 it had been produced only in cyclotrons in very pure microgram amounts, whereas a weapon would require kilogram quantities bred in a reactor. In April 1944, Los Alamos physicist Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium produced by the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Clinton Engineer Works contained plutonium-240 as an impurity. Plutonium-240 undergoes spontaneous fission at thousands of times the rate of plutonium-239, and the extra neutrons thereby released made it likely that plutonium in a gun-type fission weapon would detonate too soon after a critical mass was formed, producing a &quot;fizzle&quot;—a nuclear explosion many times smaller than a full explosion. The Thin Man design would therefore not work.

Project scientists then turned to a more technically difficult implosion design. In September 1943, mathematician John von Neumann had proposed surrounding a fissile &quot;core&quot; by two different high explosives which produced shock waves of different speeds. Alternating the faster- and slower-burning explosives in a carefully calculated configuration would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This so-called &quot;explosive lens&quot; focused the shock waves inward with sufficient force to rapidly compress the solid plutonium core to several times its original density. The increase in density caused the core previously subcriticalto become supercritical. At the same time, the shock wave activated a small neutron source at the center of the core, thereby assuring that the chain reaction would begin in earnest immediately at the moment of compression. Such a complicated design required substantial research and experimentation in engineering and hydrodynamics, and in August 1944 the entire Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized to focus on this work.

==Preparation==
===Decision===

The idea of testing the implosion device was brought up in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944 and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had spent a great deal of money and effort to produce the plutonium, and he wanted to know whether there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory&#x27;s Governing Board then directed Norman Ramsey to investigate how this could be done. In February 1944, Ramsey proposed a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.

The means of generating such a controlled reaction were uncertain, and the data obtained would not be as useful as that from a full-scale explosion. Oppenheimer argued that the bomb &quot;must be tested in a range where the energy release is comparable with that contemplated for final use.&quot; In March 1944, he obtained Groves&#x27;s tentative approval for testing a full-scale explosion inside a containment vessel, although Groves was still worried about how he would explain the loss of &quot;a billion dollars worth&quot; of plutonium in the event the test failed.

===Code name===
The origin of the code name &quot;Trinity&quot; for the test is unknown, but it is often attributed to Oppenheimer as a reference to the poetry of John Donne, which in turn references the Christian belief of the Trinity. In 1962, Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, asking if he had chosen it because it was a name common to rivers and peaks in the West and would not attract attention, and elicited this reply:
===Organization===
In March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard University, working under explosives expert George Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge&#x27;s group was known as the E-9 (Explosives Development) Group. Stanley Kershaw, formerly from the National Safety Council, was made responsible for safety. Captain Samuel P. Davalos, the assistant post engineer at Los Alamos, was placed in charge of construction. First Lieutenant Harold C. Bush became commander of the Base Camp at Trinity. Scientists William Penney, Victor Weisskopf and Philip Moon were consultants. Eventually seven subgroups were formed:
* TR-1 (Services) under John H. Williams
* TR-2 (Shock and Blast) under John H. Manley
* TR-3 (Measurements) under Robert R. Wilson
* TR-4 (Meteorology) under J. M. Hubbard
* TR-5 (Spectrographic and Photographic) under Julian E. Mack
* TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) under Bernard Waldman
* TR-7 (Medical) under Louis H. Hempelmann

The E-9 group was renamed the X-2 (Development, Engineering and Tests) Group in the August 1944 reorganization.

===Test site===

Safety and security required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary effects of the blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.

The sites were surveyed by car and by air by Bainbridge, R. W. Henderson, Major W. A. Stevens and Major Peer de Silva. The site finally chosen, after consulting with Major General Uzal Ent, the commander of the Second Air Force on September 7, 1944, lay at the northern end of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, in Socorro County near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio (). The Alamogordo Bombing Range was renamed the White Sands Proving Ground on July 9, 1945, one week before the test. Despite the criterion that the site be isolated, nearly half a million people lived within of the test site; soon after the Trinity test, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s chief medical officer, Colonel Stafford L. Warren, recommended that future tests be conducted at least 150 miles from populated areas.

The only structures in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, about to the southeast. Like the rest of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, it had been acquired by the government in 1942. The patented land had been condemned and grazing rights suspended. Scientists used this as a laboratory for testing bomb components. Bainbridge and Davalos drew up plans for a base camp with accommodation and facilities for 160 personnel, along with the technical infrastructure to support the test. A construction firm from Lubbock, Texas, built the barracks, officers&#x27; quarters, mess hall and other basic facilities. The requirements expanded and by July 1945 250 people worked at the Trinity test site. On the weekend of the test, there were 425 present.
Lieutenant Bush&#x27;s twelve-man MP unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they were repurposed for polo playing, and the MPs resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation and to provide organized games and nightly movies.

Throughout 1945, other personnel arrived at the Trinity Site to help prepare for the bomb test. They tried to use water out of the ranch wells, but found the water so alkaline, it was not drinkable. They were forced to use U.S. Navy saltwater soap and hauled drinking water in from the firehouse in Socorro. Gasoline and diesel were purchased from the Standard Oil plant there. Freshwater was trucked in, per load, from away. Military and civilian construction personnel built warehouses, workshops, a magazine and commissary. The railroad siding at Pope, New Mexico, was upgraded by adding an unloading platform. Roads were built, and of telephone wire were strung. Electricity was supplied by portable generators. Bomb shelters to protect test observers were the most expensive to construct.

Due to its proximity to the bombing range, the base camp was accidentally bombed twice in May. When the lead plane on a practice night raid accidentally knocked out the generator or otherwise doused the lights illuminating their target, they went in search of the lights, and since they had not been informed of the presence of the Trinity base camp, and it was lit, they bombed it instead. The accidental bombing damaged the stables and the carpentry shop, and a small fire resulted.

===Jumbo===

Responsibility for the design of a containment vessel for an unsuccessful explosion, known as &quot;Jumbo&quot;, was assigned to Robert W. Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory&#x27;s X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb&#x27;s detonation was unsuccessful the walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb&#x27;s plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson. They drew up specifications for a steel sphere in diameter, weighing and capable of handling a pressure of . After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, Babcock &amp; Wilcox; they had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.

As delivered in May 1945, Jumbo was in diameter and long with walls thick, and weighed . A special train brought it from the Babcock &amp; Wilcox plant in Barberton, Ohio, to the siding at Pope, where it was loaded on a large trailer and towed across the desert by crawler tractors. At the time, it was the heaviest item ever shipped by rail.
For many of the Los Alamos scientists, Jumbo was &quot;the physical manifestation of the lowest point in the Laboratory&#x27;s hopes for the success of an implosion bomb.&quot; By the time it arrived, the reactors at the Hanford Engineer Works produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test. The use of Jumbo would interfere with the gathering of data on the explosion, the primary objective of the test. An explosion of more than would vaporize the steel and make it difficult to measure the thermal effects. Even would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment. It was therefore decided not to use it. Instead, it was hoisted up a steel tower from the explosion, where it could be used for a subsequent test. In the end, Jumbo survived the explosion, although its tower did not.

Jumbo was destroyed on April 16, 1946, when an Army ordnance team detonated eight 500 lb bombs in the bottom of the steel container. Jumbo, with its steel banding around the middle, had been designed to contain the 5,000 lbs of high explosive in the atomic bomb while it was suspended in the center of the vessel. With the conventional bombs placed in the bottom of Jumbo, the resulting blast sent fragments flying in all directions as far as three quarters of a mile. Who authorized the destruction of Jumbo remains controversial. The rusting skeleton of Jumbo sits in the parking lot at the Trinity site on the White Sands Missile Range, where it was moved in 1979.

The development team also considered other methods of recovering active material in the event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment. The (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.

===100-ton test===

Because there would be only one chance to carry out the test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a rehearsal should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical but gave permission, and he later agreed that it contributed to the success of the Trinity test.

A wooden platform was constructed to the southeast of Trinity ground zero. The high explosive was piled in its wooden shipping boxes in the shape of a pseudo-octagonal prism on it. The charge consisted of tons of TNT and tons of Composition B (with the total explosive power of approximately ), actually a few tons more than the stated &quot;100-tons&quot;. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting them up to the platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with of beta ray activity and of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured the solution into the tubing.

The test was scheduled for May 5 but was postponed for two days to allow for more equipment to be installed. Requests for further postponements had to be refused because they would have affected the schedule for the main test. The detonation time was set for 04:00 Mountain War Time (MWT), on May 7, but there was a 37-minute delay to allow the observation plane, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit flown by Major Clyde &quot;Stan&quot; Shields, to get into position.
The fireball of the conventional explosion was visible from Alamogordo Army Air Field away, but there was little shock at the base camp away. Shields thought that the explosion looked &quot;beautiful&quot;, but it was hardly felt at . Herbert L. Anderson practiced using a converted M4 Sherman tank lined with lead to approach the and blast crater and take a soil sample, although the radioactivity was low enough to allow several hours of unprotected exposure. An electrical signal of unknown origin caused the explosion to go off 0.25 seconds early, ruining experiments that required split-second timing. The piezoelectric gauges developed by Anderson&#x27;s team correctly indicated an explosion of 108 tons of TNT, but Luis Alvarez and Waldman&#x27;s airborne condenser gauges were far less accurate.

In addition to uncovering scientific and technological issues, the rehearsal test revealed practical concerns as well. Over 100 vehicles were used for the rehearsal test, but it was realized more would be required for the main test, and they would need better roads and repair facilities. More radios and more telephone lines were required. Lines needed to be buried to prevent damage by vehicles. A teletype was installed to allow better communication with Los Alamos. A town hall was built to allow for large conferences and briefings, and the mess hall had to be upgraded. Because dust thrown up by vehicles interfered with some of the instrumentation, of road was sealed.

===The bomb===
The term &quot;gadget&quot;—a laboratory euphemism for a bomb—gave the laboratory&#x27;s weapon physics division, &quot;G Division&quot;, its name in August 1944. At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as that had yet to be developed, but once it was, it became the laboratory code name. The Trinity bomb was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, though the Trinity bomb lacked fuzing and external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.

To keep the design as simple as possible, a nearly solid spherical core was chosen rather than a hollow one, although calculations showed that a hollow core would be more efficient in its use of plutonium. The core was compressed to prompt super-criticality by the implosion generated by the high explosive lens. This design became known as a &quot;Christy Core&quot; or &quot;Christy pit&quot; after physicist Robert F. Christy, who made the solid pit design a reality after it was initially proposed by Edward Teller.

Of the several allotropes of plutonium, the metallurgists preferred the malleable δ (delta) phase. This was stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with gallium. Two equal hemispheres of plutonium-gallium alloy were plated with silver, and designated by serial numbers HS-1 and HS-2. The radioactive core generated 15 W of heat, which warmed it up to about , and the silver plating developed blisters that had to be filed down and covered with gold foil; later cores were plated with nickel instead.

A trial assembly of the bomb, without active components or explosive lenses, was carried out by the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. Magnetic measurements from this test suggested that the implosion might be insufficiently simultaneous and the bomb would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.

Assembly of the nuclear capsule began on July 13 at the McDonald Ranch House, where the master bedroom had been turned into a clean room. The polonium-beryllium &quot;Urchin&quot; initiator was assembled, and Louis Slotin placed it inside the two hemispheres of the plutonium core. Cyril Smith then placed the core in the natural uranium tamper plug, or &quot;slug&quot;. Air gaps were filled with gold foil, and the two halves of the plug were held together with uranium washers and screws which fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug.
To better understand the likely effect of a bomb dropped from a plane and detonated in air, and generate less nuclear fallout, the bomb was to be detonated atop a steel tower. The bomb was driven to the base of the tower, where a temporary eye bolt was screwed into the capsule and a chain hoist was used to lower the capsule into the bomb. As the capsule entered the hole in the uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and, in a few minutes, the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eye bolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule (to complete the thin spherical shell of plastic boron around the tamper), an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher (aluminum shell surrounding the tamper), and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. The assembly of active material and high explosives was finished at 17:45 hours on 13 July.

The gadget was hoisted to the top of the tower. The tower stood on four legs extending into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform and a corrugated iron shack open to the west. The gadget was hauled up with an electric winch. A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the gadget fell. A crew then attached each of the 32 Model 1773 EBW detonators. Full assembly of the bomb was completed by 17:00 on July 14. The seven-man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.

===Personnel===

In the final two weeks before the test, some 250 personnel from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity Site, and Lieutenant Bush&#x27;s command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves warned Governor of New Mexico John J. Dempsey that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.

Shelters were established due north, west, and south of the tower, each with its own chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths. Bainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, and Sir James Chadwick. The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill (also called Compaña Hill or Cerro de la Colorado), about northwest of the tower.
Photographic film was placed in nearby towns to detect radioactive contamination, and seismographs were placed in Tucson, Denver, and Chihuahua, Mexico to determine how far the explosion could be sensed. Calculations stated that even if the mechanical and electrical systems did not fail, the likelihood of a non-optimal test was greater than 10%. The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test. Teller was the most optimistic, predicting . He wore gloves to protect his hands and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with. He was one of the few scientists to watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned. He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others. Ramsey chose zero (a complete dud), Robert Oppenheimer chose , Kistiakowsky , and Bethe chose . Rabi, the last to arrive, took the only remaining choice, which turned out to be the winner. Bethe later stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segrè, and he was swayed by Segrè&#x27;s authority over that of a more junior [but unnamed] member of Segrè&#x27;s group who had calculated 20 kt.

Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state or incinerate the entire planet. This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible, although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for frightening the guards, some of whom asked to be relieved; his own biggest fear was that nothing at all would happen, in which case he would have to return to the tower to investigate.

==Explosion==

===Detonation===
The scientists wanted good visibility, low humidity, light winds at low altitude, and westerly winds at high altitude for the test. The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the Potsdam Conference was due to start on July 16 and President Harry S. Truman wanted the test to be conducted before the conference began. It was therefore scheduled for July 16, the earliest date at which the bomb components would be available.

The detonation was initially planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation, as had happened with a model of the electrical system. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. A rocket launched at 5:25 to signal five minutes before detonation; another rocket fired at 5:29. At 5:29:15, a switch in the control bunker started the detonation timer. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems: the shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.

Two circling B-29s observed the test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of Project Alberta who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic missions. These included Captain Deak Parsons, the associate director of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the head of Project Alberta; Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, Bernard Waldman, Wolfgang Panofsky, and William Penney. The overcast sky obscured their view of the test site.

At 05:29:21 MWT (11:29:21 GMT) ± 15 seconds, the device exploded with an energy equivalent to . The desert sand, largely made of silica, melted and became a mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named trinitite. The explosion created a crater approximately deep and wide. The radius of the trinitite layer was approximately . The 100-foot shot tower was completely vaporized. At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated &quot;brighter than daytime&quot; for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as &quot;being as hot as an oven&quot; at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over away, and the mushroom cloud reached in height.
Many observers recalled their amazement at the light from the explosion. Conant wrote, &quot;The enormity of the light and its length quite stunned me&quot;. Lawrence, away, wrote of being &quot;enveloped with a warm brilliant yellow white light—from darkness to brilliant sunshine in an instant&quot;. Ralph Carlisle Smith, watching from Compania Hill, wrote:

Mary Argo was the only female staff member to be officially invited to watch the test. Joan Hinton snuck in to watch the test despite not being invited: It was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up. Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up. We were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds. We saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight on the top. Then suddenly the sound reached us. It was very sharp and rumbled and all the mountains were rumbling with it. We suddenly started talking out loud and felt exposed to the whole world.

In his official report on the test, Thomas Farrell (who initially exclaimed, &quot;The long-hairs have let it get away from them!&quot;) wrote: 

William L. Laurence of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had been transferred temporarily to the Manhattan Project at Groves&#x27;s request in early 1945. Groves had arranged for Laurence to view significant events, including Trinity and the atomic bombing of Japan. Laurence wrote press releases with the help of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s public relations staff. He later recalled: 

After the initial euphoria of witnessing the explosion had passed, Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, &quot;Now we are all sons of bitches.&quot; Rabi noticed Oppenheimer&#x27;s reaction: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget his walk&quot;; Rabi recalled, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the way he stepped out of the car ... his walk was like &quot;High Noon&quot; ... this kind of strut. He had done it.&quot;

Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from a Hindu holy book, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; (XI,12):
Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:
John R. Lugo was flying a U.S. Navy transport at , east of Albuquerque, en route to the west coast. &quot;My first impression was, like, the sun was coming up in the south. What a ball of fire! It was so bright it lit up the cockpit of the plane.&quot; Lugo radioed Albuquerque. He got no explanation for the blast but was told, &quot;Don&#x27;t fly south.&quot;

===Instrumentation and measurements===

The T (Theoretical) Division at Los Alamos had predicted a yield of between . Immediately after the blast, two lead-lined M4 Sherman tanks made their way to the crater. Radiochemical analysis of soil samples that they collected indicated that the total yield (or energy release) had been around . This method turned out to be the most accurate means of determining the efficiency of a nuclear explosion and was used for many years after.

The energy of the blast wave was measured by a large number of sensors using a variety of physical principles. The piezoelectric blast gauges were thrown off scale and no records were obtained. The excess-velocity blast-yield measurement (precise measurement of the velocity of sound at the site of the explosion and then comparing it with the velocity of the blast wave) provided among the most accurate measurements of the blast pressure. Another method was to use the aluminum diaphragm box gauges designed to record the peak pressure of the blast wave. These indicated a blast energy of ± . They were supplemented by a large number of other types of mechanical pressure gauges. And only one of them gave a reasonable result of about .

Fermi prepared his own experiment to measure the energy that was released as blast. He later recalled:

There were also several gamma ray and neutron detectors; few survived the blast, with all the gauges within of ground zero being destroyed, but sufficient data were recovered to measure the gamma ray component of the ionizing radiation released.

Some fifty different cameras had been set up, taking motion and still photographs. Special Fastax cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. Spectrograph cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and pinhole cameras would record gamma rays. A rotating drum spectrograph at the station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank. Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segrè brought in Jack Aeby with his 35 mm Perfex 44. He took the only known well-exposed color photograph of the detonation explosion.

The official estimate for the total yield of the Trinity bomb, which includes the energy of the blast component together with the contributions from the explosion&#x27;s light output and both forms of ionizing radiation, is , of which about was contributed by fission of the plutonium core, and about was from fission of the natural uranium tamper. A re-analysis of data published in 2021 put the yield at .

As a result of the data gathered on the size of the blast, the detonation height for the bombing of Hiroshima was set at to take advantage of the Mach stem blast reinforcing effect. The final Nagasaki burst height was so the Mach stem started sooner. The knowledge that implosion worked led Oppenheimer to recommend to Groves that the uranium-235 used in a Little Boy gun-type weapon could be used more economically in a Fat Man implosion-type weapon containing a composite core with plutonium and enriched uranium. It was too late to do this with the first Little Boy, but the composite cores would soon enter production.

===Civilian detection===
The light from the test was visible as far as Amarillo, Texas, and a mountain range away from Trinity. The Second Air Force issued a press release with a cover story that Groves had prepared weeks before, which described the explosion as the accidental destruction of a magazine on the base. The press release, written by Laurence, stated: 

Laurence had prepared four releases, covering outcomes ranging from a cover story for a successful test (the one which was used) to catastrophic scenarios involving serious damage to surrounding communities, evacuation of nearby residents, and a placeholder for the names of those killed. As Laurence was a witness to the test, he knew that the last release, if used, might be his own obituary. A newspaper article published the same day stated that &quot;the blast was seen and felt throughout an area extending from El Paso to Silver City, Gallup, Socorro, and Albuquerque.&quot; The articles appeared in New Mexico, but East Coast newspapers ignored them, and local residents who saw the light accepted the cover story.

Information about the Trinity test was made public shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima. The Smyth Report, released on August 12, 1945, gave some information on the blast, and the edition released by Princeton University Press a few weeks later incorporated the War Department&#x27;s press release on the test as Appendix 6, and contained the famous pictures of a &quot;bulbous&quot; Trinity fireball.

===Official notifications===
The results of the test were conveyed to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson at the Potsdam Conference in Germany in a coded message from his assistant George L. Harrison:

The message arrived at the &quot;Little White House&quot; in the Potsdam suburb of Babelsberg and was at once taken to Truman and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. Harrison sent a follow-up message which arrived on the morning of July 18:

Because Stimson&#x27;s summer home at Highhold was on Long Island and Harrison&#x27;s farm near Upperville, Virginia, this indicated that the explosion could be seen away and heard away.

Three days later, on July 21, a 13-page report written by Groves arrived at Potsdam via a courier. It stated:

It continued on to estimate the yield of the test (15-20 kilotons) and describe the effects vividly. Stimson took the report to Truman, who was &quot;tremendously pepped up by it.&quot; Winston Churchill, who observed Truman&#x27;s newly confident approach with the Soviets the same day, concluded that he had become &quot;a changed man&quot; as a result of the news.

===Fallout===
Film badges used to measure exposure to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 had been exposed to more than 0.1 roentgens (half of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements recommended daily radiation exposure limit), but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected, and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. Nevertheless, the fission consumed only 3 out of the 13 pounds of plutonium, leaving 10 pounds to be spread through the atmosphere and as fallout. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson&#x27;s dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.

The heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was from the detonation point, on Chupadera Mesa. The fallout there was reported to have settled in a white mist onto some of the livestock in the area, resulting in local beta burns and a temporary loss of dorsal or back hair. Patches of hair grew back discolored white. The Army bought 88 cattle in all from ranchers; the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos, while the rest were shipped to Oak Ridge for long-term observation.

Dose reconstruction published in 2020 under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute documented that five counties in New Mexico experienced the greatest radioactive contamination: Guadalupe, Lincoln, San Miguel, Socorro, and Torrance. People living in the surrounding area near the site were unaware of the project and later not included in the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act support for affected &quot;downwinders&quot; which addressed serious community health problems resulting from similar tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site. Efforts in Congress to add the New Mexico residents to the population covered by the bill continued in 2024.

In August 1945, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company observed spotting and fogging on its film, which was at that time usually packaged in cardboard containers. J. H. Webb, an employee of the Kodak Company, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible because of the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that a paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Webb kept this secret until 1949.

This incident, along with the next continental US tests in 1951, set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.

==Site today==

In September 1953, about 650 people attended the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house are allowed to see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas. More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site was about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is about half of the total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.

On December 21, 1965, the Trinity Site was declared a National Historic Landmark district, and on October 15, 1966, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The landmark includes the base camp where the scientists and support group lived, ground zero where the bomb was placed for the explosion, and the McDonald ranch house, where the plutonium core to the bomb was assembled. One of the old instrumentation bunkers is visible beside the road just west of ground zero. An inner oblong fence was added in 1967, and the corridor barbed wire fence that connects the outer fence to the inner one was completed in 1972.

The Trinity monument, a rough-sided, lava-rock obelisk about high, marks the explosion&#x27;s hypocenter. It was erected in 1965 by Army personnel using local rocks taken from the western boundary of the range. A special tour of the site on July 16, 1995 (marking the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test) attracted 5,000 visitors. Since then, the site has been open to the public on the first Saturdays of April and October.

== In popular culture ==
The Trinity test has been portrayed in various forms of media, including documentary films and dramatizations. In 1946, an 18-minute documentary titled &quot;Atomic Power&quot; was produced by Time Inc. under &quot;The March of Time&quot; banner and released theatrically. It featured many people involved with the project, including J. Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest Lawrence, as actors in re-creations of real discussions and events that led up to the Trinity test. In 1947, a docudrama titled &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; chronicled the development of nuclear weapons and portrayed the Trinity test.

In 1980, a television drama miniseries titled &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, a co-production between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American television station WGBH-TV, aired for seven episodes on BBC Two. The Trinity test is depicted in its fifth episode. In early 1981, a documentary titled &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; was released, focusing closely on the events of the Trinity test. In 1989, a feature film titled &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; depicted the Trinity test. Two documentaries, &quot;Trinity and Beyond&quot; and &quot;The Bomb&quot;, were released in 1995 and 2015 respectively. The 2017 third season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; prominently features a fantastical depiction of the Trinity test as part of a flashback in its eighth episode, providing an oblique origin story for the show&#x27;s main antagonist, BOB.

The 2023 Christopher Nolan-directed blockbuster &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; prominently portrayed the Trinity test. Nolan cited the film&#x27;s depiction of the test firing as one of its most important scenes, calling it &quot;the fulcrum that the whole story turns on.&quot; Nolan avoided using computer-generated imagery for the re-enactment of the explosion, instead using practical effects, with a smaller explosion made of gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium being conducted and then spliced via forced perspective to recreate the size of the Trinity explosion. The popularity of the film brought newfound attention to previous media depictions of the Trinity test, such as &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot;.

<text>In thermodynamics, a physical property is any property that is measurable, and whose value describes a state of a physical system. Thermodynamic properties are defined as characteristic features of a system, capable of specifying the system&#x27;s state. Some constants, such as the ideal gas constant, , do not describe the state of a system, and so are not properties. On the other hand, some constants, such as (the freezing point depression constant, or cryoscopic constant), depend on the identity of a substance, and so may be considered to describe the state of a system, and therefore may be considered physical properties.

&quot;Specific&quot; properties are expressed on a per mass basis. If the units were changed from per mass to, for example, per mole, the property would remain as it was (i.e., intensive or extensive).

==Regarding work and heat==

Work and heat are not thermodynamic properties, but rather &quot;process quantities:&quot; flows of energy across a system boundary. Systems do not &quot;contain&quot; work, but can &quot;perform&quot; work, and likewise, in formal thermodynamics, systems do not &quot;contain&quot; heat, but can &quot;transfer&quot; heat. Informally, however, a difference in the energy of a system that occurs solely because of a difference in its temperature is commonly called &quot;heat&quot;, and the energy that flows across a boundary as a result of a temperature difference is &quot;heat&quot;.

Altitude (or elevation) is usually not a thermodynamic property. Altitude can help specify the location of a system, but that does not describe the state of the system. An exception would be if the effect of gravity need to be considered in order to describe a state, in which case altitude could indeed be a thermodynamic property.

<text>Matera (, ; Materano: ) is a city and the capital of the Province of Matera in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. With a history of continuous occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic (10th millennium BC), it is renowned for its rock-cut urban core, whose twin cliffside zones are known collectively as the Sassi.

Matera lies on the right bank of the Gravina river, whose canyon forms a geological boundary between the hill country of Basilicata (historic Lucania) to the south-west and the Murgia plateau of Apulia to the north-east. The city began as a complex of cave habitations excavated in the softer limestone on the gorge&#x27;s western, Lucanian face. It took advantage of two streams which flow into the ravine from a spot near the Castello Tramontano, reducing the cliff&#x27;s angle of drop and leaving a defensible narrow promontory in between. The central high ground, or acropolis, supporting the city&#x27;s cathedral and administrative buildings, came to be known as Civita, and the settlement districts scaling down and burrowing into the sheer rock faces as the Sassi. Of the two streambeds, called the &quot;&quot;, the northern hosts Sasso Barisano (facing Bari) and the southern Sasso Caveoso (facing Montescaglioso).

The Sassi consist of around twelve levels spanning the height of 380 m, connected by a network of paths, stairways, and courtyards (&quot;vicinati&quot;). The medieval city clinging on to the edge of the canyon for its defence is invisible from the western approach. The tripartite urban structure of Civita and the two Sassi, relatively isolated from each other, survived until the 16th century, when the centre of public life moved outside the walls to the Piazza Sedile in the open plain (the Piano) to the west, followed by the shift of the elite residences to the Piano from the 17th century onwards. By the end of the 18th century, a physical class boundary separated the overcrowded Sassi of the peasants from the new spatial order of their social superiors in the Piano, and geographical elevation came to coincide with status more overtly than before, to the point where the two communities no longer interacted socially.

Yet it was only at the turn of the 20th century that the Sassi were declared unfit for modern habitation, and the government relocation of all their inhabitants to new housing in the Piano followed between 1952 and the 1970s. A new law in 1986 opened the path to restoration and reoccupation of the Sassi, this time – as noted by the architectural historian Anne Toxey – for the benefit of the wealthy middle class. The recognition of the Sassi, labelled (&quot;the underground city&quot;), together with the rupestrian churches across the Gravina as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 1993 has assisted in attracting tourism and accelerated the reclaiming of the site. In 2019, Matera was declared a European Capital of Culture.

== History ==
Before its integration into the modern Italian state, the city of Matera had experienced the rule of the Romans, Lombards, Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Swabians, Angevins, Aragonese, and Bourbons.

Though scholars continue to debate the date the dwellings were first occupied in Matera, and the continuity of their subsequent occupation, the area of what is now Matera is believed to have been settled since the Palaeolithic (10th millennium BC). This makes it potentially one of the oldest continually inhabited settlements in the world. Alternatively, it has been suggested by Anne Toxey that the area has been &quot;occupied continuously for at least three millennia&quot;.

Built on an entrenched prehistoric village, the town is likely to have Greek origins. In the times of Magna Graecia, Matera shared a close relationship with the Greek cities on the southern coast, becoming a trade and transit route in Roman times.Then the town of Matera was established by the Roman Lucius Caecilius Metellus in 251 BC who called it &quot;Matheola&quot;. In AD 664 Matera was conquered by the Lombards and became part of the Duchy of Benevento. In the 7th and 8th centuries the nearby grottos were colonised by both Benedictine and Basilian monastic institutions. After the Arab conquest of Bari in 840, Matera came under Islamic rule. Emancipated from the old Lombard jurisdiction of the gastald of Acerenza in the Principality of Salerno, the town gained regional prominence. 

In the spring of 867, it was burnt by the imperial troops of Louis II as the first key target in the emirate&#x27;s conquest; the Chronicle of St Benedict of Monte Cassino calls it a particularly well-defended site. The Franks soon fell out with the Lombards and the Byzantines exploited the local need for protection from Arab raiding and internal Lombard divisions to retake Apulia, which became the theme of Longobardia in 891/2. Already by 887, Matera&#x27;s local Lombard elite bore Byzantine titles, the monastery of San Vincenzo al Volturno had to conduct business before the Byzantine judge and town notables of Matera, and the Greeks of Matera made up the Byzantine garrison of Naples. The precarious Byzantine rule had to contend with the ambitions of Lombard towns and nobles against the background of frequent incursions from the neighbouring duchy of Capua-Benevento and from Arab Sicily. In 940 Matera was besieged, possibly with local assistance, by the Lombards. 

On 25 January 982 the army of Otto II camped before the walls of Matera on its way from Salerno to Taranto, ostensibly marching against the Arabs. In 994 Matera was temporarily captured by the Arabs after a four-month siege. The town continued to play a part in Byzantine governance: in June 1019 the chartoularios Stephanos of Matera assisted in the re-foundation of Troia. But civic unrest was also endemic and in 1040 the Byzantine judge Romanos was murdered at Matera by the local auxiliary troops during a wave of assaults on Byzantine officials that swept across the region. After the prominent Apulian rebels enlisted the support of the Normans and defeated the new katepano of Italy at Cannae in 1041, Matera fell within the scope of Norman incursions and struck a deal with the invaders. In retaliation for this, the next katepano Georgios Maniakes, dispatched to Italy with special powers in April 1042, carried out mass executions in Matera in June, only to launch a rebellion of his own in September. 

After his departure Matera elected William Iron Arm as its count (1042), but like other towns it remained in Byzantine hands despite the Norman advances – in 1054 died Sico, the protospatharios of Matera. The city was seized in April 1064 as an independent acquisition by Robert, Count of Montescaglioso, a seditious nephew of Robert Guiscard, who profited from the involvement of his uncle further south. After count Robert died in July 1080, Matera accepted the rule of his brother Geoffrey of Conversano. Geoffrey&#x27;s son Alexander joined a revolt against Roger II in 1132, but he fled before the advance of the king to Byzantium and left his son Geoffrey in Matera, whose inhabitants gave the city away to avoid being massacred by the royal troops. Alexander later took part in the Byzantine invasion of Italy in 1156. Lombard aristocrats survived with a reduced status: around 1150, Guaimar (III) of Capaccio, a descendant of Lombard princes, held a sub-fief near Matera from the count of Montescaglioso. Meanwhile, after a period of association with the Byzantine metropolis of Otranto from 968, the episcopal see of Matera was reclaimed by the archbishopric of Acerenza. A new cathedral church of St Eustace was consecrated in May 1082.

After a short communal phase and a series of pestilences and earthquakes, the city became an Aragonese possession in the 15th century, and was given in fief to the barons of the Tramontano family. In 1514, however, the population rebelled against the oppression and killed Count Giovanni Carlo Tramontano. In the 17th century Matera was handed over to the Orsini and then became part of the Terra d&#x27;Otranto, in Apulia. Later it was capital of the province of Basilicata, a position it retained until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte assigned it to Potenza.

In 1927, it became capital of the new province of Matera.

== Demographics ==
==Government==

Since local government political reorganization in 1993, Matera has been governed by the City Council of Matera. Voters elect directly 32 councilors and the Mayor of Matera every five years.

== Main sights ==
=== The Sassi (ancient town)===

Matera has gained international fame for its ancient town, the &quot;Sassi di Matera&quot;. The Sassi originated in a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and these dwellings are thought to be among the first ever human settlements in what is now Italy. The Sassi are habitations dug into the calcareous rock itself, which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia. Many of them are really little more than small caverns, and in some parts of the Sassi a street lies on top of another group of dwellings. The ancient town grew up on one slope of the rocky ravine created by a river that is now a small stream, and this ravine is known locally as &quot;la Gravina&quot;. In the 1950s, as part of a policy to clear the extreme poverty of the Sassi, the government of Italy used force to relocate most of the population of the Sassi to new public housing in the developing modern city.

Until the late 1980s the Sassi was still considered an area of poverty, since its dwellings were, and in most cases still are, uninhabitable and dangerous. The present local administration, however, has become more tourism-orientated, and it has promoted the regeneration of the Sassi as a picturesque tourist attraction with the aid of the Italian government, UNESCO, and Hollywood. In 2008, the city began the candidacy process for a European Capital of Culture in 2019; it was designated one of the European Capitals of Culture for 2019 on 17 October 2014. Today there are many thriving businesses, pubs and hotels there, and the city is amongst the fastest growing in southern Italy.

=== Monasteries and churches ===

Matera preserves a large and diverse collection of buildings related to the Christian faith, including a large number of rupestrian churches carved from the calcarenite rock of the region. These churches, which are also found in the neighbouring region of Apulia, were listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.

Matera Cathedral (1268–1270) has been dedicated to Santa Maria della Bruna since 1389. Built in an Apulian Romanesque architectural style, the church has a 52 m tall bell tower, and next to the main gate is a statue of the Maria della Bruna, backed by those of Saints Peter and Paul. The main feature of the façade is the rose window, divided by sixteen small columns. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles. The decoration is mainly from the 18th century Baroque restoration, but recently a Byzantine-style 14th-century fresco portraying the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; has been discovered.

Two other important churches in Matera, both dedicated to the Apostle Peter, are San Pietro Caveoso (in the &quot;Sasso Caveoso&quot;) and San Pietro Barisano (in the &quot;Sasso Barisano&quot;). San Pietro Barisano was recently restored in a project by the World Monuments Fund, funded by American Express. The main altar and the interior frescoes were cleaned, and missing pieces of mouldings, reliefs, and other adornments were reconstructed from photographic archives or surrounding fragments.

There are many other churches and monasteries dating back throughout the history of the Christian church. Some are simple caves with a single altar, occasionally accompanied by a fresco, often located on the opposite side of the ravine. Some are complex cave networks with large underground chambers, thought to have been used for meditation by the rupestrian and cenobitic monks.

=== Cisterns and water collection ===

Matera was built above a deep ravine called Gravina of Matera that divides the territory into two areas. Matera was built such that it is hidden, but made it difficult to provide a water supply to its inhabitants. Early dwellers invested tremendous energy in building cisterns and systems of water channels.

The largest cistern has been found under Piazza Vittorio Veneto, the Palombaro Lungo which was built in 1832. With its solid pillars carved from the rock and a vault height of more than fifteen metres, it is a veritable water cathedral, which is navigable by boat. Like other cisterns in the town, it collected rainwater that was filtered and flowed in a controlled way to the Sassi.

There were also a large number of little superficial canals that fed pools and hanging gardens. Moreover, many bell-shaped cisterns in dug houses were filled up by seepage. Later, when the population increased, many of these cisterns were turned into houses and other kinds of water-harvesting systems were realised.

Some of these more recent facilities have the shape of houses submerged in the earth.

===Natural areas===
The Murgia National Park (Parco della Murgia Materana), a regional park established in 1990, includes the territory of the Gravina di Matera and about 150 rock churches scattered along the slopes of the ravines and the plateau of the Murgia. This area, inhabited since prehistoric times, still preserves stationing dating back to the Paleolithic, such as the Grotta dei pipistrelli (cave of the bats), and to the Neolithic. The symbol of the park is the lesser kestrel.

The San Giuliano Regional Reserve, a protected area established in 2000, includes Lake San Giuliano, an artificial reservoir created by the damming of the Bradano river, and the river sections upstream and downstream of it.

==== Timmari ====
Colle di Timmari, a green plateau located about 15 km from the city, dominates the Bradano valley and the San Giuliano lake. It is a pleasant residential area, and on the top of the hill there is the small Sanctuary of San Salvatore, dating back to 1310, and an important archaeological area.

=== Other sights ===
The &quot;Tramontano Castle&quot;, begun in the early 16th century by Gian Carlo Tramontano, Count of Matera, is probably the only other structure that is above ground of any great significance outside the sassi. However, the construction remained unfinished after his assassination in the popular riot of 29 December 1514. It has three large towers, while twelve were probably included in the original design. During some restoration work in the main square of the town, workers came across what were believed to be the main footings of another castle tower. However, on further excavation large Roman cisterns were unearthed. Whole house structures were discovered where one can see how the people of that era lived.

The &quot;Palazzo dell&#x27;Annunziata&quot; is a historical building on the main square, seat of Provincial Library.

== Culture ==
On 17 October 2014, Matera was declared European Capital of Culture for 2019, together with Bulgaria&#x27;s second-largest city, Plovdiv.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Matera is a typical from Southern Italy. It features a sort of blend of Basilicata and Apulia&#x27;s cuisines being in a border area between the two regions. Some specialties are &quot;peperoni cruschi&quot;, a sweet and dry pepper variety very popular in Basilicata, and &quot;Pane di Matera&quot;, a type of bread recognizable for its intense flavour and conical shape, granted Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. Matera produces an eponymous wine which bears the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation.

Some dishes from the local cuisine include:
*&quot;Crapiata&quot;, a peasant soup with chickpeas, beans, broad beans, wheat, lentils, cicerchie. An old recipe dating to the Roman period, later enriched with other ingredients such as potatoes, it is a common ritual grown into &quot;Sassi di Matera&quot; and celebrated on 1 August
*&quot;Orecchiette alla materana&quot;, baked orecchiette-pasta seasoned with tomatoes, lamb, mozzarella and Pecorino cheese
*&quot;Pasta con i peperoni cruschi&quot;, a pasta dish with peperoni cruschi and fried breadcrumb. Grated cheese or turnip greens can be added.
*&quot;Cialedda&quot;, a frugal recipe with stale bread as a main ingredient. It can be &quot;calda&quot; (hot) with egg, bay leaves, garlic and olives or &quot;fredda&quot; (cold) with tomatoes and garlic.
*&quot;Pignata&quot;, sheep meat with potatoes, onion, tomatoes and celery cooked in the &quot;pignata&quot;, a terracotta pot shaped like an amphora.
*&quot;Strazzate&quot;, crumbly biscuits prepared with egg, almonds and coffee

===Cinema===

Because of the ancient primeval-looking scenery in and around the Sassi, it has been used by filmmakers as the setting for ancient Jerusalem. The following famous biblical period motion pictures were filmed in Matera: 
* Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; (1964)

===Music===
Matera appears in the music videos for the songs &quot;Sun Goes Down&quot; (2014) by Robin Schulz and &quot;Spit Out the Bone&quot; (2016) by Metallica.

=== Religious traditions ===
The Feast of the Madonna della Bruna, held in Matera on 2 July each year, is notable for its religious procession featuring an ornamented chariot which is then pulled apart by spectators. The origins of the festival are not well known, because its story has changed while being handed down from generation to generation. One of these legends says that a woman asked a farmer to go up on his wagon to accompany her to Matera. When she arrived to the periphery of the city, she got off the wagon and asked farmer to take her message to the bishop. In this message she said she was Christ&#x27;s mother. The bishop, the clergy and the folk rushed to receive the Virgin, but they found a statue. So the statue of Madonna entered in the city on a triumphal wagon. Another legend talks about a destruction of the wagon: Saracens besiege Matera and the citizens, to protect the painting of Madonna, hid it on a little wagon. They then destroyed the wagon to keep the Saracens from taking the painting. 
Different hypotheses are attributed to the name of &quot;Madonna della Bruna&quot; : the first says that the noun derives from the Lombard high-medieval term &quot;brùnja&quot; (armor/protection of knights). So the name might mean &quot;Madonna of defense&quot;. Another hypothesis is that the name comes from &quot;herbon&quot;, a city of Giudea, where the Virgin went to visit her cousin Elisabetta. A third hypothesis says that the name comes from the colour of the Virgin&#x27;s face. The profane insertions such as the &quot;navalis&quot; wagon and its violent destruction, along with the intimacy and the religious solemnity, suggest this festival shares roots with ancient traditions of other Mediterranean countries. For example, in Greek culture, wedding parties also celebrate with a triumphal wagon (&quot;ships on wheels&quot; richly designed). 
The Madonna&#x27;s sculpture is located in a case in the transept of the cathedral dedicated to her, where there is also a fresco that portrays her. It dates back to the 13th century and it belongs to the Byzantine school.

<text>Willem Barentsz (; – 20 June 1597), anglicized as William Barents or Barentz, was a Dutch navigator, cartographer, and Arctic explorer.

Barentsz went on three expeditions to the far north in search for a Northeast passage. He reached as far as Novaya Zemlya and the Kara Sea in his first two voyages, but was turned back on both occasions by ice. During a third expedition, the crew discovered Spitsbergen and Bear Island, but subsequently became stranded on Novaya Zemlya for almost a year. Barentsz died on the return voyage in 1597.

The Barents Sea, among many other places, is named after him.

==Life and career==
Willem Barentsz was born around 1550 in the village Formerum on the island Terschelling in the Seventeen Provinces, present-day Netherlands. &quot;Barentsz&quot; was not his surname but rather his patronymic name, short for &quot;Barentszoon&quot; &quot;Barent&#x27;s son&quot;.

A cartographer by trade, Barentsz sailed to Spain and the Mediterranean to complete an atlas of the Mediterranean region, which he co-published with Petrus Plancius.

His career as an explorer was spent searching for a Northeast passage in order to trade with China. He reasoned clear, open water north of Siberia must exist since the sun shone 24 hours a day melting Arctic sea ice, indeed he thought the further north one went the less ice there would be.

===First voyage===
On 5 June 1594, Barentsz left the island of Texel aboard the small ship &quot;Mercury&quot;, as part of a group of three ships sent out in separate directions to try to enter the Kara Sea, with the hopes of finding the Northeast Passage above Siberia. Between 23 and 29 June, Barentsz stayed at Kildin Island.

On 9 July, the crew encountered a polar bear for the first time. After shooting and wounding it with a musket when it tried to climb aboard the ship, the seamen decided to capture it with the hope of bringing it back to Holland. Once leashed and brought aboard the ship however, the bear rampaged and had to be killed. This occurred in Bear Creek, Williams Island.

Upon discovering the Orange Islands, the crew came across a herd of approximately 200 walruses and tried to kill them with hatchets and pikes. Finding the task more difficult than they imagined, cold steel shattering against the tough hides of the animals, they left with only a few ivory tusks.

Barentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, and followed it northward before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. Although they did not reach their ultimate goal, the trip was considered a success.

Jan Huyghen van Linschoten was a member of this expedition and the second.

===Second voyage===

The following year, Prince Maurice of Orange was filled with &quot;the most exaggerated hopes&quot; on hearing of Barentsz&#x27; previous voyage, and named him chief pilot and conductor of a new expedition, which was accompanied by six ships loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.

Setting out on 2 June 1595, the voyage went between the Siberian coast and Vaygach Island. On 30 August, the party came across approximately 20 Samoyed &quot;wild men&quot; with whom they were able to speak, due to a crewmember speaking their language. 4 September saw a small crew sent to States Island to search for a type of crystal that had been noticed earlier. The party was attacked by a polar bear, and two sailors were killed.

Eventually, the expedition turned back upon discovering that unexpected weather had left the Kara Sea frozen. This expedition was largely considered to be a failure.

===Third voyage===
In 1596, disappointed by the failure of previous expeditions, the States-General announced they would no longer subsidize similar voyages – but instead offered a high reward for anybody who &quot;successfully&quot; navigated the Northeast Passage. The Town Council of Amsterdam purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by Jan Rijp and Jacob van Heemskerk, to search for the elusive channel under the command of Barentsz. They set off on 10 May or 15 May, and on 9 June discovered Bear Island.

They discovered Spitsbergen on 17 June, sighting its northwest coast. On 20 June they saw the entrance of a large bay, later called Raudfjorden. On 21 June they anchored between Cloven Cliff and Vogelsang, where they &quot;set up a post with the arms of the Dutch upon it.&quot; On 25 June they entered Magdalenefjorden, which they named &quot;Tusk Bay&quot;, in light of the walrus tusks they found there. The following day, 26 June, they sailed into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, but were forced to turn back because of a shoal, which led them to call the fjord &quot;Keerwyck&quot; (&quot;inlet where one is forced to turn back&quot;). On 28 June they rounded the northern point of Prins Karls Forland, which they named &quot;Vogelhoek&quot;, on account of the large number of birds they saw there. They sailed south, passing Isfjorden and Bellsund, which were labelled on Barentsz&#x27;s chart as &quot;Grooten Inwyck&quot; and &quot;Inwyck&quot;.

The ships once again found themselves at Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement between Barentsz and Van Heemskerk on one side and Rijp on the other. They agreed to part ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed due north in an attempt to cross directly over the north pole to reach China. Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya on 17 July. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he intended to head for the Vaigatch Strait, but their ship became stuck within the many icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on a barren bluff. After a failed attempt to melt the permafrost, the crew used driftwood and lumber from the ship to build a 7.8×5.5-metre lodge they called &quot;Het Behouden Huys&quot; (The Saved House).

Dealing with extreme cold, the crew realised that their socks would burn before their feet could even feel the warmth of a fire – and took to sleeping with warmed stones and cannonballs. They used the merchant fabrics aboard the ship to make additional blankets and clothing. The ship bore salted beef, butter, cheese, bread, barley, peas, beans, groats, flour, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt, beer, wine, brandy, hardtack, smoked bacon, ham and fish. Much of the beer froze, bursting the casks. By 8 November Gerrit de Veer, the ship&#x27;s carpenter who kept a diary, reported a shortage of beer and bread, with wine being rationed four days later.

In January 1597, the crew became the first to witness and record the atmospheric anomaly of a polar mirage, now coined the Novaya Zemlya effect due to this sighting.

Proving somewhat successful at hunting, the group caught Arctic foxes in primitive traps. The raw flesh of the Arctic fox contains small amounts of vitamin C, which, unknown to the sailors, reduced the effects of scurvy. The crew were continually attacked by polar bears that infested the area where they camped. The bears turned the stranded and now empty ship into a wintertime abode. Primitive guns usually did not kill the bears on first or even second shot (unless well aimed at the heart) and were difficult to aim, while the cold and brittle metal weapons often shattered or bent.

By June, the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, and the remaining desperate scurvy-ridden survivors took two open boats. Barentsz died at sea soon after on 20 June 1597. It is not known whether Barentsz was buried on the northern island of Novaya Zemlya, or at sea. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach the Kola Peninsula, where they were rescued by a Dutch merchant vessel commanded by former fellow explorer Jan Rijp who by that time had returned to the Netherlands and was on a second voyage, assuming the Barentsz crew to be lost, and found it by accident. By that time, only 12 crewmen remained. They did not reach Amsterdam until 1 November. Sources differ on whether two men died on the ice floe and three in the boats, or three on the ice floe and two in the boats. The young cabin boy had died during the winter months in the shelter.

==Excavation and findings==
The wooden lodge where Barentsz&#x27; crew sheltered was found undisturbed by Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen in 1871. Making a sketch of the lodge&#x27;s construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a tool chest, clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod and a number of pictures. Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a grappling iron, two maps and a handwritten translation of Arthur Pet and Charles Jackman&#x27;s voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, after some had initially been held in The Hague.

The amateur archaeologist Miloradovich&#x27;s 1933 finds are held in the Arctic and Antarctic Museum in St. Petersburg. Dmitriy Kravchenko visited the site in 1977, 1979 and 1980 – and sent divers into the sea hoping to find the wreck of the large ship. He returned with a number of objects, which went to the Arkhangelsk Regional Museum of Local Lore (Russia). Another small collection exists at the Polar Museum in Tromsø (Norway).

In 1992, an expedition of three scientists, a journalist and two photographers commissioned by the &quot;Arctic Centre&quot; at the University of Groningen, coupled with two scientists, a cook and a doctor sent by the &quot;Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute&quot; in St. Petersburg, returned to the site, and erected a commemorative marker at the site of the cabin.

The location of Barentsz&#x27; wintering on the ice floes has become a tourist destination for icebreaker cruiseships operating from Murmansk.

==Legacy==

Two of Barentsz&#x27; crewmembers later published their journals, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and Gerrit de Veer who had acted as the ship&#x27;s carpenter on the last two voyages.

In 1853, the former &quot;Murmean Sea&quot; was renamed Barents Sea in his honour. Barentsburg, the second largest settlement on Svalbard, Barentsøya (Barents Island) and the Barents Region were also named after Barentsz.

In the late 19th century, the Maritime Institute Willem Barentsz was opened on Terschelling.

In 1878, the Netherlands christened the &quot;Willem Barentsz&quot; Arctic exploration ship.

In 1931, Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar published a play written by Albert Helman about Barentsz&#x27; third voyage, although it was never performed.

In 1946, the whaling ship &quot;Pan Gothia&quot; was re-christened the &quot;Willem Barentsz&quot;. In 1953, the second &quot;Willem Barentsz&quot; whaling ship was produced.

A protein in the molecular structure of the fruit fly was named &quot;Barentsz&quot;, in honour of the explorer.

Dutch filmmaker Reinout Oerlemans released a film called &quot;Nova Zembla&quot; in November 2011. It is the first Dutch 3D feature film.

In 2011, a team of volunteers started building a replica of Barentsz&#x27; ship in the Dutch town of Harlingen. The plan was to have the ship ready by 2018, when the Tall Ships&#x27; Races was scheduled to visit Harlingen.

<text>The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion (), later reorganized as the Foreign Legion of Patricios, was a Mexican Army unit which fought against the United States in the Mexican–American War. Consisting of several hundred mostly Irish and other Catholic European expatriates and immigrants, including numerous men who had deserted or defected from the United States Army, the battalion was formed and led by Irishman John Riley. It served as an artillery unit for much of the war, and despite later being formally designated as an infantry unit of two companies, the battalion continued to operate artillery pieces throughout the conflict. The participated in many of the bloodiest battles during the American invasion of Mexico, with Ulysses S. Grant remarking that &quot;Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in the valley of Mexico&quot;.

Composed primarily of Irish immigrants, the battalion also included German, Canadian, English, French, Italian, Polish, Scottish, Spanish, Swiss and Mexican soldiers, most of whom were Catholic. Several native-born Americans were in the ranks, including fugitive slaves from the Southern United States. Only a few members of the battalion were U.S. citizens. The Mexican government printed propaganda in different languages to entice immigrants serving in the United States Army to switch sides and offered incentives to foreigners who would enlist in its army, including being granted citizenship, being paid higher wages and generous land grants. U.S. Army regiments which had members defect included the 1st Artillery, the 2nd Artillery, the 3rd Artillery, the 4th Artillery, the 2nd Dragoons, the 2nd Infantry, the 3rd Infantry, the 4th Infantry, the 5th Infantry, the 6th Infantry, the 7th Infantry and the 8th Infantry. The are honored in both Mexico and Ireland.

==Historical perspective==
For those Mexicans who had fought in the Mexican–American War and for generations to come after, the were heroes who came to their aid in an hour of need. For Americans, the were traitors, fighting in an unjust attempt by Mexico to reconquer Texas. Successive Mexican presidents have praised the ; Vicente Fox Quesada stated that, &quot;The affinities between Ireland and Mexico go back to the first years of our nation, when our country fought to preserve its national sovereignty... Then, a brave group of Irish soldiers... in a heroic gesture, decided to fight against the foreign ground invasion&quot;, and Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo stated &quot;Members of the St. Patrick&#x27;s Battalion were executed for following their consciences. They were martyred for adhering to the highest ideals... we honor their memory. In the name of the people of Mexico, I salute today the people of Ireland and express my eternal gratitude&quot;.

==Motivations==
The great majority of those men who formed Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion were recent immigrants who had arrived at northeastern U.S. ports. They were part of the Irish diaspora then escaping the Great Irish Famine and extremely poor economic conditions in Ireland, which was at the time part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The U.S. Army often recruited the Irish and other immigrants into military service shortly or sometimes immediately after arrival in America in coffin ships with promises of salaries and land after the war.

Numerous theories have been proposed as to their motives for desertion, including cultural alienation, mistreatment of immigrant soldiers by nativist soldiers and senior officers, brutal military discipline and dislike of service in the U.S. military, being forced to attend Protestant church services and being unable to practice their Catholic religion freely as well as religious ideological convictions, the incentive of higher wages and land grants starting at offered by Mexico, and viewing the U.S. invasion of Mexico as unjust.

It is believed primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and sympathy for the Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence of the number of Irish Catholics in the battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Irish immigrants had been faced with animosity both as a result of their Catholic faith and ethnicity. Catholic immigrants were regularly met with discrimination from their Protestant peers, sentiments which sometimes boiled over into events such as the Philadelphia nativist riots against Irish Catholic immigrants. Catholic churches had been similarly defaced by the American military in Mexico during the war. Additionally, both the Mexicans and the Irish were subjected to racism and xenophobia based on racist pseudo-science and treated as inferior to American nativists.

Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while &quot;there was a portion of truth&quot; in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism; he said, &quot;I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result [desertion],&quot; and described how he found the punishments used for &quot;trivial offensives&quot; to be &quot;revolting and disgusting&quot;. Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.

Mexican author José Raúl Conseco noted that many Irish lived in northern Texas, and were forced to move south due to regional insecurity. Mainly Irish settlers from San Patricio, Texas, had previously sided with Mexican forces against Texan rebels at the Battle of Lipantitlán in the Texan Revolution.

Irish expatriates had a long tradition of serving as mercenaries in the military forces of Catholic countries, including in European countries after the Williamite War. In the decades leading up to the Mexican-American War many Irish fought in the South American wars of independence.

==Service as a military unit==

===Formation and early engagements===
Present in the Mexican Army for the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma were the &quot;Legión de Extranjeros&quot; (Legion of Foreigners); the men who would later make up the core of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s battalion. Meanwhile, deserters were abandoning General Taylor&#x27;s army on the Rio Grande. Riley and &quot;a company of 48 Irishmen&quot; manned Mexican artillery at the Siege of Fort Texas, which took place concurrently to the two other battles. Martin Tritschler, German Mexican and a Captain at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, is attributed with convincing a large number of German soldiers to defect from the U.S. occupying forces in Puebla, Puebla.

The first major engagement of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, as a recognised Mexican unit, was as an artillery battery in the Battle of Monterrey of 21 September 1846. Popularly they were called &quot;Los Colorados&quot; by the Mexicans because of their ruddy, sun-burnt complexions and red hair color. They were commanded by John Riley, an Irish artilleryman and veteran non-commissioned officer of the British Army, who possibly arrived in Canada in 1843 whilst serving in the British Army (the assertion that he served as a Sergeant in the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot, is known to be inaccurate) going on to join the U.S. Army in Michigan in September 1845. He deserted in Matamoros in April 1846. Upon meeting Mexican forces he was initially given the Officer rank of Lieutenant by General Pedro de Ampudia.
At the battle of Monterrey the proved their artillery skills by causing the deaths of many American soldiers, and they are credited with defeating two to three separate assaults into the heart of the city. Among their targets were companies led by such officers as Braxton Bragg, many of whose soldiers would end up in their own ranks later in the war. Their tenacity, however, did not affect the Mexican commanders&#x27; decision to capitulate and abandon the position.

Following the engagement at Monterrey, the grew in number, by some estimates reaching an enlistment of over 700 men. Forces re-assembled at San Luis Potosí and they had their distinct green silk flag embroidered there.

===Buena Vista===

They then marched northward after joining a larger force commanded by Antonio López de Santa Anna sent from Mexico City, the &quot;liberating army of the North&quot;. At the Battle of Buena Vista (known as the battle of Angostura in Mexico) in Coahuila on 23 February, the Patricios became engaged with U.S. forces. They were assigned the three heaviest—18 and 24 pound—cannons the Mexican army possessed, which were positioned on high ground overlooking the battlefield, at the base of a hillside (just below what is now a gravel mine). They were later described as &quot;a strong Mexican battery ... moved ... by dint of extraordinary exertions ... [that] commanded the entire plateau&quot;.

They started the battle supporting Mexican infantry by firing on U.S. lines as the Mexicans advanced on them, then later decimating an artillery battery directly opposite them on the battlefield (Washington&#x27;s 4th Artillery, D Battery). A small number of were dispatched with a division commanded by Manuel Lombardini with the express purpose of capturing the 4th&#x27;s cannons once the crews had been dealt with. As the division got close enough they charged the artillery battery, bayoneting whoever remained and routing the rest, leaving the attached free to haul away two six-pound cannons. These cannons would later be used by Mexican forces at the Battle of Contreras.

In frustration U.S. Commander Zachary Taylor, referring to the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, ordered a squadron of the 1st Dragoons to &quot;take that damned battery&quot;. In this task they failed, and, badly bloodied, were forced to retreat. At about 1 p.m. the covered a Mexican retreat as a disordered mass of infantry sought refuge during a lull in the fighting. The rode out the day in a costly artillery duel with several American batteries, which killed and injured roughly one third of them. General Francisco Mejia&#x27;s Battle Report for Buena Vista described the &#x27; as &quot;worthy of the most consummate praise because the men fought with daring bravery.&quot; Several Irishmen were awarded the War Cross by the Mexican government for their conduct in that battle, and many received field promotions.

===Re-organization and final battles===
Despite their excellent performance in a number of engagements as artillery, the much-reduced were ordered to muster a larger infantry battalion, as well as a cavalry unit, in mid-1847 by personal order of Santa Anna. It was renamed the Foreign Legion of Patricios and consisted of volunteers from many European countries, commanded by Col. Francisco R. Moreno, with Riley in charge of 1st company and Santiago O&#x27;Leary heading up the second. Desertion handbills were produced, specially targeting Catholic Irish, French and German immigrants in the invading U.S. army and stating that &quot;You must not fight against a religious people, nor should you be seen in the ranks of those who proclaim slavery of mankind as a constitutive principle ... liberty is not on the part of those who desire to be lords of the world, robbing properties and territories which do not belong to them and shedding so much blood in order to accomplish their views, views in open war to the principles of our holy religion&quot;.
The Battle of Churubusco (20 August 1847) took place about four months after the defeat at Cerro Gordo. Gen. Santa Anna gave a verbal order to &quot;preserve the point at all risk&quot;. The San Patricio Companies initially met the attackers outside the walls of the convent at a tête-de-pont, which was about from a fortified convent. A battery of three to five heavy cannons were used from this position to hold off the American advance along with support from &quot;Los Independencia Batallón&quot; and &quot;Los Bravos Batallón&quot;. The Americans were under the command of Col. William Hoffman. Several U.S. charges towards the bridgehead were thrown off, with the companies serving as an example to the supporting battalions. Unlike the , most of whom were veterans (many having served in the armies of the United Kingdom and various German states), the supporting Mexican battalions were simply militia (the term &#x27;National Guard&#x27; is also used) who had been untested by battle.

A lack of ammunition led the Mexican soldiers in the trenches between the bridgehead and the convent to disband; without ammunition, they had no way to fight back. Santa Anna had ordered half of these soldiers to a different part of the battlefield. When the requested ammunition wagon finally arrived, the 9 ½ drachm cartridges were compatible with none but the San Patricio Companies &quot;Brown Bess&quot; muskets, and they made up only a fraction of the defending forces. Further hampering Mexican efforts, a stray spark from an artillery piece firing grapeshot at the on-coming U.S. troops caused the just-arrived ammunition to explode and set fire to several men, including Captain O&#x27;Leary and Gen. Anaya. A withdrawal behind the walls of the &quot;convento de Churubusco&quot; was called when the threat of being outflanked proved too great.
The used this battle as a chance to settle old scores with U.S. troops: &quot;The large number of officers killed in the affair was ... ascribed to them, as for the gratification of their revenge they aimed at no other objects during the engagement&quot;. At some point during the fighting for the convent, two American officers led fifteen men against a point in the Mexican defenses, and mistook members for friendly U.S. army troops; the opened fire on them, killing or wounding all but one of the group. Though hopelessly outnumbered and under-equipped, the defenders repelled the attacking U.S. forces with heavy losses until their ammunition ran out and a Mexican officer raised the white flag of surrender. Officer Patrick Dalton of the tore the white flag down, prompting Gen. Pedro Anaya to order his men to fight on, with their bare hands if necessary. American Private Ballentine reported that when the Mexicans attempted to raise the white flag two more times, members of the shot and killed them. After brutal close-quarters fighting with bayonets and sabers through the halls and rooms inside the convent, U.S. Army Captain James M. Smith suggested a surrender after raising his white handkerchief. Following the U.S. victory, the Americans &quot;ventilat[ed] their vocabulary of Saxon expletives, not very &quot;courteously&quot;, on Riley and his beautiful disciples of St. Patrick.&quot;

Gen. Anaya stated in his written battle report that 35 were killed, 85 taken prisoner (including a wounded John Riley, Captain O&#x27;Leary, and Anaya); about 85 escaped with retreating Mexican forces. Some 60% of the were killed or captured in the engagement. The survivors were reformed before the Battle of Mexico City some two weeks later and were stationed at Querétaro where the Mexican government had decamped, with some 50 members serving as a body-guard for the commander-in-chief. The battalion were caught up in the infighting and politicking of Mexico at the time, and were under the patronage of a faction that favored suing for ending of the conflict peacefully. New units were later made up of the free survivors of the battle of Churubusco and a roughly equal number of fresh deserters from the U.S. Army. Following the war, the Mexican Government insisted in a clause of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that the remaining prisoners held by the Americans were to be left in Mexico, and Major General William Orlando Butler issued General Orders 116 on 1 June 1848 stating that; &quot;The prisoners confined at the Citadel, known as the prisoners, will be immediately discharged&quot;—Rogue&#x27;s March was played upon their release. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion continued to function as two infantry companies under the command of John Riley, with one unit tasked with sentry duty in Mexico City and the other was stationed in the suburbs of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The were officially mustered out of Mexican military service in 1848; some members were alleged to have been involved in an abortive military coup, while historians have said the group was disbanded because of Mexican budget cuts.

==Aftermath of Churubusco==

===Trials===
The captured by the U.S. Army were treated and punished as traitors for desertion in time of war. Seventy-two men were immediately charged with desertion by the Army.

Two separate courts-martial were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, and another at San Ángel on 26 August. At neither of these trials were the men represented by lawyers nor were transcripts made of the proceedings. This lack of formal legal advice could account for the fact that several of the men claimed that drunkenness had led them to desert (a common defense in military trials at the time that sometimes led to lighter sentences), and others described how they were forced to join the Mexican Army in some form or another. The majority of the either offered no defense or their defenses were not recorded. Wealthy Mexicans came to the &#x27; defence at the trials, and members of Mexico&#x27;s first families visited them in prison.

===Sentences===
One soldier who claimed he was forced to fight by the Mexicans after he was captured by them, and who subsequently refused to do so, was sentenced to death by firing squad instead of hanging, along with another who was found not to have officially joined the Mexican Army.

Most of the convicted were sentenced to death by hanging: 30 from the Tacubaya trial and 18 from San Ángel. The rationale was that they had entered Mexican military service following the declaration of war. Execution by hanging was in violation of the contemporary Articles of War, which stipulated that the penalty for desertion and/or defecting to the enemy during a time of war was death by firing squad, regardless of the circumstances. Hanging was reserved only for spies (without uniform) and for &quot;atrocities against civilians&quot;, neither of which activities were among the charges brought against any members of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion. Although more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers deserted the army during the Mexican–American War, only the (who unlike almost all other deserters had also fought against the United States) were punished by hanging.

Those soldiers who had left military service before the official declaration of war on Mexico (Riley among them) were sentenced to &quot;... receive 50 lashes on their bare backs, to be branded with the letter &#x27;D&#x27; for deserter, and to wear iron yokes around their necks for the duration of the war.&quot; This, too, went against the Articles of War; deserters who left prior to a declaration of war were supposed to be branded, scourged, &quot;or&quot; sentenced to hard labor. The &quot;San Patricios&quot; instead received all three punishments, a fate that once again was given to no other deserters during the war.

===Executions===
In all, 50 Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion members were officially executed by the U.S. Army, all but two by hanging. Collectively, this was the largest mass execution in United States history. (The hanging of 38 Sioux at the conclusion of the Dakota War of 1862 appears to have been the largest execution by hanging at a single event.) En masse executions for treason took place at three separate locations on three separate dates; 16 were executed on 10 September 1847 at San Ángel, four were executed the following day at the village of Mixcoac on 11 September, and 30 were hanged at Chapultepec on 13 September. One was murdered by American soldiers when he was recognised among the prisoners of war in the aftermath of the Battle of Molino del Rey, by being thrown &quot;into a mill flume and crushed by the wheel&quot;. 
At the San Ángel hangings all prisoners were executed without incident except for Patrick Dalton, who, as an American captain described, was &quot;literally choked to death&quot;. Dalton had previously voiced concerns regarding his treatment.

By order of Gen. Winfield Scott, thirty were to be executed at Chapultepec in full view of the two armies while they fought the Battle of Chapultepec, at the precise moment that the flag of the U.S. replaced the flag of Mexico atop the citadel. This order was carried out by Col. William Harney. Harney was taunted and jeered by the condemned men. 
While overseeing the hangings, Harney ordered Francis O&#x27;Connor hanged although he had had both legs amputated the previous day. When the army surgeon informed the colonel that the absent soldier had lost both his legs in battle, Harney replied: &quot;Bring the damned son of a bitch out! My order was to hang 30 and by God I&#x27;ll do it!&quot;

The U.S. flag appeared on the flagpole at 9.30 a.m. Legend has it that the Mexican flag had been taken by a cadet, of the Niños Héroes, who leapt with it to his death from Chapultepec Castle to deny the Americans the honor of capturing it. In a final act of defiance, the men about to be hanged cheered the Mexican flag, as one onlooker remarked; &quot;Hands tied, feet tied, their voices still free&quot;. At Harney&#x27;s signal, the carts holding the tied and noosed men pulled away. Harney refused to cut the bodies down, stating that &quot;I was ordered to have them hanged, and have no orders to &quot;unhang&quot; them&quot;. Harney was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, which rank he held while the U.S. Army occupied Mexico City.

The Mexican government described the hangings as &quot;a cruel death or horrible torments, improper in a civilized age, and [ironic] for a people who aspire to the title of illustrious and humane&quot;, and by a writer covering the war as &quot;a refinement of cruelty and ... fiendish&quot;. George Ballentine remarked, in his account of his American military service in Mexico, &quot;[T]he desertion of our soldiers to the Mexican army ... were still numerous, in spite of the fearful example of the executions at Churubusco, [and] also served to inspire that party with hope.&quot; 

==Legacy==
Those who survived either made lives for themselves in Mexico or returned to their home nations such as Ireland. Some former found work at the arsenal in Guadalajara making gun stocks. One former , an Irishman, started a military academy teaching &quot;the sword exercise&quot;, also in Guadalajara. Others were reportedly killed while travelling through Mexico, while others were reduced to living on handouts. A handful are on record as having made use of the land claims promised them by the Mexican government. Americans in Mexico who had been taken prisoner by Mexico or who were common deserters were known to falsely present themselves as members of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion; American William W. Carpenter, who found himself in this predicament, stated that: &quot;the reputation of the San Patricio battalion was spread from ocean to ocean, and to that, more than any thing else, do I owe my present safety&quot;.

The men have continued to be honored and revered as heroes in Mexico. The is memorialised on two separate days; 12 September, the generally accepted anniversary of the executions of those battalion members captured by the U.S. Army, and 17 March, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Numerous schools, churches and other landmarks in Mexico take their name from the battalion, including:
* Monterrey: The street in front of the Irish School is named (Battalion of Saint Patrick).
* Mexico City: The street in front of the Santa María de Churubusco convent was named &quot;Mártires Irlandeses&quot; (&quot;the Irish martyrs&quot;).
* The Wall of Honor in Mexico&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies: On Thursday, 28 October 2002 the LVII Mexican Congress held a ceremony where the inscription &quot;&quot; [Defenders of the Motherland 1846–1848 and the San Patricio Battalion] was inscribed in gold letters.
* &quot; [St. Patrick&#x27;s Battalion Pipes &amp; Drums]: The only bagpipe band in Mexico is named after the battalion, and based at the former Convent of Churubusco in Mexico City, which now houses the Museum of Foreign Interventions (). The band was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame in 2013.
* San Patricio station: Metro Zapata was renamed for one day to Metro San Patricio, on 17 March 2015, to commemorate Saint Patrick&#x27;s day and the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion. This was the first time a metro had been renamed in such a manner.

In the U.S., the memory of the battalion has been different. In Winfield Scott&#x27;s 1852 run for President of the United States, his treatment of the was brought up by his opponents to sway Irish American voters. The U.S. Army long denied the existence of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, as a cover-up and an attempt to discourage other deserters. In 1915, an inquiry was initiated by U.S. congressmen William Henry Coleman and Frank L. Greene. This resulted in the U.S. Army&#x27;s admitting its denial of the matter. The U.S. Congress ordered the army to turn over its records on the battalion to the National Archives. In 1999, MGM cancelled the U.S. distribution of a film depicting the battalion, &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot;. The &quot;San Patricios&quot; are rarely covered in American education; on the rare occasion that they are mentioned, it is pointed out that they were traitors (if holding US citizenship), and small in number. Reasons given for having abandoned the United States included religious sympathy, and pursuit of money and land.

In 1997, President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo commemorated the 150th anniversary of the execution of the at a ceremony in Mexico City&#x27;s San Jacinto Plaza. This is where the U.S. Army conducted the first 16 hangings after the men were convicted of desertion at court martial. Ireland and Mexico jointly issued commemorative postage stamps to mark the anniversary.

In 2004, at an official ceremony attended by numerous international dignitaries, including directors Lance and Jason Hool and several actors from the film &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot;, the Mexican government gave a commemorative statue to the Irish government in perpetual thanks for the bravery, honor and sacrifice of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion. The statue was erected in the town of Clifden, Connemara, Ireland, where leader John Riley was born. Clifden flies the Mexican flag in honor of Riley every year on 12 September. In 2014, Sinn Féin named a in Clifden in honor of Reilly.

The battalion has inspired numerous responses: it is the name of an supporters&#x27;s association of the association football team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. The unit was evoked in a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day message from Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, The have been remembered as a symbol of international solidarity with Mexico.

==Flag==

There are conflicting accounts of the design of the flag of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion. No flags or depictions of them are known to have survived to the present day. The only version of the flag known to have survived the war was subsequently lost or stolen from the chapel at West Point.

John Riley, who left an account of the battalion, noted the flag in a letter:


According to George Wilkins Kendall, an American journalist covering the war with Mexico:

Two other eye-witness accounts of the flag exist, both from American soldiers. The first describes it as:

The second notes only:

A radically different version of the flag was described in a Mexican source:

Whatever the case, in 1997 a reproduction military flag was created by the Clifden and Connemara Heritage Group. Another was created the following year for the MGM film &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot;, a romanticised version of the &#x27; history. A third version embodying the description of the San Luis Potosí flag was made for the Irish Society of Chicago, which hung it in the city&#x27;s Union League Club.

Some writers suggest that the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion might have used different banners (as an artillery unit, as an infantry company, and as a reconstructed unit).

<doc id="60044" wikidata="Q399625" url="?curid=60044" title="Sadao Munemori">
<text>Sadao Munemori (, August 17, 1922 – April 5, 1945) was a United States Army soldier and posthumous recipient of the Medal of Honor, after he sacrificed his life to save those of his fellow soldiers at Seravezza, Italy during World War II.

Munemori was a private first class in the United States Army, in Company A, 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. For his actions, when the 442nd was part of the 92d Infantry Division, he was the only Japanese American to be awarded the Medal of Honor during or immediately after World War II.

==Early life==
Munemori was born in Los Angeles, California to Japanese immigrant parents Kametaro and Nawa Munemori. He was a &quot;Nisei&quot;, a second generation Japanese American. He grew up in the suburb of Glendale and graduated from Abraham Lincoln Senior High School in 1940 before becoming an auto mechanic.

==Soldier==
Munemori had volunteered for the U.S. Army in November 1941, one month before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and he was inducted in February 1942. Along with all other Japanese American soldiers, he was soon after demoted to 4-C class, removed from combat training and assigned to menial labor. While he was transferred to a series of Midwestern and Southern army bases (eventually winding up at Camp Savage, Minnesota), his parents and siblings were incarcerated at Manzanar.

When Japanese American soldiers were allowed to reenter active service in March 1943, Munemori volunteered to be part of the all-&quot;Nisei&quot; 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This segregated army unit was made up entirely of Japanese Americans, with most initial recruits coming from Hawaii. The unit began as the 100th Infantry, initially listed as a separate battalion, and fought as part of the 133rd Infantry Regiment within the 34th Infantry Division. After the Allied capture of Rome, the battalion withdrew from the front and became the 1st Battalion of the 442nd RCT. Munemori was sent to Camp Shelby in January 1944 and, after completing his combat training three months later, joined the 100th Battalion in the European Theater. Fighting in Italy and France, he participated in the rescue of the Lost Battalion before arriving on the Gothic Line, where he was killed in action saving the lives of two of his comrades.

In 1990s, the awards issued to 442nd soldiers were reviewed after two studies revealed that racial discrimination had caused some to be overlooked, and twenty-one soldiers&#x27; Distinguished Service Crosses were upgraded to Medals of Honor.

==Awards and decorations==
Sadao &quot;Spud&quot; Munemori received these awards during World War II:


==Medal of Honor citation==
Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company A, 100th Infantry Battalion, 442d Combat Team. Place and date: Near Seravezza, Italy, 5 April 1945. Entered service at: Los Angeles, Calif Birth: Los Angeles, Calif. G.O. No.. 24, 7 March 1946.

&quot;The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pride in presenting the Medal of Honor (Posthumously) to Private First Class Sadao S. Munemori (ASN: 39019023), United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Company A, 100th Infantry Battalion, 442d Regimental Combat Team, attached to the 92d Infantry Division, in action against the enemy on 5 April 1945. Private First Class Munemori fought with great gallantry and intrepidity near Seravezza, Italy. When his unit was pinned down by grazing fire from the enemy&#x27;s strong mountain defense and command of the squad devolved on him with the wounding of its regular leader, he made frontal, one-man attacks through direct fire and knocked out two machine guns with grenades. Withdrawing under murderous fire and showers of grenades from other enemy emplacements, he had nearly reached a shell crater occupied by two of his men when an unexploded grenade bounced on his helmet and rolled toward his helpless comrades. He arose into the withering fire, dived for the grenade, and smothered its blast with his body. By his swift, supremely heroic action Private First Class Munemori saved two of his men at the cost of his own life and did much to clear the path for his company&#x27;s victorious advance.&quot;

<doc id="60045" wikidata="Q3304442" url="?curid=60045" title="Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa">
<text>Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa () is a Spanish mission founded September 1, 1772 by Father Junípero Serra in San Luis Obispo, California. The mission was named after San Luis, obispo de Talosa (Saint Louis, bishop of Toulouse, France).

The Mission of San Luis Obispo is unusual in its design, in that its combination of belfry and vestibule are found nowhere else among the California missions. Like other churches, the main nave is short and narrow, but at the San Luis Obispo Mission, there is a secondary nave of almost equal size situated to the right of the altar, making it the only L-shaped mission church in California.

==History==
===Founding of the mission (1772)===
In 1769, Gaspar de Portolá traveled through California on his way to the Bay of Monterey and traveled through the San Luis Obispo area. Expedition diarist and Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí wrote that the soldiers called the place &quot;llano de los osos&quot;, or the &quot;plain of the bears&quot;. Portola followed the same route the following year, on his way to establish the Presidio of Monterey. Missionary president Junípero Serra, traveling by sea, met the Portola party there and founded San Carlos Borremeo, in Monterey, which was moved to Carmel the following year.

When food supplies started to dwindle at the mission, Serra remembered the stories of the &quot;valley of the bears.&quot; He decided to send a hunting expedition to San Luis Obispo to help feed the Spanish and neophytes (natives that converted to Christianity) in Monterey. The success of the hunting expedition caused Junípero Serra to consider building a mission in that area. Upon further investigation, he was convinced that San Luis Obispo would be a perfect site for a mission, based on its surplus of natural resources, good weather and the Chumash, a local Native American tribe who could be used as labor, often by means of enslavement. The mission became the fifth in the mission chain founded by Father Junípero Serra. Serra himself was known for intimidating and controlling native subjects, and once baptized, the Chumash were not allowed to leave the missions, nor were the generations to follow. 

Father Serra sent an expedition down south to San Luis Obispo to start building the mission, and on September 1, 1772, a cross was erected near San Luis Obispo Creek and Serra celebrated the first mass. Following the first mass, Father Junípero Serra left the responsibility of construction to Father José Cavaller. The mission was to be named after San Luis, obispo de Tolosa, a saint that is popular within the Franciscan order. Father Cavaller used Chumash labor in building the palisades, which would serve as temporary buildings for the mission. Native American tribes set these buildings ablaze in an act of resistance against European colonization. The buildings were rebuilt using adobe and tile structures.

Beginning in 1794 Mission San Luis Obispo went through extensive building operations. Buildings to accommodate the nearby Native Americans and many improvements to the mission, including storerooms, residences for single women, soldiers barracks and mills were added. The renovation was finished after completion of the quadrangle in 1819, and celebrated a year later by the arrival of two mission bells from Lima, Peru. The arrival of the bells marked the end of improvements made to Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa for many years. In 1830 Father Luis Gil y Taboada took over the mission, but he died three years later. In 1842, the death of Father Ramon Abella marked the last Franciscan at the mission for the next 40 years.

=== Rancho period (1834–1849) ===
In 1845, Governor Pío Pico sold the San Luis Obispo Mission to Captain John Wilson for $510. John C. Frémont and his &quot;California Battalion&quot; used the mission as a base of operations during their war with Mexico in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt). The mission fell to ruins during the period of secularization and the priests who were left would rent out rooms to help support the mission.

=== California statehood (since 1850) ===
The Mission San Luís Obispo de Tolosa became the first courthouse and jail in San Luis Obispo County, California. In 1850, when California became a part of the United States, the first California bishop, Joseph Alemany, petitioned the Government to return some of the mission lands back to the Church. Since then, it has undergone major civic, political and structural changes. In the 1880s, the front portico and bell loft were removed when weakened by an earthquake. An attempt was made to &quot;modernize&quot; the structures, and the colonnades along the front of the convento wing were razed and the Church and residence were covered with wooden clapboard. A New England–style belfry was added. The changes protected the structure from further decay, although significantly altering the facade of the buildings. In the 1930s, during the pastorship of Fr. John Harnett, the buildings underwent extensive restoration to transform them back to early mission style. The 1893 annex was extended in 1948. The mission is the center of the busy downtown area, and functions as a Catholic parish church for the City of San Luis Obispo in the Diocese of Monterey.

==Mission plaza==
In 1970 the Mission was recognized as the center of the City of San Luis Obispo, with the dedication of Mission Plaza. Mayor Ken Schwartz worked with students from Cal Poly to develop a plan to convince voters to close Monterey Street in front of the mission. Construction of a plaza began in 1969 and the plaza was dedicated in 1970. A statue of Junípero Serra was installed on the grounds facing the public Mission Plaza. The attention to the statues of Junípero Serra expanded during the George Floyd protests to include monuments of individuals associated with the controversy over the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas. The statue was moved into storage on the grounds in 2020.

The plaza in front of the mission often serves as a location for demonstrations and protests in the San Luis Obispo county.

<text>Samuel Jones Tilden (February 9, 1814 – August 4, 1886) was an American politician who served as the 25th governor of New York and was the Democratic nominee in the disputed 1876 United States presidential election.

Tilden was born in 1814 into a wealthy family in New Lebanon, New York. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a protégé of Martin Van Buren. After studying at Yale University and New York University School of Law, Tilden began a legal career in New York City, becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the New York State Assembly and helped launch Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy in the 1848 United States presidential election. A War Democrat who opposed slavery, Tilden opposed Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election, but later supported him and the Union during the Civil War. Afterward, he became the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and managed Horatio Seymour&#x27;s campaign in the 1868 presidential election.

Tilden initially cooperated with the state party&#x27;s Tammany Hall faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss William M. Tweed&#x27;s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as governor of New York in 1874, and in that office, he helped break up the Canal Ring. His battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in New York, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the party&#x27;s nominee on the second ballot. In the general election, Tilden faced Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the gold standard, and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending Reconstruction in the Southern United States.

Tilden won the popular vote by 250,000 votes. However, 20 electoral votes were in dispute, leaving both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the electoral vote. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden&#x27;s wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan Electoral Commission to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Commission, and decided in a series of party-line rulings that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the Compromise of 1877, Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden is the only presidential candidate to win an absolute majority of the popular vote while losing the election. He subsequently left politics and died in 1886.

==Early life==
Tilden was born in New Lebanon, New York, the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden. He was descended from Nathaniel Tilden, an early English settler who came to North America in 1634. His father and other family members were the makers of patent medicines including Tilden&#x27;s Extract, a popular concoction of the 1800s and early 1900s that was derived from cannabis. Tilden&#x27;s father maintained relationships with many influential New York politicians, including President Martin Van Buren, who became Tilden&#x27;s political idol. Tilden was frequently in poor health during his youth, and he spent much of his time studying politics and reading works such as &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Tilden&#x27;s health troubles prevented him from regularly attending school, and he dropped out of Williams Academy after three months and Yale College after a single term in 1834–1835.

Likely motivated by a family friendship with Benjamin Franklin Butler, then serving as a professor at New York University School of Law, Tilden enrolled there to resume his studies and continued to attend intermittently from 1838 to 1841. While studying at NYU, Tilden also read law in the office of attorney John W. Edmonds. He was admitted to the bar in 1841 and became a skilled corporate lawyer. Tilden affiliated with the Democratic Party and frequently campaigned on behalf of Van Buren and other Democratic candidates.

==Early political career==
In 1843, Tilden was appointed as New York City&#x27;s corporation counsel, a reward for his campaign work for Governor William C. Bouck. Tilden handled hundreds of cases on behalf of the city, but was forced out of office in 1844 after New York City elected a Whig mayor. He served as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention, which rejected Van Buren and nominated James K. Polk for president. At the urging of Governor Silas Wright, Tilden won election to the New York State Assembly. He became a key ally to Wright and helped end the Anti-Rent War by passing a compromise land bill that defused tensions between tenant farmers and their landlords. After serving as a delegate to the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention, Tilden left public office to focus on his legal practice, where he gained a national reputation as a &quot;financial physician&quot; for struggling railroads. Tilden&#x27;s successful legal practice, combined with shrewd investments, made him rich. His success at money management and investing caused many of his friends, relatives, and political allies, including Van Buren, to allow Tilden to manage their finances.

Tilden was a leader of the &quot;Barnburners&quot;, an anti-slavery faction of the New York Democratic Party that arose during the debate over the Wilmot Proviso. Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the land acquired from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He helped organize the 1848 Free Soil Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy in the 1848 presidential election drew votes from Democratic nominee Lewis Cass in New York, which played a role in the victory of Whig nominee Zachary Taylor. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the Republican Party in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. In 1855, Tilden was the unsuccessful state attorney general candidate of the &quot;Soft&quot; faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party. In 1859, after he lost an election to serve as New York City&#x27;s corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was &quot;out of politics.&quot;

In the 1860 presidential election, Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee Abraham Lincoln. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war. Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the Union after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Tilden served as the manager of Horatio Seymour&#x27;s successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the presidential nomination for George B. McClellan at the 1864 Democratic National Convention.

In 1867, Tilden received the honorary degree of LL.D. from New York University. He was also chosen as a delegate to that year&#x27;s state constitutional convention.

==State party leader==
Following the end of the Civil War, Tilden won the election for chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee. He served as Seymour&#x27;s campaign chairman in the 1868 presidential election, but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee Ulysses S. Grant. After the election, Tilden broke with William M. Tweed, the leader of the Tammany Hall political machine. Through bribery, patronage, and control of Irish-American voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York. In 1871, former Tammany associate James O&#x27;Brien leaked Tweed&#x27;s account books to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed&#x27;s bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was &quot;time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.&quot; The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the 1871 state elections, and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.

Tilden&#x27;s role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected governor of New York in 1874. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the &quot;Canal Ring,&quot; a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the New York State Canal System. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of scandals that had come into public view during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant.

In 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from Yale University. At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his Bachelor of Arts degree.

==Presidential election of 1876==
===Democratic nomination===
By the time of the June 1876 Democratic National Convention, Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the 1876 presidential election. Tilden&#x27;s appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country&#x27;s most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge were so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he had predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes. Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the presidency after four consecutive defeats, Tilden faced competition from some of the party&#x27;s most prominent leaders, including Thomas F. Bayard, Allen G. Thurman, Thomas A. Hendricks, and General Winfield Scott Hancock.

During the difficult economic times of the Panic of 1873, the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of currency. Many &quot;soft money&quot; Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act and authorize the printing of more greenbacks, banknotes that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in inflation and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and &quot;hard money&quot; members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the gold standard) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden&#x27;s lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden&#x27;s reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden&#x27;s hard money views.

Tilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention (404.5), but fell short of the two-thirds majority (492) required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss John Kelly and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden&#x27;s running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions. Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.

===General election===
Per tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed Abram Hewitt to lead his campaign. The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign. The Democrats campaigned on the theme of &quot;retrenchment and reform&quot; and attacked the &quot;corrupt centralism&quot; of the Grant administration. Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised civil service reform and hard money policies. Meanwhile, Republicans focused on their party&#x27;s identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion. Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War. For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden&#x27;s emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end Reconstruction and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three &quot;unredeemed&quot; Southern states. Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning African-American voters. Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the Hamburg massacre, in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.

Both campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key swing states, but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states. Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the border states, and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one electoral vote short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was &quot;of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.&quot; Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General George B. McClellan as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.

===Post-election controversy===
With the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6,000. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states. On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state&#x27;s electoral votes. On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to &quot;systemic intimidation,&quot; leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state&#x27;s electoral votes. Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes. Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the Post Office violated the United States Constitution. After Watts resigned, the state&#x27;s Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state&#x27;s two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts&#x27;s resignation.

On December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president. With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that Thomas W. Ferry, a Republican senator from Michigan and the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a contingent election in the United States House of Representatives. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election. In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden&#x27;s argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns. He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt&#x27;s suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.

===Electoral Commission===
On January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice David Davis, a political independent, but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican Joseph P. Bradley, was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission. In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.

Even after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the results. Though some House Democrats hoped to do so, they were unable, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in voting to accept. During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The Compromise of 1877, as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission&#x27;s rulings, although author Roy Morris Jr. argues that the compromise &quot;was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.&quot; Some other historians, including C. Vann Woodward, have argued that the Compromise of 1877 played the decisive role in determining the outcome of the election. On March 2, two days before the end of Grant&#x27;s term, Congress declared Hayes the victor of the 1876 presidential election. Hayes took office on March 4, and withdrew the last federal soldiers from the South in April 1877, bringing an end to the Reconstruction Era.

Some Democrats urged Tilden to reject the results and take the presidential oath of office, but Tilden declined to do so. On March 3, the House passed a resolution declaring Tilden the &quot;duly elected President of the United States,&quot; but this had no legal effect. Tilden himself stated that, &quot;I can retire to private life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares and responsibilities of the office.&quot; Tilden was the second individual, after Andrew Jackson in 1824, to lose a presidential election despite winning at least a plurality of the popular vote. Tilden remains the only individual to lose a presidential election while winning an outright majority of the popular vote.

==Later life==
===Potter Committee===
In 1878, Democratic Congressman Clarkson Nott Potter convinced the House of Representatives to create a committee to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in the 1876 election. Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election. Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by Western Union. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; editor Whitelaw Reid obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party&#x27;s argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency. A congressional committee&#x27;s investigation into the Cipher Telegrams cleared Tilden of any personal wrongdoing, but the allegations damaged his national standing.

===Elections of 1880 and 1884===
After the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in 1880 presidential election. He declined to run for another term as governor in 1879, focusing instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination. The revelations of the Potter Committee, along with Tilden&#x27;s persistent health issues, both damaged Tilden&#x27;s national standing, but his superior political organization and personal fortune ensured that he remained a serious contender for the Democratic nomination. Tilden&#x27;s standing with the party slipped further following the Republican victory in the 1879 New York gubernatorial election, where a revitalized Tammany Hall organization split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden&#x27;s faction. In the months before the 1880 Democratic National Convention, rumors about Tilden&#x27;s intentions circulated wildly, but Tilden refused to definitively state whether or not he would seek the Democratic nomination.

As the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, Daniel Manning, suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination. Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only if he was the unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden&#x27;s letter available to the New York delegation. The New York delegation interpreted the letter as a notice of withdrawal, and the delegates began looking for a new candidate, eventually settling on Speaker of the House Samuel J. Randall. Ultimately, the party nominated Winfield Scott Hancock, who lost the election to James A Garfield.

Though many Democrats favored Tilden for the party&#x27;s nomination in the 1884 presidential election, Tilden once again declined to run due to poor health. He endorsed New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the Democratic nomination and went on to defeat James G. Blaine in the general election.

===Retirement and death===

Tilden retired in the early 1880s, living as a near-recluse at his estate, Greystone (now part of Untermyer Park and Gardens) in Yonkers, New York. He died a bachelor at Greystone on August 4, 1886, at the age of 72. He is buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York. In reference to the 1876 election, Tilden&#x27;s gravestone bears the words, &quot;I Still Trust The People&quot;.

Of his fortune, estimated at $7 million (equivalent to $ million in ), $4 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was bequeathed for the establishment and maintenance of a free public library and reading-room in the City of New York; but, as the will was successfully contested by relatives, only about $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was applied to its original purpose. In 1895, the Tilden Trust was combined with the Astor and Lenox libraries to found the New York Public Library, and the building bears his name on its front.

==Legacy==

The Samuel J. Tilden House at 15 Gramercy Park South, which he owned from 1860 until his death, is now used by the National Arts Club. Tilden&#x27;s Greystone property is now known as Untermyer Park; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Several places have been named for Tilden, including Tilden, Wisconsin, Tilden, Nebraska, Tilden, Texas, Tilden Township, Pennsylvania, and Grove Park-Tilden Township, Minnesota. The Gov. Samuel J. Tilden Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Other things named for Tilden include Samuel J. Tilden High School, Fort Tilden, New York, and the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship.

<text>The Mission San Francisco de Asís (), also known as Mission Dolores, is a historic Catholic church complex in San Francisco, California. Operated by the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the complex was founded in the 18th century by Spanish Catholic missionaries. The mission contains two historic buildings:

* The Mission Dolores adobe chapel, constructed in 1776. It is the oldest structure in San Francisco.
* The Mission Dolores Basilica, constructed in 1918. It was designated a minor basilica by Pope Pius XII in 1952.

Located in the Mission District, the mission complex was founded on October 9, 1776, by Frs Francisco Palóu and Pedro Benito Cambón. The Franciscan Order sent the two priests to the Spanish Province of Alta California to bring in Spanish settlers and evangelize the indigenous Ohlone people. The Mission Dolores Basilica replaced a brick church built in 1876 that was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.

==History==

=== 1700 to 1800 ===
The site of the future Mission San Francisco was scouted by the Spanish missionary Pedro Font in March 1776 during a visit to the Bay Area by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza. The Spanish missionaries named the new mission San Francisco de Asís, in honor of Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan Order. It became commonly known as Mission Dolores, after the nearby creek, &quot;Arroyo de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows Creek)&quot;

On October 9, 1776, the missionaries dedicated a small chapel in present-day San Francisco as the Mission San Francisco. According to some sources, the chapel stood near the present intersection of Camp and Albion Streets&quot;.&quot; Members of the local Ramaytush Ohlone tribe are recorded as entering the mission in 1785. They would later provide the labor to build the new mission church.

The construction of adobe walls for the Mission Dolores church began in 1788, with the Ohlone laborers manufacturing 36,000 bricks. By 1790, the walls were completed, plastered, and whitewashed.The missionary Junípero Serra is recorded as having celebrated a mass at the chapel while it was still under construction.

The Mission Dolores adobe church was finished in 1791. The new church had adobe walls that were four feet thick. The roof beams were redwood and the ceiling displayed traditional Ohlone designs, painted in vegetable dyes. The mission complex at this time included a convent and facilities for agriculture and manufacturing.

=== 1800 to 1848 ===
The early 19th century saw the greatest period of activity at Mission San Francisco:

At its peak in 1810–1820, the average Indian population at Pueblo Dolores was about 1,100 people. In 1810 the Mission owned 11,000 sheep, 11,000 cows, and thousands of horses, goats, pigs, and mules. Its ranching and farming operations extended as far south as San Mateo and east to Alameda. Horses were corralled on Potrero Hill, and the milking sheds for the cows were located along Dolores Creek at what is today Mission High School. Twenty looms were kept in operation to process wool into cloth. The circumference of the Mission&#x27;s holdings was said to have been about 125 miles.

In 1817, the Franciscans established the Mission San Rafael Arcángel in San Rafael, California as an a&quot;sistencia&quot; to act as a hospital for the Mission San Francisco de Asís. San Rafael became an independent mission in 1822.

With the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the newly independent Mexico took control of Alta California. Relations were strained between the new Mexican Government and the Franciscan overseers of the California missions. Supplies were scarce and over 5,000 Native Americans had died from disease and other causes at the Mission San Francisco. The Mexican Government decided to free the Native Americans who were under mission guardianship and give them mission lands.

New regulations under the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833 forced the missions in 1834 to start selling their vast commercial properties. In practical terms, this meant that each mission could only own its church, its priests residence and small plots of land surrounding the church for gardens. The Mission San Francisco sold most of its property in 1836. By 1842, only eight Native Americans were still residing there.

=== 1848 to 1900 ===

After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, the Mission San Francisco and the rest of Alta California became part of the United States. With the end of Mexican authority, the rules governing the California missions became defunct.

In 1848, the California Gold Rush brought a surge of American immigrants and commercial activity to the San Francisco area. In the 1850s, the city constructed two plank roads from the downtown area to the Mission District. The area soon became a popular resort and entertainment center. The Franciscans sold or leased some of the remaining mission land to developers who built saloons and gambling halls. By 1857, the Franciscans had turned control of the Mission San Francisco to the Archdiocese of San Francisco.

During the late 19th century, the archdiocese converted part of the old convent into a two-story wooden wing for use as a seminary and priests&#x27; residence. The rest of the convent building became the Mansion House, a tavern. By 1876, the archdiocese had razed the Mansion House, replacing it with a large Gothic Revival brick church to accommodate more congregants than the adobe church

The archdiocese also covered the adobe church with clapboard siding for both cosmetic and protective reasons. The siding was removed in a later renovation.

=== 1900 to the present ===
The 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed the brick church and damaged the adobe building. To prevent the huge fire sparked by the earthquake from engulfing the two buildings, firefighters blew up the convent and School of Notre Dame building across the street. In 1913, the archdiocese began constructing the Mission Dolores Church to replace the destroyed brick church. The architect Willis Polk restored the adobe building in 1917.

The construction of the new Mission Dolores Church experienced delays due to the American entry into World War I in 1917. It was finally completed in 1918. The church was remodeled in 1926, with the archdiocese adding churrigueresque ornamentation. These were inspired by exhibits at the 1915 Panama–California Exposition in San Diego, California.

In 1952, Archbishop John J. Mitty announced that Pope Pius XII had elevated Mission Dolores to the status of a minor basilica. It became the first minor basilica west of the Mississippi River and the fifth one in the United States.

Today, the church constructed in 1918 is referred to as the Mission Dolores Basilica while the 1791 adobe chapel is called the Mission Dolores. The mission complex also includes a historic cemetery.

==Art==

=== Mission Dolores Mural ===

The Mission Dolores adobe chapel contains the Mission Dolores mural, painted in 1791 by Ohlone artists. The mural covers the entire rear wall of the building, behind the historic wooden altar. It measures 22 by 20 feet and includes two statuary niches. In 1796, the Franciscans installed a baroque-style relief sculpture called a &quot;reredos&quot; in front of the mural. In later years, the mural was covered up with wooden boarding. The mural was rediscovered during a renovation in 1910.

Part of the mural depicts the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. The mural also contains the image of a rooster, a Christian symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.

===Junípero Serra statue===

The Junípero Serra statue is located on the grounds of the Mission San Francisco complex. The cast stone sculpture was designed by the American artist Arthur Putnam and completed in 1909. It was cast between 1916 and 1917, and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled.

Funding for the sculpture came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately 6 ft 6 in tall. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a Franciscan friar&#x27;s robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is one of a series of allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well-maintained.

=== Francis of Assisi stained glass window ===
The Mission Dolores Basilica contains a stained glass window of Francis of Assisi, created by the German artist Franz Xaver Zettler at the time of the church&#x27;s construction.

<text>Mission San Juan Capistrano () is a Spanish mission in San Juan Capistrano, Orange County, California. Founded November 1, 1776 in colonial &quot;Las Californias&quot; by Spanish Catholic missionaries of the Franciscan Order, it was named for Saint John of Capistrano. The Spanish Colonial Baroque style church was located in the Alta California province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Mission was founded less than 60 yards from the village of Acjacheme. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and returned to the Roman Catholic Church by the United States government in 1865. The Mission was damaged over the years by a number of natural disasters, but restoration and renovation efforts date from around 1910. It functions today as a museum.

==Introduction==
The mission was founded in 1776, by the Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order. Named for Saint John of Capistrano, a 14th-century theologian and &quot;warrior priest&quot; who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy, San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use, a chapel built in 1782. &quot;Father Serra&#x27;s Church&quot;, also known as &quot;Serra&#x27;s Chapel&quot;, is the only extant structure where it has been documented that Junipero Serra celebrated Mass. The mission is one of the best known in Alta California, and one of the few to have actually been founded twice – the others being Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission La Purísima Concepción. The site was originally consecrated on October 30, 1775, by Fermín Lasuén, but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego.

The success of the settlement&#x27;s population is evident in its historical records. Prior to the arrival of the missionaries, some 550 indigenous Acjachemen people lived in this area of their homeland. By 1790, the number of Indian reductions had grown to 700 Mission Indians, and just six years later nearly 1,000 &quot;neophytes&quot; (recent converts) lived in or around the Mission compound. Baptisms in that year alone numbered 1,649 out of the none total 4,639 people converted between 1776 and 1847.

More than 69 former inhabitants, mostly &quot;Juaneño&quot; Indians, have marked graves in the Mission&#x27;s cemetery (&quot;campo santo&quot;). The remains of (later Monsignor) St. John O&#x27;Sullivan, who recognized the property&#x27;s historic value and working tirelessly to conserve and rebuild its structures, are buried at the entrance to the cemetery on west side of the property, and a statue raised in his honor stands at the head of the crypt. The surviving chapel also serves as the final resting place of three priests who passed on while serving at the Mission: José Barona, Vicente Fustér, and Vicente Pascual Oliva are all entombed beneath the sanctuary floor.

The &quot;Criolla&quot; or &quot;Mission grape,&quot; was first planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779, and in 1783 the first wine produced in Alta California was from the Mission&#x27;s winery.

The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after Mexican government secularization in 1833. After 1850 U.S. statehood, numerous efforts were made over the latter 19th century to restore the Mission to its former state, but none achieved much success until the arrival of O&#x27;Sullivan in 1910. Restoration efforts continue, and the chapel called &quot;Father Serra Church&quot; is still used for religious services.

Over 500,000 visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission each year. And while the ruins of &quot;The Great Stone Church&quot; (which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake) are a renowned architectural wonder, the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual &quot;Return of the Swallows&quot; which is traditionally observed every March 19 (&quot;Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day&quot;). Mission San Juan Capistrano has served as a favorite subject for many notable artists, and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times.

In 1984, a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound and is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano. Today, the mission compound serves as a museum, with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish.

== History==

===Indigenous peoples===

 The former Spanish settlement at Sajavit lies within that area occupied during the late Paleoindian period and continuing on into the present day by the Native American society commonly known as the &quot;Juaneño&quot;; the name denotes those people who were ministered by the priests at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Many contemporary &quot;Juaneño&quot;, who identify themselves as descendants of the indigenous society living in the local San Juan and San Mateo Creek drainage areas, have adopted the indigenous term &quot;Acjachemen&quot;. Their language was related to the &quot;Luiseño&quot; language spoken by the nearby &quot;Luiseño&quot; tribe.

The &quot;Acjachemen&quot; territory extended from Las Pulgas Creek in northern San Diego County up into the San Joaquin Hills along Orange County&#x27;s central coast, and inland from the Pacific Ocean up into the Santa Ana Mountains. The bulk of the population occupied the outlets of two large creeks, San Juan Creek (and its major tributary, Trabuco Creek) and San Mateo Creek (combined with Arroyo San Onofre, which drained into the ocean at the same point). The highest concentration of villages was along the lower San Juan, where Mission San Juan Capistrano was ultimately situated and is preserved today. The &quot;Acjachemen&quot; resided in permanent, well-defined villages and seasonal camps. Village populations ranged from between 35 and 300 inhabitants, consisting of a single lineage in the smaller villages, and of a dominant clan joined with other families in the larger settlements.

Each clan had its own resource territory and was &quot;politically&quot; independent; ties to other villages were maintained through economic, religious, and social networks in the immediate region. The elite class (composed chiefly families, lineage heads, and other ceremonial specialists), a middle class (established and successful families), and people of disconnected or wandering families and captives of war comprised the three hierarchical social classes. Native leadership consisted of the &quot;Nota&quot;, or clan chief, who conducted community rites and regulated ceremonial life in conjunction with the council of elders (&quot;Puuplem&quot;), which was made up of lineage heads and ceremonial specialists in their own right. This body decided upon matters of the community, which were then carried out by the &quot;Nota&quot; and his underlings. While the placement of residential huts in a village was not regulated, the ceremonial enclosure (&quot;Vanquech&quot;) and the chief&#x27;s home were most often centrally located.

Much has been discovered about the native inhabitants in recent centuries, thanks in part to the efforts of the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who documented his observations of life in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542. Fray Gerónimo Boscana, a Franciscan scholar who was stationed at San Juan Capistrano for more than a decade beginning in 1812, compiled what is widely considered to be the most comprehensive study of prehistoric religious practices in the San Juan Capistrano valley. Religious knowledge was secret, and the prevalent religion, called &quot;Chinigchinich&quot;, placed village chiefs in the position of religious leaders, an arrangement that gave the chiefs broad power over their people. Boscana divided the &quot;Acjachemen&quot; into two classes: the &quot;&quot;Playanos&quot; (who lived along the coast) and the &quot;Serranos&quot; (who inhabited the mountains, some three to four leagues from the Mission). The religious beliefs of the two groups as related to creation differed quite profoundly. The &quot;Playanos&quot; held that an all-powerful and unseen being called &quot;Nocuma&quot;&quot; brought about the earth and the sea, together with all of the trees, plants, and animals of sky, land, and water contained therein. The &quot;Serranos&quot;, on the other hand, believed in two separate but related existences: the &quot;existence above&quot; and the &quot;existence below.&quot; These states of being were &quot;altogether explicable and indefinite&quot; (like brother and sister), and it was the fruits of the union of these two entities that created &quot;...the rocks and sands of the earth; then trees, shrubbery, herbs and grass; then animals&quot;. In 1908, noted cultural anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber published the following observations with regard to the Juaneño religious observances:

We know that they adore a large bird similar to a kite, which they raise with the greatest of care from the time it is young, and they hold to many errors regarding it.
When a new moon shows itself they make a great outcry, which manifests their interest (&quot;negosijo&quot;). If there is an eclipse of the sun or of the moon, they shout with still louder outcries, beating the ground, skins, or mats with sticks, which shows their concerns and uneasiness.

===Mission Period (1776–1833)===
Juan Crespí, as a member of the 1769 Spanish Portolà expedition, authored the first written account of interaction between Europeans and the indigenous population in the region that today makes up Orange County. The expedition arrived at the site from the northeast, traveling down San Juan Creek, and camped near the future mission site on July 23. At the time, Crespi named the campsite after Santa Maria Magdalena (though it would also come to be called the &quot;Arroyo de la Quema&quot; and &quot;Cañada del Incendio&quot;, &quot;Wildfire Hollow&quot;).

In early 1775, Don Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, Viceroy of New Spain, authorized the establishment of a mission at a logical halfway point between Mission San Diego de Alcalá and Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. By that time, the site was already known by the name of its patron saint, &quot;San Juan Capistrano&quot;.

At the proposed site, located approximately 26 &quot;leguas&quot; (Spanish Leagues) north of San Diego, 18 leagues south of San Gabriel, and half a league from the Pacific Ocean, an &quot;enramada&quot; (arbor) was constructed, two bronze bells were hung from the branch of a nearby tree, and a wooden cross was erected. The grounds were consecrated by Fermín Lasuén of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on October 30, 1775 (the last day of the octave after the feast of San Juan Capistrano), near an Indian settlement named &quot;Sajavit&quot;; thus, La Misión de San Juan Capistrano de Sajavit was founded.

Assisting clergy Gregório Amúrrio of Mission San Luis Obispo arrived from San Gabriel eight days later with a supply of goods and cattle. Unfortunately, word arrived from San Diego at the same time that a group of natives attacked the mission and brutally murdered one of the missionaries (Luís Jayme). Since it was feared at the time that any hostile action by the natives against the few burgeoning outposts might break Spain&#x27;s tenuous hold on Alta California, the priests quickly buried the San Juan Capistrano Mission bells. Lieutenant José Francisco Ortega, military leader of the expedition, led all but a small contingent of Spanish soldiers back to El Presidio de San Diego to help quell the uprising; the priests, along with the few remaining soldiers as an escort, gathered up their belongings and fled to the safety of the Presido, where they were given further details of the disaster.

One year later Serra himself, along with Amúrrio and Pablo de Mugártegui, took up work on the Mission at San Juan Capistrano; the contingent, accompanied by eleven soldiers, arrived on October 30 or 31, 1776. Upon their return to the site today known as &quot;&quot;Mission Vieja&quot;,&quot; the party excavated the bells and constructed a new arbor; the original wooden cross was, to their surprise, still standing. Serra celebrated High Mass in thanksgiving on November 1, 1776—celebrated ever since as the official founding date. Due to an inadequate water supply the Mission site was subsequently relocated approximately three miles to the west less than 60 yards from the village of &quot;Acágcheme&quot;. The new venue was strategically placed above two nearby streams, the Trabuco and the San Juan. Mission San Gabriel provided cattle and neophyte labor to assist in the development of the new Mission. Amúrrio performed the Mission&#x27;s first baptism on December 19 of that year (a total of 4,639 souls were converted at the Mission between 1776 and 1847.) The first Indian marriage was blessed by Mugártegui on the feast of the &quot;Espousals of the Blessed Virgin Mary,&quot; January 23, 1777. Mugártegui also presided over the first burial ceremony on July 13 (the first burial on Mission grounds would not take place until March 9, 1781). The Registers of Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials are all intact and preserved at the Mission, as is the Confirmation Register (San Juan Capistrano is one of the few Missions to have retained this document). Serra visited the Mission for the first time since its founding and administered the Sacrament of Confirmation on October 22. In 1778, the first adobe &quot;capilla&quot; (chapel) was blessed. It was replaced by a larger, long house of worship in 1782, which is regarded as the oldest standing building in California. Known proudly as the &quot;Serra Chapel,&quot; it also has the distinction of being the only remaining church in which Serra is known to have officiated (&quot;Mission Dolores&quot; was still under construction at the time of Serra&#x27;s visit there). Serra presided over the confirmations of 213 people on October 12 and 13, 1783. By the time of the chapel&#x27;s completion, living quarters, kitchens (&quot;pozolera&quot;), workshops, storerooms, soldiers&#x27; barracks (&quot;cuartels&quot;), and a number of other ancillary buildings had also been erected, effectively forming the main &quot;cuadrángulo&quot; (quadrangle).

California&#x27;s first vineyard was located on the Mission grounds, with the planting of the &quot;Mission&quot; or &quot;Criollo&quot; grape in 1779, one grown extensively throughout Spanish America at the time but with &quot;an uncertain European origin.&quot; It was the only grape grown in the Mission system throughout the mid-19th century. The first winery in Alta California was built in San Juan Capistrano in 1783; both red and white wines (sweet and dry), brandy, and a port-like fortified wine called Angelica were all produced from the Mission grape. In 1791, the Mission&#x27;s two original bells were removed from the tree branch on which they had been hanging for the previous fifteen years and placed within a permanent mounting. Over the next two decades the Mission prospered, and in 1794 over seventy adobe structures were built in order to provide permanent housing for the Mission Indians, some of which comprise the oldest residential neighborhood in California. It was decided that a larger, European-style church was required to accommodate the growing population. Hoping to construct an edifice of truly magnificent proportions, the priests retained the services of &quot;maestro albañil&quot; (master stonemason) Isídro Aguilár of Culiacán. Aguílar took charge of the church&#x27;s construction and set about incorporating numerous design features not found at any other California Mission, including the use of a domed roof structure made of stone as opposed to the typical flat wood roof. His elegant roof design called for six vaulted domes (&quot;bovedas&quot;) to be built. 

====The Great Stone Church====
Work was begun on &quot;The Great Stone Church&quot; (the only chapel building in Alta California not constructed out of adobe) on February 2, 1797. It was laid out in the shape of a cross, measuring long by wide with high walls, and included a tall &quot;campanile&quot; (bell tower) located adjacent to the main entrance. Local legend has it that the tower could be seen for or more, and that the bells could be heard from even farther away. The sandstone building sat on a foundation seven feet thick. Construction efforts required the participation of the entire population. Stones were quarried from gullies and creek beds up to away and transported in carts (&quot;carretas&quot;) drawn by oxen, carried by hand, and even dragged to the building site. Limestone was crushed into a powder on the Mission grounds to create a mortar that was more erosion-resistant than the actual stones.

On the afternoon of November 22, 1800, tremors from the 6.5-magnitude San Diego earthquake cracked the walls of the rising edifice, necessitating that repair work be performed. Unfortunately, Señor Aguilár died six years into the project; his work was carried on by the priests and their charges, who made their best attempts to emulate the existing construction. Lacking the skills of a master mason, however, led to irregular walls and necessitated the addition of a seventh roof dome. The church was finally completed in 1806, and blessed by Fray Estévan Tapís on the evening of September 7; a two-day-long &quot;fiesta&quot; followed. The sanctuary floors were paved with diamond-shaped tiles, and brick-lined niches displayed the statues of various saints. It was by all accounts the most magnificent in all of California and a three-day feast was held in celebration of this monumental achievement.

On the morning of December 8, 1812, the &quot;Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin&quot;, a series of large earthquakes shook Southern California during the first Sunday service. The 7.5-magnitude San Juan Capistrano earthquake racked the doors to the church, pinning them shut. When the ground finally stopped shaking, the bulk of the nave had come crashing down, and the bell tower was obliterated. Forty native worshipers who were attending Mass and two boys who had been ringing the bells in the tower were buried under the rubble and lost their lives, and were subsequently interred in the Mission cemetery. This was the second major setback the outpost had suffered, and followed severe storms and flooding that had damaged Mission buildings and ruined crops earlier in the year. 

The priests immediately resumed holding services in Serra&#x27;s Church. Within a year a brick &quot;campanario&quot; (&quot;bell wall&quot;) had been erected between the ruins of the stone church and the Mission&#x27;s first chapel to support the four bells salvaged from the rubble of the campanile. As the transept, sanctuary (&quot;re-do&#x27;s&quot;), and &quot;sacristia&quot; (sacristy) were all left standing, an attempt was made to rebuild the stone church in 1815 which failed due to a lack of construction expertise (the latter is the only element that is completely intact today). Consequently, all of the construction work undertaken at the Mission grounds thereafter was of a strictly utilitarian nature. José Barona and Boscana oversaw the construction of a small infirmary (hospital) building (located just outside the northwestern corner of the quadrangle) in 1814, &quot;for the convenience of the sick.&quot; It is here that &quot;Juaneño&quot; medicine men used traditional methods to heal the sick and injured. Archaeological excavations in 1937 and 1979 unearthed what are believed to be the building&#x27;s foundations.

====The Day That Pirates Sacked The Mission====
On December 14, 1818, the French privateer Hipólito Bouchard, sailing under the flag of the &quot;United Provinces of Rio de la Plata&quot; (Argentina), brought his ships &quot;La Argentina&quot; and &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; to within sight of the Mission; aware that Bouchard (today known as &quot;California&#x27;s only pirate&quot;) had recently conducted raids on the settlements at Monterey and Santa Barbara, Comandante Ruíz had sent forth a party of thirty men (under the leadership of a young Spanish lieutenant named Santiago Argüello) to protect the Mission at first news of the approach on the 13th. Two members of Bouchard&#x27;s contingent made contact with the garrison soldiers and made their demand for provisions, which was rebuffed with added threats: Lieutenant Argüello replied that if the ships did not sail away the garrison would gladly provide &quot;an immediate supply of shot and shell&quot;. In response, &quot;Pirata Buchar&quot; (as he was referred to by the Californios) ordered an assault on the Mission, sending some 140 men and two or three &quot;violentos&quot; (light howitzer cannon) to take the needed supplies by force. The Mission guards engaged the attackers but were overwhelmed; the marauders looted the Mission warehouses and left minor damage to several Mission buildings in their wake, and reportedly set fire to a few of the outlying straw houses. Reinforcements from Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, led by Comandante Guerra from El Presidio Real de Santa Bárbara, arrived the next day to no avail as the ships had already set sail.

Though the mission was spared, all ammunition, supplies and valuables in the area were taken. Regarded today as one of the more colorful events in the Mission&#x27;s history, an annual celebration is held to memorialize &quot;The Day that Pirates Sacked the Mission.&quot;

====Mexican independence====
Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821. The 1820s and 30s saw a gradual decline in the Mission&#x27;s status. Disease thinned out the once ample cattle herds, and a sudden infestation of mustard weed made it increasingly difficult to cultivate crops. Floods and droughts took their toll as well. But the biggest threat to the Mission&#x27;s stability came from the presence of Spanish settlers who sought to take over Capistrano&#x27;s fertile lands. Over time the disillusioned Indian population gradually left the Mission, and without regular maintenance its physical deterioration continued at an accelerated rate. Nevertheless, there was sufficient activity along El Camino Real to justify the construction of the Las Flores Asistencia in 1823. This facility, situated halfway between San Juan Capistrano and the Mission at San Luis Rey, was intended to act primarily as a rest stop for traveling clergy. Around 1820 an &quot;estancia&quot; (station) was established a few miles north on the banks of the Santa Ana River to accommodate the Mission&#x27;s sizeable cattle herd. The adobe structure built to house the mayordomo and &quot;vaqueros&quot; (cowboys) who tended the Mission herds is known today as the Diego Sepúlveda Adobe. Upon his death in 1825, Don José Antonio Yorba I (a prominent Spanish land owner and member of the Portolà Expedition), was buried in the Mission&#x27;s cemetery in an unmarked grave; a cenotaph was later placed in Yorba&#x27;s honor.

José María de Echeandía, the first native Mexican to be elected Governor of Alta California, issued his &quot;Proclamation of Emancipation&quot; (or &quot;Prevenciónes de Emancipacion&quot;) on July 25, 1826. All Indians within the military districts of San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Monterey who were found qualified were freed from missionary rule and made eligible to become Mexican citizens; those who wished to remain under mission tutelage were exempted from most forms of corporal punishment. Catholic historian Zephyrin Engelhardt referred to Echeandía as &quot;...an avowed enemy of the religious orders.&quot; Despite the fact that Echeandía&#x27;s emancipation plan was met with little encouragement from the neophytes who populated the southern missions, he was nonetheless determined to test the scheme on a large scale at Mission San Juan Capistrano. To that end, he appointed a board of &quot;comisianados&quot; (commissioners) to oversee the emancipation of the Indians. In response to the proclamation, Barona refused to take the oath of allegiance to what he saw as the &quot;bogus republic of Mexico&quot; despite the fact that he, along with all but two of the other Spanish missionaries, had previously sworn to the Independence of Mexico. The Mexican government passed legislation on December 20, 1827, that mandated the expulsion of all Spaniards younger than sixty years of age from Mexican territories; Governor Echeandía nevertheless intervened on Barona&#x27;s behalf in order to prevent his deportation once the law of took effect in California.

Even before Mexico had gained its independence, the Mission had begun its decline. Although Governor José Figueroa (who took office in 1833) initially attempted to keep the mission system intact, the Mexican Congress passed &quot;An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California&quot; on August 17, 1833. The Act also provided for the colonization of both Alta and Baja California, the expenses of this latter move to be borne by the proceeds gained from the sale of the mission property to private interests. Mission San Juan Capistrano was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834, Governor Figueroa issued his &quot;Decree of Confiscation.&quot;

===Rancho Period (1834–1849)===
On November 22, 1834, commissioner Juan José Rocha formally acknowledged receipt of the Decree of Confiscation. The final inventory for Mission San Juan Capistrano was compiled by José Maria de Zalvidea and four of the commissioners, and included:
* buildings ($7,298);
* chapel ($1,250);
* furnishings, tools, and implements ($14,768);
* contents of chapel and sacristy ($15,568);
* ranchos of San Mateo and Mission Viejo ($12,019); and
* library holdings ($490)
for a total valuation of $54,456. Mission credits totaled $13,123 while debts equaled a mere $1,410. The Mission library included three volumes of Juan de Torquemada and twelve volumes of the &quot;Año Cristiano&quot;. The names of 2,000 neophytes were carried on the Mission rolls. Mission agricultural holdings for that year consisted of:
* 8,000 head of cattle;
* 4,000 sheep;
* 80 pigs;
* 50 horses;
* 9 mules;
* 150 &quot;fanegas&quot; of maize;
* 20 &quot;fanegas&quot; of beans; and
* 50 barrels of wine and brandy.

Thereafter, the Franciscans all but abandoned the Mission, taking with them most everything of value, after which the locals plundered many of the Mission buildings for construction materials. According to Bancroft, &quot;The population of San Juan Capistrano in 1834 had decreased to 861 souls, and in 1840 it was probably less than 500 with less than 100 at the pueblo proper; while in its crops San Juan (Capistrano) showed a larger deterioration than any other (missionary) establishment.&quot; By 1835, little of the Mission&#x27;s assets remained, though the manufacture of hides and tallow continued in full swing as described in Richard Henry Dana&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. The Mission was declared to be &quot;in a ruinous state&quot; and the Indian &quot;pueblo&quot; dissolved in 1841. San Juan Capistrano was officially designated by Governor Juan B. Alvarado as a secular Mexican town on July 29, at which time those few who still resided at the Mission were granted sections of land to use as their own. Following this change in status, the area around the Mission began to decay rapidly; Santiago Argüello (then prefect of the southern District of Los Angeles) complained to the Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, Don José de la Guerra y Noriega, that &quot;...the unfortunate missions of San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano [have] been converted into brothels of the mayordomos.

Four years later, the Mission property was auctioned off under questionable circumstances for $710 worth of tallow and hides (equivalent to $15,000 in 2004 dollars) to Englishman John (Don Juan) Forster (Governor Pío Pico&#x27;s brother-in-law, whose family would take up residence in the friars&#x27; quarters for the next twenty years) and his partner James McKinley. More families would subsequently take up residence in other portions of the Mission buildings. José María Zalvidea left San Juan Capistrano on or about November 25, 1842, when Mission San Luis Rey de Francia&#x27;s Ibarra died, leaving the Mission without a resident priest for the first time (Zalvidea had been the Mission&#x27;s sole priest ever since the death of Josef Barona in 1831.) The first secular priest to take charge of the mission, Reverend José Maria Rosáles, arrived on October 8, 1843; Vicente Pascual Oliva, the last resident missionary, died on January 2, 1848.

===California statehood (1850–1900)===
Because virtually all of the artwork at the missions served either a devotional or didactic purpose, there was no underlying reason for the mission residents to record their surroundings graphically; visitors, however, found them to be objects of curiosity. During the 1850s a number of artists found gainful employment as draftsmen attached to expeditions sent to map the Pacific coastline and the border between California and Mexico (as well as plot practical railroad routes); many of the drawings were reproduced as lithographs in the expedition reports. The oldest surviving sketch of the Mission, dating back to 1850 and now in the collection of the Bancroft Library, shows that the domes above the stone church&#x27;s transept, along with the main dome and cupola (lantern house) located above the sanctuary, survived the 1812 earthquake. The earliest known photograph of San Juan Capistrano was taken by German-born artist Edward Vischer in 1860. Even before that time, however, the ruins at San Juan Capistrano and its stone church had been romanticized by landscape painters, writers, and historians. The ruins have been compared to those of Greece and Rome, and have at various times been referred to as the &quot;Alhambra of America,&quot; the &quot;American Acropolis,&quot; and the &quot;Melrose Abbey of the West.&quot; Also in 1860, an abortive attempt at restoring the stone church was the cause of its additional disintegration, forcing the domes over the transept and sanctuary to collapse.


A smallpox epidemic swept through the area in 1862, nearly wiping out the remaining &quot;Juaneño Indians&quot;. President Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation on March 18, 1865, that restored ownership of the Mission proper to the Roman Catholic Church. The document remains on display in the Mission&#x27;s barracks &quot;cum&quot; museum. Ownership of was conveyed to the Church, for all practical intents being the exact area of land occupied by the original Mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens. The Mission&#x27;s sole resident from April 1866, to April 1886, was its pastor, José Mut. Mut made certain changes in order to accommodate his own needs, but little was accomplished to prevent further deterioration of the Mission buildings. Around 1873, some forty &quot;Juaneño&quot; were still associated with the Mission; however, many of those of mixed Spanish/Mexican and &quot;Juaneño&quot; heritage were not taken into consideration, and several native villages still existed in the interior valleys. During this same era, the Mission priests established a circuit-riding ministry to these interior villages to the south, and on the other side of the Palomar Mountain Range. A wave of migration by the &quot;Juaneño&quot; out of San Juan occurred in 1880–1900 as towns in northern Orange County started to form and needed laborers.

The 1880s also saw the appearance of a number of articles on the missions in national publications and the first books on the subject; as a result, a large number of artists did one or more mission paintings, though few attempted series. By 1891 a roof collapse required that the Serra Chapel be abandoned completely. Modifications were made to the original adobe church (including the addition of a cross-topped &quot;espadaña&quot; at the south end, a feature that has been retained in the present iteration of the Mission compound) in order to render it suitable for use as a parish church. In 1894, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway constructed a new depot in the emerging &quot;Mission Revival Style&quot; mere blocks from the Mission. It is rumored that the stonework, bricks, and roof tiles were salvaged from the decaying buildings. The following year, a group calling itself the &quot;Landmarks Club of Southern California&quot; (under the direction of acclaimed American journalist, historian, and photographer Charles Fletcher Lummis) made the first real efforts in over fifty years at preserving the Mission and restoring it to its original state. Over 400 tons of debris was cleared away, holes in the walls were patched, and new shake cedar roofs were placed over a few of the derelict buildings; nearly a mile of walkways were repaved with asphalt and gravel as well.

===20th century and beyond (since 1901)===

After Mut&#x27;s departure in 1886 the parish found itself without a permanent pastor, and the Mission languished during this period. St. John O&#x27;Sullivan arrived in San Juan Capistrano in 1910 to recuperate from a recent stroke, and to seek relief from chronic tuberculosis. He became fascinated by the scope of the Mission and soon set to work on rebuilding it a section at a time. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first task was to repair the roof of the Serra Chapel (which was being employed as a granary and storeroom) using sycamore logs to match those that were used in the original work; in the process, the roof of the apse was raised to allow for the inclusion of a window so that natural light could be brought into the space. Other refurbishments were made as time and funds permitted. Arthur B. Benton, a Los Angeles architect, strengthened the chapel walls through the addition of heavy masonry buttresses. The centerpiece of the chapel is its spectacular &quot;retablo&quot; which serves as the backdrop for the altar. A masterpiece of Baroque art, the altarpiece was hand-carved of 396 individual pieces of cherry wood and overlaid in gold leaf in Barcelona and is estimated to be 400 years old. It was originally imported from Barcelona in 1806 for the Los Angeles cathedral but was never used. It was later donated by Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell of Los Angeles and installed sometime between 1922 and 1924 (the north end of the building had to be enlarged to accommodate this piece due to its height). Although the &quot;retablo&quot; had been relayered over the centuries, most of the original gilding remains underneath the modern materials (extensive restoration was begun in June 2006).

The first of many Hollywood productions to use San Juan Capistrano as a backdrop was D.W. Griffith&#x27;s 1910 western film &quot;The Two Brothers&quot; (the first film ever shot in Orange County). On January 7, 1911, the film&#x27;s leading lady, silent film star Mary Pickford, secretly wed fellow actor Owen Moore in the Mission chapel. Artist Charles Percy Austin often stayed in San Juan Capistrano and donated several of his works, the most notable being his memorialization of Pickford&#x27;s wedding ceremony, appropriately entitled &quot;Mary Pickford&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which he painted after O&#x27;Sullivan performed the marriage rites. Noted portraitist Joseph Kleitsch also resided at the Mission for a time, and painted a portrait of O&#x27;Sullivan in 1924 (among other works). The third and final act of John Steven McGroarty&#x27;s &quot;The Mission Play&quot; (1911) is set &quot;...amid the broken and deserted walls of Mission San Juan Capistrano (the Mission of the Swallow), in 1847.&quot;

Severe flooding destroyed a portion of the Mission&#x27;s front arcade in 1915, and heavy storms a year later washed away one end of the barracks building (which O&#x27;Sullivan rebuilt in 1917), incorporating minor modifications such as an ornamental archway in order to make the edifice more closely resemble a church. The Mission grounds were enclosed with a wood picket fence, and beginning on May 9, 1916, a ten-cent admission fee was charged to help defray preservation costs. In 1918, the Mission was given parochial status, with O&#x27;Sullivan serving as its first modern pastor. It was on April 21 of that year that the San Jacinto Earthquake caused moderate structural damage to some of the buildings. In 1919, author Johnston McCulley created the character &quot;Zorro&quot; and chose Mission San Juan Capistrano as the setting for the first novella, &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;. In 1920, the &quot;Sacred Garden&quot; was created in the courtyard adjacent to the stone church, and in 1925 the full restoration of the Serra Chapel was completed. O&#x27;Sullivan died in 1933 and was interred in the Mission cemetery (&quot;campo santo&quot;) amongst more than 2,000 former inhabitants (mostly &quot;Juaneño&quot; Indians), who are buried in unmarked graves. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s tomb lies at the foot of a Celtic cross that O&#x27;Sullivan himself erected as a memorial to the Mission&#x27;s builders.

After O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s death, Arthur J. Hutchinson (another pastor with a love of California history) assumed leadership of the Mission, and played a central role in raising needed funds to continue the Mission&#x27;s preservation work. Pastor Hutchinson made key archeological discoveries on the Mission grounds during his tenure (he died on July 27, 1951), after which time his work was continued by the next two pastors, Monsignors Vincent Lloyd-Russell and Paul M. Martin. In 1937, representatives of the U.S. National Park Service&#x27;s Historic American Buildings Survey, as a part of the Historic Sites Act of 1935, surveyed and photographed the grounds and structures extensively. Their efforts laid the groundwork for future excavation and reconstruction of the west wing industrial complex. Monsignor Martin began a comprehensive preservation effort following the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake.
The prestigious World Monuments Fund placed &quot;The Great Stone Church&quot; on its &quot;List of 100 Most Endangered Sites&quot; in 2002. The most recent series of seismic retrofits at the Mission were completed at a cost of $7.5 million in 2004. About half a million visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission each year.

A number of events are held at the mission today. The main fundraising event, Battle of the Mariachis, has been held since 2004 and started as a way to honor its heritage.

==Mission industries==


The goal of the missions was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, was the most important industry of any mission. Barley, maize, and wheat were the principal crops grown at San Juan Capistrano; cattle, horses, mules, sheep, and goats were all raised by the hundreds as well. In 1790, the Mission&#x27;s herd included 7,000 sheep and goats, 2,500 cattle, and 200 mules and horses. Olives were grown, cured, and pressed under large stone wheels to extract their oil, both for use at the Mission and to trade for other goods. Grapes were also grown and fermented into wine for sacramental use and again, for trading. The specific variety, called the &quot;Criolla&quot; or &quot;Mission grape&quot;, was first planted at the Mission in 1779; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from San Juan Capistrano&#x27;s winery. Until about 1850, Mission grapes represented the entirety of viticulture in the state. Cereal grains were dried and ground by stone into flour. The Mission&#x27;s kitchens and bakeries prepared and served thousands of meals each day. Candles, soap, grease, and ointments were all made from tallow (rendered animal fat) in large vats located just outside the west wing. Also situated in this general area were vats for dyeing wool and tanning leather, and primitive looms for weavings. Large &quot;bodegas&quot; (warehouses) provided long-term storage for preserved foodstuffs and other treated materials.

Three long &quot;zanjas&quot; (aqueducts) ran through the central courtyard and deposited the water they collected into large cisterns in the industrial area, where it was filtered for drinking and cooking, or dispensed for use in cleaning. The Mission had to fabricate all of its construction materials as well. Workers in the &quot;carpintería&quot; (carpentry shop) used crude methods to shape beams, lintels, and other structural elements; more skilled artisans carved doors, furniture, and wooden implements. For certain applications bricks (&quot;ladrillos&quot;) were fired in ovens (kilns) to strengthen them and make them more resistant to the elements; when &quot;tejas&quot; (roof tiles) eventually replaced the conventional &quot;jacal&quot; roofing (densely packed reeds) they were placed in the kilns to harden them as well. Glazed ceramic pots, dishes, and canisters were also made in the Mission&#x27;s kilns.

Prior to the establishment of the missions, the native peoples&#x27; way of life involved the use of bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries decided that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine sex, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to support their social and economic goals. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise used by the natives was produced at the missions under the supervision of the priests; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. The foundry at Mission San Juan Capistrano was the first to introduce the Indians to the Iron Age. The blacksmith used the Mission&#x27;s Catalan furnaces (California&#x27;s first) to smelt and fashion iron into everything from basic tools and hardware (such as nails) to crosses, gates, hinges, even cannon for Mission defense. Iron was one commodity in particular that the Mission relied solely on trade to acquire, as the missionaries had neither the know-how nor the technology to mine and process metal ores.

==Mission bells==

Bells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The original bells were hung from a large nearby tree for some fifteen years, until the chapel bell tower was completed in 1791. What ultimately became of the original bells is not known. New bells were cast in Chile for inclusion in the belfry of &quot;The Great Stone Church.&quot; All four of Mission San Juan Capistrano&#x27;s bells are named and all bear inscriptions as follows (from the largest to the smallest; inscriptions are translated from Latin):
* &quot;Praised by Jesus, San Vicente. In honor of the Reverend Fathers, Ministers (of the Mission) Fray Vicente Fustér, and Fray Juan Santiago, 1796.&quot;
* &quot;Hail Mary most pure. Ruelas made me, and I am called San Juan, 1796.&quot;
* &quot;Hail Mary most pure, San Antonio, 1804.&quot;
* &quot;Hail Mary most pure, San Rafael, 1804.&quot;

In the aftermath of the 1812 earthquake, the two largest bells cracked and split open. Due to this damage neither produced clear tones. Regardless, they were hung in the campanario that went up the following year. During the Mission&#x27;s heyday, a lone bell also hung at the west end of the front corridor, next to an entrance gate which has long since eroded away. One of O&#x27; Sullivan&#x27;s companions during his tenure at San Juan Capistrano was José de Gracia Cruz, better known as Acú, who related many stories and legends of the Mission. A descendant of the &quot;Juaneño&quot; Indians, he served as the Mission&#x27;s bell ringer until his death in 1924.

On March 22, 1969, President Richard M. Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon visited the Mission and rang the Bell of San Rafael. A bronze plaque commemorating the event is set in the bell wall. In celebration of the new Mission church being elevated to minor basilica status in 2000, exact duplicates of the damaged bells were cast by Royal Bellfoundry Petit &amp; Fritsen b.v. of Aarle-Rixtel, the Netherlands using molds made from the originals. The replacement bells were placed in the bell wall and the old ones put on display within the footprint of the destroyed Mission &quot;campanile&quot; (&quot;bell tower&quot;).

==Folklore==

===Legends===
The tragedy of &quot;The Great Stone Church&quot; gave rise to its well loved legend, that of a young native girl named Magdalena who was killed in the collapse. Magdalena lived on the Mission grounds and had fallen in love with an artist named Teófilo. However, the pair was deemed too young to marry by their elders and were forced to carry on their relationship in secret. On that terrible December morning, the repentant Magdalena walked ahead of the procession of worshipers carrying a penitent&#x27;s candle just as the earthquake struck. Teófilo rushed into the church as the walls and roof tumbled to the ground in a vain attempt to save his lover. When the rubble was cleared the pair was found among the dead, locked in a final embrace. It is said that on moonlit nights one can sometimes make out the face of a young girl, seemingly illuminated by candlelight, high up in the ruins. Other, less-pervasive legends include that of a faceless monk who haunted the corridors of the original quadrangle, and of a headless soldier who was often seen standing guard near the front entrance.

===Return of the swallows===
The American cliff swallow (&quot;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota&quot;) is a migratory bird that spends its winters in Goya, Argentina, but makes the trek north to the warmer climes of the American Southwest in springtime. According to legend, the birds, who have visited the San Juan Capistrano area every summer for centuries, first took refuge at the Mission when an irate innkeeper began destroying their mud nests (the birds also frequent the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo). The Mission&#x27;s location near two rivers made it an ideal location for the swallows to nest, as there was a constant supply of the insects on which they feed, and the young birds are well-protected inside the ruins of the old stone church.

A 1915 article in &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; magazine made note of the birds&#x27; annual habit of nesting beneath the Mission&#x27;s eaves and archways from spring through fall, and made the swallows the &quot;signature icon&quot; of the Mission; O&#x27;Sullivan used interest in the phenomenon to generate public interest in restoration efforts during his two decades in residence. One of bell ringer Acú&#x27;s most colorful tales was that the swallows (or &quot;las golondrinas&quot;, as he called them) flew over the Atlantic Ocean to Jerusalem each winter, carrying small twigs on which they could rest atop the water along the way. On March 13, 1939, a popular radio program was broadcast live from the Mission grounds, announcing the swallows&#x27; arrival. Composer Leon René was so inspired by the event that he penned the song &quot;When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano&quot; in tribute. During its initial release the song spent several weeks atop the &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; charts. The song has been recorded by such musicians as The Ink Spots, Fred Waring, Guy Lombardo, Glenn Miller, The Five Satins and Pat Boone. A glassed-off room in the Mission has been designated in René&#x27;s honor and displays the upright piano on which he composed the tune, the reception desk from his office and several copies of the song&#x27;s sheet music and other pieces of furniture, all donated by René&#x27;s family.

Each year the &quot;Fiesta de las Golondrinas&quot; is held in the City of San Juan Capistrano. Presented by the San Juan Capistrano Fiesta Association, the &quot;Fiesta de las Golondrinas&quot; is a week-long celebration of this auspicious event culminated by the Swallows Day Parade and Mercado, street fair. Tradition has it that the main flock arrives on March 19 (Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day), and flies south on Saint John&#x27;s Day, October 23.

In recent years, the swallows have failed to return in large flocks to the Mission. Few birds were counted in the 1990s and 2000s. The reduction has been connected to increased development of the area, including many more choices of nesting place and fewer insects to eat.

===California pepper tree===
The largest California pepper tree (&quot;Schinus molle&quot;) in the United States resided at Mission San Juan Capistrano until 2005, when it was felled due to disease. The tall specimen, planted in the 1870s, was typical of the early California landscape; it was also listed in the National Register of Big Trees. The oldest pepper tree in California resides in the courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia.

<text>Mission Santa Clara de Asís () is a Spanish mission in the city of Santa Clara, California. The mission, which was the eighth in California, was founded on January 12, 1777, by the Franciscans. Named for Saint Clare of Assisi, who founded the order of the Poor Clares and was an early companion of St. Francis of Assisi, this was the first California mission to be named in honor of a woman.

It is the namesake of both the city and county of Santa Clara, as well as of Santa Clara University, which was built around the mission. This is the only mission located on the grounds of a university campus. Although ruined and rebuilt six times, the settlement was never abandoned, and today it functions as the university chapel for Santa Clara University.

== History ==
The outpost was originally established as &quot;La Misión Santa Clara de Thamien&quot; (or &quot;Mission Santa Clara de Thamien&quot;, a reference to the Tamien people) at the Native American village of &quot;So-co-is-u-ka&quot; (meaning &quot;Laurelwood&quot;, located on the Guadalupe River) on January 12, 1777. There the Franciscan brothers erected a cross and shelter for worship to bring Christianity to the Ohlone people. Floods, fires, and earthquakes damaged many of the early structures and forced relocation to higher ground. The second site is known as Mission Santa Clara de Asís. A subsequent site of the mission dating from 1784 to 1819 is located several hundred yards west of the De La Cruz overpass of the Caltrain track; moreover, several Native American burial sites have been discovered near this subsequent site. The current site, home to the first college in Alta California, dates back to 1828.


Initially, there was tension between the people of the mission and those in the nearby Pueblo de San Josè over disputed ownership rights of land and water. The tension was relieved when a road, the Alameda, was built by two hundred Native Americans to link the communities together. On Sundays, people from San Jose would come to the mission for services, until the building of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in 1803. In that year, the mission of Santa Clara reported a Native American population of 1,271. In the same tabular report, its resident priest estimated that 10,000 cattle, 9,500 sheep, 730 horses, 35 mules, and 55 swine were on mission lands, while about 3,000 fanegas of grain (some each of wheat, barley or corn) had been harvested.


After the Mexican secularization act of 1833 most of the mission&#x27;s land and livestock was sold off by Mexico. The mission land was subdivided, and the land sold to whoever could afford it which often meant it was sold to government officials and with half of the mission land going to Native Americans. Most of the buildings continued to be used as a parish church, unlike the other missions in California. By 1836, the mission Native Americans were &quot;freed&quot; by the Mexican government. The local land near the mission had drastically changed in the 60 years of mission operation under the Spanish and many of the native plants needed for Native American survival were gone, requiring a change from the former lifestyle for many Native Americans. Many Native Americans fled to the Central Valley of California, others stayed locally and worked for the new ranchos. There were a few small and short-lived Native American villages established around the Bay Area by 1839; many of these villages could not support themselves, so they began raiding the nearby ranchos.

In 1850, California became a state. With that change, priests of the Jesuit order took over the Mission Santa Clara de Asís in 1851 from the Franciscans. Father John Nobili, S.J., was put in charge of the mission. He began a college on the mission site in 1851, which grew into Santa Clara University; it is the only mission to become part of a university, and it is also the oldest university in California. Throughout the history of the mission, the bells have rung faithfully every evening, a promise made to King Charles III of Spain when he sent the original bells to the mission in 1777. He asked that the bells be rung each evening at 8:30 in memory of those who had died, although the actual bells have since been replaced by a recording. The bell tower has three bells; one was donated by King Carlos IV but subsequently destroyed in a fire. King Alphonso XIII donated a replacement bell, which is on display in the de Saisset Museum (in the mission).

In 1861, a new wooden façade with two bell towers was attached over the old adobe front of the building. The interior was widened in 1885 to increase the seating capacity by removing the original adobe nave walls. A fire in 1925 destroyed the structure, including the surrounding wall. The church&#x27;s parochial functions were transferred to the Saint Clare Parish west of the campus. A rebuilt and restored Mission Santa Clara was consecrated in 1929, when it assumed its primary modern function as chapel and centerpiece of the university campus. It is open to visitors daily; the mission museum is located in the university&#x27;s De Saisset Museum.
The original mission cemetery, still in use, is located on nearby Lincoln Street.

== Santa Clara Mission Cemetery ==
Santa Clara Mission Cemetery, also known as Santa Clara Catholic Cemetery, was founded in 1777, alongside the mission by the same Franciscans. In 1851, when Santa Clara College was founded, the cemetery near the mission was running out of space, so they moved the location a few minutes walk from the mission near the adobe home of Fernando Berryessa, son of Maria Zacharias Bernal y Berryessa.

In the 1930s, this cemetery completed its first indoor mausoleum. In part due to the popularity of mausoleum burial, in 2015, they began building the St. Ignatius Outdoor Mausoleum Complex.

<text>Mission San Buenaventura (, Ventureño: ), formally known as the Mission Basilica of San Buenaventura, is a Catholic parish and basilica in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The parish church in the city of Ventura, California, United States, is a Spanish mission founded by the Order of Friars Minor. Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in Alta California (or Nueva California) and the last to be established by the head of the Franciscan missions in California, Junípero Serra. Designated a California Historical Landmark, the mission is one of many locally designated landmarks in downtown Ventura.

The mission was named after St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Franciscan saint, one of the early leaders of the Order to which the friars belonged, and a Doctor of the Church. On June 9, 2020, Pope Francis elevated the church to a minor basilica, and on July 15, 2020, the feast day of its patron saint, the announcement of the Pope&#x27;s action was made and the elevation of the mission&#x27;s status was officially proclaimed by Archbishop José Gómez of Los Angeles. The name of the mission was changed to reflect this new status in the Catholic Church.

Mission San Buenaventura was planned to be founded in 1770 and become 3rd mission, but the founding was delayed because of the low availability of the military escorts needed to establish the mission. In 1793, the first church burned down. When the mission was completed, it included an adjacent quadrangle with living and work space. All that remains of the original mission is the church and its garden.

==History==
===Spanish Empire===
The founding of the San Buenaventura Mission traces to the decision on Palm Sunday, March 30, 1749, by the Franciscan friar Junipero Serra to journey to the New World as a missionary to the native peoples.

Thirty-three years and one day later he raised the Cross at &quot;la playa de la canal de Santa Barbara&quot; (the beach of the Santa Barbara Channel) on Easter morning, March 31, 1782. Assisted by Pedro Benito Cambon, he celebrated a High Mass, preached on the Resurrection, and dedicated a mission to San Buenaventura (St. Bonaventure). It had been planned as the third in the chain of twenty-one missions founded by Serra but was destined to be the ninth and last founded during his lifetime, and one of six he personally dedicated.

Under the direction of Friar Cambon, whom Serra left in charge of the new mission, a system of aqueducts were built by the Chumash people between 1805 and 1815 to meet the needs of the Mission population and consisted of both ditches and elevated stone masonry. The watercourse ran from a point on the Ventura River about ½ mile north of the remaining ruins and carried the water to holding tanks behind the mission, a total of about . With plentiful water, the mission was able to maintain flourishing orchards and gardens, which were described by |English navigator George Vancouver as the finest he had seen. The water distribution system was damaged by floods and abandoned in 1862.

The mission&#x27;s first church was destroyed by fire in 1793. The construction of a second church was abandoned because &quot;the door gave way.&quot; A permanent replacement was not able to be rebuilt until 1812. About the same time, the San Miguel Chapel and the Santa Gertrudis Chapel were completed.

A series of earthquakes and an accompanying seismic sea wave in 1812 forced the friars and Indian neophytes to seek temporary shelter a few miles inland. Six years later the friars had to remove sacred objects from the church and the whole mission flee into the hills to elude an attack led by Argentine pirate Hippolyte de Bouchard, who was pillaging the missions and had just conducted a successful attack against Mission San Juan Capistrano.

===Mexico===

After its independence from Spain, in 1834 the Mexican government issued a secularization decree, divesting the friars of administrative control over the missions. In 1845 Mission San Buenaventura was rented to Jose Arnaz and Narciso Botello and was later sold illegally to Arnaz.

The mission did not fully escape the impact that the Mexican–American War of 1846–1847 had on California. On January 5, 1847, while on its way from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, the 428 men-strong California Battalion, under the command of U.S. Army Major John C. Fremont, managed to disperse an armed force of up to 70 enemy Californios near the mission.

===United States===
As California had become a state of the Union, when Joseph Sadoc Alemany, O.P., was named the first Bishop of Monterey in 1850, he petitioned the United States Government to return that part of the mission holdings comprising the church, clergy residence, cemetery, orchard, and vineyard to the Catholic Church. The request was granted in the form of a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln on May 23, 1862.

Because of severe damage in the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, the Mission&#x27;s tile roof was replaced by a shingle roof. In 1893, Cyprian Rubio &quot;modernized&quot; the interior of the church, painting over the original artwork; when he finished, little of the old church was untouched. The windows were lengthened, the beamed ceiling and tile floor were covered, and the remnants of the quadrangle were razed. The west sacristy was removed to provide room for a school, which was not actually built until 1921. During the pastorate of Patrick Grogan the roof of the church was once again tiled, the convent and present rectory were built, and a new fountain was placed in the garden.

The education of children at Mission San Buenaventura has flourished intermittently since 1829 (during Mexican rule) and continuously since 1922. Originally a four-classroom structure, Holy Cross School served its students and the parish admirably since its 1922 dedication. In 1925 it was expanded to accommodate growth and in 1949 a subsequent renovation brought it out to Main Street (El Camino Real) with no space left for further expansion.

In a major restoration under the supervision of Aubrey J. O&#x27;Reilly in 1956–1957 the windows were reconstructed to their original size, and the ceiling and floor were uncovered. A long-time parishioner commissioned the casting of a bell with an automatic angelus device and donated it to the mission; it hangs in the bell tower above the four ancient hand-operated bells.

The second half of the 20th century brought more growth, as well as wear-and-tear and obsolescence, and the school&#x27;s problems far exceed spatial deficiency. In response to this situation, the San Buenaventura Mission parish, under the leadership of Monsignor Patrick J. O&#x27;Brien, formed a Planning and Development Committee comprising parishioners, faculty, parish staff, and parents. In June 1994, the downtown firm of Mainstreet Architects and Planners prepared a conceptual master site plan for the mission properties, incorporating the design of a new school and an adjoining multi-purpose building which would serve both school and parish. This plan also necessitated the deconstruction of the convent and the two remaining Holy Cross Sisters moved into the larger St. Catherine by the Sea Convent, a short distance from the Mission.

The entire roof of the church was removed and replaced in 1976. In December of that year the church was solemnly consecrated by Cardinal Timothy Manning, the Archbishop of Los Angeles. In 1982 the mission marked its bicentennial. A new three-story school building, with pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and grades 1–8, located at the base of the hill behind the Mission, was dedicated in January 2001. The school also houses the Serra Chapel for Eucharistic Adoration, adult classrooms, a parish/school kitchen, and a large assembly hall used as a school auditorium and for large parish gatherings and one Sunday Mass. The assembly room was named after O&#x27;Brien, who was the pastor of the church for 25 years until his sudden death in 2005. The mission celebrated its 225th anniversary with a year-long series of events and activities during 2006–07.

==Description==
All that remains of the original mission is the church and its garden. A small museum sits at the mission with displays of Chumash Indian artifacts and mission-era items. Located in the historic downtown of Ventura, very few California missions had the center of business and commerce remain at the location where the mission was established like Mission San Buenaventura.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2015/09/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The church remains an active Catholic parish, serving approximately 2,000 families, and services are still held in the parish church. The current pastor is Tom Elewaut, who has served since 2011. A reproduction of the Pieta at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was donated to the parish in 2018. The Father Serra statue that was removed from the plaza in front of the Ventura City Hall was installed in the garden in 2024.

==Mission industries==

Some animals at San Buenaventura were cattle, horses, sheep, donkeys and goats. The cattle were very important because they provided food, oil and hides. In the year of 1818, 35,274 cattle wandered over the mission lands as far as the Oxnard Plain. A little time after January 7, 1831, the animal population decreased to a low of 4,000 cattle, 3,000 sheep, 300 horses and 60 mules. In July 1839, Inspector-General E.P. Hartnell found 2,208 cattle, 1,670 sheep, 799 horses, 35 mules and 65 goats. The soil around Mission San Buenaventura was very good so the mission could grow many crops. San Buenaventura grew apples, grapes, bananas, pears, plums, pomegranates, figs, oranges, coconuts, beans, grain, corn and barley. In the year of 1818, 12,483 bushels of grain were harvested. Shortly after January 7, 1831, harvests had been reduced to 1,750 bushels of wheat, 2,000 bushels of barley, 500 bushels of corn, and 400 bushels of beans. In July 1839, Inspector-General William E.P. Hartnell found 322 fanegas of wheat, 182 fanegas of corn and 35 fanegas of peas.

==Mission bells==
Bells were vitally important to daily life at Mission San Buenaventura, which had five bells. The bells were borrowed from Mission Santa Barbara because there were no bells at the time. They were never returned. The bell facing north is labeled &quot;S. San Francisco 1781&quot;. The bell facing east has the inscription: &quot;San Pedro Alcantra 1781&quot;. A small swinging bell hangs in the southern arch with the lettering: &quot;Ave Maria S. Joseph&quot;. The only bell used daily at San Buenaventura is large and crown topped with a cross on its side. Inscribed on the bell is &quot;Ave Maria Pruysyma D Sapoyan Ano D 1825&quot;, which means &quot;Hail Mary Most Pure. Mary of Zapopan Year of 1825.&quot; This bell was originally cast for the church of Zapopan but was later sent to Mission San Buenaventura. Another bell, which was once the gift of the Spanish Viceroy, is inscribed &quot;Marquez de Croix Mexico November 12, 1770&quot;. It is currently owned by Senora Isabel del Valle Cram. There are also two wooden bells in the museum that measure about two feet. These were the only wooden bells in the California missions.

<text>Mission Santa Barbara () is a Spanish mission in Santa Barbara, California, United States. Often referred to as the &#x27;Queen of the Missions&#x27;, it was founded by Padre Fermín Lasuén for the Franciscan order on December 4, 1786, the feast day of Saint Barbara, as the tenth mission of what would later become 21 missions in Alta California.

Mission Santa Barbara, like other California missions, was built as part of a broader effort to consolidate the Spanish claim on Alta California in the face of threats from rival empires. In attempting to do this, Spain sought to turn local indigenous tribes into good Spanish citizens (for Mission Santa Barbara, this was the Chumash-Barbareño tribe). This required religious conversion and integration into the Spanish colonial economy – for the local Chumash people, the environmental changes wrought by the Mission&#x27;s large herd of livestock, combined with epidemics and military force, meant that tribal members often had little choice but to join the mission system, resulting in a type of forced servitude.

The mission is the namesake of the city of Santa Barbara as well as of Santa Barbara County and comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a girl who was beheaded by her father for following the Christian faith.

The Mission grounds occupy a rise between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, and were consecrated by Father Fermín Lasuén, who had taken over the presidency of the California mission chain upon the death of Father Junípero Serra. Mission Santa Barbara is, along with mission San Luis Rey, the only mission to remain under the leadership of the Franciscan Friars since its founding, and today is a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

==History==
===Construction and development===
The early missionaries built three different chapels during the first few years, each larger than the previous one. In 1787, the first chapel built was a palisaded log structure with a grass roof and an earthen floor that measured x . In 1789, the second chapel was constructed out of adobe with roof tiles and measured x . In 1793–94, it was replaced again with another adobe tiled-roof structure that measured x . However, the third chapel was destroyed by the 1812 Santa Barbara earthquake on December 21.

By 1815, construction of the fourth Mission structure had begun and was mostly completed by 1820. Most probably under the direction of master stonemason José Antonio Ramiez (as estimated by historians), the work was performed by a labor force of Canalino people. The towers were severely damaged in the June 29, 1925, earthquake, but the walls were held intact by the buttresses. Restoration was undertaken the following year. By project completion in 1927, the church had been accurately rebuilt to retain its original design using the original materials to reproduce the walls, columns, and arches. Some years later it was discovered that the concrete foundation of the church had begun to disintegrate while it was settling into the ground, thereby causing the towers to crack. Between 1950 and 1953, the facade and towers were demolished and rebuilt to duplicate their original form. The appearance of the interior of the church has not been altered significantly since 1820.

Remains of the Mission&#x27;s original infrastructure constructed primarily by the indentured Chumash people under Franciscan rule are located on the eastern abutting property known as Mission Historical Park, which was sold to the City in 1928. These ruins include tanning vats, a pottery kiln, and a guard house as well as an extensive water distribution system that incorporated aqueducts, a filtration system, two reservoirs, and a hydro-powered gristmill. The larger reservoir, which was built in 1806 by the expedient of damming of Mission Canyon situated to the north within the existing Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, continued to serve as a functioning component of the city&#x27;s water system until 1993. Also intact near the entrance to the Mission is the original fountain and &quot;lavadero&quot;.

===Relations with the Chumash tribe===
Mission Santa Barbara was part of a broader plan by the Kingdom of Spain to protect its claim on Alta California against rival colonial powers (Russia and Great Britain). The mission was expected to turn the local indigenous people into upstanding Spanish citizens through conversion to Catholicism and by making them productive members of the Spanish colonial economy.

The main economic activity of the missions in the region that was occupied by the local Chumash tribe was animal husbandry and related products (hides and tallow). The average size of the Santa Barbara Mission&#x27;s herd was a little over 14,000 animals over the 1806–1810 period. Large numbers of Chumash workers were required to care for this herd and to serve the other needs of the Mission. At the same time, the herds disrupted the sophisticated Chumash system of hunting and gathering, placing the tribes in an increasingly precarious position and aggravating the existing demographic stress caused by epidemics of European diseases against which the Chumash had no immunity. Thus, the Chumash often had little choice but to join the mission. A modern source describes the lives of indigenous people in the mission system as being &#x27;controlled by the padres&#x27;; it also notes that baptised indigenous peoples &#x27;were not allowed to leave without permission&#x27;.

In 1818, two Argentine ships under the command of the French privateer, Hipólito Bouchard approached the coast and threatened the young town of Santa Barbara. The padres, led by Fray Antonio Ripoll armed and trained 180 of the neophytes to mobilize for the anticipated attack. They were organized into an infantry unit comprising one-hundred archers that were reinforced by an additional fifty brandishing machetes, and a cavalry unit of thirty lancers. Father Ripoll named the unit &quot;&quot;Compañía de Urbanos Realistas de Santa Bárbara&quot;.&quot; With their help, the Presidio soldiers confronted Bouchard, who sailed out of the harbor without attacking.

===Decline of the Chumash population and the Chumash revolt===
In 1803, 1,792 Chumash lived as neophytes within 234 adobe huts that surrounded the mission, which was the highest number living onsite during a single year. By 1820, the Mission&#x27;s Chumash population declined to 1,132 and then dropped to 962 three years later.

During the Chumash revolt of 1824, under the leadership of Andrés Sagimomatsee, the mission was briefly seized and looted. The soldiers posted there were disarmed (two of them were wounded with machete blows) and were sent back to the Presidio. After an indecisive battle was fought against troops from the Presidio, most of the Indians withdrew over the Santa Ynez Mountains via Mission Canyon and eventually on to the eastern interior; while fifty others had fled during the night of the uprising to Santa Cruz Island in plank canoes embarking from Mescaltitlán.

For a few months thereafter, the mission was mostly devoid of any Chumash presence until a pardon agreement was brokered for their return by Father Presidente Vicente Francisco de Sarría (sent from Monterrey) and Father Antonio Ripoll (minister of the Santa Barbara Mission). A military expedition, led by Captain Pablo de la Portilla, had been sent in pursuit of the Chumash &quot;for the purpose of subjugating and restoring to their mission the neophytes of Santa Barbara who had fled to the tulares&quot;. After a seven-day long march from the Presidio, Captain de la Portilla and his division consisting of roughly 104 soldiers equipped with &quot;caliber-4 cannon&quot; arrived near Lake Tulares on June 9, 1824, and began negotiations for the surrender of the Indians (who were referred to as the rebels or fugitives); a process that took about six days. The majority of those captured, including many women, children, and elders were marched back on a route leading across the Cuyama Valley and over the mountains southward towards the Santa Barbara Mission through San Roque Canyon on a journey (according to del Portilla&#x27;s log) lasting from June 15 or 16, until their arrival on June 23 (with &quot;straggling families&quot; arriving over the course of subsequent days). An untallied number of elderly and infirmed were reported to have perished along the way. By June 28 of that year, about 816 out of an approximate population of 1,000 had returned to the mission.

From 1836 to 1839 the remaining Chumash residing at the Mission dwindled from 481 to 246. By 1854, records stated that &quot;only a few Indians were about the area of the mission&quot;. Although there are purportedly no records kept by the Franciscans which offer an explanation of the diminishing trend of the Chumash population, all of the California missions throughout their establishment experienced a mortality rate that exceeded their birthrate. Modern sources attribute this decline to ill-treatment, overwork, malnutrition, violence and disease.

===Post-secularization===

After the Mexican Congress passed &quot; An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California&quot; on August 17, 1833, Father Presidente Narciso Durán transferred the missions&#x27; headquarters to Santa Barbara, thereby making Mission Santa Barbara the repository of some 3,000 original documents that had been scattered through the California missions.

In 1840, Alta California and Baja California Territory were removed from the Diocese of Sonora to form the Diocese of Both Californias. Bishop Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno, OFM, established his cathedra at Mission Santa Barbara, making the chapel the pro-cathedral of the diocese until 1849. Under Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi, C.M., the chapel again served as a pro-cathedral, for the Diocese of Monterey and then the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, from 1853 to 1876. It is for this reason that of all the California missions, only the chapel at Mission Santa Barbara has two matching bell towers. At that time, that particular architectural feature was restricted to a cathedral church.

When President Abraham Lincoln restored the missions to the Catholic Church on March 18, 1865, the Mission&#x27;s leader at the time, Friar José González Rubio, came into conflict with Bishop Amat over the matter of whether the Mission should be under the ownership of the Franciscan order rather than the diocese. Bishop Amat refused to give the deed for the Mission to the Franciscans, but in 1925, Bishop John J. Cantwell finally awarded the deed to them.

As the center for the Franciscans, the Mission played an important role in education in the late 1900s and early twentieth century. From 1854 to 1885 it was chartered as an apostolic college and from 1869 to 1877 it also functioned as a college for laymen, Thereby making it Santa Barbara&#x27;s first institution of higher education. In 1896, this education initiative led to the creation of a high school seminary program that in 1901 would become a separate institution, Saint Anthony&#x27;s Seminary. In 1929 the college level program was relocated to Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and would become San Luis Rey College from 1950 to 1968 before relocating to Berkeley, California what is today the Franciscan School of Theology (FST).

==Contemporary uses==
The City of Santa Barbara originally developed between the Mission proper and the harbor, specifically near El Presidio Reál de Santa Bárbara (the &quot;Royal Spanish Presidio&quot;), about a mile southeast of the Mission. As the city grew, it extended throughout the coastal plain. A residential area now surrounds the Mission with public parks (Mission Historical Park and Rocky Nook Park) and a few public buildings (such as the Natural History Museum) in the adjacent area.

Mission Santa Barbara includes a gift shop, a museum, a Franciscan Friary, and a retreat house. The Mission grounds are a tourist attraction. The Mission is owned by the Franciscan Province of Santa Barbara and the parish church rents the church from the Franciscans. For many decades in the late 20th century, Fr. Virgil Cordano, OFM served as the pastor of the St. Barbara&#x27;s Parish co-located on the grounds of the Santa Barbara Mission. He died in 2008. Since the summer of 2017, the Mission has served as the Interprovincial Novitiate for the English Speaking Provinces of the Franciscan Friars (Observants).

The Mission also houses the Santa Barbara Mission-Archive Library, which collects and preserves &#x27;historical and cultural resources pertaining to Franciscan history and Missions and the communities with which they interacted, especially in Colonial New Spain, Northwestern Mexico, and the Southwestern United States.&#x27; The sources of the Library&#x27;s collections can be traced to the 1760s with Fray Junipero Serra&#x27;s plans for missions in Alta California. The collections include named sections, the Junipero Serra Collection (1713–1947), the California Mission Documents (1640–1853), and the Apostolic College collection (1853–1885). The Archive-Library also has a large collection of early California writings, maps, and images as well as a collection of materials for the Tohono O&#x27;oodham Indians of Arizona. Beginning with the writings of Hubert Howe Bancroft, the Library has served as a center for historical study of the missions for more than a century. It is an independent non-profit educational and research institution that is separate from Mission Santa Barbara, but occupies a portion of the Mission complex. Some Franciscans serve on the Board of Trustees along with scholars and community members; the institution is directed by a lay academic scholar.

The Mission also has the oldest unbroken tradition of choral singing among the California Missions and, indeed, of any California institution. The weekly Catholic liturgy is serviced by two choirs, the California Mission Schola and the Cappella Barbara. The Mission archives contain one of the richest collections of colonial Franciscan music manuscripts known today, which remain closely guarded (most have not yet been subjected to scholarly analysis).

<text>Psilocybe cubensis, commonly known as the magic mushroom, shroom, golden halo, golden teacher, cube, or gold cap, is a species of psilocybin mushroom of moderate potency whose principal active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the fungus family Hymenogastraceae and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis. It is the best-known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1906 as &quot;Stropharia cubensis&quot; by American mycologist Franklin Sumner Earle in Cuba. In 1907, it was identified as &quot;Naematoloma caerulescens&quot; in Tonkin (now Vietnam) by French pharmacist and mycologist Narcisse Théophile Patouillard, while in 1941, it was called &quot;Stropharia cyanescens&quot; by William Alphonso Murrill near Gainesville in Florida. German-born mycologist Rolf Singer moved the species into the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; in 1949, giving it the binomial name &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;. The synonyms were later also assigned to the species &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;.

The name &quot; Psilocybe &quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek roots &quot;psilos&quot; (ψιλος) and &quot;kubê&quot; (κυβη), and translates as &quot;bare head&quot;. &quot;Cubensis&quot; means &quot;coming from Cuba&quot;, and refers to the type locality published by Earle.

Singer divided &quot;P. cubensis&quot; into three varieties: the nominate, which usually had a brownish cap, Murrill&#x27;s &quot;cyanescens&quot; from Florida, which generally had a pale cap, and var &quot;caerulascens&quot; from Indochina with a more yellowish cap.

&quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is commonly known as gold top, golden top or gold cap in Australia, sacred mushroom or blue mushroom in Brazil, and San Ysidro or Palenque mushroom in the United States and Mexico, while the term &quot;magic mushroom&quot; has been applied to hallucinogenic mushrooms in general. It is commonly known as &quot;Golden teacher&quot; in South Africa. A common name in Thai is &quot;Hed keequai&quot;, which translates as &quot;mushroom which appears after water buffalo defecates&quot;.

==Description==

The cap is , conic to with a central papilla when young, becoming broadly convex to plane with age, retaining a slight umbo sometimes surrounded by a ring-shaped depression. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, sometimes with white universal veil remnants attached. The cap is brown becoming paler to almost white at the margin and fades to more golden-brown or yellowish with age. When bruised, all parts of the mushroom stain blue. The narrow grey gills are adnate to adnexed, sometimes seceding attachment, and darken to purplish-black and somewhat mottled with age. The gill edges remain whitish. The hollow white stipe is high by thick, becoming yellowish in age. The well-developed veil leaves a persistent white membranous ring whose surface usually becomes the same color as the gills because of falling spores. The fruiting bodies are 90% water. The mushroom has no odor and has been described as tasting farinaceous, with an alkaline or metallic aftertaste. The spores are 11.5–17.3 x 8–11.5 μm, sub-ellipsoid, basidia 4-spored but sometimes 2- or 3-, pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia present.

The related species &quot;Psilocybe subcubensis&quot;—found in tropical regions—is indistinguishable but has smaller spores.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is a pan-tropical species, occurring in the Gulf Coast states and southeastern United States, Mexico, in the Central American countries of Belize, Costa Rica, Panamá, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Caribbean countries Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guadalupe, Martinique, and Trinidad, in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Uruguay and Peru, Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, India, Australia, Fiji, and possibly Nepal and Hawaii.

&quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is found on cow (and occasionally horse) dung, sugar cane mulch or rich pasture soil, with mushrooms appearing from February to December in the northern hemisphere, and November to April in the southern hemisphere. In Asia, the species grows on water buffalo dung. Along with other fungi that grow on cow dung, &quot;P. cubensis&quot; is thought to have colonized Australia with the introduction of cattle there, 1800 of which were on the Australian mainland by 1803—having been transported there from the Cape of Good Hope, Kolkata and the American west coast. In Australia, the species grows between northern Queensland to southern New South Wales.

In March 2018, several &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; specimens were collected in Zimbabwe in the Wedza District of Mashonaland East province, approx. 120 km  southeast of Harare. This was the first reported occurrence of a psilocybin mushroom in Zimbabwe. The mushrooms were collected on Imire Rhino &amp; Wildlife Conservation - a nature reserve that is home to both wildlife and cattle, as well as cattle egrets.

==Relationship with cattle==

Because &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is intimately associated with cattle ranching, the fungus has found unique dispersal niches not available to most other members of the family Hymenogastraceae. Of particular interest is the cattle egret (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;), a colonizer of Old World origin (via South America), whose range of distribution overlaps much of that of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis.&quot; Cattle egrets typically walk alongside cattle, preying on insects; they track through spore-laden vegetation and cow dung and transfer the spores to suitable habitats, often thousands of miles away during migration activities. This type of spore dispersal is known as zoochory, and it enables a parent species to propagate over a much greater range than it could achieve alone. The relationship between cattle, cattle egrets, and &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is an example of symbiosis—a situation in which dissimilar organisms live together in close association.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; grows naturally in tropical and subtropical conditions, often near cattle due to the ideal conditions they provide for the growth of the fungus. The cow usually consumes grains or grass covered with the spores of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; and the fungus will begin to germinate within the dung.

Mushrooms such as &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; are relatively easy to cultivate indoors. First, spores are inoculated within sterilized jars or bags, colloquially known as grainspawn, containing a form of carbohydrate nutrient such as rye grains. After approximately one month, the spores fully colonize the grain spawn forming dense mycelium, which is then planted within a substrate such as a coconut husk fiber and vermiculite mixture. Given proper humidity, temperature, and fresh air exchange, the substrate will produce fruiting &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; bodies within a month of planting. To preserve potency after harvesting, growers often dehydrate the fruit and store them in air-tight containers in cool environments.

A study conducted in 2009 showed that mushrooms grown in the dark had higher levels of psilocybin and psilocin compared to the mushrooms grown in bright, indirect light, which had minimum levels.

Studies were conducted where an environmentally controlled wind tunnel and a computer program were used to determine the influence of humidity on the individual basidiocarps of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; which aided in mapping their growth and development. The transpiration and growth of the mushroom were heavily influenced by the humidity of the air, and the transpiration was accelerated at higher humidities while light did not affect the growth. Faster growth was observed at higher humidities. It was also discovered that misting enhanced both the growth and transpiration rates in the growing process of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;.

Small-scale cultivation of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; is often accomplished with &quot;cakes&quot; that colonize within jars, but fruit inside specially designed tubs called &quot;shotgun fruiting chambers&quot;. The most common cake method for beginners is PF-Tek (&quot;Psilocybe Fanaticus technique&quot;), named after Psylocybe Fanaticus, the clandestine cultivator credited for its creation. Cakes are popular for the new cultivator because of their fool-proof inoculation methods and low cost of startup materials. As cakes are composed of brown rice flour, vermiculite, and gypsum, they can be steam-sterilized in a large pot. Unlike cereal grains used in bulk growing, brown rice flour contains no bacterial endospores, a contamination vector requiring a pressure cooker to sterilize.

Cultivation methods resulting in larger yields are categorized as &quot;bulk growing.&quot; Bulk growing allows cultivators to operate on a larger scale, but require a greater investment of time, money, and knowledge. While small-scale grows utilize spore syringes to inject spore solution into cakes, bulk methods instead use grain spawn as primary nutrition for the subsequent growth. Additionally, cultivators must develop solid sterile technique in working with agar. Instead of inoculating grain with spores, growers instead germinate spores on agar plates, then transfer the resultant healthy mycelium to the grain jars. Once the grain is colonized with clean mycelial growth, users inoculate their bulk substrates with the grain in a process known as &quot;spawning.&quot; Bulk substrates are frequently a mix of coir, vermiculite and gypsum due to not requiring pasteurization or sterilization. However, some utilize blends of manure-based substrates or straw; substrates which always require pasteurization with open-air spawning. After spawning, the healthy mycelium will colonize the bulk substrate, and given proper conditions, eventually fruit mushrooms.

Terence and Dennis McKenna made &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; particularly famous when they published &quot;Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower&#x27;s Guide&quot; in the 1970s upon their return from the Amazon rainforest, having deduced new methods (based on pre-existing techniques originally described by J.P. San Antonio) for growing psilocybin mushrooms and assuring their audience that &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; were amongst the easiest psilocybin-containing mushrooms to cultivate.

The potency of cultivated specimens can vary widely per each flush (harvest). In a classic paper published by Jeremy Bigwood and M.W. Beug, it was shown that with each flush, psilocybin levels varied somewhat unpredictably but were much the same on the first flush as they were on the last flush; however, psilocin was typically absent in the first two flushes but peaked by the fourth flush, making it the most potent. Two strains were also analyzed to determine potency in caps and stems: In one strain the caps contained generally twice as much psilocybin as the stems, but the small amount of psilocin present was entirely in the stems. In the other strain, a trace of psilocin was present in the cap but not in the stem; the cap and stem contained equal amounts of psilocybin. The study concluded that the levels of psilocybin and psilocin vary by over a factor of four in cultures of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; grown under controlled conditions.

==Psychedelic and entheogenic use==

Singer noted in 1949 that &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; had psychoactive properties.

In Australia, the use of psychoactive mushrooms grew rapidly between 1969 and 1975.

In a 1992 paper, locals and tourists in Thailand were reported to consume &quot;P. cubensis&quot; and related species in mushroom omelets—particularly in Ko Samui and Ko Pha-ngan. At times, omelets were adulterated with LSD, resulting in prolonged intoxication. A thriving subculture had developed in the region. Other localities, such as Hat Yai, Ko Samet, and Chiang Mai, also had some reported usage.

In 1996, jars of honey containing &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; were confiscated at the Dutch-German border. Upon examination, it was revealed that jars of honey containing psychedelic mushrooms were being sold at Dutch coffee shops.

&quot;P. cubensis&quot; is one of the most widely known of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms used for triggering psychedelic experiences after ingestion.
Its major alkaloids are:

* Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine)
* Psilocin (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine)
* Baeocystin (4-phosphoryloxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine)
* Norbaeocystin (4-phosphoryloxytryptamine)
* Aeruginascin (&quot;N,N,N&quot;-trimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine)

The potential psychoactivity of other compounds other than psilocybin and psilocin has been speculated but not confirmed.

The concentrations of psilocin and psilocybin, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, are in the range of 0.14–0.42% (wet weight) and 0.37–1.30% (dry weight) in the whole mushroom 0.17–0.78% (wet weight) and 0.44–1.35% (dry weight) in the cap, and 0.09%–0.30% (wet weight) and 0.05–1.27% (dry weight) in the stem, respectively. For quickly and practically measuring the psychoactive contents of most healthy &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; varieties, it can generally be assumed that there is approximately 15 mg (+/- 5 mg) of psilocybin per gram of dried mushroom. Furthermore, due to factors such as age and storage method, the psilocybin and psilocin content of a given sample of mushrooms will vary.

Individual body composition, brain chemistry and psychological predisposition play a significant role in determining appropriate doses. For a modest psychedelic effect, a minimum of one gram of dried &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; mushrooms is ingested orally, 0.25–1 gram is usually sufficient to produce a mild effect, 1–2.5 grams usually provides a moderate effect and 2.5 grams and higher usually produces strong effects. For most people, 3.5 dried grams (1/8 oz) would be considered a high dose and may produce an intense experience; this is, however, typically considered a standard dose among recreational users. Body composition (usually weight) should be taken into account when calculating dosage. For many individuals, doses above three grams may be overwhelming. For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25 gram can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses. For most people, however, that dose level would have virtually no effects.

There are many different ways to ingest &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;. Users may prefer to take them raw, freshly harvested, or dried and preserved. It is also possible to prepare culinary dishes such as pasta or tea with the mushrooms. However, the psychoactive compounds begin to break down rapidly at temperatures exceeding 100 °C (212 °F). Another method of ingestion known as &quot;Lemon Tekking&quot; involves combining pulverized &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; with a concentrated citrus juice with a pH of ~2. Many users believe that a considerable amount of the psilocybin will have been dephosphorylated into psilocin, the psychoactive metabolite, by citric acid. However, this claim is not substantiated by the literature on the metabolism of psilocybin, as dephosphorylation is known to be mediated by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in humans. It is therefore more likely that citric acid mostly helps in breakdown of mushroom cells, aiding in digestion and psilocybin release.
The &quot;Lemon Tekk&quot; method of consumption results in a more rapid onset and can offer easier digestion or reduced &quot;come-up pressure&quot; associated with raw consumption.

Upon ingestion, effects usually begin after approximately 20–60 minutes (depending on the method of ingestion and stomach contents) and may last from four to ten hours, depending on dosage, potency of cultivar, and individual biochemistry. Visual distortions often occur, including walls that seem to breathe, a vivid enhancement of colors, and the animation of organic shapes.

The effects of high doses can be overwhelming depending on the particular phenotype of cubensis, grow method, and the individual. It is recommended not to eat wild mushrooms without properly identifying them as they may be poisonous. In particular, similar species include mushrooms of the genus &quot;Galerina&quot; and &quot;Pholiotina rugosa&quot;—all potentially deadly—and &quot;Chlorophyllum molybdites&quot;. All of these grow in pastures, a similar habitat to that preferred by &quot;P. cubensis&quot;.

In 2019, a 15-year-old boy suffered from transient kidney failure after eating &quot;P. cubensis&quot; from a cultivation kit in Canada. No one else in the group suffered any ill effects.

===Legality===
Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. However, mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin are not illegal in some parts of the world. For example, in Brazil they are legal, but extractions from the mushroom containing psilocybin and psilocin remain illegal. In the United States, growing or possessing &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; mushrooms is illegal in all states, but it is legal to possess and buy the spores for microscopy purposes. However, as of May 8, 2019 Denver, Colorado has decriminalized it for those 21 and up. On June 4, 2019, Oakland, California followed suit, decriminalizing psilocybin-containing mushrooms as well as the Peyote cactus. On January 29, 2020, Santa Cruz, California decriminalized naturally-occurring psychedelics, including psilocybin mushrooms. On November 3, 2020, the state of Oregon decriminalized possession of psilocybin mushrooms for recreational use and granted licensed practitioners permission to administer psilocybin mushrooms to individuals age 21 years and older.

In 1978, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Fiske vs Florida&quot; that possession of psilocybin mushrooms is not illegal, in that the mushrooms cannot be considered a &quot;container&quot; for psilocybin based on how the law is written, i.e., it does not specifically state that psilocybin mushrooms themselves are illegal, but that the hallucinogenic constituents in them are. According to this decision, the applicable statute as framed imparts no information as to which plants may contain psilocybin in its natural state and does not advise a person of ordinary intelligence that this substance is contained in a particular variety of mushroom. The statute, therefore, can not constitutionally be applied to the appellant.

The production, sale and possession of magic mushrooms is illegal in Canada.

<text>Mission La Purísima Concepción, or La Purísima Mission (originally La Misión de la Purísima Concepción de la Santísima Virgen María, or &quot;The Mission of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;) is a Spanish mission in Lompoc, California. It was established on December 8, 1787 (the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, hence the mission&#x27;s name) by the Franciscan order. The original mission complex south of Lompoc was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812, and the mission was rebuilt at its present site a few miles to the northeast.

The mission is part of the larger La Purísima Mission State Historic Park, part of the California State Parks system, and along with Mission San Francisco de Solano is one of only two of the Spanish missions in California that is no longer governed by the Catholic Church. It is currently the only example in California of a complete Spanish Catholic mission complex, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

==History==
===Original mission===

Mission La Purísima was originally established at a site known to the Chumash people as Algsacpi and to the Spanish as the plain of Río Santa Rosa, one mile south of Lompoc. (During the mission period, the Chumash spoke the Purisimeño language.) The Viceroyalty of New Spain made an exception to the rule that no California mission was to be established within seven miles of any pueblo in Las Californias, as Lompoc was so small. The site was the location of the mission from its founding on December 8, 1787, by Fermín Lasuén till it was destroyed by the 1812 Ventura earthquake on December 12, 1812. The original mission was associated with the Presidio of Santa Barbara. Fermín Lasuén (1736–1803) was a Spanish Franciscan missionary to Alta California and the president of the Franciscan missions. He was the founder of nine of the twenty-one Spanish missions in California including original Mission La Purísima, the 11th mission.

By 1803, the Mission Indian population had increased, by Indian Reductions, to 1,436 Chumash people. At the mission there were also 3,230 cattle, 5,400 sheep, 306 horses, and 39 mules. In the same year, there was a harvest of 690 fanegas of wheat, corn and beans (a fanega equaling about 220 pounds).

The mission grew from its founding to be 330 feet square quadrangle made of adobe bricks. The original mission had many rooms for the two priests, the evangelized Chumash and for a chapel, six soldiers, married Indians and unmarried females. At its peak about 1,520 Chumash Indian lived at the mission. The original mission was south of the Santa Ynez River and included vast crop and grazing lands.

An earthquake on December 21, 1812, severely damaged the mission buildings.

The site became a California State Historical Landmark No. 928 on June 29, 1979. Ruins of the original mission are at 508 South F Street, near East Locust Avenue in Lompoc, California. The California State Historical Landmark reads:
:&quot;NO. 928 SITE OF ORIGINAL MISSION AND REMAINING RUINS OF BUILDINGS OF MISSION DE LA PURÍSIMA CONCEPCIÓN DE MARÍA SANTISIMA - The ruins at this site are part of the original Mission La Purísima, founded by Padre Fermín de Lasuén on December 8, 1787, as the 11th in the chain of Spanish Missions in California. The mission was destroyed by earthquake on December 12, 1812, the present Mision (mission) La Purisima was then established several miles away. &quot; 

===Second mission===
Mariano Payeras received permission to relocate the mission community to the northeast in La Cañada de los Berros, next to El Camino Real. La Purísima Mission was officially established in its new location on April 23, 1813. Materials salvaged from the buildings destroyed by the earthquake were used to construct the new buildings four miles northeast of the pueblo at their present location, which was known to the Chumash as Amúu, and to the Spanish as La Cañada de los Berros. The buildings were completed within ten years.

===Chumash revolt of 1824===
After Mexico won the Mexican War of Independence in 1823, Spanish funding ceased to the Santa Barbara Presidio. Many soldiers at the mission who were no longer being paid by the new Mexican government took out their frustrations on the local Chumash Indians. After a soldier apparently beat an Indian at nearby Mission Santa Inés, the Chumash revolt of 1824 began at that mission. It spread to La Purísima Mission, where the Chumash people took over the mission for one month until more soldiers arrived from Monterey Presidio. The Chumash lost their hold on the mission with many leaving the mission soon thereafter. Many of the Indians who had sought refuge in the neighboring mountains during the revolt returned to the mission.

Following independent Mexico&#x27;s secularization of the Alta California missions from 1834 to 1843, the buildings of La Purísima Mission were abandoned. The Mexican government, which had gained independence from Spain, transferred control of the missions from the Catholic Church to civil authorities. The property passed into private ownership and the mission buildings fell into ruin; the lands were granted to the Rancho Ex-Mission la Purisima.

===20th century===
In 1933 the Union Oil Company deeded several parcels to the State of California. By 1934, only nine of the buildings remained intact.

In the 20th century, under direction of the National Park Service, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) pledged to restore the mission if enough land could be provided to convert it into a historic landmark. The Catholic Church and the Union Oil Company donated sufficient land for the CCC to proceed with the restoration. The nine buildings as well as many small structures and the original water system were fully restored with the mission&#x27;s dedication occurring on December 7, 1941, the same day the United States entered World War II. Today, La Purísima Mission is the only example in California of a complete mission complex.

As of 2011 it was considered to be the most completely restored Spanish mission in California. Ten of the original buildings are fully restored and furnished, including the church, shops, quarters, and blacksmith shop. The mission gardens and livestock represent what would have been found at the mission during the 1820s. Special living history events are scheduled throughout the year. A visitor center features information, displays and artifacts, and a self-guided tour gives visitors the opportunity to step back in time for a glimpse of a brief, turbulent period in California&#x27;s history.

==La Purísima Mission State Historic Park==
La Purísima Mission is now part of the La Purísima Mission State Historic Park within the California State Parks System. Located outside Lompoc, California, the park was established in 1935. With a visitor center and guided tours, the historic park is maintained by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). La Purísima is located in Lompoc, in the county of Santa Barbara, California.

La Purísima Mission State Historic Park was one of many state parks threatened with closure in 2008. Those closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide.

<text>Mission Santa Cruz (Spanish: &quot;La Misión de la Exaltación de la Santa Cruz&quot;, lit. The Mission of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross) is a replica Spanish Californian mission in Santa Cruz, California. Located on the San Lorenzo River floodplain below what would later be named Mission Hill, the mission was founded on August 28, 1791, by Father Fermín Francisco de Lasuén, the successor to Father Junipero Serra. The mission was dedicated that same year but, in the winter rainy season, the river overflowed its banks and flooded the mission compound. The mission was then relocated to the top of Mission Hill.

After earthquake damage and years of neglect, this second mission fell into disrepair, and much of it, though not all, was removed to accommodate the construction of the Holy Cross Church in 1889. A scaled-down replica was constructed in the 1930s, which today functions as a historical monument and chapel for the parish.

Near the replica chapel stands the one surviving Mission Santa Cruz Mission building, an adobe structure built between 1822 and 1824. This adobe building served as housing for Indigenous families who, after being converted to Catholicism, lived and worked at the Mission. It is the oldest surviving structure in Santa Cruz County and the best preserved Native American residence at any of the Alta California missions. It is now part of Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park.

== History ==
The outpost was originally established near the Uypi village of &quot;Aulintak&quot;, located near the mouth of the San Lorenzo River, on August 28, 1791. There the Franciscan brothers erected a tent for worship to bring Christianity to the Awaswas people. The settlement was named for the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, adopting the name given to a nearby creek by the missionary priest Juan Crespi, who accompanied the explorer Gaspar de Portolá when he camped on the San Lorenzo River on October 17, 1769.

The original mission was a small structure dedicated on September 25, 1791. It was located on the bottom of what would become Mission Hill, near what is today the intersection of River and North Pacific Streets, on the San Lorenzo River&#x27;s flood plains. The mission was flooded as the river swelled with the rains that winter. Over the next three years until 1793, the padres rebuilt the mission on the hill overlooking the river.

As with the other California missions, Mission Santa Cruz served as a site for ecclesiastical conversion of natives, first the people, the original inhabitants of the region (called &quot;Costeño&quot; by the Spaniards, and later known as the &quot;Ohlone&quot;). Later, Yokuts people were brought from the east. The settlement was the site of the first autopsy in Alta California.

It was one of the smaller missions, in the fourth military district under protection of the Presidio of San Francisco.

In 1797, the secular &quot;pueblo&quot; (town) of Branciforte was founded across the San Lorenzo River to the east of Mission Santa Cruz. The mission padres did not welcome the location of the pueblo so close to the mission, and accused the Branciforte settlers of gambling, smuggling and tempting the native acolytes to desert the mission.

On October 12, 1812, Father Andrés Quintana was strangled to death by mission neophytes, angry over his use of a metal-tipped whip in the punishment of laborers, Native Americans, and Native children.

In 1818, the Mission received advance warning of an attack by the Argentine corsair (simply a pirate, from the Spanish point of view) Hipólito Bouchard and was evacuated. The citizens of Branciforte, several of whom were retired soldiers, were asked to protect the Mission&#x27;s valuables; instead, they were later accused (by the priests) of stealing. The people from the mission then decided to flee the mission, and they later arrived in a new mission.

One of the only surviving first-person descriptions by a native Californian of life in a mission was given in an interview by Lorenzo Asisara in 1877. Asisara was born at Mission Santa Cruz in 1819. His father was one of the neophytes involved in the Quintana killing, and Asisara repeated the story his father had told him about those events.

== Decline ==

The front wall of the adobe mission, built in 1794, was destroyed by the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. A wooden facade was added and the structure converted to other uses. A new wooden church was built next door in 1858. In 1889, the current Gothic Revival-style Holy Cross Church was built over (in the same orientation) part of the original sanctuary and cemetery. The cemetery wall was defined in 1993 and developed as a memorial and native plant garden.

The current Holy Cross Church was built on the site of the original mission church in 1889, and it remains an active parish of the Diocese of Monterey. A section of stone foundation wall from one of the mission buildings and a few old headstones from the mission cemetery can be found directly behind the present Holy Cross Church. A reduced-scale &quot;replica&quot; chapel was built near the mission site in the 1930s and functions as a chapel of Holy Cross Church. Today&#x27;s Plaza Park occupies the same location as the original plaza, at the center of the former mission complex. The complex at one time included as many as 32 buildings. The only surviving mission building, a dormitory for native acolytes, has been restored to its original appearance and functions as a museum of the Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park.

At the same time, the mission cemetery was excavated and the remains moved to a mass grave at Old Holy Cross Cemetery, a few miles to the east. In recent years, a group of local volunteers worked to restore the old cemetery, and to identify the mission gravesite and those whose remains were moved there. A memorial was dedicated in 2016.

The only original Mission building left is a long multi-room building which at one time housed local &quot;Yokuts&quot; and &quot;Ohlone&quot; Native American families. The original building is located at 144 School Street and can be toured during operating hours. There is also a protected remnant of the mission church foundation wall behind the current Holy Cross Church. The parish address is 126 High Street. The road leading to the mission from the west is called Mission Street, which is also part of California State Route 1.

In 1931, Gladys Sullivan Doyle proposed to construct a reduced-size replica of the original chapel. She contributed all of the construction costs, on the condition that she be allowed to be buried inside. Her grave can be viewed in a small side room. Since there were no surviving photographs or drawings of the original structure, design of the replica chapel was adapted from an 1876 (19 years after the collapse of the building&#x27;s front half) painting by the French painter Léon Trousset. The original painting hangs in the nave of the chapel.

The concrete construction was done by parishioner Tranquilino Costella, an Italian immigrant, whose contractor stamp is still seen in the sidewalk in front of the mission. The small replica chapel is mainly used for private services, daily Masses (M-F), and Morning Prayer on Saturday. An adjoining room functions as a gift shop. A stone fountain from the original mission complex stands in the garden behind the gift shop.

== Santa Cruz Mission Historic Park and District ==
The only surviving original adobe mission building, a dormitory for Native American residents, has been restored as part of the Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park as the Neary-Rodriguez Adobe. The Santa Cruz Mission is designated California Historical Landmark number 342.
The Neary-Rodriguez Adobe was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Cruz County, California as site number 75000484 on February 24, 1975,
and the Mission Hill Area as a United States Historic District as site number 76000530 on May 17, 1976.

==Unidentified adobe foundations==

The stone foundations of an unidentified adobe on the east edge of Mission Hill in Santa Cruz was first discovered in 1978. Prior to any excavations an extensive archival research program was carried out. After no mention was found in the written record, the foundations were given the name the &quot;Lost Adobe&quot;. Archaeological excavations (from 1981 to 1984) indicated the presence of 18+ rooms structural foundations extending west toward the original church and cemetery. Artifacts found were a diverse collection of Spanish Mission Era/ Mexican Republic materials including glass beads, Majolica ceramic fragments and phoenix buttons. These findings suggest that the structure was used to house the neophyte community of &quot;Yokuts&quot; and &quot;Ohlone&quot; families living at the Mission in the 1820s and 1830s. The Lost Adobe collapsed during the 19th century and no remnants remain. The area is on private property and visitors are not allowed.

== Mission Hill train tunnel ==
Mission Santa Cruz has a hidden single track gated railroad tunnel running under it. Railroad train service used to connect Oakland to Santa Cruz with a train going down the middle of Pacific Avenue on the way to the wharf. In 1876 South Pacific Coast Railroad built a railroad tunnel under Mission Santa Cruz to reroute train traffic out of the busy downtown corridor. The entrance can be found at the end of Amat Street with the tunnel going under the church&#x27;s parking lot and Emmett Street, and emerging at Chestnut Street. This is still an active rail line for Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway connecting Santa Cruz with Felton.

<text>Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (), commonly known as Mission Soledad, is a Spanish mission located in Soledad, California. The mission was founded by the Franciscan order on October 9, 1791, to convert the Native Americans living in the area to Catholicism. It was the thirteenth of California&#x27;s Spanish missions, and is named for Mary, Our Lady of Solitude. The town of Soledad is named for the mission.

After the 1835 secularization of the mission and the later sale of building materials, the mission fell into a state of disrepair and soon after was left in ruins. A restoration project began in 1954 and a new chapel was dedicated in 1955. The chapel now functions as a chapel of Our Lady of Solitude, a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey. The priests&#x27; residence was later recreated, and functions as a museum.

==History==

===Mission era===

Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, &quot;La Misión de María Santísima, Nuestra Señora Dolorosísima de la Soledad&quot; (&quot;The Mission of Mary Most Holy, Our Lady of Sorrows of Solitude&quot;), was founded October 9, 1791 by Fermín Francisco de Lasuén, the 13th of 21 missions in California.

The Chalon, a subgroup of the Ohlone were converted and resided there, followed by Esselen and Yokuts people. By 1803, there were 627 Mission Indians at Mission Soledad. At the Mission many Chalon married local Esselen speakers, while others married Yokuts were brought into the mission between 1806 and 1834.

The mission&#x27;s herds numbered 1,150 cattle, about 5,000 sheep, 30 swine, 670 horses, and 40 mules. Spanish Governor José Joaquín de Arrillaga was buried in the chapel after he died on July 24, 1814, during a visit to the Mission.

The mission was inundated by floods in 1824, 1828, and 1832, and following secularization (when Pio Pico sold the mission for a reported $800), the remaining buildings were looted for supplies. The mission&#x27;s land became Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad.

==Restoration and reconstruction==

In 1954, when the Mission Soledad restoration was begun, only piles of adobe dirt and a few wall sections from the &quot;cuadrángulo&quot; (quadrangle) remained. The chapel was reconstructed and dedicated under the auspices of the Native Daughters of the Golden West on October 9, 1955. The ruins of the quadrangle, cemetery, and some of the outer rooms, while not restored, can still be seen. Governor Arrillaga&#x27;s grave was identified and given a new marker.

The Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad is now a functioning Catholic chapel and public museum.

<text>Mission San José is a Spanish mission located in the present-day city of Fremont, California, United States. It was founded on June 11, 1797, by the Franciscan order and was the fourteenth Spanish mission established in California. The mission is the namesake of the Mission San José district of Fremont, which was an independent town subsumed into the city when it was incorporated in 1957.
The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after Mexican secularization act of 1833. After suffering decline, neglect and earthquakes most of the mission was in ruins. Restoration efforts in the intervening periods have reconstructed many of the original structures. The old mission church remains in use as a chapel of Saint Joseph Catholic Church, a parish of the Diocese of Oakland. The museum also features a visitor center, museum, and slide show telling the history of the mission.

==History==
The original site considered by Juan Crespí in 1772 for what was to become Mission San José was in what is today known as the San Ramon Valley. However, the Native Americans living in that area were very hostile towards the Spanish, so it was decided to locate the Mission farther south, in an area that is now part of Fremont, California.

Work on the site of Mission San Jose commenced in May 1797, many years after Crespí&#x27;s death, by Native American people from Mission Santa Clara, to the south, under the direction of Franciscan missionaries and secular Hispanic overseers. The location, on slopes overlooking the Fremont plain on the east side of San Francisco Bay, had been inhabited for countless generations by Indians who spoke the San Francisco Bay Ohlone language. The Ohlone lived a hunting and wild-plant harvesting lifestyle. Their food included seeds, roots, berries, the flour from acorns, small game, deer, fish, and shellfish. In 1797 most of the Indians, from the immediate vicinity of the mission site had already been baptized at Mission Santa Clara during the 1780s and early 1790s. It was these people who returned home to form the founding population of the new community. Mission San José&#x27;s walls were thick. The church is long, wide, high; made of adobe and redwood, the floor and the wall are made of tiles.

By the end of 1800, the neophyte population had risen to 277, including both Ohlone and Bay Miwok speakers. By the end of 1805, all Indians of the East Bay south of Carquinez Strait were at the missions. After a devastating measles epidemic that reduced the mission population by one quarter in 1806, people from more distant areas and new language groups began to join the Mission San Jose community. The first such language group was the Yokuts or Yokutsan, whose speakers began to move to Mission San José from the San Joaquin Valley in 1810. Members of two more language groups, the Coast Miwok from present Sonoma County and Patwin from present Napa and Solano counties, moved down to Mission San Jose in the 1812–1818 period, but in smaller numbers than the Yokuts. By 1825 Delta Yokuts was the dominant language in the multilingual community of 1,796 people. Over the next few years speakers of yet another language group, Plains Miwok, moved to the mission from the north side of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. By the time Mission San Jose was closed as an agricultural commune in the mid-1830s, Plains Miwok was the predominant native language among its neophyte Indian people.
Father Narciso Durán became the pastor of the mission in 1806 and remained until he was replaced by Father José González Rubio in February 1833 as part of a post-independence policy requiring the replacement of Spanish-born clerics with those born in Mexico. Durán trained the neophytes in music, organizing both a choir and a 30-piece orchestra that became famous throughout California. While at San José, Father Durán twice served as Father-Presidente of the Franciscan missions.

The Mission&#x27;s first permanent Adobe church was dedicated with great ceremony on April 22, 1809. Valuable gifts of vestments, sacred vessels, religious statues, and paintings attest to the generosity of friends of the Mission in the Bay Area and abroad. The majority of vestments in the modern collection date from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The silken fabrics and embroideries were products of various textile centers of the Spanish Empire, whose suppliers extended from Europe to Asia. Mission San José was the center of industry and agriculture. The site was chosen for the abundance of natural resources of the area including water, fertile ground, stones, and adobe soil suitable for building. Thousands of cattle roamed the Mission ranges, and acres of wheat and other crops were planted and harvested under the direction of the Padres. In 1868, it produced 4,070 bushels (110 metric tons) of wheat and much produce, including grapes, olives, and figs.

In 1832, the Mission&#x27;s 12,000 cattle, 13,000 horses, and 12,000 sheep roamed Mission lands from present-day Oakland to San Jose. San José was one of the most prosperous of all of the California missions. An 1833 inventory prepared by Father José González Rubio lists a church, monastery, guardhouse, guest house, and a women&#x27;s dormitory, in addition to the thousands of acres of crops and grazing land. This prosperity was not to last long, however. On August 17 of that year, the Mexican Congress passed &quot;An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California&quot;.

===Rancho period (1836–1853)===

During the transition to full secularization, Father José González Rubio remained at the Mission as chief administrator for the church, while José de Jesús Vallejo (brother of General Mariano G. Vallejo) was appointed a civil administrator. The Mission lands were gradually parceled out to private landowners. In 1842, Father González Rubio was transferred to Mission Santa Barbara. The native people fled but found themselves unable to readjust to their former way of life; many subsequently died of disease and starvation. The Mission buildings, granaries, orchards, and gardens were allowed to decay, and the great herds scattered. Mexican Governor Pío Pico sold the Mission property to private interests in 1845 for $12,000. During the 1848 California Gold Rush, H. C. Smith converted the Mission to a general store, saloon, and hotel. The town of Mission San José became a thriving provision center at the gateway to the Southern Mines. The names of many pioneer families prominent in early California history, including Livermore, Peralta, and Alviso, were closely linked to the Mission.

===California statehood (1850–1890)===
 The Rancho period ended with the succession of California to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and the establishment of California as a state in 1850. Some of the original exterior adobe buttresses were removed on orders of the parish priest. On March 18, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln restored the California missions to the Catholic Church.

On October 21, 1868, a magnitude 6.3–6.7 earthquake on the Hayward Fault which runs through the grounds of the Mission shattered the walls of the Mission church and broke open the roof. Other Mission buildings, including the Tienda, the Priest&#x27;s Quarters, and the Mission itself were also damaged by the earthquake.

The site was cleared and a wood-framed, Gothic-style church was erected directly over the original red-tiled Mission floor. In 1890, a Victorian-style rectory was built over the site of a portion of the adobe wing which housed the Padres and served as the administration building during the Mission Era.

===20th century and beyond (1900–present)===

The original mission complex consisted of over 100 adobe buildings. Restoration efforts by the Native Sons of the Golden West in 1915 and 1950 saved the surviving portion of the Mission wing and converted it into a museum, set in the gracious surroundings of flowers and palm trees. In 1956, the town of Mission San José incorporated with four others to become the City of Fremont. Plans to reconstruct the church of Mission San José were launched in 1973. The Victorian-style rectory was relocated to nearby Anza Street and the Gothic-style wooden church was moved to San Mateo where it has been restored as a house of worship by an Anglican church group. After extensive archaeological excavations and planning, construction began in 1982 on a replica of the 1809 adobe church. Work was completed and the facility rededicated on June 11, 1985. The walls vary in thickness from 4 to . Old timbers and rawhide thongs demonstrate the practicality of the Padres who, having no iron nails for building, substituted the leather laces. Consequently, the lumber used in the reconstruction has been given a hand-hewn appearance.

With its &quot;simple and forthright&quot; exterior, the Mission church stands as a tribute to those whose efforts made this dream come true. The richly decorated interior follows the descriptions in the historic inventories of the 1830s. The crystal chandeliers are copies of period pieces similar to ones listed in the old church inventories. Two of the original statues have been placed on the two side altars. &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, a figure of Christ clothed in a scarlet robe and crowned with thorns, stands on a balcony above one of the side altars. The other statue of Saint Bonaventure was carved from wood and then painted. The original baptismal font of hammered copper on a turned wood base has been returned to the church, as has the bell wheel used by the Ohlones during the sacred parts of the Mass.

The &quot;reredos&quot; behind the main altar features a painting of Christ, a statue of Saint Joseph, and two carved figures: a dove represents the Holy Spirit, and at the top sits God the Father with detailed golden rays surrounding him. The altar and choir railings were copied from an original piece found in the museum during the reconstruction. The Mission cemetery (&quot;camp Santo&quot;), where a great number of Mission pioneers are buried, is situated to the side of the church. During the dig, the marble grave marker of Robert Livermore was located in the original tile floor of the church. It was carefully repaired and replaced in the reconstructed church. Many prominent Spaniards are buried in the floor of the Mission church, but only Livermore&#x27;s grave is marked. Thousands of Ohlones are resting in the Ohlone cemetery located almost a mile away from the mission down Washington Boulevard. Three of the original Mission bells were transferred from the destroyed adobe church to the wooden church of 1869, where they hung until the 1970s. The fourth bell had been given to a church in Oakland and recast, but was returned to the Mission during the reconstruction of the bell tower. Now all four bells are hung, ready to ring on special occasions.

In 1985, the restoration of the church was completed by the Committee for the Restoration of the Mission San Jose and the Catholic Diocese of Oakland. It is considered to be a near-perfect replica of the original church, though it incorporates a concealed structural steel frame which provides earthquake resistance. Further reconstruction of the missing part of the Padres&#x27; living quarters and a restoration of the surviving adobe wing are part of the overall plans for the Mission. Today, the Mission is administered by St. Joseph&#x27;s parish, which includes the Mission building and the surrounding areas, an ordinary church building used to fulfill the daily needs of the parish, and a school serving students in grades 1–8.

<text>The Maildir e-mail format is a common way of storing email messages on a file system, rather than in a database. Each message is assigned a file with a unique name, and each mail folder is a file system directory containing these files. Maildir was designed by Daniel J. Bernstein circa 1995, with a major goal of eliminating the need for program code to handle file locking and unlocking through use of the local filesystem. Maildir design reflects the fact that the only operations valid for an email message is that it be created, deleted or have its status changed in some way.

== Specifications ==

A Maildir directory (often named codice_1) usually has three subdirectories named codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4. 

* The codice_2 subdirectory temporarily stores e-mail messages that are in the process of being delivered. This subdirectory may also store other kinds of temporary files.
* The codice_3 subdirectory stores messages that have been delivered, but have not yet been seen by any mail application.
* The codice_4 subdirectory stores messages that have already been seen by mail applications.

=== Maildir++ ===

Sam Varshavchik, the author of the Courier Mail Server and other software, defined the Maildir++ extension to the Maildir format to support subfolders and mail quotas. Maildir++ directories contain subdirectories with names that start with a &#x27;.&#x27; (dot) which are also Maildir++ folders. The extension complies with the original Maildir specification, which allows for subdirectories in addition to &quot;tmp&quot;, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;cur&quot;.

== Technical operation ==

A mail delivery agent is a program that delivers an email message into a Maildir. The mail delivery agent creates a new file with a unique filename in the codice_2 directory. At the time of its invention guaranteeing unique filenames efficiently was difficult. The original qmail algorithm for unique names was:
# read the current Unix time
# read the current process identifier (PID)
# read the current hostname
# concatenate the above three values into a string separated by the period character; this is the new filename
# if codice_9 reports that the filename exists, then wait two seconds
# go to previous step until the filename does not exist
# create a file with the unique filename and write the message contents to the new file

By 2000, the qmail author recommended in an updated specification to append the value of a per-process counter to the PID, whose value should be incremented after each delivery. The rate-limiting recommendation to &quot;wait two seconds&quot; was dropped. 

By 2003, the recommendations had been further amended to require that instead of the PID and counter, the middle part of the filename should be created by &quot;concatenating enough of the following strings to guarantee uniqueness&quot; even in the face of multiple simultaneous deliveries to the same maildir from one or more processes:

* #&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in hexadecimal) the output of the operating system&#x27;s codice_10 system call, which returns a number that increases by 1 every time it is called, starting from 0 after reboot.
* X&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in hexadecimal) the output of the operating system&#x27;s codice_11 system call, which reports the number of times that the system has been booted. Together with #, this guarantees uniqueness; unfortunately, most operating systems don&#x27;t support codice_10 and codice_11.
* R&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in hexadecimal) the output of the operating system&#x27;s codice_14 system call or an equivalent source, such as codice_15. Unfortunately, some operating systems don&#x27;t include cryptographic random number generators.
* I&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in hexadecimal) the UNIX inode number of this file. Unfortunately, inode numbers aren&#x27;t always available through NFS.
* V&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in hexadecimal) the UNIX device number of this file. Unfortunately, device numbers aren&#x27;t always available through NFS. (Device numbers are also not helpful with the standard UNIX filesystem: a maildir has to be within a single UNIX device for codice_16 and codice_17 to work.)
* M&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in decimal) the microsecond counter from the same codice_18 used for the left part of the unique name.
* P&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in decimal) the process ID.
* Q&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is (in decimal) the number of deliveries made by this process.
This 2003 algorithm was criticised in 2006 as being unnecessarily complex by Timo Sirainen, the creator of Dovecot.

As of November 2023, qmail author Daniel Bernstein had made no further changes to the 2003 filename generation recommendations. On modern POSIX systems, temporary files can be safely created with the codice_19 C library function.

The delivery process stores the message in the maildir by creating and writing to codice_20, and then moving this file to codice_21. The moving can be done using codice_22, which is atomic in many systems. Alternatively, it can be done by hard-linking the file to codice_3 and then unlinking the file from codice_2. Any leftover file will eventually be deleted. This sequence guarantees that a maildir-reading program will not see a partially written message. There can be multiple programs reading a maildir at the same time. They range from mail user agents (MUAs), which access the server&#x27;s file system directly, through Internet Message Access Protocol or Post Office Protocol servers acting on behalf of remote MUAs, to utilities such as biff and rsync, which may or may not be aware of the maildir structure. Readers should never look in codice_2.

When a cognizant maildir-reading process (either a POP or IMAP server, or a mail user agent acting locally) finds messages in the codice_3 directory, it &quot;must&quot; move them to codice_4. It is just a means to notify the user &quot;you have &quot;X&quot; new messages&quot;. This moving needs to be done using the atomic filesystem codice_17, as the alternative &quot;link-then-unlink&quot; technique is non-atomic and may result in duplicated messages. An informational suffix is appended to filenames at this stage. It consists of a colon (to separate the unique part of the filename from the actual information), a &quot;2&quot;, a comma and various flags. The &quot;2&quot; specifies the version of the information that follows the comma. &quot;2&quot; is the only currently officially specified version, &quot;1&quot; being an experimental version. The specification defines flags that show whether the message has been read, deleted and so on: the initial (capital) letter of &quot;Passed&quot;, &quot;Replied&quot;, &quot;Seen&quot;, &quot;Trashed&quot;, &quot;Draft&quot;, and &quot;Flagged&quot;. Applications often choose to supplement this very limited set of flags, for example notmuch offers flag synchronization in addition to arbitrary user-defined flags, while Dovecot uses lowercase letters to match 26 IMAP keywords, which may include keywords such as $MDNSent or user-defined flags.

Although Maildir was intended to allow lockless usage, in practice some software that uses Maildirs also uses locks, such as Dovecot.

== File-system compatibility issues ==

The Maildir standard can only be implemented on systems that accept colons in filenames. 

Systems that don&#x27;t allow colons in filenames (this includes Microsoft Windows and some configurations of Novell Storage Services) can use a non-standard alternative separator, such as &quot;;&quot; or &quot;-&quot;. It is often trivial to patch free and open-source software to use a different separator.

As there is currently no agreement on what character this alternative separator should be, there can be interoperability difficulties between different Maildir-supporting programs on these systems. However, not all Maildir-related software needs to know what the separator character is, because not all Maildir-related software needs to be able to read or modify the flags of a message (&quot;read&quot;, &quot;replied to&quot; etc.); software that merely delivers to a Maildir or archives old messages from it based only on date, should work no matter what separator is in use. If only the MUA needs to read or modify message flags, and only one MUA is used, then non-standard alternative separators may be used without interoperability problems.

<text>Mission San Juan Bautista is a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, San Benito County, California. Founded on June 24, 1797, by Fermín de Lasuén of the Franciscan order, the mission was the fifteenth of the Spanish missions established in present-day California. Named for Saint John the Baptist, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Juan Bautista.

Barracks for the soldiers, a nunnery, the Jose Castro House, the Plaza Hotel and other buildings were constructed around a large grassy plaza in front of the church and can be seen today in their original form. The Ohlone, the original residents of the valley, were brought to live at the mission and baptized, followed by Yokuts from the Central Valley. Mission San Juan Bautista has served mass daily since 1797, and today functions as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.

== History ==


Following its creation in 1797, San Juan&#x27;s population grew quickly. By 1803, there were 1,036 Native Americans living at the mission. Ranching and farming activity had moved apace, with 1,036 cattle, 4,600 sheep, 22 swine, 540 horses and 8 mules counted that year. At the same time, the harvest of wheat, barley and corn was estimated at 2,018 fanegas, each of about 220 pounds.

Father Pedro Estévan Tápis (who had a special talent for music) joined Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1815 to teach singing to the Native Americans. He employed a system of notation developed in Spain that uses varied colors or textures for polyphonic music, usually (from bottom to top) solid black, solid red, black outline (sometimes solid yellow) and red outline (or black outline when yellow was used). His choir of Native American boys performed for many visitors, earning the San Juan Bautista Mission the nickname &quot;the Mission of Music.&quot; Two of his handwritten choir books are preserved at the San Juan Bautista Museum. When Father Tapis died in 1825 he was buried on the mission grounds. The town of San Juan Bautista, which grew up around the mission, expanded rapidly during the California Gold Rush and continues to be a thriving community today.

The mission is situated adjacent to the San Andreas Fault, and has suffered damage from numerous earthquakes, such as those of 1800 and 1906. However, the mission was never entirely destroyed at once. It was restored initially in 1884, and then again in 1949 with funding from the Hearst Foundation. The three-bell &quot;campanario&quot;, or &quot;bell wall,&quot; located by the church entrance, was fully restored in 2010. An unpaved stretch of the original El Camino Real, just east of the mission, lies on a fault scarp.

Although initially secularized in 1835, the church was reconsecrated by the Catholic Church in 1859, and continues to serve as a parish of the Diocese of Monterey. The mission includes a cemetery, with the remains of over 4,000 Native American converts and Europeans buried there.

The mission and its grounds were featured prominently in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Associate producer Herbert Coleman&#x27;s daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission&#x27;s original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at the Paramount studio in Los Angeles. The tower does not resemble the original steeple. The tower&#x27;s staircase was assembled inside a studio.

<doc id="60070" wikidata="Q131324" url="?curid=60070" title="Janet Jackson">
<text>Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content that focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.

The tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, Jackson starred in multiple television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, and &quot;Fame&quot;. She signed a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1982 and became a pop icon following the releases of the albums &quot;Control&quot; (1986) and &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated a variety of music genres, which led to crossover success in popular music and influenced the development of the new jack swing fusion genre. In the 1990s, Jackson became one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, signing two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records. She established her image as a sex symbol with a leading role in the film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (1993), and the albums &quot;Janet&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; (1997). &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the second most successful artist of the decade in the United States after Mariah Carey.

The release of her seventh studio album &quot;All for You&quot; in 2001 coincided with Jackson being the subject of the first &quot;MTV Icon&quot; special. By the end of the year, she joined her brother Michael as one of the few artists to score ten &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles. However, the backlash from the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy resulted in an industry blacklisting under the direction of Les Moonves, then-CEO of CBS. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album &quot;Discipline&quot; (2008), her only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation, and released her eleventh studio album, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, the same year. Since then she has continued to release music as an independent artist.

Jackson has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. She holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 by a female artist (18) and remains the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven singles from one album (&quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;) peak within the top five positions. In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the &quot;Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years&quot;. In 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist after Madonna. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, eleven &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, an Academy Award nomination, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and eight &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; entries. In 2019, she was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Life and career ==

=== 1966–1985: Early life and career beginnings ===

Janet Damita Jo Jackson was born on May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana. She was the youngest of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. Her mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (&quot;née&quot; Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. Her father, Joseph Walter &quot;Joe&quot; Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family&#x27;s income. Janet&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, July &quot;Jack&quot; Gale, was a US Army scout. Family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man. Janet grew up with two sisters (Rebbie and La Toya) and six brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael and Randy). Another brother, Marlon&#x27;s twin Brandon, died shortly after birth. The Jacksons were devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, although Janet would later refrain from organized religion.

At a young age, Jackson&#x27;s brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, they signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.

At age seven, Jackson and her sisters performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph, was emotionally withdrawn and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show &quot;The Jacksons&quot; in 1976.

In 1977, She was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot;. She later starred in &quot;A New Kind of Family&quot; and later got a recurring role on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of &quot;Fame&quot;, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&amp;B singer James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.

When Jackson was fifteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson arranged a contract for her with A&amp;M Records. Her debut album, &quot;Janet Jackson&quot;, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph. It peaked at No. 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 6 on the publication&#x27;s R&amp;B albums chart, receiving little promotion. The album appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Black Albums of 1983, while Jackson herself was the highest-ranking female vocalist on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Black Album Artists.

Jackson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Dream Street&quot;, was released two years later. &quot;Dream Street&quot; reached No. 147 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 19 on the R&amp;B albums chart. The lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Another Chance&quot; peaked at No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B singles chart. Both albums consisted primarily of bubblegum pop music.

=== 1986–1988: &quot;Control&quot; ===

After her second album, Jackson terminated business affairs with her family, commenting &quot;I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do.&quot; Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, &quot;Control&quot;, released in February 1986. The album shot to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified fivefold Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.

&quot;Control&quot; was declared &quot;remarkably nervy and mature&quot; for a teenage act, also considered &quot;an alternative to the sentimental balladry&quot; which permeated radio, likening Jackson to Donna Summer&#x27;s position of &quot;unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it.&quot; The album spawned five top five singles, &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;When I Think of You&quot;, &quot;Control&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&quot;, and a top 15 hit with &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. &quot;When I Think of You&quot; became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100. &quot;Control&quot; received six &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards, including &quot;Top Pop Singles Artist&quot;, and three Grammy nominations, such as Album of the Year. It also won four American Music Awards from twelve nominations, an unbroken record.

At this point, Jackson was successfully &quot;shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child&quot;, becoming &quot;an artist in her own right&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrical content included several themes of empowerment, inspired by an incident of sexual harassment, with Jackson recalling &quot;the danger hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street and instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That&#x27;s how songs like &#x27;Nasty&#x27; and &#x27;What Have You Done for Me Lately&#x27; were born, out of a sense of self-defense.&quot;

Its innovative fusion of dance-pop and industrial music with hip-hop and R&amp;B undertones influenced the development of the new jack swing genre by bridging the gap between the latter two styles. The accompanying music videos shot for the album&#x27;s singles became popular on MTV, and obtained a then-unknown Paula Abdul a recording contract for her choreography work with Jackson. &quot;Billboard&quot; stated &quot;[Jackson&#x27;s] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix.&quot;

In retrospect of her influence on the channel, Kyle Anderson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented: &quot;The videos from Control were all over MTV, and Janet established herself as an instantly dominant pop figure talked about in the same sentences as Madonna and her older brother Michael.&quot; MTV&#x27;s Meaghan Garvey asserted &quot;it&#x27;s hard to overstate the significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems.&quot; She also argued &quot;it&#x27;s important to note that &quot;Control&quot;&#x27;s self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. &quot;Control&quot; spawned a whopping six videos—great ones, at that—which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop.&quot;

=== 1989–1992: &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; ===
Jackson released her fourth album, &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to &quot;Control&quot;, Jackson chose to include a socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, &quot;I know an album or a song can&#x27;t change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience&#x27;s attention, and to hold it long enough for them to listen to the lyrics.&quot; The album&#x27;s central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.

Peaking at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album was certified sixfold Platinum by the RIAA and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed Jackson&#x27;s artistic growth shifted from &quot;personal freedom to more universal concerns—injustice, illiteracy, crime, drugs—without missing a beat.&quot; The album was also considered &quot;the exclamation point on her career&quot;, consisting of a &quot;diverse collection of songs flowing with the natural talent Jackson possesses&quot;, which effectively &quot;expanded Janet&#x27;s range in every conceivable direction&quot;, being &quot;more credibly feminine, more crucially masculine, more viably adult, more believably childlike.&quot; With singles &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;Black Cat&quot; and &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot;, it became the first album in history to produce number one hits in three separate calendar years, as well as the only album to achieve seven top five singles on the Hot 100.

Famous for its choreography and warehouse setting, the &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; music video is considered one of the most iconic and popular in history, with Jackson&#x27;s military ensemble also making her a fashion icon. The video for &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; is notable for being the first instance of Jackson&#x27;s transition into sexual imagery and midriff-baring style, becoming her trademark. &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; became the highest selling album of 1990, winning a record fifteen &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards. The full &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; short film won a Grammy Award.

Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut tour in history and set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Dome. She established the &quot;Rhythm Nation Scholarship&quot;, donating funds from the tour to various educational programs. As Jackson began her tour, she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music. Joel Selvin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country&quot;, and William Allen, then-executive vice president of the United Negro College Fund, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of &#x27;Rhythm Nation 1814&#x27; is having positive effects.&quot;

She also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors. The massive success experienced by Jackson placed her in league with her brother Michael, Madonna, and Tina Turner for her achievements and influence. &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine remarked: &quot;No individual or group has impacted the world of entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson,&quot; arguing that despite many imitators, few could surpass Jackson&#x27;s &quot;stunning style and dexterity&quot;.

With her recording contract under A&amp;M Records fulfilled in 1991, she signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Virgin Records—estimated between thirty-two to fifty million dollars—making her the highest paid recording artist at the time. The recording contract also established her reputation as the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;. In 1992, Jackson provided guest vocals on Luther Vandross&#x27;s &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;, becoming a top ten &quot;Billboard&quot; hit and reaching the top ten internationally.

=== 1993–1996: &quot;Janet&quot;, &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, and &quot;Design of a Decade&quot; ===
Jackson&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Janet&quot;, was released in May 1993. The record opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Jackson the first female artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era to do so. Certified sixfold Platinum by the RIAA, it sold over 14 million copies worldwide.

&quot;Janet&quot; spawned five singles and four promotional singles, receiving various certifications worldwide. The lead single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. &quot;Again&quot; reached number one for two weeks, while &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Any Time, Any Place&quot; peaked in the top four. &quot;Because of Love&quot; and &quot;You Want This&quot; charted within the top ten.

The album experimented with a diverse number of genres, including contemporary R&amp;B, deep house, swing jazz, hip-hop, rock, and pop, with &quot;Billboard&quot; describing each as being &quot;delivered with consummate skill and passion&quot;. Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary &quot;to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies&quot; while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album&#x27;s content. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;[a]s princess of America&#x27;s black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on &quot;Control&quot; (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society&#x27;s problems (&quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, from 1989), she&#x27;s influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, &quot;Janet.&quot;, it&#x27;s a cultural moment.&quot;

In July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. While the film received mixed reviews, her performance was described as &quot;beguiling&quot; and &quot;believably eccentric&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s ballad &quot;Again&quot;, which was written for the film, received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for &quot;Best Original Song&quot;.

In September 1993, Jackson appeared topless on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, with her breasts covered anonymously by her then-husband, René Elizondo Jr. The photograph is the original version of the cropped image used on the &quot;Janet&quot; album cover, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; reported, &quot;Jackson, 27, remains clearly established as both role model and sex symbol; the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; photo of Jackson ... became one of the most recognizable, and most lampooned, magazine covers.&quot;

The Janet World Tour launched in support of the studio album garnered criticism for Jackson&#x27;s lack of vocal proficiency and spontaneity, but earned critical acclaim for her showmanship. It was described as erasing the line between &quot;stadium-size pop music concerts and full-scale theatrical extravaganzas&quot;.
During this time, Janet was set to sign a multimillion-dollar deal with Coca-Cola when her brother Michael was immersed in a child sex abuse scandal, of which he denied any wrongdoing. She provided moral support, defending her brother, and denied abuse allegations regarding her parents made by her sister La Toya.

She collaborated with Michael on &quot;Scream&quot;, the lead single from his album &quot;&quot;, released 1995. The song was written by both siblings as a response to media scrutiny. It debuted at number five on the Hot 100 singles chart, becoming the first song ever to debut within the top five. Its music video, directed by Mark Romanek, was listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;Most Expensive Music Video Ever Made&quot;, costing $7 million. The clip won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.

Jackson&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Design of a Decade: 1986–1996&quot;, was released in 1995. It peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The lead single, &quot;Runaway&quot;, became the first song by a female artist to debut within the top ten of the Hot 100, reaching number three. &quot;Design of a Decade 1986–1996&quot; was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.

Jackson&#x27;s influence in pop music continued to garner acclaim, as &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; remarked &quot;If you&#x27;re talking about the female power elite in pop, you can&#x27;t get much higher than Janet Jackson, Bonnie Raitt, Madonna and Yoko Ono. Their collective influence ... is beyond measure. And who could dispute that Janet Jackson now has more credibility than brother Michael?&quot;

Jackson renewed her contract with Virgin Records for a reported $80 million the following year. The contract established her as the then highest-paid recording artist in history, surpassing the recording industry&#x27;s then-unparalleled $60 million contracts earned by Michael Jackson and Madonna.

=== 1997–1999: &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; ===

Jackson began suffering from severe depression and anxiety, leading her to chronicle the experience in her sixth album, &quot;The Velvet Rope,&quot; released October 1997. Jackson returned with a dramatic change in image, boasting vibrant red hair, nasal piercings, and tattoos. The album is primarily centered on the idea that everyone has an intrinsic need to belong. Aside from encompassing lyrics relating to social issues such as same-sex relationships, homophobia and domestic violence, it also contains themes of sadomasochism and is considered far more sexually explicit in nature than her previous release, &quot;Janet&quot;.

The record was hailed as &quot;her most daring, elaborate and accomplished album&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;the best American album of the year and the most empowering of her last five.&quot; The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA. It has sold over eight million copies worldwide.

The lead single &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; was released in August 1997, featuring guest vocals from folk singer Joni Mitchell and rapper Q-Tip. The song&#x27;s music video, depicting a pre-Apartheid celebration, won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. &quot;Together Again&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s eighth number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, placing her on par with Elton John, Diana Ross, and the Rolling Stones. It spent a record forty-six weeks on the Hot 100 and nineteen weeks on the United Kingdom&#x27;s singles chart. It sold six million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; peaked at number three on the Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. It was Jackson&#x27;s eighteenth consecutive top ten hit, making her the only female artist to garner that achievement; and surpassed only by Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

Several other singles were released, including &quot;Go Deep&quot; and the ballad &quot;Every Time&quot;, which was controversial for the nudity displayed in its music video. The album fully established Jackson as a gay icon for its themes regarding homosexuality and protesting homophobia. &quot;Together Again&quot;, a &quot;post-Aids pop song&quot;, and &quot;Free Xone&quot;, considered &quot;a paean to homosexuality&quot; and an &quot;anti-homophobia track&quot;, were praised for their lyrical context, in addition to Jackson&#x27;s lesbian reinterpretation of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;.

&quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; received an award for &quot;Outstanding Music Album&quot; at the 9th Annual GLAAD Media Awards and was honored by the National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership Forum. A portion of the proceeds from &quot;Together Again&quot; were donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

Jackson embarked on The Velvet Rope Tour, traveling to Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The tour received praise for its theatrics, choreography, and Jackson&#x27;s vocal performance. It was likened to &quot;the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical&quot;, and exclaimed as &quot;only fitting that the concert program credits her as the show&#x27;s &#x27;creator and director.

The tour&#x27;s HBO special, &quot;The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden&quot;, garnered more than fifteen million viewers. It surpassed the ratings of all four major networks among viewers subscribed to the channel. The concert won an Emmy Award from four nominations. Jackson donated a portion of the tour&#x27;s sales to America&#x27;s Promise, an organization founded by Colin Powell to assist disenfranchised youth.

As the tour concluded, Jackson lent guest vocals to several collaborations, including Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Luv Me, Luv Me&quot;, used for the film &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, as well as &quot;Girlfriend/Boyfriend&quot; with Teddy Riley&#x27;s group Blackstreet, and &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?!&quot; with Busta Rhymes. The latter two music videos are both among the most expensive music videos ever produced, with &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?!&quot; becoming a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hip-Hop Singles and Hot Rap Tracks charts, reaching the top three of the Hot 100.

Jackson also contributed the ballad &quot;God&#x27;s Stepchild&quot; to the &quot;Down in the Delta&quot; soundtrack. Jackson recorded a duet with Elton John titled &quot;I Know the Truth&quot;, included on the soundtrack to &quot;Elton John and Tim Rice&#x27;s Aida&quot;. At the 1999 World Music Awards, Jackson received the Legend Award for &quot;outstanding contribution to the pop industry&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Jackson as the second most successful artist of the decade, behind Mariah Carey.

=== 2000–2003: &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot; and &quot;All for You&quot; ===
In July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot;, as the role of Professor Denise Gaines, opposite Eddie Murphy. Director Peter Segal stated &quot;Janet Jackson was a natural fit, and an obvious choice.&quot; The film became her second to open at number one, grossing an estimated $170 million worldwide. Jackson&#x27;s single &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Really Matter&quot;, used for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, became her ninth number-one single on the Hot 100.

Preceding the release of her seventh album, MTV honored Jackson with the network&#x27;s inaugural &quot;MTV Icon&quot; ceremony, honoring her &quot;significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the MTV Generation.&quot; The event paid tribute to Jackson&#x27;s career and influence, including commentary from Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Aaliyah, and Jessica Simpson, and performances by &#x27;N Sync, Pink, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Usher, Buckcherry, Mýa, Macy Gray, and Outkast. The American Music Awards also honored Jackson with the Award of Merit for &quot;her finely crafted, critically acclaimed and socially conscious, multi-platinum albums&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;All for You&quot;, was released in April 2001. It opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 605,000 copies sold, the highest first-week sales of her career, and among the highest first-week sales by a female artist in history. The album was a return to an upbeat dance style, receiving generally positive reception. Jackson received praise for indulging in &quot;textures as dizzying as a new infatuation&quot;, in contrast to other artists attempting to &quot;match the angularity of hip-hop&quot; and following trends. &quot;All for You&quot; was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;All for You&quot;, debuted on the Hot 100 at number fourteen, setting a record for the highest debut by a single that was not commercially available. Jackson was titled &quot;Queen of Radio&quot; by MTV as the single made airplay history, being &quot;added to every pop, rhythmic and urban radio station&quot; within its first week. The song broke the overall airplay debut record with a first week audience of seventy million, debuting at number nine on the Radio Songs chart. It topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks, also reaching the top ten in eleven countries. The song received a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. &quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot; peaked at number three on the Hot 100. Built around a sample of the iconic 1972 hit &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; by Carly Simon, &quot;Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)&quot; featured Simon herself, along with Missy Elliott on remixes of the single.

In July 2001, Jackson embarked on the All for You Tour, which was also broadcast on a concert special for HBO watched by twelve million viewers. The tour traveled throughout the United States and Japan, although European and Asian dates were required to be canceled following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; complimented Jackson&#x27;s showmanship. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said Jackson&#x27;s performance surpassed her contemporaries, but Bob Massy of &quot;Spin&quot; thought her dancers &quot;threw crisper moves&quot; and her supporting singers were mixed nearly as high, though declared &quot;Janet cast herself as the real entertainment.&quot; Jackson donated a portion of the tour&#x27;s proceeds to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.

The following year, Jackson began receiving media attention for her rumored relationships with Justin Timberlake, actor Matthew McConaughey, and record producer Jermaine Dupri. Upon the release of Timberlake&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Justified,&quot; Jackson provided vocals on &quot;(And She Said) Take Me Now&quot; per Timberlake&#x27;s request, with the song initially planned as a single. Jackson collaborated with reggae artist Beenie Man for the song &quot;Feel It Boy&quot;, produced by the Neptunes.

=== 2004–2005: Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy and &quot;Damita Jo&quot; ===
Jackson was chosen by the National Football League and MTV to perform at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February 2004. She performed a medley of &quot;All for You&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, and an excerpt of &quot;The Knowledge&quot; before performing &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; alongside surprise guest Justin Timberlake. As Timberlake sang the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m gonna have you naked by the end of this song&quot;, he tore open her costume, exposing her right breast to 140 million viewers. The incident was referred to as &quot;nipple gate&quot; by the media.

Jackson issued an apology after the performance, saying that the incident was accidental and unintended, explaining that Timberlake was only meant to pull away a bustier and leave the red-lace bra intact. She commented, &quot;I am really sorry if I offended anyone. That was truly not my intention ... MTV, CBS, the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever, and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end.&quot; Timberlake also issued an apology, calling the accident a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. CBS, the NFL, and MTV denied any knowledge of the incident and all responsibility for it. The Federal Communications Commission heavily fined all companies involved and continued an investigation for eight years, ultimately losing its appeal for a $550,000 fine against CBS.

Following the incident, CBS permitted Timberlake to appear at the 46th Grammy Awards ceremony but did not allow Jackson to attend, forcing her to withdraw after being scheduled as a presenter. The controversy halted plans for Jackson to star in the biographical film of singer and activist Lena Horne, which was to be produced by ABC. Horne was reportedly displeased by the incident, but Jackson&#x27;s representatives stated that she withdrew from the project willingly. A Mickey Mouse statue wearing Jackson&#x27;s iconic &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; outfit was mantled at Walt Disney World theme park the previous year to honor her legacy, but it was removed following her controversial performance.

Jackson&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Damita Jo&quot; was released in March 2004, titled after her middle name. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received mixed to positive reviews, praising the sonic innovation of selected songs and Jackson&#x27;s vocal harmonies, while others criticized its frequent themes of carnality. However, several critics&#x27; reviews focused on the Super Bowl incident, rather than critiquing the album itself. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA within a month, and sold over three million copies worldwide.

The album&#x27;s performance was affected by blacklisting from radio and music channels, in part at the behest of CBS CEO Les Moonves. Conglomerates involved in the boycott included Viacom and CBS, subsidiaries MTV, Clear Channel Communications, and Infinity Broadcasting, the latter two among the largest radio broadcasters. The blacklist was placed into effect preceding the release of &quot;Damita Jo&quot; and continued throughout the course of Jackson&#x27;s following two albums. Entertainment conglomerate Viacom owns MTV, VH1, and many radio formats, and a senior executive commented that they were &quot;absolutely bailing on the record. The pressure is so great, they can&#x27;t align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure.&quot;

Prior to the incident, &quot;Damita Jo&quot; was expected to outsell prior release &quot;All for You&quot;. Its three singles received positive reviews but failed to achieve high chart positions, although each was predicted to perform extremely well under different circumstances. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that &quot;Damita Jo&quot; &quot;was largely overshadowed by the Super Bowl fiasco... The three singles it spawned were blacklisted by pop radio—they were also the album&#x27;s biggest highlights&quot;.

For the album&#x27;s promotion, Jackson appeared as a host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performing two songs, and she was also a guest star on the sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; portraying herself. Jackson received several career accolades upon the album&#x27;s release, including the &quot;Legend Award&quot; at the Radio Music Awards, &quot;Inspiration Award&quot; from the Japan Video Music Awards, &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the Soul Train Music Awards, and a Teen Choice Awards nomination for &quot;Favorite Female&quot;.

In November 2004, she was honored as a role model by 100 Black Men of America, Inc. and presented with the organization&#x27;s Artistic Achievement Award saluting &quot;a career that has gone from success to greater success&quot;. The organization responded to criticism for honoring Jackson in light of the Super Bowl incident by saying that &quot;an individual&#x27;s worth can&#x27;t be judged by a single moment in that person&#x27;s life.&quot; In June 2005, she was honored with a Humanitarian Award by the Human Rights Campaign and AIDS Project Los Angeles as recognition for her involvement in raising money for AIDS charities.

==== Impact on the Internet ====
The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show is considered to be one of the most controversial televised events in history, and Jackson was later listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;Most Searched in Internet History&quot; and the &quot;Most Searched for News Item&quot;. The incident became the most recorded and replayed moment in TiVo history, enticing an estimated 35,000 new subscribers. Jawed Karim has stated that the incident inspired the creation of YouTube, as he noted that it was difficult for him to find videos of the incident online.

=== 2006–2007: &quot;20 Y.O.&quot; and &quot;Why Did I Get Married?&quot; ===

Jackson began recording her ninth studio album, &quot;20 Y.O.&quot;, in 2005. She recorded with producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album&#x27;s title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album &quot;Control&quot;, representing the album&#x27;s &quot;celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style&quot;.

To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the &quot;Today Show&quot; and at the Billboard Awards. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Us Weekly&quot; cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine&#x27;s best-selling issue in history. &quot;20 Y.O.&quot; was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; disagreed with the album&#x27;s reference to &quot;Control&quot;, saying &quot;If we were her, we wouldn&#x27;t make the comparison.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single &quot;Call on Me&quot;, which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;So Excited&quot;, was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson&#x27;s clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine.

&quot;20 Y.O.&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.5 million worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album.
After the album&#x27;s release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; stated, &quot;After promising a return to Janet&#x27;s dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.&quot;

Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by &quot;Forbes&quot;, having amassed a fortune of over $150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film &quot;Why Did I Get Married?&quot;. It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing $60 million. Jackson&#x27;s performance was praised for its &quot;soft authority&quot;, though also described as &quot;charming, yet bland&quot;.

=== 2008–2009: &quot;Discipline&quot; and &quot;Number Ones&quot; ===
Jackson signed with Island Records after her contract with Virgin was fulfilled. She interrupted plans for touring and began recording with various producers, including Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, Tricky Stewart, and Stargate. Her tenth studio album, &quot;Discipline&quot;, was released in February 2008, opening at number one. Despite radio blacklisting, the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Feedback&quot; peaked at number nineteen on the Hot 100 and nine on Pop Songs, her highest-charting single since &quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot;.

Also in February 2008, Jackson won an Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture&quot; for the role. Jackson was also approached to record the lead single for the film &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;. Jackson was awarded the Vanguard Award at the 19th annual GLAAD Media Awards, honoring her contributions in promoting equal rights among the gay community. The organization&#x27;s president commented, &quot;Ms. Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out, and having her stand with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely significant.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s fifth concert tour, the Rock Witchu Tour, began in September 2008. Jackson parted with Island Records through mutual agreement. &quot;Billboard&quot; disclosed Jackson was dissatisfied with L.A. Reid&#x27;s handling of the album and its promotion, saying &quot;the label agreed to dissolve their relationship with the artist at her request.&quot; Producer Rodney Jerkins expressed &quot;I felt like it wasn&#x27;t pushed correctly... She just didn&#x27;t get her just due as an artist of that magnitude.&quot;

In June 2009, Jackson&#x27;s brother Michael died at age fifty. She spoke publicly concerning his death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating &quot;I&#x27;d just like to say, to you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live in all of our hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much.&quot; In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming &quot;Why Did I Get Married Too?&quot;.

Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling&#x27;s death. She commented, &quot;it&#x27;s still important to face reality, and not that I&#x27;m running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second.&quot; During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri.

Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet &quot;Scream&quot;. MTV stated &quot;there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message.&quot; The performance was lauded by critics, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; affirming the rendition &quot;as energetic as it was heartfelt&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s second hits compilation, &quot;Number Ones&quot; (retitled &quot;The Best&quot; for international releases), was released in November 2009. For promotion, she performed a medley of hits at the American Music Awards, Capital FM&#x27;s Jingle Bell Ball at London&#x27;s O2 arena, and &quot;The X-Factor&quot;. The album&#x27;s promotional single &quot;Make Me&quot;, produced with Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, debuted in September. It became Jackson&#x27;s nineteenth number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, making her the first artist to have number-one singles in four separate decades.

Later that month, Jackson chaired the inaugural benefit of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, held in Milan in conjunction with fashion week. The foundation&#x27;s CEO stated &quot;We are profoundly grateful to Janet Jackson for joining amfAR as a chair of its first event in Milan... She brings incomparable grace and a history of dedication to the fight against AIDS.&quot; The event raised $1.1 million for the nonprofit organization.

=== 2010–2014: Film projects and &quot;True You&quot; ===
In April 2010, Jackson reprised her role in the sequel to &quot;Why Did I Get Married?&quot; titled &quot;Why Did I Get Married Too?&quot;. The film opened at number two, grossing sixty million. Jackson&#x27;s performance was hailed as &quot;invigorating and oddly funny&quot;, and praised for her &quot;willingness to be seen at her most disheveled&quot;. Her performance earned her an Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture&quot;. Jackson recorded the film&#x27;s theme, &quot;Nothing&quot;, released as a promotional single. The song was performed on the ninth season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; along with &quot;Again&quot; and &quot;Nasty&quot;.

In July, Jackson modeled for the Blackglama clothing line featuring mink fur, then helped design a signature line of clothing and accessories for Blackglama, to be sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales. Universal Music released the hits compilation &quot;&quot; as the debut of the &quot;Icon&quot; compilation series.

In November 2010, Jackson starred as Joanna in the drama &quot;For Colored Girls&quot;, the film adaptation of Ntozake Shange&#x27;s 1975 play &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated Jackson &quot;recites verses written by Ntozake Shange, the author of the play that inspired the film ... But instead of offering up a mannered coffeehouse reading of the lines, Jackson makes the words sound like ordinary—though very eloquent—speech.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s portrayal in the film was likened to Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. Her performance earned Black Reel Awards nominations in the categories of Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Ensemble.
Jackson announced plans to embark on her largest world tour in support of her second hits collection, &quot;Number Ones&quot;. The tour, entitled Number Ones, Up Close and Personal, held concerts in thirty-five global cities, selected by fans who submitted suggestions on her official website. During the tour, Jackson performed thirty-five number one hits and dedicated a song to each city. Mattel released a limited-edition Barbie of Jackson titled &quot;Divinely Janet&quot;, auctioned for over $15,000, with proceeds donated to Project Angel Food.

Jackson released the self-help book &quot;True You: A Journey to Finding and Loving Yourself&quot; in February 2011, co-written with David Ritz. It chronicled her struggle with weight and confidence, also publishing letters from fans. It topped &quot;The New York Times″&quot; Best Seller list the following month. Additionally, she signed a film production contract with Lions Gate Entertainment to &quot;select, develop and produce a feature film for the independent studio.&quot;

Jackson became the first female pop singer to perform at the I. M. Pei glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum, raising contributions for the restoration of iconic artwork. Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line &quot;Blackglama&quot; for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line&#x27;s history chosen to do so. She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products.

In 2012, Jackson endorsed Nutrisystem, sponsoring their weight-loss program after struggling with weight fluctuations in the past. With the program, she donated ten million dollars in meals to the hungry. She was honored by amfAR for her contributions to AIDS research when chairing the Cinema Against AIDS gala during the Cannes Film Festival. She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help starving children.

=== 2015–2019: &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, touring and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ===
On May 16, 2015, Jackson announced plans to release a new album and to embark on a world concert tour. She outlined her intention to release her new album in the fall of 2015 under her own record label, Rhythm Nation, distributed by BMG Rights Management. The launch of Rhythm Nation established Jackson as one of the few African-American female musicians to own a record label.

On June 15, 2015, Jackson announced the first set of dates for the North American leg of her Unbreakable World Tour. On June 22, the lead single &quot;No Sleeep&quot; was released from the album. Jackson&#x27;s solo version of the single debuted on the Hot 100 at number 67, marking her 40th entry on the chart. The song went to number 1 on the Billboard + Twitter Trending 140 immediately following the release. The album version featuring J. Cole enabled it to re-enter the Hot 100 with a new peak position at number 63, while also topping the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart.
BET presented Jackson with their inaugural Ultimate Icon: Music Dance Visual award at the BET Awards 2015, which also featured a dance tribute to her performed by Ciara, Jason Derulo and Tinashe. It was announced she would launch a luxury jewelry line called the &quot;Janet Jackson Unbreakable Diamonds collection,&quot; a joint venture between herself and Paul Raps New York. On August 20, she released a preview of a new song &quot;The Great Forever&quot;, while also confirming the title of her eleventh studio album as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.

Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis stated that Jackson&#x27;s concept for the album was developed simultaneously with the accompanying tour&#x27;s production and that its composition will differ from the majority of her catalog. They also stated that the album&#x27;s theme reflects &quot;being able to be vulnerable and to be able to withstand what comes to you,&quot; drawing on Jackson&#x27;s experiences over the past several years. The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released on September 3, 2015, debuting on Apple Music&#x27;s Beats 1 radio station, hosted by Ebro Darden. The album was also made available for pre-order on iTunes the same day. &quot;Burnitup!&quot; featuring Missy Elliott debuted on BBC Radio 1 on September 24, 2015. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released on October 2, 2015. It received largely positive reviews, including those by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The following week, Jackson received her first nomination to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her seventh album to top the chart in the United States.

On April 6, 2016, Jackson announced that she was &quot;planning her family&quot; with husband Wissam Al Mana, resulting in her postponing her tour. On May 1, 2017, Jackson announced she would resume her Unbreakable World Tour, now known as the State of the World Tour. The revamped tour launched on September 7, 2017. Refocusing the tour&#x27;s theme to reflect socially conscious messages from Jackson&#x27;s entire music catalog, many songs selected for the concert set list along with corresponding imagery depicted on stage address racism, white supremacy, fascism, xenophobia and police brutality. The tour opened to positive critical reception, with several commentators praising Jackson&#x27;s post-pregnancy physical fitness, showmanship and socially conscious messages.

Her emotional rendition of &quot;What About&quot;, a song about domestic violence originally recorded for &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;, drew media attention highlighting her recent separation from her husband; Jackson&#x27;s brother Randy alleges she suffered verbal abuse by Al Mana which contributed to the breakdown of their marriage. Proceeds from the concert of September 9, 2017, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas were donated to relief efforts supporting evacuees of Hurricane Harvey. Jackson met with Houston mayor Sylvester Turner and evacuees at the George R. Brown Convention Center prior to the performance. In May 2018, it was announced that Jackson would receive the Billboard Icon Award at the 2018 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. In an interview for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Jackson revealed that she was then working on new music. On August 16, 2018, it was announced that Jackson and Rhythm Nation had entered into a partnership with Cinq Music Group. The next day, Jackson released the single &quot;Made for Now&quot;, a collaboration with Daddy Yankee.

In October 2018, she received her third nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On December 13, 2018, Jackson was announced as one of the seven inductees of the 2019 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

On February 26, 2019, Jackson announced a four-month Las Vegas residency entitled &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. The initial schedule comprised fourteen shows at the Park Theater at Park MGM resort; three additional shows were announced in May. In September and November 2019 Jackson performed a series of concerts in support of the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; album in Welch Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino, San Francisco and Hawaii. In 2019, Jackson played a variety of festivals in the US and abroad, including The Glastonbury Festival.

=== 2020–present: Documentaries and Together Again Tour ===

Jackson was set to embark on the Black Diamond World Tour in 2020. Later that year, the tour was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She also announced her upcoming twelfth studio album &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, which was scheduled for a 2020 release.

A two-part documentary titled &quot;Janet Jackson&quot; for Lifetime and A&amp;E premiered on January 28 and 29, 2022, respectively. Jackson previewed a clip of a new song, &quot;Luv I Luv&quot;, during the end credits of the last episode of her documentary. On March 3, 2022, Jackson was announced as a headliner of the 2022 Essence Music Festival in New Orleans.

On December 12, 2022, Jackson announced she was going on tour again starting April 14, 2023, with her Together Again Tour and teased new music. On March 8, 2023, Lifetime and A&amp;E announced that it had greenlighted a follow-up documentary series, &quot;Janet Jackson: Family First&quot;. The series will follow Jackson as she prepares for her Together Again Tour as well as her and brother Randy&#x27;s attempts to reunite the family band.

On August 21, 2024, Jackson announced a new Las Vegas concert residency, Janet Jackson: Las Vegas, which began on December 30, 2024. On January 14, 2025, six additional shows for May of the same year were announced.

== Artistry ==

=== Music and voice ===
Jackson possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Over the course of her career, she has received frequent criticism for the limitations of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that &quot;[w]hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through. She&#x27;s obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely. But actually, it&#x27;s fairly limited.&quot; He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn&#x27;t translate well to the stage because despite having &quot;great songs, incredible dancing, and her star-like presence, the live show is still magnificent. But the voice is not the star.&quot;

Biographer David Ritz commented, &quot;on Janet&#x27;s albums—and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique [...] singing wasn&#x27;t the point,&quot; saying emphasis was placed on &quot;her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values.&quot; Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant magazine&quot; claimed critics opposing her small voice &quot;somehow missed the explosive &#x27;gimme a beat&#x27; vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over &#x27;Nasty&#x27; ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem &#x27;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&#x27;.&quot; Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her &quot;rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice.&quot;

Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music&#x27;s production. Wendy Robinson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said &quot;the power of Janet Jackson&#x27;s voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn&#x27;t blow, she whispers ... Jackson&#x27;s confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she&#x27;s never unpleasant to listen to.&quot;

Matthew Perpetua of &quot;Fluxblog&quot; suggested Jackson&#x27;s vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess &quot;a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks.&quot; Perpetua added: &quot;Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance ... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we&#x27;re listening to the expression of a formed human being with contradictions and complexities.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s music has encompassed a broad range of genres. Her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince, as her producers are ex-members of the Time. Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining Top 40 radio, she &quot;gave Prince&#x27;s Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine—and, with songs like &#x27;What Have You Done for Me Lately?,&#x27; &#x27;Nasty,&#x27; &#x27;Control,&#x27; and &#x27;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile,&#x27; a distinctly feminist—spin.&quot;

On &quot;Control&quot;, Richard J. Ripani documented that she, Jam, and Lewis had &quot;crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.&quot; Author Rickey Vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial music beats of the album. She is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry, with Richard Rischar stating &quot;the black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram.&quot;

Jackson continued her musical development by blending pop and urban music with elements of hip-hop in the nineties. This included a softer representation, articulated by lush, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance beats. She is described by music critic Greg Kot as &quot;an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues&quot; within the first decade of her career. Critic Karla Peterson remarked that &quot;she is a sharp dancer, an appealing performer, and as &#x27;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&#x27; proves—an ace pop-song writer.&quot; Selected material from the following decade has been viewed less favorably, as Sal Cinquemani comments &quot;except for maybe R.E.M., no other former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative returns.&quot;

Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years, becoming the subject of analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson&#x27;s musical style to Marvin Gaye&#x27;s, stating, &quot;like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin&#x27;s, floated over a reservoir of secret pain.&quot; Much of her success has been attributed to &quot;a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge.&quot; Ritz also stated, &quot;The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson&#x27;s soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear.&quot;

During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization, feminist principles, and politically driven ideology. Gillian G. Gaar described &quot;Control&quot; as &quot;an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free.&quot; Jessie Carney Smith wrote &quot;with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ingénue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity.&quot; Referring to &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer wrote &quot;It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There&#x27;s a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people.&quot;

On &quot;Janet&quot;, Jackson began focusing on sexual themes. Shayne Lee wrote that her music over the following decade &quot;brand[ed] her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s.&quot; Lilly J. Goren observed, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared Jackson&#x27;s public image over the course of her career had shifted &quot;from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993&#x27;s &#x27;Janet&#x27; and 1997&#x27;s &#x27;The Velvet Rope&#x27;, the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust.&quot;

The song &quot;Free Xone&quot; from &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as &quot;a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics.&quot; During the promotion for &quot;Janet&quot;, she stated &quot;I love feeling deeply sexual—and don&#x27;t mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process.&quot;

Upon the release of &quot;Damita Jo&quot;, Jackson stated &quot;Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme,&quot; adding &quot;As an artist, that&#x27;s not only my passion, it&#x27;s my obligation.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson&#x27;s consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating &quot;while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn&#x27;t an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist.&quot;

=== Videos and stage ===
Jackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others. Throughout her career, she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence, such as Tina Landon, Paula Abdul, and Michael Kidd. Veronica Chambers declared, &quot;Her impact on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching,&quot; adding, &quot;A quick glance at the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart reveals any number of artists cast in the Janet Jackson mold.&quot; Chambers observed numerous videos which &quot;features not only Ms. Jackson&#x27;s dancers, but choreography and sets remarkably like those she has used.&quot;

Janine Coveney of &quot;Billboard&quot; observed that &quot;Jackson&#x27;s musical declaration of independence [&quot;Control&quot;] launched a string of hits, an indelible production sound, and an enduring image cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still emulate.&quot; Ben Hogwood of &quot;MusicOMH&quot; applauded the &quot;huge influence she has become on younger pretenders to her throne,&quot; most notably Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera. Qadree EI-Amin remarked that many pop artists &quot;pattern their performances after Janet&#x27;s proven dance-diva persona.&quot; Beretta E. Smith-Shomade wrote that &quot;Jackson&#x27;s impact on the music video sphere came largely through music sales successes, which afforded her more visual liberties and control. This assuming of control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos, giving Jackson an agency not assumed by many other artists—male or female, Black or White.&quot;

&quot;Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance&quot; (1993) documents that her videos have often been reminiscent of live concerts or elaborate musical theater. However, in her 30-minute &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; film, Jackson utilizes street dancing techniques in contrast to traditional choreography. The group dynamic visually embodies gender-neutral equality, with Jackson &quot;performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but as one of the members of the group.&quot; Her music videos have also contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, with Jackson &quot;heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man&#x27;s head until he&#x27;s in exactly the right position.&quot; However, accusations of cosmetic surgery, skin lightening, and increasingly hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white, male-dominated view of sexuality, rather than liberating herself or others.

Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award for her contributions to the art form, and she became the first recipient of the MTV Icon tribute, celebrating her impact on the music industry as a whole. In 2003, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; and &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; among the 100 Greatest Music Videos of all time, ranked at number 87 and number 10, respectively. In 2011, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; was voted the tenth best music video of the 1980s by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Independent Journalist Nicholas Barber stated &quot;Janet&#x27;s concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage, and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies.&quot;
&quot;Jet&quot; magazine reported &quot;Janet&#x27;s innovative stage performances during her world tours have won her a reputation as a world-class performer.&quot; Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated the &quot;enthralling&quot; choreography of Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour &quot;represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping &#x27;n&#x27; locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements.&quot; When Jackson was asked &quot;do you understand it when people talk about [The Velvet Rope Tour] in terms of Broadway?&quot;, she responded, &quot;I&#x27;m crazy about Broadway ... That&#x27;s what I grew up on.&quot;

Her &quot;Number Ones: Up Close and Personal&quot; tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;In past tours, Jackson&#x27;s thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production ... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn&#x27;t always evident in stadiums ... the best Janet Jackson performance I&#x27;ve covered in 20-plus years.&quot;

Thor Christensen of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported Jackson often lip syncs in concert; he wrote: &quot;Janet Jackson—one of pop&#x27;s most notorious onstage lip-syncers—conceded ... she uses &#x27;some&#x27; taped vocals to augment her live vocals. But she refused to say what percentage of her concert &#x27;voice&#x27; is taped and how much is live.&quot; Michael MacCambridge of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, who reviewed Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation World Tour, described lip-syncing as a &quot;moot point&quot;, stating &quot;Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles.&quot; MacCambridge also observed &quot;it seemed unlikely that anyone—even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music—could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the &#x27;90s super concerts are expected to achieve.&quot;

Similarly, Chris Willman commented, &quot;even a classically trained vocalist would be hard-pressed to maintain any sort of level of volume—or, more appropriately, &#x27;Control&#x27;—while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck speed.&quot; Critics observed that in the smaller scale of her &quot;Number Ones: Up Close and Personal&quot; tour, she forwent lip-syncing. Chris Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated &quot;even at its breathiest, that delicate voice hasn&#x27;t lost the laserlike precision.&quot;

=== Influences ===
Jackson describes Lena Horne as a profound inspiration, for entertainers of several generations as well as herself. Upon Horne&#x27;s death, she stated &quot;[Horne] brought much joy into everyone&#x27;s lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She was such a great talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself.&quot; Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols.

Jackson has declared herself &quot;a very big Joni Mitchell fan&quot;, explaining: &quot;As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni&#x27;s songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way.&quot; She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating &quot;Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn&#x27;t seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be.&quot; She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration.

In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine Jackson as musical influences.

== Legacy and influence ==
The youngest sister of the &quot;precious Jackson clan&quot;, Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that &quot;[s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys.&quot; Phillip McCarthy of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, &quot;[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from &#x27;The Pleasure Principle&#x27; to the radical-sounding &#x27;Rhythm Nation&#x27; to the telling statement of purpose, &#x27;Control&#x27;.&quot;

Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a &quot;superstar&quot; in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while &quot;successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult&quot;. By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;. Klein argued that &quot;stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you&#x27;re nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.&quot;.

Jackson has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where black artists were once considered to be substandard. Author Maureen Mahon states: &quot;In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince were among the African American artists who crossed over ... When black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence.&quot; The &quot;Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women&#x27;s Issues and Knowledge&quot; documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving &quot;superstar status&quot; in the process.

She, alongside her contemporaries &quot;offered viable creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency, lyrical potency, marketing and ownership&quot;. Her business savvy has been compared to that of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables &quot;creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution&quot;. A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that &quot;Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power&quot;, receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career.

Musicologist Richard J. Ripani identified Jackson as a leader in the development of contemporary R&amp;B, as her music created a unique blend of genre and sound effects which ushered in the use of rap vocals into mainstream R&amp;B. He also argues her signature song &quot;Nasty&quot; influenced the new jack swing genre developed by Teddy Riley. Leon McDermott of the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;Her million-selling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary R&amp;B through Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis&#x27;s muscular, lean production; the sinuous grooves threaded through 1986&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot; and 1989&#x27;s &quot; Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; are the foundation upon which today&#x27;s hotshot producers and singers rely.&quot; On March 24, 2021, the Library of Congress announced that &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; had been added to the National Recording Registry&#x27;s class of 2020, stating that the album still &quot;resonates today&quot;.

Simon Reynolds described Jackson&#x27;s collaborations with her record producers as a reinvention of the dance-pop genre, introducing a new sonic palate. Den Berry, Virgin Records CEO and Chairman stated: &quot;Janet is the very embodiment of a global superstar. Her artistic brilliance and personal appeal transcend geographic, cultural and generational boundaries.&quot; In July 1999, she placed at number 77 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll&quot;. She also placed at number 134 on their list of the &quot;200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time&quot;, number seven on the &quot;100 Greatest Women In Music&quot;, and at number two on the &quot;50 Greatest Women of the Video Era&quot;, behind Madonna.

In March 2008, Business Wire reported &quot;Janet Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music; ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the second most successful female artist in pop music history.&quot; She is the only female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to have 18 consecutive top ten hit singles, from &quot;Miss You Much&quot; (1989) to &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; (1998). The magazine ranked her at number seven on their Hot 100 50th Anniversary &quot;All-Time Top Artists&quot;, making her the third most successful female artist in the history of the chart, following Madonna and Mariah Carey.

In November 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; released its &quot;Top 50 R&amp;B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years&quot; list and ranked her at number five. She ranks as the top artist on the chart with 15 number ones in the past twenty-five years, garnering 27 top ten hits between 1985 and 2001, and 33 consecutive top 40 hits from 1985 through 2004. Recipient of eleven &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, she is one an elite group of musical acts, such as Madonna, Aerosmith, Garth Brooks and Eric Clapton, whom &quot;Billboard&quot; credits for &quot;redefining the landscape of popular music&quot;.

In November 2014, Jackson was voted &#x27;Queen of Pop&#x27; by a poll conducted online by VH1.com. In October 2015, she received her first nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and four years later was inducted to the Hall. Jackson&#x27;s music and choreography have inspired numerous performers.
Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: &quot;Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She&#x27;s one of those gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, that people want to believe in ... there&#x27;s not that many superstars that stand the test of time.&quot;

Sarah Rodman of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; remarked: &quot;For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah&#x27;s dog calls, there&#x27;s an equal number trying to match Jackson&#x27;s bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny&#x27;s Child.&quot; Music critic Gene Stout commented she &quot;has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez ... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson&#x27;s dance moves.&quot; NSYNC and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance.

Elysa Gardner of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote: &quot;Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style.&quot; Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated, &quot;scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson&quot; who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars&#x27; careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as &quot;Janet-come-lately&#x27;s&quot;. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that &quot;[a]s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor.&quot; Joan Morgan of &quot;Essence&quot; magazine remarked: &quot;Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; and &quot;janet.&quot; established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you&#x27;re thinking of asking Miss Jackson, &#x27;What have you done for me lately?&#x27; remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built.&quot;

On season 30 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2021, the 8th week&#x27;s theme, &quot;Janet Jackson Night&quot;, was dedicated as a tribute to Jackson.

Jackson has also been considered a primary example of a musician maintaining a credible acting career, setting a template for artists such as Jennifer Lopez. Dan Shanoff stated, &quot;Before J-Lo even thought about being a singing-dancing-acting triple-threat... [Janet] was reinventing music videos, putting on a sick stage show and starring in both &quot;&quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;.&quot; MTV News observed her to inspire &quot;a slew of singers&quot; with her forays into film. Ashley Roberts stated, &quot;I always kind of went to the artists who, like Janet Jackson, was an artist, but would go off and do film,&quot; while Kat Graham commented, &quot;looking up to artists like Janet Jackson... I just don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t do it both.&quot;

Jackson has inspired performances by a number of actors, including Brit Marling, Olivia Wilde, Kate Hudson in &quot;Something Borrowed&quot;, and Elizabeth Mathis in &quot;&quot;, who stated, &quot;I got the part. So I owe it all to Janet.&quot; Tom Hanks praised the usage of Jackson&#x27;s choreography within films. Jackson brought director Dominic Sena to prominence, leading him to direct films starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Jessica Alba cited her as the inspiration for her role in &quot;Honey&quot;, saying, &quot;I grew up falling in love with Janet Jackson videos... And I wanted to be part of that.&quot; Jenna Dewan credits dancing with Jackson as the platform to star in &quot;Step Up&quot;. She also influenced actors Michael K. Williams and Carmen Electra. Her choreography has also been incorporated in numerous Bollywood films.

Jackson&#x27;s debut in &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; has inspired several trends. &quot;PopMatters&quot; cited its spoken poetry theme to start &quot;the spoken word explosion,&quot; influencing films such as &quot;Love Jones&quot; and &quot;Slam!&quot;. &quot;The Fader&quot; considered Jackson&#x27;s image as Justice iconic, declaring it &quot;one hell of a defining, iconoclastic moment that sticks in our brains and eventually disseminated through-and-through society.&quot; Her box braids in the film have become known as &quot;Janet Jackson Braids,&quot; setting fashion trends. An anecdote stated, &quot;celebrities continue to embrace Janet&#x27;s look and continue to evoke the memory of John Singleton&#x27;s classic character and film.&quot; Artists such as Beyoncé and Solange Knowles were observed to emulate Jackson&#x27;s braids. &quot;Nylon&quot; considered it the film&#x27;s most iconic feature, comparing Jennifer Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;side-winding French plait&quot; in &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; to the style.

== Personal life ==
At age 18, Janet Jackson eloped with singer James DeBarge in September 1984. The marriage was annulled in November 1985. In 1986, Jackson began dating dancer, songwriter, and director René Elizondo Jr. In March 1991, Jackson married Elizondo Jr. and the union was kept a secret until the divorce was made public. Elizondo filed a lawsuit against her, estimated to have been between $10–25 million a settlement was reached and the divorce was finalized in October 2003. From 2002 to 2009, Jackson dated music producer, rapper, and songwriter Jermaine Dupri.

Jackson was introduced to Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana in October 2006, and began dating him in 2010. The couple became engaged and married privately in 2012. In January 2017, aged 50, Jackson gave birth to their son, Eissa Al Mana. In April 2017, it was reported that the couple had separated and were pursuing a divorce, and was announced by Jackson the following month.

===Comments on Kamala Harris===
In September 2024, Jackson gave an interview to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, during which she claimed that she heard that U.S. Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris was &quot;not Black&quot;: &quot;Her father&#x27;s white. That&#x27;s what I was told. I mean, I haven&#x27;t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white&quot;. Some media outlets later reported a statement from Mo Elmasri, who said he was Jackson&#x27;s manager, and claimed that Jackson was apologizing and retracting her remarks. It was later found that Elmasri was not authorized to speak on her behalf when he issued the statement.

<text>Mission San Miguel Arcángel is a Spanish mission in San Miguel, California. It was established on July 25, 1797, by the Franciscan order, on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of Salinan Indians that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize.

The mission remains in use as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey. After being closed to the public for six years due to the 2003 San Simeon earthquake, the church reopened on September 29, 2009. Inside the church are murals designed by Esteban Munras.

The mission was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was named to a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Of California&#x27;s missions, it is one that retains more than most of its layout and buildings, including a portion of its neophyte village.

==History==

Father Fermín Lasuén and Father Buenaventura Sitjar founded the mission on July 25, 1797, making it the sixteenth California mission. Its location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days.
A temporary wooden church was built with living quarters. The site was chosen as it was close to a Salinan Indian village called Vahca. In 1798 the small chapel was replaced. From 1816 to 1818 a new church was constructed with a tile roof and courtyard.

Mission San Miguel Arcángel land was sold off after the Mexican secularization act of 1833. The William Reed family lived in the buildings until 1848, when they were murdered by a band of thieves. The killers were tracked down by a posse in the foothills of Santa Barbara. Two thieves died in the ensuing battle, and the other three were tried and executed by firing squad. Upon secularization, the mission began to decay. Padre Abella, the last Franciscan at San Miguel, died in July, 1841.

In 1859 the U.S. government returned the mission to the Catholic Church. But with the buildings in poor condition, no priests were assigned to the mission; buildings were rented to some small businesses. In 1878 the Church reactivated the mission, and Rev. Philip Farrelly took up residence as First Pastor of Mission San Miguel. In 1928 the mission was returned to the Franciscan Padres, the same group who had founded the mission in 1797.

==Features==

* The Mission Arcade, a series of 12 arches, is original. The variety of shapes and sizes was planned and the Mission was known for this arcade. 
* The first chapel on the site was replaced within a year of its construction by a larger adobe chapel, which burned in the 1806 fire.
* The current mission church was built between 1816 and 1818. It is long, wide, and high.
* The cemetery adjacent to the church holds the remains of 2,249 Native Americans listed in the Mission&#x27;s burial records.
* The painted walls inside the church are the original artwork by artist Esteban Munras and other Salinan artists.

==Mission bells==
Bells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells.

==Associated structures==
The Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of the San Miguel Mission as a home for the overseer of Mission lands. This historic site is well preserved with the original Inn and Stagecoach stop now a museum and small gift shop. A building was added in 1930 that is now a unique history research library. The grounds are maintained by San Luis Obispo County Parks with picnic sites and restrooms available.

The Historic Rios-Caledonia Adobe is a California Historical Landmark (#936) and is listed on the National Park Service&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places (#71000190).

<doc id="60075" wikidata="Q1188344" url="?curid=60075" title="Unknot">
<text>In the mathematical theory of knots, the unknot, not knot, or trivial knot, is the least knotted of all knots. Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot tied into it, unknotted. To a knot theorist, an unknot is any embedded topological circle in the 3-sphere that is ambient isotopic (that is, deformable) to a geometrically round circle, the standard unknot.

The unknot is the only knot that is the boundary of an embedded disk, which gives the characterization that only unknots have Seifert genus 0. Similarly, the unknot is the identity element with respect to the knot sum operation.

== Unknotting problem ==
Deciding if a particular knot is the unknot was a major driving force behind knot invariants, since it was thought this approach would possibly give an efficient algorithm to recognize the unknot from some presentation such as a knot diagram. Unknot recognition is known to be in both NP and co-NP.

It is known that knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology detect the unknot, but these are not known to be efficiently computable for this purpose. It is not known whether the Jones polynomial or finite type invariants can detect the unknot.

== Examples ==
It can be difficult to find a way to untangle string even though the fact it started out untangled proves the task is possible. Thistlethwaite and Ochiai provided many examples of diagrams of unknots that have no obvious way to simplify them, requiring one to temporarily increase the diagram&#x27;s crossing number.

While rope is generally not in the form of a closed loop, sometimes there is a canonical way to imagine the ends being joined together. From this point of view, many useful practical knots are actually the unknot, including those that can be tied in a bight.

Every tame knot can be represented as a linkage, which is a collection of rigid line segments connected by universal joints at their endpoints. The stick number is the minimal number of segments needed to represent a knot as a linkage, and a stuck unknot is a particular unknotted linkage that cannot be reconfigured into a flat convex polygon. Like crossing number, a linkage might need to be made more complex by subdividing its segments before it can be simplified.

== Invariants ==
The Alexander–Conway polynomial and Jones polynomial of the unknot are trivial:
: formula_1

No other knot with 10 or fewer crossings has trivial Alexander polynomial, but the Kinoshita–Terasaka knot and Conway knot (both of which have 11 crossings) have the same Alexander and Conway polynomials as the unknot. It is an open problem whether any non-trivial knot has the same Jones polynomial as the unknot.

The unknot is the only knot whose knot group is an infinite cyclic group, and its knot complement is homeomorphic to a solid torus.

<text>Mission San Fernando Rey de España is a Spanish mission in the Mission Hills community of Los Angeles, California. The mission was founded on 8 September 1797 at the site of Achooykomenga, and was the seventeenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions established in Alta California. Named for Saint Ferdinand, the mission is the namesake of the nearby city of San Fernando and the San Fernando Valley.

The mission was secularized in 1834 and returned to the Catholic Church in 1861; it became a working church in 1920. Today the mission grounds function as a museum; the church is a chapel of ease of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

==History==
In 1769, the Spanish Portolà expedition – the first Europeans to see inland areas of California – traveled north through the San Fernando Valley. On August 7 they camped at a watering place near where the mission would later be established. Fray Juan Crespí, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, noted in his diary that the camp was &quot;at the foot of the mountains&quot;.

=== Founding ===
Mission San Fernando Rey de España was the 17th of 21 Franciscan missions established in Alta California. The Rancho of Francisco Reyes (then the &quot;Alcalde&quot; of the Pueblo de Los Ángeles), which included the agricultural settlement of Achooykomenga worked by Ventureño Chumash, Fernandeño (Tongva), and Tataviam laborers, was approved by the &quot;padres&quot; as a suitable site for the Mission. After brief negotiations with the &quot;Alcalde&quot;, the land was acquired (Mission records list Reyes as godfather to the first infant baptized at San Fernando).

The mission was founded on 8 September 1797 by Father Fermín Lasuén who, with the assistance of Fray Francisco Dumetz and in the presence of troops and natives, performed the ceremonies and dedicated the mission to San Fernando Rey de España, making it the fourth mission site he had established; ten children were baptized on the first day. Fray Francisco Dumetz and his associate Fray Francisco Javier Uría labored in the mission until after 1800.

Early in October 1797, 13 adults were baptised and the first marriage took place on 8 October. At the end of the year, there were 55 neophytes. By 1800, there were 310 neophytes, 352 baptisms, and 70 deaths.

The mission church was finished months after its establishment and the first baptism recorded to have occurred in the church was on November 28, 1797. The first church was an 8 vara (22 feet) long adobe structure; within two years, the church was too small for services and a second 23 by 7¼ vara (63 by 20 feet) adobe church was built which served the mission for five more years.

=== 1800s ===
In 1801, a 106 vara (291 feet) addition to the workshops was built and formed the south wing of the workshop courtyard; it included two granaries which became wine and &quot;aguardiente&quot; factories, two small rooms for missionaries, a weaving room, and a dormitory with a small courtyard for neophyte girls and single women. Six adjoining houses of unreported dimensions were built as a single structure directly northwest of the church which were assigned as a &quot;cuartel&quot;; they contained a storeroom, barracks, a kitchen, and a house containing a reception room and along with two other rooms.

The mission workshops&#x27; courtyard was closed into a square in 1802 with the addition of a 100 vara (275 ft.) east wing addition which contained another granary, a flour mill, candle factory and a carpentry shop.

Fray Dumetz left the mission in April 1802, then returned in 1804. Construction on the third church began in 1804 and Spanish carpenter Manuel Gutiérrez, who was active in the mission from 1805 to 1806, is considered the church architect; the church along with its sacristy and carpentry, cart, and plow shops formed the full approximately 133 vara (365.75 ft.) north wing. Construction of about seventy adobe rooms for indigenous neophytes, arranged in the shape of a U, and located southwest of the convento, also began in 1804 as well as a detached tallow vat attached to the northeast corner of the quadrangle and a detached row of adobe and stone buildings running north and south to the south of the quadrangle. This last row of buildings contained olive and grain storerooms, horse stables, a tannery and a soap factory or tallow vat called a &quot;jabonería&quot;.

In 1805, Fray Dumetz left the mission along with Fray Uría who left the country and Fray Nicolás Lázaro and Fray José María Zalvidea arrived at the mission; the latter was transferred to San Gabriel in 1806. Prior to the completion of the church in 1806, the bell tower was built adjacent to the church and was integrated into the workshop quadrangle&#x27;s west wing. The new 60 by 14 vara (165 by 38 feet) adobe and tile-roofed church was blessed on December 6, 1806, by Fray Pedro Muñoz from Mission San Miguel Arcángel.

Fray Zalvidea died at San Diego in August 1807 and &quot;padres&quot; José Antonio Uría and Pedro Muñoz arrived the same year; the former retired in November 1808 and was succeeded by Fray Martín de Landaeta while Fray José Antonio Urresti arrived in 1809 and became the associate of Fray Muñoz. Fray Landaeta died in 1816.

During the first decade of the century, the neophyte population increased from 310 to 955, there had been 797 deaths, and 1468 baptisms. The largest number of baptisms in any one year was 361 in 1803.

In 1804 there was a land controversy where the &quot;padres&quot; successfully protested against the granting of the Rancho Camulos to Francisco Ávila.

=== 1810s ===
By the 1810s with the onset of the Mexican War of Independence as well as the conflict with France in Spain, support of the missions by the Spanish government largely disappeared and the missions had to largely fend for themselves and soldier&#x27;s wages were no longer being paid; this caused economic pressures that led to a decline in the quality of life and productivity of the mission communities.

A convento building to house the friars began to be constructed in 1810 and was written about in the friar&#x27;s annual report at the end of the year. Little is known about this initial structure&#x27;s dimensions and exact location. The master carpenter Salvador Carabantes was employed to work on the convento as early as February 1811 and he continued to work at the mission until his death in February 1813. The building continued to be expanded whenever materials and resources were available into the next decade.

Fray Urresti died in 1812 and was succeeded by Fray Joaquín Pascual Nuez in 1812 to 1814, Fray Vincente Pascual Oliva was stationed in the mission from 1814 to 1815. Fray Pedro Muñoz left California in 1817, and his place was taken by Fray Marcos Antonio de Vitoria from 1818 to 1820. Fray Ramón Ulibarri arrived in January and Fray Francisco González de Ibarra in October 1820. On 21 December 1812, an earthquake hit the area which caused enough damage to necessitate the introduction of 20 new beams to support the church wall. Before 1818, a new chapel was completed. In 1818, another &quot;jabonería&quot; was built in the detached buildings south of the quadrangle with two boilers and holes to accept firewood, this is the only &quot;jabonería&quot; left in modern times and is still visible in Brand Park. In the period of 1810 to 1820 the population increased slightly, reaching its highest figure, 1,080, in 1819, after which its decline began.

The soldiers&#x27; unpaid wages were being supplanted by supplies and food produced in the missions which put further pressure on the neophyte indigenous labor force. The neophytes faced an increase in abuses and the insufficient harvests led to starvation which pushed more and more of them to flee the missions.

=== 1820s ===
After Fray Ulibarri died in 1821, Fray Francisco González de Ibarra was stationed alone in the mission. Ibarra wrote letters to the commander of the troops complaining of the starvation caused by the soldiers&#x27; demands.

=== Beginning of the Mexican era ===
After the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain on 27 September 1821, the province of Alta California became the Mexican Territory of Alta California. The missions continued under the rule of Mexico.

Fray Ibarra began to complain that the soldiers of his guard were causing problems by selling liquor and lending horses to the natives and in 1825, he declared that &quot;the presidio was a curse rather than a help to the mission, that the soldiers should go to work and raise grain, and not live on the toil of the Indians, whom they robbed and deceived with talk of liberty while in reality they treated them as slaves.&quot; This led to a sharp reply from Captain Guerra, who advised the &quot;Padre&quot; to modify his tone. The amount of supplies furnished by the mission to the presidio from 1822 to April 1827 amounted to $21,203.

=== 1830s and secularization ===
Governor José Figeroa officially secularized the mission in October, 1834, Comisionado Teniente Antonio del Valle took charge of the mission estates by inventory from Fray Ibarra. From then, the mission was to be a parish of the second class with a $1000 salary. Lieutenant del Valle became the mission &quot;mayordomo&quot; on May 29, 1835. Fray Ibarra opposed the appointment of del Valle as mayordomo. After secularization, many of the former neophytes returned to their lands while others remained to work at the ranches near the mission in return for low wages and some shelter.

The Mexican government had planned to send all Spanish-born friars back to Spain; however, Fray Ibarra was allowed to stay at the mission and he continued his labors alone until the middle of 1835 when he retired to Mexico. His successor was Fray Pedro Cabot from San Antonio who was stationed until his death in October 1836. Anastasio Carrillo succeeded Lieutenant Antonio del Valle as mayordomo on January 3, 1837.

After Fray Cabot&#x27;s death, there is no mention of a missionary at San Fernando until August 1838 when Fray Blas Ordaz remained there during the rest of the decade. Fray Ordaz was the last resident Franciscan in the mission and remained as the mission curate until June 30, 1847. Down to 1834, the neophyte population decreased by less than 100 and the mission remained productive.

In 1842, six years before the California Gold Rush, a brother of the mission mayordomo made the first Alta California gold discovery in the foothills near the mission. In memory of that discovery, the place was given the name Placerita Canyon, but only small quantities of gold were found.

In 1845, Governor Pío Pico declared the Mission buildings for sale under the secularization act of 1833 and, in 1846, turned the mission into the headquarters of the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando.

Fray Ordaz took charge of Mission San Gabriel, but would occasionally return to perform religious services until February 1849. The secularization&#x27;s requirement of a diocesan replacement of the regular clergy was met on May 28, 1848, when Reverend José M. Rosales officially took charge of the mission, allowing it to become another secular curato of Alta California; however, the mission settlement was not replaced with a pueblo as the mission buildings had been turned into the property of the private rancho and could no longer be used to establish a settlement. The former convento became a storage room and living quarters for rancho workers and the mission buildings were neglected.

=== Later history ===

The Mission was used in a number of ways during the late 19th century: north of the mission was the site of Lopez Station for the Butterfield Stage Lines; it served as a warehouse for the Porter Land and Water Company; and in 1896, the quadrangle was used as a hog farm. In 1861, the Mission buildings and 75 acres of land were returned to the church after Charles Fletcher Lummis acted for preservation. The buildings were disintegrating as beams, tiles and nails were taken from the church by settlers. San Fernando&#x27;s church became a working church again in 1923 when the Oblate priests arrived. Many attempts were made to restore the old Mission from the early 20th century, but it was not until the Hearst Foundation gave a large gift of money in the 1940s, that the Mission was finally restored. The museum became the repository for heirlooms of the Mexican church evacuated during the Cristero revolt, and also holds part of the Doheny library. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, but was extensively damaged by the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, and was completely rebuilt. Repairs were completed in 1974. It continues to be very well cared for and is still used as a chapel-of-ease. The Convento Building was separately listed on the Register in 1988. In 2003, comedian Bob Hope, a late-life convert to Catholicism, was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens; followed by his widow Dolores Hope in 2011.

==Mission industries==

The goals of the missions were, first, to spread the message of Christianity and, second, to establish a Spanish colony. Because of the difficulty of delivering supplies by sea, the missions had to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Toward that end, neophytes were taught European-style farming, animal husbandry, mechanical arts and domestic crafts like tallow candle making.

The San Fernando Mission was known for having good quality wines and around the mission walls there were over 32,000 grapevines from which the neophytes produced wine; at the peak of its production, the mission produced about 2,000 gallons of wine and 2,000 gallons of &quot;aguardiente&quot;. The mission also contained about 70 acres of olive trees which were collected and crushed to make olive oil. The men of the mission community spent their days working in the fields or in the mission workshops and buildings; they were charged with tending to the cattle, horses and sheep as well as growing wheat, barley, peas, beans, corn, figs, and peaches. The women were charged with weaving in the workrooms to produce the cloth used in the mission. Sundays and holy days were dedicated to rest and prayer.

==Mission bells==
Bells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bell. The residents as referred to above were called neophytes (Indigenous persons) after baptism. There were five bells at the mission from 1769 to 1931.

A hundred-pound bell was unearthed in an orange grove near the Mission in 1920. It carried the following inscription (translated from Russian): &quot;&quot;In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of Archimandrite Joaseph, during the sojourn of Alexsandr Baranov&quot;.&quot; It is not known how this Russian Orthodox artifact from Kodiak, Alaska made its way to a Catholic mission in Southern California.

<text>Mission San Luis Rey de Francia () is a former Spanish mission in San Luis Rey, a neighborhood in Oceanside, California. This Mission lent its name to the Luiseño tribe of Mission Indians.

At its prime, Mission San Luis Rey&#x27;s structures and services compound covered almost , making it the largest of the Californian missions, along with its surrounding agricultural land. Multiple outposts were built in support of Mission San Luis Rey and placed under its supervision, including the San Antonio de Pala Asistencia in 1816 and the Las Flores Estancia in 1823.

==Spanish era==

The full name of the mission is &quot;La Misión de San Luis, Rey de Francia&quot; (The Mission of Saint Louis, King of France). It was named for King Louis IX of France. Its nickname is &quot;King of the Missions&quot;. It was founded by padre Fermín Lasuén on June 12, 1798, the eighteenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions built in the Alta California Province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1800, Mission olive trees were first planted at the Mission; by 1876, only seven of the mission&#x27;s olive trees were alive.

The current church, built in 1815, is the third church on this location. It is a National Historic Landmark, for its pristine example of a Spanish mission church complex. Today the mission complex functions as a parish church of the Diocese of San Diego as well as a museum and retreat center. Mission San Luis Rey De Francia raised about 26,000 cattle as well as goats, geese, and pigs.

An early account of life at the Mission was written by one of its Native American converts, Luiseño Pablo Tac, in his work &quot;Indian Life and Customs at Mission San Luis Rey: A Record of California Mission Life by Pablo Tac, An Indian Neophyte&quot; (written in Rome, later edited and translated in 1958 by Minna Hewes and Gordon Hewes). In his book, Tac lamented the rapid population decline of his Luiseño people after the founding of the mission:
In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring lands. Through a sickness that came to California, 2,000 souls died, and 3,000 were left.

The Mission-born, Franciscan-educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their Southern California lands. Pablo Tac went on to describe the preferential conditions and treatment the padres received:
In the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandino father is like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, gardens, ranchos, livestock...

==Mexican era==

The first Peruvian Pepper Tree (&quot;Schinus molle&quot;) in California was planted here in 1830, now iconic, widely planted, and renamed the &quot;California Pepper tree&quot; in the state. After the Mexican secularization act of 1833 much of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia land was sold off. Indigenous peoples, previously forced to work on missions, were freed from direct subjugation in the mission system through this act. When Native people at San Luis Rey learned of their impending freedom, they proclaimed together: &quot;We are free! We do not want to obey! We do not want to work!&quot; and left the mission by the thousands, returning to their rural communities &quot;which in some cases their forebears had left two generations earlier.&quot;

During the Mexican–American War in Alta California (1846–1847), the Mission was utilized as a military outpost by the United States Army. In July 1847, U.S. military governor of California Richard Barnes Mason created an Indian sub-agency at Mission San Luis Rey, and his men took charge of the mission property in August, appointing Jesse Hunter from the recently arrived Mormon Battalion as sub-agent. Battalion guide Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the Native American Shoshone child of Sacagawea who had traveled with the Lewis and Clark Expedition forty years earlier, was appointed by Mason as the Alcalde &quot;within the District of San Diego, at or near San Luis Rey&quot; in November 1847. Charbonneau resigned from the post in August, 1848, claiming that &quot;because of his Indian heritage others thought him biased when problems arose between the Indians and the other inhabitants of the district.&quot;

==American era==

With secularization of the mission in 1834, no religious services were held and the Luiseño were left behind by the fleeing Franciscan padres. The Mission&#x27;s religious services restarted in 1893, when two Mexican priests were given permission to restore the Mission as a Franciscan college. Father Joseph O&#x27;Keefe was assigned as an interpreter for the monks. It was he who began to restore the old Mission in 1895. The &quot;cuadrángulo&quot; (quadrangle) and church were completed in 1905. San Luis Rey College was opened as a seminary in 1950, but closed in 1969.

Episodes 2, 3, 4 and 12 of the Disney-produced &quot;Zorro&quot; TV series include scenes filmed in 1957 at San Luis Rey, which doubled for the Mission of San Gabriel. Disney added a skull and crossbones to the cemetery entrance.

In 1998, Gilbert Levine led members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and, with the special permission of Pope John Paul II, the ancient Cappella Giulia Choir of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, the first-ever visit of this 500-year-old choir to the Western Hemisphere, in a series of concerts to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the mission, broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Performance Today&quot;. In February 2013, the seismic retrofitting was completed.

Today, Mission San Luis Rey de Francia is a working mission, cared for by the people who belong to the parish, with ongoing restoration projects. Mission San Luis Rey has a Museum, Visitors&#x27; Center, Retreat Center, gardens with the historic Pepper Tree, and the original small cemetery.

<doc id="60080" wikidata="Q6878745" url="?curid=60080" title="Mission Santa Inés">
<text>Mission Santa Inés (sometimes spelled Santa Ynez) was a Spanish mission in present-day Solvang, California, United States, and named after St. Agnes of Rome. Founded on September 17, 1804, by Father Estévan Tapís of the Franciscan order, the mission site was chosen as a midway point between Mission Santa Barbara and Mission La Purísima Concepción, and was designed to relieve overcrowding at those two missions and to serve the Indians living north of the Coast Range. &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine editors wrote of the Hidden Gem of the Missions: “With its simple, straightforward exterior, Santa Inés fits one’s impression of how a ripe old mission should look.”

The mission was home to the first learning institution in Alta California and today serves as a museum as well as a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. It is also designated a National Historic Landmark, noted as one of the best-preserved of the 21 California missions.

==History==

Most of the original church was destroyed on December 21, 1812, in an earthquake centered near Santa Barbara that damaged or destroyed several California missions. The quake also severely damaged other mission buildings, but the complex was not abandoned. A new church, constructed with walls and great pine beams brought from nearby Figueroa Mountain, was dedicated on July 4, 1817. 
A water-powered grist mill was built in 1819, about half a mile from the church.

In 1821, a fulling mill was added, designed by newly arrived American immigrant Joseph John Chapman. He oversaw the building of a grist mill for Mission San Gabriel, and he prepared timbers for the construction of the first church in Los Angeles. The mill he built near San Gabriel is now a museum. Chapman was baptized at Mission Basilica San Buenaventura in 1822, and that same year married Guadalupe Ortega of Santa Barbara, with whom he had five children. In 1824, Chapman bought land in Los Angeles and developed a vineyard, but still continued to perform odd jobs at the missions.

On February 21, 1824, a soldier beat a young Chumash native. Two separate Chumash accounts, written in the early 1900s, state that around the time the tribesman was beaten a Spanish page overheard Santa Inés priests talking about having the natives of the mission killed the next summer when they arrived. The page was found out by the priests after having alerted the natives, and his tongue and feet were cut off before he was burned to death. Upon learning of this news, the natives sought the help of the other Santa Barbara Channel Mission natives and a week later the Chumash revolt of 1824 was sparked. When the fighting was over, the natives themselves put out the fire that had started at the mission. Many of the Indians left to join other tribes in the mountains; only a few Chumash remained at the mission.

In 1833, the missions in California began to be secularized, however, it was not until 1835 that the Santa Inés Mission became secularized by the Mexican government. Secularization involved replacing the padres as managers of the missions with government appointed overseers. In this case, the existing Spanish Franciscans were replaced by Mexican Franciscans who were restricted to provide only for the spiritual needs of the Chumash. The Chumash were mistreated under this new policy and began to leave the mission, returning to their villages or working at settlers’ ranches. As a result, much of their land was given to settlers in land grants.

In 1843, California&#x27;s Mexican governor Micheltorena granted of Santa Ynez Valley land, called Rancho Cañada de los Pinos, to the College of Our Lady of Refuge, the first seminary in California. Established at the mission by Francisco García Diego y Moreno, the first bishop of California, the college was abandoned in 1881. By then the mission buildings were disintegrating.

Highwayman Jack Powers briefly took over Mission Santa Inés and the adjacent Rancho San Marcos in 1853, intending to rustle the cattle belonging to rancher Nicolas A. Den. Powers was defeated in a bloodless armed confrontation. He was not ousted from the Santa Barbara area until 1855.

The Danish town of Solvang was built up around the mission proper in the early 1900s. It was through the efforts of Father Alexander Buckler in 1904 that reconstruction of the mission was undertaken, though major restoration was not possible until 1947 when the Hearst Foundation donated money to pay for the project. The restoration continues by the Capuchin Franciscan Fathers.

== Indigenous people ==
The Alta California mission system was founded by Catholic priests of the Franciscan order to evangelize the Native Americans. The missionaries introduced European fruits, vegetables, cattle, horses, ranching, and technology. The natives at Santa Inés were used as laborers and the mission&#x27;s agriculture caused great ecological changes in the environment. Archaeobotanical analysis displayed that the agricultural efforts at Santa Inés are specifically responsible for integrating pea, squash, potato, cabbage, olive, grape, pear, apricot, hemp, peach, carrot, etc. into the environment. It was not long after the placement of the missions that European plants and weeds proliferated throughout California&#x27;s coast.

Many Natives of missions in the Southwestern region of what is presently U.S. territory and North Mexico fell victim to Euro-Asiatic diseases to which they had no immunity; such as those of the Pimería Alta and Baja California missions. However, demographic studies have shown that the Santa Barbara Channel Missions (Santa Inés, Santa Barbara, San Buenaventura, and La Purísima Concepción) and many other Alta California Missions do not exactly follow this trend. Though the missions were not free of epidemics, the censuses taken in the 1800s display that women and children had a much higher mortality rate than men. Diseases are not partial to gender or age, which meant that something outside of disease had a drastic effect on the Indian population in the missions.

Researchers discovered that the population decline was focused by the unique conditions of the Alta California missions: very tight, overcrowded living arrangements which fostered the spread of diseases. These conditions were met as a part of the program the missions made to culturally and religiously change the Natives. For instance, to control the sexual intercourse of the women, the Franciscans would lock up all the single women together at night in small, damp rooms.

== Restoration of the Mission ==
The Santa Ines Mission is one of the oldest surviving structures in the state of California and requires constant efforts to repair and restore. Over the years, many men and women have labored in order to preserve, maintain, and restore the historical landmark. Efforts in the past have included restoration of buildings that are made out of adobe (dried mud) to ensure structural stability. The structures made out of adobe are particularly susceptible to the elements, soil shifts, and earthquakes. Without proper conservation, the Santa Ines Mission walls will crack and the artwork will fade.

Parishioners are largely responsible for the efforts put forth in restoring Mission Santa Ines, although, non-parishioners have contributed as well. The parish does not receive state or federal funding, instead they get their funds through museum entrance fees, fundraisers, and donations from individuals and foundations. Individual contributions and grants from private foundations such as the California Mission Foundation has also significantly helped restoration efforts in the past.

<text>Mission San Rafael Arcángel (Spanish: &quot;La Misión del Gloriosísimo Príncipe San Rafael, Arcángel&quot;, lit. The Mission of the Glorious Prince, Archangel Saint Raphael) is a replica Spanish mission in San Rafael, California. The original mission was founded in 1817 as a medical &quot;asistencia&quot; (&quot;sub-mission&quot;) of Mission San Francisco de Asís. It was a hospital to treat sick and injured indigenous people, making it Alta California&#x27;s first sanitarium. The weather was much better than in San Francisco, which helped the ill get better. It was not intended to be a stand-alone mission, but nevertheless grew and prospered and was granted full mission status on October 19, 1822.

By the 1860s, the mission had fallen into severe disrepair, giving the mission the ignoble distinction as the &quot;most obliterated&quot; Spanish mission in California. In 1870, the mission ruins were entirely removed. In 1949, the modern-day replica was built on the grounds of the original hospital, next to the surviving Saint Raphael&#x27;s Church.

==History==
 Mission San Rafael Arcángel was founded on December 14, 1817, by Father Vicente Francisco de Sarría, as a medical &quot;asistencia&quot; (&quot;sub-mission&quot;) of the San Francisco Mission to treat their sick population. It was granted full mission status on October 19, 1822.

This was one of the missions turned over to the Mexican government in 1833 after the Mexican secularization act of 1833. In 1840, there were 150 Native Americans still at the Mission. By 1844, Mission San Rafael Arcángel had been abandoned; what was left of the empty buildings was sold for $8,000 in 1846. The Mission was used by John C. Fremont as his headquarters during the Bear Flag Revolt.

On June 28, 1846, three men departed the mission, including Kit Carson, and murdered three unarmed Californians under the order of John C. Fremont: Don José R. Berreyesa, father of José de los Santos Berreyesa, along with the twin sons of Don Francisco de Haro, Ramon and Francisco De Haro.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hbbegd.htm group=dab&quot;&gt;The Beginnings of San Francisco App. D – The Murder of Berreyesa and the De Haros&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, a priest was once again living at the Mission. A new parish church was built near the old chapel ruins in 1861, and, in 1870, the rest of the ruins were removed to make room for the City of San Rafael. All that was left of the Mission was a single pear tree from the old Mission&#x27;s orchard. It is for this reason that San Rafael is known as the &quot;most obliterated of California&#x27;s missions&quot;.

In 1949, a replica of the chapel was built next to the current Saint Raphael&#x27;s Church on the site of the original hospital in San Rafael, California which was built in 1919.

<text>Lapidary (from the Latin ) is the practice of shaping stone, minerals, or gemstones into decorative items such as cabochons, engraved gems (including cameos), and faceted designs. A person who practices lapidary techniques of cutting, grinding, and polishing is known as a lapidary or lapidarist. Hardstone carving requires specialized carving techniques.

In modern contexts, a gemcutter is a person who specializes in cutting diamonds, but in older contexts the term refers to artists who produced hardstone carvings; engraved gems such as jade carvings, a branch of miniature sculpture or ornament in gemstone.

By extension, the term &quot;lapidary&quot; has sometimes been applied to collectors of and dealers in gems, or to anyone who is knowledgeable in precious stones.

==Etymology==
The etymological root of the word &quot;lapidary&quot; is the Latin word , meaning &quot;stone&quot;. In the 14th century, the term evolved from , meaning &#x27;stonecutter&#x27; or &#x27;working with stone&#x27;, into the Old French word , meaning &#x27;one skilled in working with precious stones&#x27;.

In French, and later English, the term is also used for a lapidary text, which was a treatise on precious stones that details their appearance, formation, and properties - particularly in terms of the powers believed to be held by some stones - as believed in medieval Europe. The beliefs about the powers of stones included their ability to prevent harm, heal ailments, or offer health benefits. &quot;Lapidary&quot; appeared as an English adjective in the 18th century.

==History==
The earliest known lapidary work likely occurred during the Stone Age. As people created tools from stone, they realized that some geological materials were harder than others. The next earliest documented examples of what could be considered lapidary arts came in the form of drilling stone and rock. The earliest roots of drilling rocks date back to approximately one million years ago.

The early Egyptians developed cutting and jewelry fashioning methods for lapis lazuli, turquoise, and amethyst.

The art of lapidary was relatively well-developed in the Indian subcontinent by the early 1st millennium CE. The surviving manuscripts of the 3rd century Buddhist text by Buddha Bhatta, and several Hindu texts of mid-1st millennium CE such as and , are Sanskrit treatises on lapidary arts. They discuss sources of gems and diamonds, their origins, qualities, testing, cutting and polishing, and making jewelry from them. Several other Sanskrit texts on gems and lapidary arts have been dated to post-10th century, suggesting a continuous lapidary practice.

According to Jason Hawkes and Stephanie Wynne-Jones, archaeological evidence suggests that trade in lapidary products between Africa and India was established in the 1st millennium CE. People of the Deccan region of India and those near the coast of East Africa had innovated their own techniques for lapidary before the 10th century, as evidenced by excavations and Indian and non-Indian texts dated to that period.

Lapidary was also a significant tradition in early Mesoamerica. The lapidary products were used as status symbols, for offerings, and during burials. They were made from shell, jade, turquoise, and greenstones. Aztec lapidarists used string saws and drills made of reed and bone as their lapidary tools.

=== Medieval lapidaries ===

The history of lapidaries can be traced back to the classical world, where writers like Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder laid the foundations for later medieval interpretations of gemstones. In his examination of &quot;lyngurium&quot;—a mythical gemstone described by Theophrastus—Steven A. Walton discusses how classical knowledge was transmitted and adapted in medieval lapidary traditions. Despite the mythical nature of some of these stones, medieval lapidaries continued to draw on classical sources, blending scientific knowledge with magical beliefs. Walton highlights how these texts cataloged stones not only for their aesthetic and material properties but also for their purported magical and medicinal functions, making lapidaries sources essential for texts for both scholars and practitioners of natural philosophy during the medieval period.

In Anglo-Saxon England, lapidaries became particularly significant as both medical and religious guides. Peter Kitson traces the transmission of lapidary knowledge into early medieval England, emphasizing how these texts informed by Lapidaries functioned as practical manuals for physicians, clergy, and scholars. The &quot;Old English Lapidary&quot;, for instance, detailed the healing properties of stones, reflecting the belief that gemstones could cure illnesses and provide spiritual protection. Kitson argues that lapidaries in this period served a dual purpose: they were not only scientific texts that described natural phenomena but also moral and religious guides that connected material objects to divine forces.

Medieval lapidaries were deeply embedded in the practice of lithotherapy, the belief in the healing properties of stones. John M. Riddle’s analysis of lithotherapy in the Middle Ages emphasizes the medical role lapidaries played, particularly in guiding the use of gemstones for healing. These texts described how different stones, often categorized by color, composition, and astrological associations, could be used to treat specific ailments. Riddle points out that medieval lapidaries were not merely collections of folklore; they were often considered legitimate medical texts, consulted by physicians and healers to guide treatment practices.

The &quot;Peterborough Lapidary&quot; is another example of a medieval lapidary that reflects the blending of practical and mystical knowledge. As detailed in &quot;A Medieval Book of Magical Stones: The Peterborough Lapidary&quot;, this text catalogs various gemstones and their magical properties, emphasizing the belief that stones could influence human behavior, protect against harm, and even cure diseases. The &quot;Peterborough Lapidary&quot; demonstrates how lapidaries were used not only for healing but also for magical and protective purposes, reflecting the medieval understanding that the natural world was imbued with supernatural power.

Lapidaries also played an important role in medieval spirituality. Richard A. Beinert’s analysis of medieval piety and lapidary literature emphasizes how these texts reflected religious beliefs. Medieval Christians often associated gemstones with biblical figures, virtues, and divine forces. Lapidaries like the &quot;Peterborough Lapidary&quot; reinforced the idea that stones had sacred meanings, offering protection and spiritual benefits to those who used them correctly. Beinert suggests that these texts served as “windows on a medieval world” where natural objects were seen as manifestations of divine power, bridging the gap between the material and the spiritual.

Several notable examples of medieval lapidaries highlight their widespread use and cultural significance. The &quot;Lapidary of Sydrac&quot;, a 13th-century text, stands out for its inclusion of unusual lore about gemstones. William M. Holler notes that the &quot;Lapidary of Sydrac&quot; cataloged not only conventional healing properties of stones but also fantastical claims, such as stones that could grant invincibility or manipulate human emotions. This text reflects the broader medieval belief in the mystical powers of nature and the importance of lapidaries in transmitting both empirical knowledge and magical traditions.

In literary contexts, lapidary traditions also made their way into poetry. Tony Davenport’s analysis of the medieval poem &quot;Pearl&quot; reveals how the symbolic meanings of gemstones, as described in lapidaries, informed the poem’s themes of loss, beauty, and spiritual transcendence. Davenport suggests that the portrayal of jewels in &quot;Pearl&quot; draws on lapidary traditions to convey deeper religious and moral messages, illustrating how lapidary knowledge permeated not only scientific and medical texts but also literary and artistic works.

==Techniques==

There are three broad categories of lapidary arts: tumbling, cabochon cutting, and faceting. Among a modern gemcutter&#x27;s work are the following activities:
* Positioning rough stone in a holder, and holding the stone against the edge of a revolving saw or lapidary slitter impregnated with diamond dust to cut and slit stone.
* Removing cut stone and placing it in lapidary stick. A gemcutter then selects the shaping wheel and applies abrasive compound. They hold a lapidary stick against the revolving shaping wheel and lapidary disk to further shape stone and grind facets.
* Depositing stone within a barrel with both water and a grinding/polishing medium and either vibrating or rotating said barrel using friction to grind and polish the stones over time.
* Examining stone for accuracy of cut, using a magnifying glass. A gemcutter polishes stone, using felt or canvas-covered polishing wheel, and polishing compounds, such as tripoli or jeweler&#x27;s rouge.
* Possibly using a mechanical facet-cutting device. A gemcutter may cut and polish diamonds for industrial purposes, and be designated as an industrial diamond polisher.
* The Mohs hardness scale is a commonly used tool in lapidary to help measure a mineral&#x27;s scratch hardness. A mineral&#x27;s scratch hardness is measured by seeing how easily scratched it is, and what other minerals on the Mohs hardness scale can scratch it. This tool is helpful in indicating what different lapidary methods should be used on the material.

===Cutting===

Cutting of harder stones is done with a diamond-edged saw. For softer materials, a medium other than diamond can be used, such as silicon carbide, garnet, emery, or corundum. Diamond cutting requires the use of diamond tools because of the extreme hardness of diamonds. The cutting, grinding, and polishing operations are usually lubricated with water, oil, or other liquids. Beyond these broader categories, there are other specialized forms of lapidary techniques, such as casting, carving, jewelry, and mosaics.

While the gemstone in the rough state may be trimmed to remove undesirable material or to separate it on a cleavage line with a diamond bladed saw, accurately described as cutting and once done by the use of a chisel or similar tool to simply break off pieces that were usable as single gemstones, the actual shaping and polishing of a gemstone is a grinding or sanding process. This grinding and sanding is done using a lap, a precision metal plate embedded with grit similar to the more familiar embedding of grit on paper the lap is of high precision particularly for flatness and turned by a motor. The grit material is normally diamond and sometimes corundum for their hardness. Only diamond is hard enough on the Mohs scale to shape and polish a diamond.

===Faceting===

Faceting requires equipment allowing for very precise adjustment of angle and location around the gemstone for facet-placement, a process sometimes referred to as indexing. 
The design may be computer-generated or left up to the skill and expertise of the individual cutting the gemstone.

During the process of grinding, faceting, and lapping, the gemstone is usually affixed (&quot;dopped&quot;) to a rod (frequently referred to as a &quot;dop&quot; or &quot;dopstick&quot;) made of wood, or perhaps brass or steel, 
with dopping cement, a specialized thermal adhesive. The dopstick can be hand-held or inserted into the indexing equipment for more precise faceting. A coolant then needs to be constantly applied to prevent softening of the cement. Diamonds, however, are held mechanically, or with low-melting point tin-lead solder, since the resultant heat generated by friction can be extreme, thus preventing the use of thermal adhesives.

Cabochons - smooth-shaped gemstones without facets such as jade or turquoise, and indeed most gemstones - are instead shaped and polished in much the same manner. They are usually left up to the skill and expertise of the individual cutting the gemstone and to similar equipment such as the lapping equipment.

===Polishing===
Most modern lapidary work is done using motorized equipment. Polishing is done with resin- or metal-bonded emery, silicon carbide (carborundum), aluminium oxide (corundum), or diamond dust in successively decreasing particle sizes until a polish is achieved. In older systems, the grinding and polishing powders were applied separately to the grinding or buffing wheel. Often, the final polish will use a different medium such as tin oxide or cerium(IV) oxide.

The initial shaping and facet placement may be done using laps with grits of 220, 600, 1200. The polishing step, however, requires grits of a much higher grade, such as 8,000, 14,000, 50,000 and even 100,000. This grit is also embedded into a metal lap, but sometimes applied manually to the lap during polishing.

===Inlaying===
Another specialized form of lapidary work is the inlaying of marble and gemstones into a marble matrix. This technique is known in English as &quot;pietra dura&quot;, for the hardstones that are used, like onyx, jasper and carnelian. In Florence and Naples, where the technique was developed in the 16th century, it is called . The Medici Chapel at San Lorenzo in Florence is completely veneered with inlaid hard stones. The specialty of &quot;micromosaics&quot;, which developed in the late-18th century in Naples and Rome, is sometimes covered under the umbrella term of lapidary work. In this technique, minute slivers of glass are assembled to create still life, cityscape views, and other images. In China, lapidary work specializing in jade carving has been continuous since at least the Shang dynasty.

== Safety ==

Stones can contain asbestos, silica, lead, talc, and other hazardous ingredients. The dust produced by lapidary techniques on such stones can cause health issues if inhaled. Copper(II) oxide, which is common in colorful minerals such as turquoise and malachite, can damage the endocrine and central nervous systems. The most common minerals are silicates, and the dust from these rocks can result in silicosis. Fossil rocks can be radioactive.

For lapidary work, safety precautions include wearing a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health approved respirator with replaceable cartridges and dust filters; using a local exhaust ventilation system or working outside; using proper lubricants; wearing protective clothing; showering and shampooing immediately afterward; and using a wet mop to clean the workshop. 

==Societies and clubs==
There are lapidary clubs throughout the world. In Australia, there are numerous gem shows, including an annual gem show called the GEMBOREE, which is a nationwide lapidary competition. There is a collection of gem and mineral shows held in Tucson, Arizona, at the beginning of February each year. The event began with the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society Show and has now grown to include dozens of other independent shows. In 2012, this concurrent group of shows constituted the largest gem and mineral event in the world. 

In the United States, societies include the American Gem Society.

<doc id="60084" wikidata="Q13560270" url="?curid=60084" title="Mission San Francisco Solano">
<text>Mission San Francisco Solano was the 21st, last, and northernmost mission in Alta California. It was named for Saint Francis Solanus. It was the only mission built in Alta California after Mexico gained independence from Spain. The difficulty of its beginning demonstrates the confusion resulting from that change in governance. The California Governor wanted a robust Mexican presence north of the San Francisco Bay to keep the Russians who had established Fort Ross on the Pacific coast from moving further inland. A young Franciscan friar from Mission San Francisco de Asis wanted to move to a location with a better climate and access to a larger number of potential converts.

The Mission was successful, given its short eleven year life, but was smaller in number of converts and with lower productivity and diversity of industries than the older California missions.

The mission building is now part of the Sonoma State Historic Park and is located in the city of Sonoma, California.

==History==

The mission was founded then managed by a succession of priests and friars over its duration.
===Fr. Altimira=== 
Fr. José Altimira at age 33 arrived from Barcelona, Spain, to serve at Mission San Francisco de Asís. The mission was not thriving because of its climate and had established a medical &quot;asistencia&quot; (&quot;sub-mission&quot;) in San Rafael to help the mission&#x27;s ill neophytes (baptized Native Americans) recover their health. California Governor Luis Argüello was interested in blocking the Russians at Bodega Bay and Fort Ross from moving further inland. Together they developed and presented to the church authorities and the territory (legislature) a plan for moving Mission San Francisco de Asís and the San Rafael asistencia to a new location north of the Bay. The legislature approved but the church authorities did not respond (they had forwarded the plan to their superiors in Mexico). Under the old Spanish regime, founding a new mission required the approval of both New Spain&#x27;s Bishop and the King&#x27;s Viceroy.

Beginning in 1823, while waiting for a response from the church authorities, Fr. Altimira, with military escorts, began exploring north of the Bay for a suitable mission site. On July 4, 1823, the soldiers placed a large redwood cross on the place in the Sonoma Valley where they expected the new Mission San Francisco de Assis to be established. They celebrated Mass to consecrate the location, then returned south to begin gathering men and materials to begin construction.

The area around the selected site was not empty. It was near the northeast corner of the territory of the Coast Miwok, Southern Pomo to the northwest, Wappo to the northeast, Suisunes and Ptwin peoples to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/PSHPA&quot;&gt;S/PSHPA&lt;/ref&gt; A detachment of soldiers from the Presidio of San Francisco would be provided to protect the Mission and guard the neophytes.

Altimira with soldiers and neophytes primarily from Mission San Francisco de Asís returned to the Sonoma area near the end of August. Altimira decided there was a better place to build on the other side of the valley. Just after starting he received a letter from Father-President Sarria who refused Altimira permission to continue building. Fr. Altimira obeyed and the month of September saw continuing negotiations between California&#x27;s civil and religious leaders. On September 30 an agreement was reached: a new mission could be built and Fr. Altimira would be its minister, but Mission San Francisco de Asís would not be closed and the San Rafael asistencia had already been designated as a full mission (Mission San Rafael Arcángel).

Beginning in October 1824 Fr. Altimira had the opportunity to build his new mission at the location he chose, but since Mission San Francisco de Asís would remain open this Mission needed a different patron saint. Altimira chose San Francisco Solano, a 17th-century Franciscan missionary to South America. His company of soldiers and neophytes set about building all the facilities needed in a California mission. His annual report for 1823 listed no baptisms, one marriage, one funeral, a population of 482 Indians (all transferred from other missions) and 1341 animals. The work had started too late in the year for anything to be planted and harvested.

On April 4, 1825, Passion Sunday, Father Altimira proudly dedicated his church. It was a crude, temporary structure but it symbolized development at the Mission. The church was built of whitewashed boards but was well furnished and decorated. Many of the articles were gifts from the Russians at Fort Ross. It also held a canvas painting of San Francisco Solano which had been donated by the Father-President. Furthermore, the Mission had been promised a relic of the patron saint to put in the altar.

The Mission continued to develop until an argument arose about the sharing of the bountiful 1826 harvest. Indians not living at the Mission were unhappy with the amount allocated for their work; they burned some of the wooden buildings in protest. Fr. Altimira with a few faithful neophytes fled to Mission San Rafael Arcángel.

===Fr. Fortuni===
Fr. Buenaventura Fortuni, an aging Spanish Franciscan who had been working at Mission San José in California, was assigned to replace Altimira. Fr. Fortuni quickly reestablished order and morale and the work of building the mission restarted. He arranged the main buildings to form a large, square enclosure.

In 1830 Fr. Fortuni, having labored alone at this mission for three and a half years, felt the need to transfer to another mission where the workload could be shared. He was 58 years old. The Mexican government had in 1826 required that all the Spanish friars who would not pledge loyalty to Mexico leave. Fr. Fortuni had been exempt from this rule but all new churchmen would be required to take the pledge.

===Fr. Gutierrez===
Fr. Fortuni was replaced by Fr. José Gutiérrez, a Franciscan friar from South America. Fr. Gutierrez continued to build and increased the agricultural effort. By 1832 the mission had 27 rooms in the &quot;convento&quot; or priest&#x27;s quarters, with a great adobe church at the east end, and a wooden storehouse (the original mission chapel) at the west end. Completing this enclosure were workshops where the Indians were taught to be craftsmen and created the items needed to help the mission be self-sufficient. Along the back of the courtyard were the living quarters and workrooms for the young Indian girls. In addition to the quadrangle, there were orchards, gardens, vineyards, fields of grain, a gristmill, houses for the soldiers and Indian families, a jail, a cemetery, and an infirmary.

The most successful year of this mission&#x27;s short life span (11 years) was 1832. In his annual report for that year, Fr. Gutierrez recorded the following: 127 baptisms, 34 marriages, and 70 deaths; a total of 996 neophytes (coming from 35 area villages); the livestock inventory included 6,000 sheep and goats, 900 horses, 13 mules, 50 pigs and 3,500 head of cattle. Crops were measured in fanegas, or Spanish bushels, a variable measure of volume generally between 50 and 60 liters. In 1832 the mission produced 800 fanegas of wheat, 1025 fanegas of barley, 52 fanegas of peas, 300 fanegas of corn, 32 fanegas of beans, and 2 fanegas of garbanzos.

==Secularization==
In 1833 the Mexican Congress decided to close all of the missions in Alta California with the passage of the Mexican secularization act of 1833. Governor Figueroa issued a regulation (&quot;Reglamento Provisional para la secularization de las Misiones&quot;) on August 9, 1834, outlining the requirements for the distribution of property (land, cattle, and equipment) to each mission&#x27;s neophytes. Among the provisions were that &quot;5. To each head of a family and to all over 20 years old, will be given from the Mission lands a lot not over 400 nor less than 100 &quot;varas&quot; square&quot; (28 to 7 acres). Plus &quot;6. ...&quot;pro rata&quot;...one-half of the livestock&quot; and &quot;7. ... half or less of the existing chattels, tools, and seed...&quot;.

==Closure==
Mission San Francisco Solano officially ceased to exist on November 3, 1834, when it was designated a First Class Parish. The Spanish missionaries were to be replaced by parish priests – the first was Fr. Lorenzo Quijas who had earlier been assigned to Sonoma and San Rafael.

Lieutenant (&quot;teniente&quot;) Mariano Vallejo, Commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, was named administrator (&quot;comisionado&quot;) to oversee the closing of the Mission under the &quot;Reglamento&quot;. Fr. Quijas moved back to San Rafael in July 1835, after many disputes with Guadalupe Antonio Ortega, Vallejo&#x27;s majordomo to whom he had delegated the work of secularization. Ortega (sometimes called Sergeant Ortega) was “uneducated, coarse and licentious&quot;. Right after returning to San Rafael, Padre Quijas wrote a letter to Commissary Perfect Garcia Diego, his superior, complaining about the situation in Sonoma and specifically the &quot;abominable deeds of Ortega.&quot; Quijas then gives names of witnesses to be called against Ortega. Upon receipt of the letter, Fr. Diego forwarded it to Governor José Figueroa demanding some action against Ortega. The Governor was critically ill and died at the end of the following month. No action was taken. It wasn&#x27;t until the summer of 1837, because of new scandals and unsatisfactory accounts, that Ortega was removed.

After Fr. Quijas left, the neophyte population decreased rapidly, most returning to their home villages – taking their movable property with them – or moving to ranchos {including Vallejo&#x27;s Petaluma Adobe} to work, or staying in Sonoma as servants. Some former Mission Indians reportedly received their allotted land and cattle from the Mission (none of these small plots of land were permanently recorded.) In August 1839, the government sent William Edward Petty Hartnell as &quot;Visitador General de Misiones&quot; to check compliance with the &quot;Reglamento&quot; but Vallejo avoided responding – claiming he did not have time because of military affairs. No effective review of the secularization of the Sonoma mission was ever completed.

==Decline==
The mission buildings rapidly fell into disrepair. The town of Sonoma was growing and building materials were in great demand. Roof tiles, timbers, and adobe bricks were salvaged from the mission buildings. After the settlers had ransacked the old buildings, nature began recycling the remnants.
In 1841, Mariano Vallejo ordered a small adobe chapel to be built on the location of the first wooden mission chapel. It became the church of the parish and replaced the large mission church which was rapidly deteriorating. It stood on the west end of the &quot;Convento&quot; and so is often thought to be the church of the old mission.

During 1863 President Abraham Lincoln transferred ownership of all the mission churches in California to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1881, the Sonoma church property was sold to a local businessman and a new parish church was built across town. At one time, the old adobe chapel was used as a warehouse. The &quot;Convento&quot; may have been used as a winery.

==Reconstruction, memorial and hospital==
In 1903, the two remaining mission buildings were purchased by California Historic Landmarks League, and became part of the California Park System in 1906. In 1903, the Sonoma Valley Woman&#x27;s Club raised $184 () to help preserve the Sonoma Mission as a city landmark. In 1910, Club members got a lease on the property and raised $800 () for repairs. They were assisted by the Native Sons of the Golden West of Sonoma. In 1911, club members petitioned the State Legislature, resulting in a appropriation of $5,000 () to restore the Mission. By 1913, both had been reconstructed. After the 1940s, the former church and &quot;Convento&quot; were remodeled along more authentic lines suited to exhibits devoted exclusively to mission history.

Dedicated in 1999, the Sonoma Mission Indian Memorial honors the more than 800 native people (including over 200 children) who died while living and working at the Mission between 1824 and 1839. Their Christian names, as recorded by the priests in the Mission&#x27;s records, are inscribed on this granite memorial. European diseases such as measles and smallpox, for which Native Americans had no inherited resistance, together with the overcrowded and unhealthy living conditions (by today&#x27;s standards) at all California missions (especially for women and children) contributed to the high death rate. However, the missions served, with the resources of the time, the health needs of its inhabitants, including those of Indian origin. Thus, the first hospital in California was founded in 1817 to care for the Indians of the Mission San Francisco de Asís, in what later became an independent Mission, the Mission San Rafael Arcangel, in San Rafael, California.

==California Historic Landmark==

On June 1, 1932, Mission San Francisco Solano was designated California Historical Landmark #3.

<text>In the computer industry, vaporware (or vapourware) is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public but is late, never actually manufactured, or officially cancelled. Use of the word has broadened to include products such as automobiles.

Vaporware is often announced months or years before its purported release, with few details about its development being released. Developers have been accused of intentionally promoting vaporware to keep customers from switching to competing products that offer more features. &quot;Network World&quot; magazine called vaporware an &quot;epidemic&quot; in 1989 and blamed the press for not investigating if developers&#x27; claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990 saying that they felt vaporware had hurt the industry&#x27;s credibility. The United States accused several companies of announcing vaporware early enough to violate antitrust laws, but few have been found guilty.

&quot;Vaporware&quot; was coined by a Microsoft engineer in 1982 to describe the company&#x27;s Xenix operating system and appeared in print at least as early as the May 1983 issue of Sinclair User magazine (spelled as &#x27;Vapourware&#x27; in UK English). It became popular among writers in the industry as a way to describe products they felt took too long to be released. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize it by lampooning Bill Gates with a &quot;Golden Vaporware&quot; award for the late release of his company&#x27;s first version of Windows in 1985.

==Etymology==
&quot;Vaporware&quot;, sometimes synonymous with &quot;vaportalk&quot; in the 1980s, has no single definition. It is generally used to describe a hardware or software product that has been announced, but that the developer is unlikely to release any time soon, if ever.

The first reported use of the word was in 1982 by an engineer at the computer software company Microsoft. Ann Winblad, president of Open Systems Accounting Software, wanted to know if Microsoft planned to stop developing its Xenix operating system as some of Open System&#x27;s products depended on it. She asked two Microsoft software engineers, John Ulett and Mark Ursino, who confirmed that development of Xenix had stopped. &quot;One of them told me, &#x27;Basically, it&#x27;s vaporware&#x27;,&quot; she later said. Winblad compared the word to the idea of &quot;selling smoke&quot;, implying Microsoft was selling a product it would soon not support.

Winblad described the word to influential computer expert Esther Dyson, who published it for the first time in her monthly newsletter &quot;RELease 1.0&quot;. In an article titled &quot;Vaporware&quot; in the November 1983 issue of &quot;RELease 1.0&quot;, Dyson defined the word as &quot;good ideas incompletely implemented&quot;. She described three software products shown at COMDEX in Las Vegas that year with bombastic advertisements. She stated that demonstrations of the &quot;purported revolutions, breakthroughs and new generations&quot; at the exhibition did not meet those claims.

The practice existed before Winblad&#x27;s account. In a January 1982 review of the new IBM Personal Computer, &quot;BYTE&quot; favorably noted that IBM &quot;refused to acknowledge the existence of any product that is not ready to be put on dealers&#x27; shelves tomorrow. Although this is frustrating at times, it is a refreshing change from some companies&#x27; practice of announcing a product even before its design is finished&quot;. When discussing Coleco&#x27;s delay in releasing the Adam, &quot;Creative Computing&quot; in March 1984 stated that the company &quot;did not invent the common practice of debuting products before they actually exist. In microcomputers, to do so otherwise would be to break with a veritable tradition&quot;. After Dyson&#x27;s article, the word &quot;vaporware&quot; became popular among writers in the personal computer software industry as a way to describe products they believed took too long to be released after their first announcement. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize its use by giving Bill Gates, then-CEO of Microsoft, with a &quot;Golden Vaporware&quot; award for Microsoft releasing Windows in 1985, 18 months late. Alsop presented it to Gates at a celebration for the release while the song &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; played in the background.

&quot;Vaporware&quot; took another meaning when it was used to describe a product that did not exist. A new company named Ovation Technologies announced its office suite Ovation in 1983. The company invested in an advertising campaign that promoted Ovation as a &quot;great innovation&quot;, and showed a demonstration of the program at computer trade shows. The demonstration was well received by writers in the press, was featured in a cover story for an industry magazine, and reportedly created anticipation among potential customers. Executives later revealed that Ovation never existed. The company created the fake demonstration in an unsuccessful attempt to raise money to finish their product, and is &quot;widely considered the mother of all vaporware,&quot; according to Laurie Flynn of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Use of the term spread beyond the computer industry. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s Allan Sloan described the manipulation of stocks by Yahoo! and Amazon.com as &quot;financial vaporware&quot; in 1997. &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine uses a scale ranging from &quot;vaporware&quot; to &quot;bet on it&quot; to describe release dates of new consumer electronics. Car manufacturer General Motors&#x27; plans to develop and sell an electric car were called vaporware by an advocacy group in 2008 and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine retroactively described the Vector W8 supercar as vaporware in 2017.

==Causes and use==

===Late release===

A product missing its announced release date, and the labeling of it as vaporware by the press, can be caused by its development taking longer than planned. Most software products are not released on time, according to researchers in 2001 who studied the causes and effects of vaporware; &quot;I hate to say yes, but yes&quot;, a Microsoft product manager stated in 1984, adding that &quot;the problem isn&#x27;t just at Microsoft&quot;. The phenomenon is so common that Lotus&#x27; release of 1-2-3 on time in January 1983, three months after announcing it, amazed many.

Software development is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain how long it will take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up a significant portion of its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software rather than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks&#x27; Law, doing so increases the delay.

Not all delays in software are the developers&#x27; fault. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute adopted SQL as the standard database manipulation language. Software company Ashton-Tate was ready to release dBase IV, but pushed the release date back to add support for SQL. The company believed that the product would not be competitive without it. As the word became more commonly used by writers in the mid-1980s, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; magazine editor James Fawcette wrote that its negative connotations were unfair to developers because of these types of circumstances.

==== Duke Nukem ====

Vaporware also includes announced products that are never released because of financial problems, or because the industry changes during its development. When 3D Realms first announced &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; in 1997, the video game was early in its development. The company&#x27;s previous game released in 1996, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, was a critical and financial success, and customer anticipation for its sequel was high. As personal computer hardware speeds improved at a rapid pace in the late 1990s, it created an &quot;arms race&quot; between companies in the video game industry, according to &quot;Wired News&quot;. 3D Realms repeatedly moved the release date back over the next 12 years to add new, more advanced features. By the time 3D Realms went out of business in 2009 with the game still unreleased, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; had become synonymous with the word &quot;vaporware&quot; among industry writers. The game was revived and released in 2011. However, due to a 13-year period of fan anticipation and design changes in the industry, the game received a mostly negative reception from critics and fans.

A company notorious for vaporware can improve its reputation. In the 1980s, video game maker Westwood Studios was known for shipping products late. However, by 1993, it had so improved that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported &quot;many publishers would assure [us] that a project was going to be completed on time &quot;because&quot; Westwood was doing it&quot;.

===Early announcement===
Announcing products early—months or years before their release date, also called &quot;preannouncing&quot;, has been an effective way by some developers to make their products successful. It can be seen as a legitimate part of their marketing strategy, but is generally not popular with industry press. The first company to release a product in a given market often gains an advantage. It can set the standard for similar future products, attract a large number of customers, and establish its brand before competitor&#x27;s products are released. Public relations firm Coakley-Heagerty used an early announcement in 1984 to build interest among potential customers. Its client was Nolan Bushnell, formerly of Atari Inc. who wanted to promote the new Sente Technologies, but his contract with Atari prohibited doing so until a later date. The firm created an advertising campaign—including brochures and a shopping-mall appearance—around a large ambiguous box covered in brown paper to increase curiosity until Sente could be announced.

Early announcements send signals not only to customers and the media, but also to providers of support products, regulatory agencies, financial analysts, investors, and other parties. For example, an early announcement can relay information to vendors, letting them know to prepare marketing and shelf space. It can signal third-party developers to begin work on their own products, and it can be used to persuade a company&#x27;s investors that they are actively developing new, profitable ideas. When IBM announced its Professional Workstation computer in 1986, they noted the lack of third-party programs written for it at the time, signaling those developers to start preparing. Microsoft usually announces information about its operating systems early because third-party developers are dependent on that information to develop their own products.

A developer can strategically announce a product that is in the early stages of development, or before development begins, to gain competitive advantage over other developers. In addition to the &quot;vaporware&quot; label, this is also called &quot;ambush marketing&quot;, and &quot;fear, uncertainty and doubt&quot; (FUD) by the press. If the announcing developer is a large company, this may be done to influence smaller companies to stop development of similar products. The smaller company might decide their product will not be able to compete, and that it is not worth the development costs. It can also be done in response to a competitor&#x27;s already released product. The goal is to make potential customers believe a second, better product will be released soon. The customer might reconsider buying from the competitor, and wait. In 1994, as customer anticipation increased for Microsoft&#x27;s new version of Windows (codenamed &quot;Chicago&quot;), Apple announced a set of upgrades to its own System 7 operating system that were not due to be released until nearly two years later. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that Apple did this to &quot;blunt Chicago&#x27;s momentum&quot;.

A premature announcement can cause others to respond with their own. When VisiCorp announced Visi On in November 1982, it promised to ship the product by spring 1983. The news forced Quarterdeck Office Systems to announce in April 1983 that its DESQ would ship in November 1983. Microsoft responded by announcing Windows 1.0 in fall 1983, and Ovation Technologies followed by announcing Ovation in November. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; noted in May 1984 that of the four products only Visi On had shipped, albeit more than a year late and with only two supported applications.
Industry publications widely accused companies of using early announcements intentionally to gain competitive advantage over others. In his 1989 &quot;Network World&quot; article, Joe Mohen wrote the practice had become a &quot;vaporware epidemic&quot;, and blamed the press for not investigating claims by developers. &quot;If the pharmaceutical industry were this careless, I could announce a cure for cancer today – to a believing press.&quot; In 1985 Stewart Alsop began publishing his influential monthly &quot;Vaporlist&quot;, a list of companies he felt announced their products too early, hoping to dissuade them from the practice; among the entries in January 1988 were a Verbatim Corp. optical drive that was 30 months late, WordPerfect for Macintosh (12 months), IBM OS/2 1.1 (nine months), and Lotus 1-2-3 for OS/2 and Macintosh (nine and three months late, respectively). &quot;Wired&quot; Magazine began publishing a similar list in 1997. Seven major software developers—including Ashton-Tate, Hewlett-Packard, and Sybase—formed a council in 1990, and issued a report condemning the &quot;vacuous product announcement dubbed vaporware and other misrepresentations of product availability&quot; because they felt it had hurt the industry&#x27;s credibility.

==Antitrust allegations==
In the United States, announcing a product that does not exist to gain a competitive advantage is illegal via Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, but few hardware or software developers have been found guilty of it. The section requires proof that the announcement is both provably false, and has actual or likely market impact.
False or misleading announcements designed to influence stock prices are illegal under United States securities fraud laws. The complex and changing nature of the computer industry, marketing techniques, and lack of precedent for applying these laws to the industry can mean developers are not aware their actions are illegal. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement in 1984 with the goal of reminding companies that securities fraud also applies to &quot;statements that can reasonably be expected to reach investors and the trading markets&quot;.

Several companies have been accused in court of using knowingly false announcements to gain market advantage. In 1969, the United States Justice Department accused IBM of doing this in the case &quot;United States v. IBM&quot;. After IBM&#x27;s competitor, Control Data Corporation (CDC), released a computer, IBM announced the System/360 Model 91. The announcement resulted in a significant reduction in sales of CDC&#x27;s product. The Justice Department accused IBM of doing this intentionally because the System/360 Model 91 was not released until two years later. IBM avoided preannouncing products during the antitrust case, but after the case ended it resumed the practice. The company likely announced its PCjr in November 1983—four months before general availability in March 1984—to hurt sales of rival home computers during the important Christmas sales season. In 1985 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote

The practice was not called &quot;vaporware&quot; at the time, but publications have since used the word to refer specifically to it. Similar cases have been filed against Kodak, AT&amp;T, and Xerox.

US District Judge Stanley Sporkin was a vocal opponent of the practice during his review of the settlement resulting from &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; in 1994. &quot;Vaporware is a practice that is deceitful on its face and everybody in the business community knows it,&quot; said Sporkin. One of the accusations made during the trial was that Microsoft has illegally used early announcements. The review began when three anonymous companies protested the settlement, claiming the government did not thoroughly investigate Microsoft&#x27;s use of the practice. Specifically, they claimed Microsoft announced its Quick Basic 3 program to slow sales of its competitor Borland&#x27;s recently released Turbo Basic program. The review was dismissed for lack of explicit proof.

<text>Roentgenium () is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is extremely radioactive and can only be created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 130 seconds, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 10.7 minutes. Roentgenium was first created in December 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen), who discovered X-rays. Only a few roentgenium atoms have ever been synthesized, and they have no practical application.

In the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, although it may show some differences from them.

==Introduction==
==History==

===Official discovery===
Roentgenium was first synthesized by an international team led by Sigurd Hofmann at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, on December 8, 1994. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of nickel-64 and detected three nuclei of the isotope 272111:

: + → 272111 + 

This reaction had previously been conducted at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) in 1986, but no atoms of 272111 had then been observed. In 2001, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) concluded that there was insufficient evidence for the discovery at that time. The GSI team repeated their experiment in 2002 and detected three more atoms. In their 2003 report, the JWP decided that the GSI team should be acknowledged for the discovery of this element.

===Naming===
Using Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, roentgenium should be known as &quot;eka-gold&quot;. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called &quot;unununium&quot; (with the corresponding symbol of &quot;Uuu&quot;), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it &quot;element 111&quot;, with the symbol of &quot;E111&quot;, &quot;(111)&quot; or even simply &quot;111&quot;.

The name &quot;roentgenium&quot; (Rg) was suggested by the GSI team in 2004, to honor the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays. This name was accepted by IUPAC on November 1, 2004.

==Isotopes==

Roentgenium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of roentgenium have been reported with atomic masses 272, 274, 278–283, and 286 (283 and 286 unconfirmed), two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but unconfirmed metastable states. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission, though 280Rg may also have an electron capture branch.

===Stability and half-lives===
All roentgenium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 100 seconds. The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 10.7 minutes, which would make it one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known; likewise, the unconfirmed 283Rg appears to have a long half-life of about 5.1 minutes. The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range.

The missing isotopes between 274Rg and 278Rg are too light to be produced by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion. A possible synthesis method is to populate them from above, as daughters of nihonium or moscovium isotopes that can be produced by hot fusion. The isotopes 283Rg and 284Rg could be synthesised using charged-particle evaporation, using the 238U+48Ca reaction where a proton is evaporated alongside some neutrons.

==Predicted properties==
Other than nuclear properties, no properties of roentgenium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that roentgenium (and its parents) decays very quickly. Properties of roentgenium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.

===Chemical===
Roentgenium is the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium&#x27;s basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.

Roentgenium is predicted to be a noble metal. The standard electrode potential of 1.9 V for the Rg3+/Rg couple is greater than that of 1.5 V for the Au3+/Au couple. Roentgenium&#x27;s predicted first ionisation energy of 1020 kJ/mol almost matches that of the noble gas radon at 1037 kJ/mol. Its predicted second ionization energy, 2070 kJ/mol, is almost the same as that of silver. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements, roentgenium is predicted to show stable +5 and +3 oxidation states, with a less stable +1 state. The +3 state is predicted to be the most stable. Roentgenium(III) is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold(III), but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds. Gold also forms a somewhat stable −1 state due to relativistic effects, and it has been suggested roentgenium may do so as well: nevertheless, the electron affinity of roentgenium is expected to be around , significantly lower than gold&#x27;s value of , so roentgenides may not be stable or even possible.

The 6d orbitals are destabilized by relativistic effects and spin–orbit interactions near the end of the fourth transition metal series, thus making the high oxidation state roentgenium(V) more stable than its lighter homologue gold(V) (known only in gold pentafluoride, Au2F10) as the 6d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent. The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, is expected to be more stable than , which is expected to be more stable than . The stability of is homologous to that of ; the silver analogue is unknown and is expected to be only marginally stable to decomposition to and F2. Moreover, Rg2F10 is expected to be stable to decomposition, exactly analogous to the Au2F10, whereas Ag2F10 should be unstable to decomposition to Ag2F6 and F2. Gold heptafluoride, AuF7, is known as a gold(V) difluorine complex AuF5·F2, which is lower in energy than a true gold(VII) heptafluoride would be; RgF7 is instead calculated to be more stable as a true roentgenium(VII) heptafluoride, although it would be somewhat unstable, its decomposition to Rg2F10 and F2 releasing a small amount of energy at room temperature. Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain. Gold readily forms the cyanide complex , which is used in its extraction from ore through the process of gold cyanidation; roentgenium is expected to follow suit and form .

The probable chemistry of roentgenium has received more interest than that of the two previous elements, meitnerium and darmstadtium, as the valence s-subshells of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium. Calculations on the molecular compound RgH show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium–hydrogen bond, even though spin–orbit interactions also weaken it by . The compounds AuX and RgX, where X = F, Cl, Br, O, Au, or Rg, were also studied. Rg+ is predicted to be the softest metal ion, even softer than Au+, although there is disagreement on whether it would behave as an acid or a base. In aqueous solution, Rg+ would form the aqua ion [Rg(H2O)2]+, with an Rg–O bond distance of 207.1 pm. It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with ammonia, phosphine, and hydrogen sulfide.

===Physical and atomic===
Roentgenium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 22–24 g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61 g/cm3. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 114 pm.

==Experimental chemistry==
Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 282Rg, the most stable confirmed roentgenium isotope, is 100 seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the &quot;n&quot;s subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium. The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg are promising for chemical experimentation and may be produced as the granddaughters of the moscovium isotopes 288Mc and 289Mc respectively; their parents are the nihonium isotopes 284Nh and 285Nh, which have already received preliminary chemical investigations.
